2758309,R v MUUSTAFA [2011] NSWDC 238,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Adel Muustafa committed two very serious offences between 1 December and 8 December last year. 

2He is twenty-five years of age and despite a relatively innocuous criminal history with no suggestion of involvement in drugs, let alone drug supply in the past, he was the principal supplier of more than a quarter of million dollars worth of cocaine. He may not have been a Mr Big of the drug trade but he was a Mr Big enough. Ordinarily that would see him going to gaol for a very lengthy period of time. However, there is a significant matter, which I will get to in a little while, which concerns the way in which a sentence of imprisonment for Mr Muustafa affects other members of his family who were not involved in any way in this offence and who have no history of antisocial behaviour at all. Despite that matter, the objective gravity of what the offender did means that he must go to gaol for a time that I am sure he will regard as excessive, but that is necessary to reflect the objective gravity of what he did.

3On 1 December he agreed to supply cocaine. There was talk of each ounce costing $10,500 with $500 going to the middle man so that the cost to the ultimate purchaser would be $11,000. Then it was agreed that the offender would supply twenty-five ounces of cocaine for $275,000 on 8 December. Lest it be thought that this was simply the offender big-noting himself and that he was making a promise to supply drugs which he could not keep, on 8 December he was arrested in possession of 697 grams of cocaine which was the subject of the agreement that had been reached on 1 December. The drugs had a relatively high purity too, 61.5 per cent and to compound matters even more, at the time of his arrest he was in possession of a loaded revolver. 

4He pleaded guilty to supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine and possessing an unauthorised and prohibited firearm. When I sentence him for that second matter he asks that I take into account a further offence relating to the same firearm. That is an offence relating to the fact that it was loaded in a public place.

5Both of these matters carry standard non-parole periods of ten years in the case of the commercial supply and three years in the case of the possess unauthorised and prohibited firearm. As well, the maximum penalties are important to be born in mind, twenty years for commercial drug supply and fourteen years for the firearm matter. I have taken both the maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods into account. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period for either offence are to be found in these remarks on sentence.

6It is something of a puzzle as to how the offender found himself in a position to supply a substantial quantity of drugs. He is now twenty-five years of age. At the time of his arrest he was at home with his father, his stepmother and his siblings. His mother died at a very young age when Mr Muustafa was only five. For a short time the family returned to Syria, they being of Syrian descent, but came back to Australia where Mr Muustafa's father remarried. The evidence would suggest that Mr Muustafa is an intelligent young man. He has worked in the past and received positive references from his employers. References from other people as well attest to this offence being out of character. The most that really can be said in determining what led to this offence being committed is that the offender has been a fairly long term cocaine user which is related in two ways to his longstanding anxiety disorder. The two ways are that that disorder may have prompted the offender taking the drug but paradoxically would have increased the problems that he faced. He also has problems with gambling. 

7This is the second matter that I have dealt with today where addiction to gambling has been a factor in serious offending. I will not repeat what I said at length about the experience that judges of this Court have in seeing the problems that gambling causes, beyond saying that I wish those who promote gambling as a harmless and enjoyable activity spent some time reading the judgments of this Court.

8I turn now to the most important factor that Mr Korn relied on. It concerns the rather tragic circumstances of the offender's younger brother, Bilal. He has been diagnosed as having a severe intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and a blood disorder. His behaviour is highly unpredictable and disturbing. For a while he went to a special school but he was asked to leave because of his aggression which ultimately resulted in two staff members being seriously injured which required their long term rehabilitation. Bilal is largely non-verbal and can only say the words for mother, father, the Arabic for water and toilet. The only other word his uses is the name that he has given to the offender. It is this offender who seems to have most control over his younger brother. Since the offender went into custody Bilal's behaviour has deteriorated and other members of his family are physically at risk from this large, strong and occasionally violent person. Bilal is at risk of injuring himself and those that care for Bilal are at risk from him injuring them. For whatever reason it appears that the person who has the most control over Bilal's behaviour is this offender.

9The principles that guide me when I determine whether I can take into account hardship to third parties in imposing a sentence on an offender are well known. It is only in exceptional circumstances that I can take that matter into account. The Crown did not suggest that these circumstances were not exceptional, indeed they clearly are. However having a severely disabled younger brother is not a licence to commit serious crimes. The Courts have to be realistic here. Ultimately the purpose of sentencing is to protect the community and the community is just as much at risk from offenders with disabled younger brothers as it is from offenders who do not fall into that category. And, as Mr Korn predicted I would say, the offender well knew the problems that his younger brother faced and that his family faced in dealing with him in December last year when he committed these most serious offences. He knew that if he was detected committing these offences he would go to gaol for a long time. He knew that Bilal would suffer and he knew that other family members would suffer too, but he went ahead regardless.

10In those circumstances it seems a bit strange that he now asks me to reduce the sentence I would otherwise impose upon him. It is of course something he should have thought about before he committed these offences. However, despite what I have just said, I will reduce the sentence that I would otherwise have imposed upon the offender to a significant degree because of the circumstances surrounding Bilal's wellbeing and that of his family. Bilal is entirely innocent, the offender's family who have problems dealing with Bilal are entirely innocent and the offender will know that he is responsible for those problems because of his offending. For all of those reasons, as I have said, the sentence I will ultimately impose is much lower than it would otherwise have been.

11The offender pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and the sentences I will impose upon him are thus twenty-five per cent less than they would otherwise have been. 

12It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that a sentence has to reflect the objective gravity of what an offender did. Here the risks to the community through the offender's behaviour are substantial. It is fortunate that the drugs were not actually distributed to members of the public and it is fortunate indeed that the offender did not use the firearm that he had available to him at any time. Of course that firearm was taken by him in order to deal with any issues that might arise if something went wrong with the deal or perhaps only for his self-protection. Whatever the precise circumstances in which he was going to use the firearm, there is no doubt that he was prepared to use it, why else would it be loaded? 

13The combination of a drug dealer to this magnitude and in possession of a loaded firearm demonstrate enormous risk and enormous criminality. That is why, despite all the matters that I have referred to regarding the offender's younger brother Bilal, Mr Muustafa must spend a significant time in custody.

14For the offence of possessing the firearm, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years with a head sentence of three years to date from 8 December 2010. 

15For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, I set a non-parole period of three years and a head sentence of six years to date from 8 December 2011. Thus the overall sentence is one of seven years with a non-parole period of four years and the offender is eligible to be released to parole on 7 December 2014.

		07 August 2012",2011-12-01 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758310,Raymond George MORGAN v R [2011] NSWCCA 257,"Judgment  1BEAZLEY JA :  I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Hidden J.  2I agree with his Honour's reasons and proposed orders, save in respect of ground 5, in which the appellant contended that his convictions on the robbery counts were unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence.  His Honour has concluded that the convictions on those counts ought to be quashed and a verdict of acquittal ordered.  In my opinion, the appropriate order is that there be a new trial.  3It is necessary for me to briefly recount certain matters arising from the evidence in order to explain why I have reached this conclusion.  Some of the matters to which I refer are set out in more detail in Hidden J's judgment, especially at [147] ff.  4Count 3 on the indictment was a charge of robbery in company in a hotel at Willoughby.  Count 4 on the indictment was a charge of robbery in company in a hotel at Drummoyne.  Both robberies occurred in the early hours of 17 January 2008.  The evidence established that a red Audi motor vehicle was parked near each hotel at the time of each robbery.  5A red Audi had been stolen from the driveway of a Mosman home six days earlier.  Only two keys had been issued in respect of that vehicle.  One of the keys, which was kept on a table in the hallway of the Mosman house, was found to be missing at the time of the robbery.  However, there was no sign of forced entry into the house.  6As Hidden J states, at [148], the conclusion that the two robberies were perpetrated by the same offenders was open to the jury.  The evidence established that the only report of a stolen vehicle of the colour and model of the red Audi was the report of the vehicle stolen from Mosman.  Accordingly, the conclusion that in each robbery the offenders used a red Audi, which was the same model as, and probably was, that stolen from Mosman some days earlier, was open to the jury.  7A key to the Audi was found in the appellant's possession when he was arrested, some three months after the theft.  This was circumstantial evidence that the appellant was criminally involved with the vehicle, either as a thief or receiver.  It is irrelevant that on the appeal, for the reasons given by Hidden J, the appellant's conviction on  of receiving in relation to the Audi is to be quashed.  8The Audi was destroyed in a fire in the garage of a townhouse complex at Abbotsford Point the day after the appellant's arrest.  Residents of the townhouses gave evidence that the Audi had been in the garage for a couple of months prior to the fire.  It was kept covered with a grey cover.  9The appellant was arrested on the night of 23 April 2008.  When he was first stopped that night, he had the following items on his person:  an Adidas "" bum bag "", which contained an amount of $4,650 in $50 notes and a key to an Audi motor vehicle;  a set of keys to a 1994 Nissan Skyline, from his right hip pocket;  $365 in cash of different denominations from his right hip pocket;  and a pipe from his right hip pocket.  10The appellant said that the money in his "" bum bag "" was from gambling and he had papers to prove it.  A letter from Maxgaming to the appellant's partner, Sanela Kahric, stating she had won an amount of $32,871.04 had been won on 18 March 2008 in the Statewide Jackpot, was tendered in the defence case.  That document revealed that of that amount, $2,000 was paid to the appellant immediately.  Ms Kahric's bank statements revealed a deposit of $30,817.04 on 19 March 2008.  11At the time of his arrest, the appellant was staying with his cousin and family in a house at Tempe.  Two searches of the property were conducted.  12In the first search, a number of lock-picking instruments were located and evidence was given at trial that some of those instruments were capable of opening the lock on the front door of the Mosman home from which the red Audi motor vehicle had been stolen.  The following items were also seized by police:  $25,000 in a paper bag, banded up with rubber bands in $5000 lots;  a Uniden digital scanner which was capable of reaching into police radio frequencies;  a Motorola charger for the scanner;  a pair of Wilson black golfing gloves from inside the right pocket of a red Nautica jacket;  and a photo book inside a bag.  13During a second search of the property the next day, the following items were seized by police:  a tarpaulin;  $5,000 in $50 notes in the pocket of a pair of men's shorts;  a Compaq brand computer;  a set of black clippers;  a brochure, "" Redfern Children's Program "";  receipts from Foot Locker and Esprit;  a blue crowbar and a yellow handled screwdriver.  A blue crowbar was used in the robbery at the hotel at Drummoyne.  14The money and items referred to above were located in the second bedroom of the Tempe house, which was described as the spare bedroom and appeared to be the room occupied on occasions by the appellant.  The occupants of the house, Aretta Kratsas and John Perry, the appellant's cousin, said that they had not seen these items prior to being shown them by the police.  15The casual manager of the Willoughby Hotel gave evidence that the hotel bundled its fifty dollar notes in $5,000 lots and that that was standard practice in the hotel industry.  16There was evidence that the appellant had not been in full-time employment for over three years prior to his arrest and that on 10 February 2008, the appellant's partner and her mother purchased a new Holden Captiva for $50,000.  The order form for the vehicle indicated that finance was not required for the purchase.  Police were unable to determine the source of the cash used to purchase the vehicle.  In addition, four pairs of Nike shoes in US size 11 and four pairs of ASICS shoes in US size 9.5 were located in the house.  There were also three pairs of Nike shoes found at Ms Kahric's home.  17DNA testing on the black gloves was undertaken.  A profile was obtained from the left glove indicating that the appellant had the same profile as the recovered DNA profile.  There were also traces of DNA from a second individual.  A description of the persons who robbed the hotel at Drummoyne included a description that each was wearing gloves.  One witness described the gloves as "" black cotton type gloves "".  18The tarpaulin was found to fit an Audi motor vehicle of the same model (although a different year model) as the red Audi that was stolen.  The tarpaulin did not completely cover a Holden Captiva of the same model as had been purchased by Ms Kahric and her mother and which the appellant had been driving immediately prior to his arrest.  The tarpaulin was other evidence that was capable of providing a connection between the appellant and the red Audi.  19The appellant contended, in ground 5, that the jury's verdicts on counts 3 and 4, the armed robbery counts, were unreasonable and inconsistent with the evidence.  The appellant accepted that the Crown case raised a considerable suspicion that the appellant was involved in illegal activities from which he was earning an income and that there was evidence to connect him with the stolen red Audi.  He contended, however, that the only evidence that placed him as one of the robbers at the scene of the two armed robberies was the evidence of Professor Henneberg.  For reasons given by Hidden J, that evidence must be ignored for the purposes of assessing whether the robbery verdicts were unreasonable or not supported by the evidence.  20The Crown case was that the appellant was the robber holding the sledgehammer.  The appellant submitted that the description given by the eyewitnesses to the robberies did not adequately identify him as being the robber holding the sledgehammer.  21The evidence was that the appellant was a little over 180 cm tall and less than 190 cm tall (or just about 6', or a little taller).  The following estimates of the height of the robber with the sledgehammer were given by the eyewitnesses:  Peter Brooks, casual manager of the Willoughby Hotel:  about 5'5"" (about 165 cm).  Martin Schooling, manager of the hotel at Drummoyne:  about 5'9"" (about 175 cm).  Mr Schooling made his estimate on the basis that the robber was about his own height.  Abedinasser Elkordy, security officer of the hotel at Drummoyne:  165-170 cm (about 5'5"").  Yvette Fenech, who saw a robber run out of the hotel at Drummoyne, said the robber was about 36 cm higher than an electrical box.  Evidence was given that this box was 1.46 m high.  On that basis, the person Ms Fenech observed was about 176 cm, or 5'9"" tall.  Wendy Farrell, a customer at the hotel at Drummoyne, described the robber with the sledgehammer as being about 5'6"" tall (about 168 cm).  22The appellant submitted that:  ""Common experience of criminal lawyers is that people confronted with an armed, masked intruder, will if anything overestimate the height of the offender.""  23No reliance can be placed upon this observation.  The only relevant matter is that the eyewitnesses described the person with the sledgehammer, or, in the case of Ms Fenech, the person who ran out of the hotel, as being some centimetres shorter than the appellant's actual height.  24In MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 the High Court confirmed that the test to be applied when the ground of appeal is that a verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported is that stated in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493:  ""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.""  25If the appellate court is of the opinion that it was not open to the jury to be so satisfied, a verdict of acquittal must be entered unless pursuant to the proviso in s 6(1).  26Given that I have agreed that the evidence of Professor Henneberg should not have been admitted, the question whether the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported has to be considered without taking that evidence into consideration.  The question for the Court therefore is whether, upon the whole of the remaining evidence, it considers that it would be open to the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty.  27In my opinion, the evidence of Professor Henneberg was not so fundamental to establishing the guilt of the appellant that the case must fail if that evidence is excluded, as it must be.  Leaving aside that evidence, there was a strong circumstantial case against the appellant.  He was in possession of a key to the red Audi;  he was in possession of lock-picking implements that could have been used to break into the home of the owners of the red Audi to steal the key;  he was in possession of two separate bundles of money bundled up in the same way as money was bundled up at the Willoughby Hotel.  He was in possession of a third sum of money comprising $50 notes, which in large measure was the denomination of notes stolen from the hotels.  He was in possession of a blue crowbar.  A blue crowbar was used in the robbery of the hotel in Drummoyne.  28There were eyewitnesses to the robberies who gave evidence of the appellant's physique, including his build and his height.  The appellant has pointed out that the eyewitness evidence of the height of the robber who used the sledgehammer did not correspond to his height.  However, that was only one aspect of the eyewitness evidence and in my opinion, of itself, is not sufficient to establish that it would not be open to a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.  29In my opinion, it follows that ground 5 should be rejected.  However, the appellant's success on ground 1(a) means that the verdict should be quashed and there should be a new trial.  30The formal orders I propose are:  1. Appeal allowed in part;  2. Quash the conviction on count 2 on the indictment;  3. Verdict of acquittal be entered on count 2;  4. Quash the convictions on counts 3 and 4 on the indictment;  5. Order that there be a new trial on counts 3 and 4.  31HIDDEN J: The appellant, Raymond George Morgan, was tried in the District Court upon an indictment containing the following six counts:  (1) Stealing a motor vehicle at Mosman;  (2) In the alternative, receiving that vehicle;  (3) Robbery in company in a hotel at Willoughby;  (4) Robbery in company in a hotel at Drummoyne;  (5) Possessing $4,650 in cash, the proceeds of crime;  (6) Possessing $25,000 in cash, the proceeds of crime.  All the offences were alleged to have occurred early in 2008.  32He was acquitted of the first count but found guilty of the second.  He was found guilty of all the other counts.  He has appealed against his conviction of the second, third and fourth counts, that is, receiving the motor vehicle and the two robberies.  33The case against the appellant on all counts was circumstantial.  The car which was the subject of the first and second counts was a red RS4 Audi station wagon.  It was stolen from the driveway of a home in Mosman in the early hours of 11 January 2008.  The third and fourth grounds of appeal relate to the appellant's conviction of receiving that car, and I shall refer to the evidence connecting him to it when I deal with those grounds.  It is the Crown case that that car was used in the robberies, in particular, as the getaway vehicle after the second robbery.  34The two robberies were committed six days later, in the early hours of 17 January 2008.  The first of them occurred at the Willoughby Hotel in Willoughby, and the second at the PJ Gallagher Irish Pub Hotel in Drummoyne.  In each case there were two offenders.  One was alleged to be the appellant, while the identity of the other is unknown.  There was evidence of the presence of a red Audi similar to the car stolen from Mosman in the vicinity of both hotels at the time of the robberies.  The first, second and fifth grounds of appeal relate to the robbery convictions, and I shall consider the evidence concerning them in some detail when I deal with those grounds.  The Audi  35It is convenient to begin with the third and fourth grounds of appeal, relating to the RS4 Audi station wagon.  It was apparently a high performance vehicle.  There were two keys for it.  As I have said, it was stolen from the driveway of the owners' home early in the morning of 11 January 2008.  One of the keys, which was kept in a drawer of a table in the hallway of the house, was missing.  There was no sign of forced entry to the house.  36There was evidence that for a period in early 2008 the appellant was staying at a house in Tempe, where his cousin lived with his partner and child.  In the morning of 23 April 2008, the appellant was arrested near that home pursuant to a warrant issued after he failed to appear at a Local Court in relation to a traffic matter.  He was searched, and in a bum bag which he had been wearing an Audi key was found.  This was later established by the Technical Manager at Audi Australia Pty Ltd to be a key for the stolen car.  37On the day after the appellant's arrest, 24 April 2008, the house at Tempe was searched.  In a bedroom which he was said to have been occupying police located a number of lock-picking instruments.  A forensic locksmith gave evidence that some of those instruments were capable of opening the lock on the front door of the Mosman home where the car had been stolen, but it would be necessary also to use a tension wrench or a similar tool.  No item of that kind was found during the search.  38In the early hours of 24 April the Audi was destroyed by fire in the garage area of a townhouse complex at Abbotsford Point.  There was no evidence connecting the appellant with those premises, and he was in custody following his arrest at the time the car was burnt out.  The effect of evidence of residents of the townhouses was that the car had been in the garage for some time, roughly a couple of months.  It had stolen registration plates on it, but it was able to be identified by its VIN number.  Grounds 3 and 4  39The third ground is that the trial judge failed to direct the jury that, in order to find the appellant guilty of receiving the vehicle, they would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did not steal it.  The fourth ground is that the verdict of guilty on the receiving count is unreasonable.  40As I have said, the counts of stealing and receiving the vehicle were in the alternative.  However, at the trial the Crown did not rely upon s 121 of the Crimes Act 1900, and the trial judge did not direct the jury in accordance with it.  Section 121 provides:  "" Verdict of 'larceny or receiving'  Where, on the trial of a person charged with larceny, or any offence which includes larceny, and, also, with having unlawfully received the property charged to have been stolen, knowing it to have been stolen, the jury find specially that the person either stole, or unlawfully received, such property, and that they are unable to say which of those offences was committed by the person, such person shall not by reason thereof be entitled to acquittal, but shall be liable to be sentenced for the larceny, or for the unlawful receiving, whichever of the two offences is subject to the lesser punishment.""  41Relevantly, what his Honour did say in the summing-up was this:  ""Count 2 is said to be 'in the alternative'.  What that means is that if you find the accused to be not guilty of the first count, that is the car stealing count (count 1), then you will be asked to consider whether he is guilty or not guilty of the alternative charge.  So you do not go on to consider count 2 unless you are satisfied that he is not guilty on count 1.  You do not do them as a whole rolled up count, roll the two together.  Look at count 1 separately.  If, and only if, you are satisfied that he is not guilty on that, you then go on to consider count 2.""  42Earlier, before the summing-up, his Honour had explained to the jury the notion of joint criminal enterprise, in relation to both the robberies and the stealing of the car.  In the summing-up, after the passage which I have quoted, his Honour told the jury that they might be satisfied that the car was stolen but not satisfied that the theft was part of a joint criminal enterprise to which the appellant was a party.  He continued:  ""You may not be satisfied ... on the inferential basis the Crown asks you to draw, from not just the unique ignition key but from the other matters as well.  If you adopt that approach, and as I say you can have any one of a number of different ways of getting there, then and only then if you decide he is not guilty on count 1, then go to consider count 2, which is a receiving charge.""  43The appellant was represented in this court by Mr Stratton SC, who did not appear at the trial.  The thrust of ground 3, he explained, was that his Honour's directions fell short of conveying to the jury that to find the appellant guilty of receiving the Audi, they would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was not involved in stealing it (whether alone or as a party to a joint criminal enterprise to do so).  44Mr Stratton relied upon R v McCarthy and Ryan (1993) 71 A Crim R 395.  In that case the accused were charged, among other things, with larceny of a motor vehicle.  The Crown relied upon the doctrine of recent possession, but there was no alternative count of receiving.  That being so, s 121 was not available.  45The trial judge had directed the jury about the concept of recent possession, explaining that it could give rise to the inference that the accused had either stolen the vehicle or had received it, knowing it to have been stolen.  It was in the ensuing directions that his Honour was found to have fallen into error.  Delivering the leading judgment in this court, Hunt CJ at CL summarised those directions in this way (at 399):  ""... the judge suggested first that it was sufficient if they considered it 'highly unlikely' that the accused had received the vehicle as receivers, then that it was sufficient if they merely preferred the conclusion that the accused had stolen the vehicle to one that they had received it knowing it to have been stolen, and next that, if they were unable to conclude beyond reasonable doubt one way or the other, the accused were entitled to be acquitted.""  46The Chief Judge said that each of those directions was wrong.  His Honour explained (also at 399) the relevant principles as follows (omitting references to authority):  ""The offences of larceny and of receiving are mutually exclusive ... .  It follows as a matter of fundamental principle (and common sense) that, if there was any reasonable possibility that the particular accused being considered had received the vehicle knowing it to have been stolen, the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he or she was guilty of its larceny ... .""  47Mr Stratton submitted that the converse is true of the present case.  For the jury to have found the appellant guilty of receiving the Audi, they would have to have found that there was no reasonable possibility that he had stolen it.  Put another way, they would have to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was not the thief.  Mr Stratton argued that this principle would not have been conveyed to the jury by his Honour's directions.  48No complaint was made about these directions by counsel for the appellant at the trial, and rule 4 applies.  Mr Stratton pointed out that the same was true in McCarthy and Ryan , but the appeal by each of them against the conviction of larceny was allowed.  That said, in the present case his Honour did tell the jury twice in the passage from the summing-up which I have quoted that they should consider the receiving count only if they were ""satisfied"" that the appellant was not guilty of the stealing count.  The real complaint is that that direction required elaboration.  In the event, I find it unnecessary to decide this ground because I am satisfied that ground 4, that the verdict of receiving is unreasonable, is made out.  49Mr Stratton did not argue that the evidence was not capable of establishing the appellant's criminal association with the Audi, either as thief or receiver.  Rather, his submission was that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied to the requisite degree that he was a receiver, not a thief.  The circumstantial case against the appellant, said Mr Stratton, was equally consistent with his having stolen the vehicle.  50The Crown prosecutor in this court, who also did not appear at the trial, relied on the lapse of time between the theft of the car in January 2008 and the appellant being found in possession of a key for it three months later.  She noted that his Honour had given the jury a comprehensive direction about possession for the purpose of the receiving count and the counts of possessing the proceeds of crime.  That lapse of time, she argued, supported a finding that the appellant had come into possession of the car some time after it had been stolen.  51The finding of the pick-locks in the room said to be occupied by him might be consistent with his having gained entry to the Mosman home and taken the car key, but she noted that the other implement necessary to gain entry, a tension wrench or similar tool, was not found.  She also relied upon the fact that someone else must have been criminally involved with the car, because it was burnt out at a time when the appellant was in custody following his arrest the day before.  52On the other hand, it was the Crown case that the Audi was the vehicle used in connection with the robberies at the hotels, in which the appellant was involved.  That evidence would place him in possession of the vehicle, or having access to it, only a matter of days after it was stolen.  In any event, the fact that it was not until several months later that the appellant could be clearly linked to the car by his possession of the key for it is by no means decisive of this issue.  It appears to me that the whole of the evidence concerning the vehicle is as consistent with his having stolen it as it is with his having received it.  Certainly, the evidence leaves open the reasonable possibility that he stole it, either alone or in complicity with someone else.  This court is as well placed as the jury was to make that assessment, and the jury could not reasonably have found otherwise.  53Accordingly, I am satisfied that the verdict of guilty of receiving cannot be supported by the evidence.  If the jury had been instructed in accordance with s 121 of the Crimes Act , they may have brought in the special verdict for which that section provides.  At the hearing of the appeal the question was raised whether, for that reason, a new trial should be ordered.  However, the section applies to a trial in which both larceny and receiving are charged.  The appellant having been found not guilty of larceny, that option is not available.  I would quash the conviction on the second count, and enter a verdict and judgment of acquittal.  The robberies  54As I have said, the robberies at the hotels in Willoughby and Drummoyne both occurred in the early hours of 17 January 2008.  They are the subject of the first, second and fifth grounds of appeal.  The hotels are not far apart and the robberies were close in time.  No witness identified the offenders at either hotel.  It was the Crown case that the same two men, one of them the appellant, committed each offence, and that the stolen Audi was their means of transport.  Willoughby  55The robbery at the hotel at Willoughby took place at about 12.25am, after it had closed.  The robbers smashed external doors to the hotel to gain entry.  The manager, Mr Peter Brooks, was in his office and he called the police.  He opened his office door after being ordered by one of the robbers to do so.  56He saw two men, one of them holding a sledgehammer.  He described the man with the sledgehammer as ""fairly large"", ""strong"", ""fairly solid.""  He was wearing a close fitting black balaclava, a tracksuit top and tracksuit pants.  Mr Brooks described him as being not very tall, about 5'5"" (170 cms).  It was the Crown case that this man was the appellant.  57Mr Brooks described the other man as ""very skinny"" and about his own height, that is, 6'2"" (184 cms).  He was wearing tracksuit pants and a hooded top with the hood over his head.  He could not see this man's face and thought that he was also wearing a balaclava.  He did not recall that man holding anything.  58CCTV footage of parts of the incident was in evidence, together with some still shots from that footage.  The two robbers can be seen in those exhibits.  Footage obtained outside of the hotel at the time of the robbery depicted a car, and the Technical Manager of Audi Australia gave evidence that it appeared to be an Audi of the same model as the stolen vehicle.  Enquiries by the officer in charge of the investigation revealed that no other red Audi of that model had been reported stolen between 1 January and 24 April 2008.  59Cash in an amount exceeding $45,000 was taken from two safes in Mr Brooks' office.  It was bundled in certain quantities, depending on the denomination of the notes, and secured by rubber bands.  $25,000 in cash, bundled in that way and secured by rubber bands, was found at the premises at Tempe during the search on 23 April.  Mr Brooks gave evidence that money was generally bundled in this way in the hotel industry.  Drummoyne  60The robbery at the hotel at Drummoyne took place at about 12.50am on 17 January.  It is unnecessary to describe the course of the robbery, except to say that two men entered the hotel and forced the manager to remove the cash from a number of poker machines and from the tills.  A little over $13,500 was taken.  The hotel was still open at the time.  61The manager, Mr Martin Schooling, described the first man he saw as being about his own height, 5'9"", of medium build, and aged in his 30's.  He was wearing a balaclava and a hooded top with the hood over his head.  He was holding a crowbar.  He saw a second man, whom he described as also about 5'9"" tall and of a larger build than the other man, ""probably a bit chubby.""  He had broad shoulders and a thicker torso.  He was wearing a balaclava, a tracksuit top and pants, and black gloves.  He was holding a sledgehammer.  It was the Crown case that this second man was the appellant.  62The robbery was also witnessed by a security guard, Mr Abedinasser Elkordy, and two patrons, Ms Wendy Farrell and Mr Duncan Macpherson.  Mr Macpherson did not give evidence, but his statement to police was admitted.  All three of them described the two robbers, one of them holding a crowbar and the other a sledgehammer.  63Mr Elkordy described the man with the crowbar as about 160 - 165 cms tall, with a ""mid-way"" build.  His head was covered and he was wearing gloves.  He said that he could see this man's eyes, and thought that he looked Middle-Eastern or Italian.  He described the other man, holding a ""big hammer"", as being taller and of a larger build.  In evidence he said that he was more than 175 cms tall, although he had told investigating police that he was between 165 and 170 cms.  64Ms Farrell described the man with the crowbar as skinny, about 5'6"" to 5'8"" tall, wearing a black balaclava, a black ""hoodie"" and black gloves.  She described the man with the sledgehammer as shorter and of a stocky build.  In evidence-in-chief she said he was 5'6"" to 5'8"" tall, but in cross-examination she said that he looked about the same height as herself, 5'5"".  He was also wearing a black balaclava and black gloves.  65Mr Macpherson described the man with the crowbar as tall and fit looking, wearing a black ski mask on his face, a black hoodie and gloves.  He described the man with the sledgehammer as shorter, also fit looking, wearing a black balaclava and black gloves.  66The hotel stands on the corner of Victoria Road and Lyons Road.  At around the relevant time, Mr Alex Carlson left the hotel and waited for a bus at a bus stop on Victoria Road.  He saw a red Audi station wagon, a high performance vehicle of a kind with which he was familiar, approach the intersection from Victoria Road and turn into Lyons Road.  It apparently drove around a block, as he saw it again proceeding up Victoria Road and turning into Lyons Road.  67Some time later, he saw two men who, it might be inferred, were the robbers enter the hotel from Lyons Road.  Shortly thereafter, the men emerged.  The red Audi, which was stopped in a nearby laneway, reversed out and pulled up near the hotel in Lyons Road.  The two men got into the vehicle and it was driven off quickly.  68Also at the relevant time, Ms Yvette Fenech was a passenger in a car being driven along Lyons Road towards Victoria Road.  She saw a new model red Audi parked near the hotel.  She saw a man running fast from the direction of the hotel towards the Audi.  He got into it and it was driven off quickly in the opposite direction (towards Five Dock).  69She said that the man ran past an electrical box, and she estimated him to have been 30 cms taller than that box.  The officer in charge of the investigation gave evidence that the electrical box was 1.46 metres high.  On Ms Fenech's estimate, then, the height of the man was about 176 cms (roughly 5'9"").  When describing the man to the police she had said that he was of slim build.  70Again, there was in evidence CCTV footage inside the hotel, together with still shots from that footage, in which the two robbers can be seen.  There was also CCTV footage outside the hotel showing the movement of a red vehicle consistent with the observations of Mr Carlson and Ms Fenech.  This evidence conveys that there was a third person involved in the robbery as the driver of the car.  Expert evidence  71An important part of the Crown case on the robberies was the evidence of Dr Maciej Henneberg, a biological anthropologist and anatomist.  He had been appointed to the Wood Jones chair of anthropological and comparative anatomy at the University of Adelaide, and held a doctorate in biological anthropology from a university in Poland.  He professed expertise in the anatomical comparison of images, known loosely as ""body mapping.""  It is his evidence which is the subject of the first and second grounds of appeal.  72In August 2008, Professor Henneberg was asked by investigating police to conduct an anatomical comparison of CCTV images from both hotels of the person alleged to be the appellant, on the one hand, and images of the appellant obtained during a forensic procedure upon his arrest, on the other.  He had access to the CCTV footage and stills from it, and photos and moving images of the appellant.  He set out his comparison and conclusions in an expert certificate under s 177 of the Evidence Act , and this material was fleshed out at some length in oral evidence.  73In the presence of two detectives, he examined the CCTV images and noted the anatomical characteristics of the person said to be the appellant.  He referred to that person in the certificate as the ""offender"" or the ""person of interest.""  Only after he had done that did he examine the images of the appellant obtained by the police.  He proceeded in that way to ensure that his observation of the characteristics of the offender was not influenced by his knowledge of the appearance of the appellant: as he put it, to guard against ""displacement.""  He also examined images of two other persons as a ""comparative background"" to his observations, so as to increase the ""validity of the analysis aimed as establishing anatomical similarity of a particular offender to a particular suspect.""  74He set out his observations of the offender in the CCTV images in the certificate.  In doing so, he used some technical terms which are sufficiently explained in that description.  His observations were as follows:  ""Person of interest is an adult male of heavy body build.  His shoulders and hips are wide.  He has a prominent abdomen but his upper and lower limbs, especially in their distal segments, are not thick.  This suggests centripetal pattern of body fat distribution.  This pattern consists of the deposition of most body fat on the trunk while limbs remain relatively thin.  His head and face were covered by a garment well adhering to the surface of the skin.  This enabled me to make observations of the head shape, nose and face profile.  His head is dolichocephalic (elongated) in the horizontal plane (viewed from above).  His nose is wide and rather prominent while his face has straight profile (orthognathic).  He is right-handed in his actions and carries himself straight.""  75He set out his observations of the appellant in the images obtained by the police as follows:  ""Mr MORGAN is an adult male of darkish colour skin.  He is heavily build (sic), but the bulk of his body fat is concentrated on the trunk while his distal limbs are not fat (see especially lower legs).  His shoulders and hips are wide.  He has straight posture.  His face is orthognatous (straight profile, without protruding jaws).  His nose is wide and rather prominent.  Since during the forensic procedure no photographs showing his head from above were taken the assessment of his head shape is uncertain.  Judging from head width shown on posterior (taken from behind) photographs and head length on profile photographs, his head seems to be dolichocephalic (elongated oval rather than a shape approximating a circle).""  Images of the top of the appellant's skull later supplied to him confirmed his opinion about the shape of the head.  76In the certificate he expressed his conclusion in this way:  ""Based wholly or substantially on the above knowledge, I am of the opinion that there is a high level of anatomical similarity between the Offender and the Suspect (Mr MORGAN).  My opinion is strengthened by the fact that I could not observe on the Suspect any anatomical detail different from those I could discern from the CCTV images of the Offender.""  77Attached to the certificate was an explanation of his methodology.  This included the following:  ""I use a method of anatomical examination.  It consists of inspection of images in order to form an opinion on the individual characteristics of the body and the face of a specific person.  Since individuals differ in a number of details, and since each set of photographs or digital images allows observation of a different number and quality of details, statistical analysis is not a practical approach.  Statistical analyses provide reliable results in cases where anthropometric measurements can be taken precisely, or where standard photographs in prescribed body positions are taken at same (sic) angles.  Surveillance materials and standard Police photographs are not of the quality allowing such analyses.  It can be stated that the anatomical analysis of images is similar to recognition of persons on such images by lay observers, such as, for example, eye witnesses.  The only difference is that observations are conducted by an experienced anatomist who has good understanding of shapes and proportions of various details of a human body.""  78He stated that, in his ""anatomical identification"", he makes comparisons of individuals.  He does not draw conclusions about a person's national, ethnic or geographic origin, saying, for reasons he identified, that for the purpose of individual identification statistical data on any particular racial group would be futile.  He continued:  ""When making a statement regarding the degree of certainty or uncertainty of my specific individual identifications I take into account observable biological characteristics of particular individuals in their unique combination.  For example, my statement that the identification is 95% certain is an estimate based on the fact that, due to the quality of images, I could not observe enough anatomical detail to reach certainty.""  To this last observation I shall return.  79Professor Henneberg's evidence was objected to and a voir dire examination was conducted, in which he gave oral evidence.  While his certificate asserted ""a high level of anatomical similarity"" between the offender in the CCTV footage and the appellant, he said that he did not purport to identify the appellant as the offender.  When he assessed the anatomical characteristics of the offender and his build, he had regard to other persons in the CCTV footage and inanimate objects, such as doorways or seats.  80While he recorded in the methodology set out in his certificate that he did not draw conclusions about a person's ethnicity, he did explain in evidence that ethnic groups might display certain bodily characteristics as a result of their geographical location and lifestyle.  He said that most Australian Aboriginals had long thin limbs and that, when they put on weight due to a Western diet, it tended to be concentrated in the trunk, the process he described as centripetal fat distribution.  He observed these features in the offender in the CCTV footage and, later, in the images of the appellant.  It is apparent from the photos of the appellant in evidence that he is Aboriginal.  81He was asked in cross-examination about facial mapping.  He considered that a loose expression, which he preferred not to use.  What was involved, he said, was anatomical comparison and he added that, when that task is undertaken, there is no ""qualitative difference between the face and the rest of the body.""  He denied that there are more identifiable features on a face than on a body.  82In his certificate he said that he subjected his ""identification work"" to peer review by persons ""holding higher degrees in anatomical sciences.""  He also said that his evidence ""was accepted"" by courts in various Australian jurisdictions, citing particular cases in which he had been involved.  In oral evidence, he said that he had undertaken more than fifty anatomical comparisons and provided expert certificates, usually to the police.  In cross-examination, he gave this evidence:  ""Q. You don't know how many of those recognition or identification or similarity assessments you made are true and correct, do you?  A. No I don't, I never take interest in the result.  I provide my opinion and that's where it is.   Q. There has been nothing to validate any of your opinions, has there, independently?  A. I can't make that judgment.  Q. Professor has there ever been any measurement or assessment of your ultimate opinions on any occasion?  A. Well yes there were.  Several of my opinions were peer reviewed by other individuals and although it's very inadequate or incomplete or maybe perhaps questioned, but a number of opinions expressed in certificates I provided were met with either admission or guilty plea of individuals whose comparisons I was conducting.  Q. Have you ever been subject to a review where you have been provided with an array of CCTV images where the answer was known by your peers and asked to provide objectively your opinion as to whether that person was the person depicted as the suspect?  A. No I wasn't, although I would welcome this.  Q. You have never been tested in that way, have you?  A. Yet again I don't recall, but probably I was.""  83On the voir dire, the appellant led evidence from two other experts, Dr Richard Kemp, a forensic psychologist, and Mr Glenn Porter, a forensic scientist.  Each of them had been asked to provide a critique of Professor Henneberg's expert certificate.  Dr Kemp provided a report, and Mr Porter an expert certificate.  Both of them gave oral evidence.  84Dr Kemp was a senior lecturer in forensic psychology at the University of Western Sydney.  He had undertaken and published experimental research in both the theoretical and applied aspects of human face perception and person recognition.  This included studying the factors affecting the accuracy of identification evidence.  He acknowledged in evidence that he did not have a background in anatomy or anthropology.  85He noted that Professor Henneberg relied exclusively on a morphological approach to anatomical examination, and that he did not attempt to take measurements from the photographic images or to draw on any published data regarding the frequency of occurrence of particular anatomical features to estimate the probability that two sets of images showed the same person.  His comparisons were made only with the naked eye.  86Dr Kemp had access to the CCTV and photographic material which Professor Henneberg had examined.  He described the CCTV images as of relatively poor quality.  He noted that the body of the relevant offender in those images was completely covered by clothing, so that no part of the face or body was directly visible.  He questioned the professor's ability to make observations about the person's head shape, nose and face profile because the garment covering his head and face was ""well adhering to the surface of the skin.""  He wrote in his report:  ""Professor Henneberg doesn't cite or present any evidence to demonstrate his ability to accurately discern face and head shape though (sic) a covering of clothing, or to do this by looking at relatively low quality video recordings.  Professor Henneberg has no way to know the characteristics of the items of clothing, how the clothing adheres to the face and head, and whether the Offender is wearing anything else underneath the visible covering.  Given this I believe that there is no scientific basis for the claim made by Professor Henneberg that he can discern aspects of the anatomy obscured by unknown items of clothing.""  87To this Professor Henneberg responded in evidence that he had worked with the garment industry some years before, and had learned that in the ""construction of clothing, so-called hang of garments is extremely important and it is related directly to body shape and posture.""  He added that ""the force of gravity spreads the cloth on the body in a way that is inescapable because the force of gravity always acts and therefore certain aspects of body shape can be deduced from the study of images of cloth to body.""  88Dr Kemp noted that Professor Henneberg did not attempt to make any statistical claim about the frequency of occurrence of the characteristics he observed in the offender in the CCTV footage and the appellant, so as to calculate the probability that two images of different individuals might show those characteristics.  Yet, he said, such a probability assessment was implicit in the professor's conclusion that there was ""a high level of anatomical similarity"" between the offender and the appellant.  Dr Kemp saw the effect of such a statement in this context as a suggestion ""that these similarities are noteworthy and unusual.""  His own view was that they were ""not uncommon in the adult population of Australia.""  He added that there was ""no adequate statistical evidence available regarding just how common the possession of such a set of characteristics is, and as a result we have no way of knowing what conclusions we can draw from this observation.""  89In an appendix to his report Dr Kemp summarised the findings of some research he conducted into the practice of producing facial mapping and body mapping evidence.  Put shortly, his finding was that there was no scientific evaluation of its validity, reliability and error rate.  He explained those terms in this way:  ""In scientific terms the validity of a technique is a measure of the extent to which a technique does what it is claimed to do.  The reliability of a technique is the extent to which the technique would produce the same results when repeatedly applied by different operators or on different occasions.  To be scientifically useful a technique must be demonstrated to be high in both validity and reliability.  The validity and the reliability of a technique will partly determine its accuracy and the rate at which the technique will give rise to errors (the error rate).  All measurement techniques have an associated error rate or level of accuracy.  It is critical to the proper scientific use of any measurement technique that its reliability, validity and error rate are all known.  If the error rate associated with a measurement technique is unknown then it is not possible to draw appropriate conclusions based on the measurements taken.""  90He found that there did not appear to be a standardised procedure whereby the task of face or body mapping was undertaken.  He also noted that the ability to compare images is affected by the quality and resolution of them, a matter explored in some detail in the evidence of Mr Porter, to which I shall turn shortly.  In oral evidence he said that it had not been established ""whether Professor Henneberg or anyone else can accurately discern the details he describes.""  He questioned the reliability of an attempt to discern characteristics from images of the quality of those in the present case.  He added:  ""To make it clear I don't question for one moment Professor Henneberg's expertise as an anatomist, the question for me is that whether he or anyone else can make the judgments he's making on the basis of these images.  It concerns me that there has been no attempt by anyone to test the validity and reliability of those kinds of observations.""  91Mr Porter explained in his expert certificate that part of his work as a forensic scientist is concerned with ""identification principles and methodologies,"" including facial identification from CCTV footage.  He said in evidence that he had had wide experience in forensic photography over a period of years when he had been a member of the Australian Federal Police.  He also acknowledged that he had no background in anatomy, biology or anthropology.  He had the photographic material supplied to Professor Henneberg, and in his certificate he commented in some detail upon the CCTV footage.  92Like Dr Kemp, he found the footage not to be of good quality.  He explained the problems with the photographic depiction of a person through distortion caused by the lens of a camera and the position of the camera in relation to that person.  That latter problem arose in the present case because of the positioning of the CCTV cameras above the persons depicted and tilted down towards the ground.  In his certificate he summarised his assessment of the CCTV footage in this way:  ""In summary, the photographic condition was generally found to be of low resolution and quality with problems with curvilinear distortion most likely caused by the lens design and rectilinear distortion caused by the camera focal plane not being parallel to the subject.  These image artefacts would greatly affect the reproduction of shape including human forms.  The photographic conditions are critically important when using the question (sic) images for photo-interpretation and identification purposes.""  93In oral evidence he described the distortion, both curvilinear and rectilinear, as significant.  In particular, the said that the effect of the distortion was a magnification of the upper body of the relevant offender compared to the lower body, which he described as a ""keystoning effect.""  94In his certificate, he challenged Professor Henneberg's determination that the offender in the CCTV footage was an adult male.  He described that as a ""wildly speculative assumption with no forensic science, imaging science or photo-interpretation basis.""  He added that there was nothing in the professor's expert certificate to suggest that he had given consideration ""to the image distortion and other image artefacts presented in the CCTV footage.""  At the end of the certificate he expressed the following conclusion:  ""Prof Henneberg's propositions regarding his description of the POI limbs (thin), nose, face profile and head shape are dangerous assumptions that can not be supported by sound and knowledgeable photo-interpretation.  Firstly, these features are not visible in the images, they are all covered by clothing (and of unknown clothing layers).  Secondly, due to the level of significant image distortion (curvilinear and rectilinear) the human form represented in the CCTV images are (sic) significantly distorted and do not represent a true scale of shape and size.  The level of image distortion renders any photo-interpretation of size and shape as unreliable.""  95In response, Professor Henneberg said in evidence that he concluded that the offender was an adult male because, firstly, he did not look like a child and, secondly, the shape of the person ""as revealed by the hang of clothing"" did not have a bust or prominent waist or buttocks, whereas it had fairly large and wide shoulders and chest.  He also noted that the person had a very small head in relation to the rest of the body, whereas in females the head is usually in a larger proportion in relation to the body.  As to the quality of the CCTV footage, he said that it was neither better nor worse than a lot of CCTV images that he had analysed.  He also said that he took into account distortion of those images in his analysis, adding that he always was conscious of photographic distortion and could observe and assess the amount of it.  96The trial judge admitted the evidence of Professor Henneberg.  The first ground of appeal challenges that decision, and the second ground asserts that his Honour did not give any, or any adequate, reasons for it.  It is convenient to deal with that second ground first.  Ground 2  97His Honour's reasons for admitting the evidence are not to be found in the daily transcript or, as often happens, transcribed or published as a separate judgment.  Pre-trial issues, including the voir dire concerning the expert evidence, were dealt with over a period of several days before the jury was empanelled.  Issues other than the admissibility of Professor Henneberg's evidence were also canvassed.  98At one stage during discussion with counsel, his Honour said that he would provide a ""draft outline"" of his reasons, apparently so that counsel might make submissions about them.  In the event, on a subsequent day what was described as an amended version of those reasons was admitted as a voir dire exhibit.  Why this procedure was adopted is unclear.  However that may be, what was admitted was a twenty-four page document, entitled ""Draft of matters to be taken into account on pre-trial rulings"", in which his Honour expressed his reasons for decisions in relation to a number of matters that had been agitated.  99Among them were reasons for the admission of Professor Henneberg's evidence, under the heading ""Identification: body mapping/identification.""  Over several pages the objections to the evidence were set out, and reference was made to the voir dire evidence of Dr Kemp and Mr Porter.  His Honour referred to s 79 of the Evidence Act and relevant authority, to which I shall also refer later.  He concluded that Professor Henneberg had requisite specialised knowledge and had made his methodology clear.  He noted the critiques of that methodology by Dr Kemp and Mr Porter, but concluded that these were matters for the jury with the assistance of appropriate directions.  100At the end of the document his Honour set out a series of rulings, one of them headed ""Identification: body and face types.""  The ruling was that the ""Crown and Defence may lead evidence of similarity as to body and face types and the factual material on which that similarity evidence and the consequential opinions are based.""  101Unusual as this procedure was, and notwithstanding the use of the word ""draft"" in its title, it appears to me that this document was intended to be the formal record of his Honour's reasons for his pre-trial rulings, including the admission of the evidence of Professor Henneberg.  This ground is not made out.  Ground 1  102The first ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in admitting the evidence of Professor Henneberg to the effect that:  (a) the appellant was similar in appearance to one of the robbers;  (b) that the appellant was identical in appearance to one of the robbers.  It will be seen that I would allow the fifth ground of appeal, that the verdicts of guilty on the two robbery counts are unreasonable.  However, the first ground raises an issue of importance and most of the parties' submissions, written and oral, were devoted to it.  It should be decided.  103For the purpose of this ground Mr Stratton referred to the evidence in the trial as well as that on the voir dire.  Professor Henneberg gave evidence, and his expert certificate became an exhibit.  Mr Porter gave evidence in the defence case.  An amended certificate of Mr Porter, a somewhat expanded version of the original, also became an exhibit.  Their evidence, while explored in greater detail, was broadly to the same effect as that which they had given on the voir dire.  Dr Kemp also gave evidence in the defence case, but his report was not tendered and the focus of his evidence was different from that which he had given on the voir dire.  I shall return to his evidence.  104However, a further expert was called in the defence case, Dr Meiya Sutisno, a forensic anatomist.  Her expert certificate was admitted, and she gave oral evidence.  Her evidence was also a critique of the evidence of Professor Henneberg.  For the most part, it amounted to an endorsement, from the viewpoint of a forensic anatomist, of Dr Kemp's criticisms in his voir dire evidence.  It also supported the views of Mr Porter.  105In her expert certificate Dr Sutisno had reviewed Professor Henneberg's findings in his certificate.  Put shortly, her opinions were these:  The professor's certificate ""was found lacking information of the precise methodology or scientific protocol (either quantitative or qualitative)"" for the observations of the offender which he used to arrive at the anatomical description of that person which he set out in the certificate.  There was no explanation for ""data interpretation"", nor ""whether or not he took into account the technological problems presented by the CCTV cameras and what measures he took to overcome these problems for accurate image analysis.""  The ""accuracy and reliability"" of his opinion that the offender in the hotels was the appellant was ""certainly doubtful, as his opinion was deduced from merely visual observations, unsubstantiated by proper scientific quantitative or qualitative procedures.""  The small number of ""general"" features of the face and body of the offender, not constituting ""unique identifying features,"" did not warrant the ""high level of match"" which he found between the offender and the appellant.  He ""failed to correctly process the images"" of the offender and the appellant ""for accurate comparative analysis.""  He did not assess the ""resolution, camera angles, focal length, camera-to-subject distance and lighting conditions presented by the CCTV footage and the comparative images.""  The distortions produced by the CCTV cameras could ""alter the true morphological characteristics of the body and facial features in both shape and size.""  Comparisons between the offender and the appellant should have been made only ""from images of the same geometric plane or viewpoints.""  The forensic images of the appellant ""were not sufficient for comparisons with the CCTV images"" of the offender.  It would not have been possible for him ""to assess features (ie head shape, face profile and nose)"" of the offender ""which were not visible due to the balaclava worn over the head and face.""  Like Mr Porter, she challenged the professor's assessment of the offender as an adult male, suggesting that this was the result of ""cognitive preconception whereby he subconsciously formed an impression of the fact to fit the case ... .""  Because of the small number of features of the offender described, none of which was of ""high identification value"", it was inappropriate to ""warrant a high level of identification match"" between the offender and the appellant.  The best that could be said is that the images were ""inconclusive"" on that question.  106Dr Sutisno was cross-examined about evidence she gave in a trial which came to be considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Tang [2006] NSWCCA 167, 65 NSWLR 681, a case to which I shall refer later.  She acknowledged that she had not published any material for the purpose of peer review in relation to facial or body mapping.  107I have referred to Professor Henneberg's evidence on the voir dire about his contact with the garment industry.  In the trial he said that he had run ""two big anthropometric surveys for the garment industry, for clothing sizing.""  He also gave evidence, as he had on the voir dire, that he took into account distortion in CCTV images.  He acknowledged that he had no formal qualifications in forensic photography, but said that he had experience in taking photographs in his professional work.  He was familiar with curvilinear and rectilinear distortion.  He said that they were easy to detect by examining whether there was distortion in the images of familiar objects, such as a door or a bookcase.  He also had regard to whether there was similar distortion of the appearance of other people in the footage.  108In the course of Professor Henneberg's evidence-in-chief, his Honour received a note from the jury.  It posed the question, ""What proportion of the population would fit into the profile 'person of interest' taking into account an appropriate margin of error?""  The Crown prosecutor put the jury's question to Professor Henneberg, and he answered:  ""Well the way to one can calculate this, although I have not, is to use combination of probabilities of the frequency with which each separate characteristic occurs, because all those characteristics are now occurring in the same person, and we do not have reliable statistics for Australian population describing the occurrence of those characteristics.""  109He was invited to refer to the paragraph of his expert certificate, quoted at [74] above, in which he set out his description of the offender in the CCTV footage.  This led to the following evidence:  ""A. Yes well I am referring to it but I will give the jury a very simple example.  Lets assume for the purpose of this discussion that each of the characteristics described occurs in 50%, so one half, of Australian male population, it's an assumption that is making, that is unfavourable to me, in other words it will make the --  Q. It's a generous ratio.  A. Yes, it's a generous ratio, yes.  Q. Is that a fair way to quickly summarise it?  A. Yes.  So lets say heavy body build, we do combination of probability, 0.5 times 0.5 time 0.5, heavy body build 0.5.  Shoulders and hips the same width so its one quarter.  Prominent abdomen, one eighth.  Distal segments of the limbs not thick, one sixteenth.  Centripetal pattern is just a conclusion of the other traits described...  ...  ... I do not count centripetal pattern as an additional character because it is included in description of heavy body build and said distal limbs, and head shape is one 32.  Face profile one sixty-fourth.""  Thus, albeit hypothetically, the incidence of the combination of features of the offender which he observed was whittled down to one sixty-fourth (1.6%) of the male population.  110Later in the trial, during the defence case, the jury's question was addressed again.  In answer to it, Dr Kemp produced a document which, he said, Professor Henneberg had read and with which he had agreed.  It became an exhibit.  It was in the following terms:  ...  To answer this question we need to address two issues:  1. What is the frequency in the Australian population of the attributes noted by Professor Henneberg, and in what proportion of the population do these characteristics occur together in one individual?  2. What is the error rate associated with Professor Henneberg's technique?  To take these issues in turn:  What is the frequency in the Australian population of the attributes noted by Professor Henneberg, and in what proportion of the population do these characteristics occur together in one individual?  We do not know the frequency with which these characteristics occur within the Australian population.  Furthermore, we do not know whether the characteristic (sic) noted are independent of each other.  The issue of independence is critical.  If two features are statistically independent of each other, then the observation that an individual possesses one feature tells us nothing about the likelihood that this individual will also poses (sic) the second feature.  In contrast, if two features are not independent of each other then they are said to be correlated and the observation that an individual possesses one feature will affect the probability that they also possess the second.  For example, we know that in the Australia population earnings and gender are correlated, so the probability that a man earns more than $100,000 is much higher than the probability that a woman earns this much.  In order to estimate what proportion of the population would share a particular set of features we need to know both the frequency with which each feature occurs in the population and the degree of correlation between all possible pairs of features.  We do not know either of these things and therefore it is not possible to make a valid estimate of the proportion of the population who will share a particular set of features.  In the absence of this information it would be very dangerous to attempt such an estimate, because even quite low correlations between features could have a large effect on our estimate.  1. What is the error rate associated with Professor Henneberg's technique?  The error rate associated with a particular technique tells us how often the use of that technique will result in an error.  In order to interpret the results of a technique we need to know the error rate associated with the use of that technique.  For example, when using a particular test to detect cancer, we need to know how often the test results in an error and what proportion of these errors will be false positive errors (suggesting the patient has cancer when in fact they are healthy) and what proportion will be false negative errors (suggesting the patient doesn't have cancer when if fact they do).  Without all this information we cannot interpret the results of the test.  Information about the error rate of a procedure is obtained by evaluating the procedure under controlled conditions, for example testing patients who we know to have cancer and those we know to be healthy.  No such evaluation of the procedures used by Professor Henneberg has ever been undertaken, so we do not know how often the application of this technique would result in an error.  Given all this, the answer to the Jury's question must be that we are unable to say exactly what proportion of the population would fit the description provided by Professor Henneberg, and do not know the margin of error which should be applied. ""  111However, to this was added another document which was admitted into evidence, and which expressed Professor Henneberg's view only.  It read:  ""M Heneberg's answer to the Jury question.  Anatomical characteristics occur with various probabilities in various populations.  For example, strong body build in about 50% of Australian males.  Dolichocephalic Head in 6% of Central Europeans (Henneberg 1976), but about 80% of Aboriginal Australians (Laron and Macintosh 1966).  About 90% of people are right-handed.  Were the anatomical traits completely independent of each other, the probability that specific traits occur in combination in the same person would be simply a product (multiplication) of individual probabilities.  Correlations among traits can significantly affect calculation of combined probability.  Since we do not have an extensive database for Australian population of all traits described in this case a precise enough calculation is impossible, while an estimate may turn out to be misleading.  The only thing one can tell, that due to combination of various characters (sic) a probability of finding two individuals with several anatomical characters similar in the same way is low.  I used the example of a person walking through a shopping mall trying to find two individuals of the same general anatomical characteristics like body build, head shape and face profile.""  112When Dr Kemp gave evidence he was asked to comment upon the apparent contradiction between the agreed document and Professor Henneberg's document.  He said that he saw a difference between the two, and added that the core of the agreed document was that it was not possible to estimate the frequency of certain physical features within the population ""because we don't have the data available to estimate how frequently those characteristics occur within the population.""  He added:  ""I make an additional point, which I think is a very important one.  It seems like a subtle statistical point, but actually it's critical - which is that even if we do think we know how frequently those features occur in the population, we would also need to know whether or not they're statistically independent of each other; ... essentially the critical question is if we note two characteristics, for example, of a person, if those two are so highly correlated that one always goes with the other, then noting two tells us no more than noting one. ... If they're completely independent of each other, then noting these two characteristics and estimating how frequently they occur in the population is useful, it adds something.  Now, it's probably the case that most features have some correlation between them, that they're not independent, but we simply don't know, and that's the second critical point.  So we don't know how frequently these features occur in the population, and furthermore, we also don't know whether they're independent of each other.""  113In the light of this evidence, Mr Stratton examined the passage in the evidence of Professor Henneberg quoted above in which he made a hypothetical calculation of the proportion of the Australian population which might have the combination of characteristics he observed in the offender, upon the assumption that each of those characteristics occurred in half the male population.  By adopting what is known in mathematics as the product rule, he arrived at a proportion of 1.6%.  However, as Mr Stratton pointed out, that assumes that those characteristics were independent of each other.  If there were a correlation between some of them, as one might expect, the incidence of that combination of characteristics in the general population would be significantly higher.  114Mr Stratton submitted that Professor Henneberg's answer to the jury's question, while acknowledging the significance of the difference between independent and related characteristics, was ambivalent and did not amount to a retraction of the hypothetical calculation he had made in oral evidence.  Notable was his assertion in the document that the ""only thing one can tell"" was that ""due to combination of various characters a probability of finding two individuals with several anatomical characters similar in the same way is low.""  115Dr Kemp otherwise gave evidence in general terms about the lack of scientific research examining the validity, reliability and error rate of body mapping and of facial mapping, the latter being the particular expertise of Dr Sutisno.  He also described some recent research using mock juries who were asked to determine if a suspect was a person depicted in video material.  In that exercise they were presented with mock expert reports.  The results conveyed that the mock jurors were heavily influenced by the expert opinions.  As Dr Kemp put it in evidence, ""their final decision is predicted not by the truth of the situation but by the expert evidence they hear.""  116It was put to Professor Henneberg in cross-examination that there had been ""no testing of the validation"" of his opinions.  To this he replied:  ""One of the tests includes examination in court.  Well, there was occasionally.  I had my colleagues or associates to assess the same CCTV and the same forensic procedure photographs independently.  For example, Dr Carl Stephan did this on very few occasions but he did and it would be certainly good to have more of this happening.""  117He was then taken to an occasion on which he was asked to compare images of the former politician, Ms Pauline Hanson with an image of a person said to be her published in a newspaper.  He did so by examining the facial characteristics and expressed the opinion that he was ""99.2%"" sure that the person depicted in the newspaper was Ms Hanson.  Putting it another way, he calculated that there was a 0.8% probability that two random people would have such an array of closely matching characteristics.  Later in the trial, the Crown prosecutor produced material establishing that the newspaper had subsequently acknowledged that the person depicted was not Ms Hanson and published an apology to her.  118It is convenient at this point to deal with Ground 1(b) which challenges the admission of Professor Henneberg's evidence to the effect that the appellant was identical in appearance to the offender in the CCTV footage.  As I have said, in evidence on the voir dire the professor denied that he purported to identify the appellant as the offender.  He asserted no more than a high level of anatomical similarity.  His evidence before the jury was to the same effect.  119Mr Stratton acknowledged this, but questioned whether the jury might have been left with the impression that the professor's evidence was, to all intents and purposes, an identification.  He referred to the evidence already discussed in which, albeit hypothetically, the professor asserted that the combination of the characteristics of the offender would narrow him down to 1.6% of the adult male population.  He also referred to that part of the professor's expert certificate which set out his methodology and, in particular, the passage quoted at [78] above dealing with his assessment of the degree of certainty or uncertainty of his ""specific individual identification.""  That passage included the assertion, ""... my statement that the identification is 95% certain is an estimate based on the fact that, due to the quality of images, I could not observe enough anatomical detail to reach certainty.""  120Whatever one might make of that assertion, it is clear enough that it was a part of his description in general terms of his methodology.  It was not directed to the case at hand.  The professor said as much in cross-examination, describing it as a ""general statement about methodology.""  In evidence-in-chief, he explained that  he used images ""to form anatomical descriptions of persons of interest, and of the suspect or suspects, in various cases.  He added, ""I never ... identify a person, I never state with 100% certainty that a person of interest and a suspect are the same person.""  121I must say that I perceive some tension between that evidence and the manner in which the methodology is expressed in the certificate.  Nevertheless, the case was conducted on the basis that the professor's evidence was an assertion of similarities, not of identification.  His Honour instructed the jury accordingly by directions about which no complaint is made.  Ground 1(b) is not made out.  122Let me turn, then, to ground 1(a), challenging the admission of Professor Henneberg's evidence to the effect that the appellant was similar in appearance to the offender.  Mr Stratton's submission was that this evidence did not meet the test of the admissibility of opinion evidence set out in s 79 of the Evidence Act 1995.  By that section opinion evidence is admissible if the person giving it ""has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience,"" and the opinion is ""wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.""  123Mr Stratton referred to Tang (supra), in which the evidence of Dr Sutisno was at issue.  She had given evidence of points of similarity between CCTV images of an offender and photographs of Tang, applying facial mapping and body mapping techniques.  She expressed three related opinions: first, that the CCTV images and the photographs of Tang depicted the same person; second, that there was a level of support for this conclusion by the application of a six point scale derived from literature on the subject; and, third, that certain characteristics in the photographic material were ""unique identifiers.""  124Spigelman CJ, with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed, set out Dr Sutisno's methodology at [16] ff.  She was dealing with CCTV footage in which the face of the relevant offender was exposed, but the quality of the images was such that a jury would not been able to make their own comparison of them with Tang's appearance.  She was supplied with forensic photos of Tang.  She noted individual facial and body features, a process known as morphological analysis, and compared measurements and dimensions of faces, known as photo-anthropometry.  She used computer software to enhance the photographic images, together with a process of overlaying comparably enlarged images, known as photograph superimposition.  She identified a number of individual characteristics, and it was these which she classified as ""unique identifiers.""  125The Chief Justice noted that Dr Sutisno had identified her area of expertise as a forensic anatomist specialising in facial identification, and that this expertise was reinforced by her formal research: [58].  His Honour found that this enabled her to detect similarities between the relevant images, placing her in a better position than the jury to compare them: [84].  The case against Tang was circumstantial, and evidence of his similarity to the particular offender in the CCTV footage was relevant: [83].  126His Honour said at [120]:  ""... the evidence of particular similarities between the two categories of photographs of the accused and the [relevant] offender was admissible. The process of identification and magnification of stills from the videotape was a process that had to be conducted by Dr Sutisno out of court. Furthermore, the quality of the photographs derived from the videotape was such that the comparison of those stills with the photographs of the Appellant could not be left for the jury to undertake for itself. The identification of points of similarity by Dr Sutisno was based on her skill and training, particularly with respect to facial anatomy. It was also based on her experience with conducting such comparisons on a number of other occasions.""  127However, one of the unique identifiers upon which Dr Sutisno had relied was the ""relatively upright posture"" of the person in the images and photographs: [29].  The Chief Justice noted that body mapping is an area of specialised knowledge ""qualitatively different"" from facial mapping: [57].  After an examination of the evidence at [58] - [79], his Honour found that Dr Sutisno did not have requisite expertise in body mapping.  He concluded:  ""[134]  Section 79 has two limbs. Under the first limb, it is necessary to identify 'specialised knowledge', derived from one of the three matters identified, i.e. 'training, study or experience'. Under the second limb, it is necessary that the opinion be 'wholly or substantially based on that knowledge'. Accordingly, it is a requirement of admissibility that the opinion be demonstrated to be based on the specialised knowledge. The Appellant invokes each limb.  [135]  With respect to the first limb of s 79, I have set out above the evidence of the nature of the specialised knowledge which Dr Sutisno said she had brought to bear in the formulation of the three opinions she expressed. There does appear to be a body of expertise based on facial identification. The detailed knowledge of anatomy which Dr Sutisno unquestionably had, together with her training, research and experience in the course of facial reconstruction supports her evidence of facial characteristics.   [136]  Nothing was presented to the Court which indicates, in any way, that Dr Sutisno's extension from facial to body mapping, with respect to matters of posture, has anything like that level of background and support. Specialist knowledge of posture can of course exist. ... But the foundation for admissibility must be lain. It was not lain in the present case. The so-called 'unique identifier' of posture was an essential element of Dr Sutisno's evidence of identity in the present case.  ...  [140]  In the case of the Appellant the relevant evidence about posture was expressed in terms of 'upright posture of the upper torso' or similar words. The only links to any form of 'training, study or experience' was the witnesses' study of anatomy and some experience, entirely unspecified in terms of quality or extent, in comparing photographs for the purpose of comparing 'posture'. The evidence in this trial did not disclose, and did not permit a finding, that Dr Sutisno's evidence was based on a study of anatomy. That evidence barely, if at all, rose above a subjective belief and it did not, in my opinion, manifest anything of a 'specialised' character. It was not, in my opinion, shown to be 'specialised knowledge' within the meaning of s 79.  128His Honour dealt with the three opinions which Dr Sutisno had expressed at [88].  He described her evidence that the two bodies of photographs depicted the same person as ""plainly an opinion.""  He saw the six point scale as having ""no scientific basis,"" being ""no more than a series of convenient labels, arranged in an ascending hierarchy, that state a conclusion.""  The characterisation of an identifier as unique, he said, ""similarly has no scientific basis and is no more than an emphatic statement of an opinion.""  129At [141] ff, his Honour held that each of those three opinions failed to meet the second limb of s 79 of the Evidence Act , that is, that they were wholly or substantially based on Dr Sutisno's specialised knowledge.  As he put it at [146], ""Facial mapping, let alone body mapping, was not shown, on the evidence in the trial, to constitute 'specialised knowledge' of a character which can support an opinion of identity.""  He noted that she claimed to have applied a ""strict protocol"" in arriving at those opinions, but did not explain the basis upon which such a protocol was developed.  Indeed, she considered that information confidential and had not published it because she was in the process of patenting it: [154].  130The Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeal had occasion to examine evidence of Dr Sutisno in Murdoch v The Queen [2007] NTCCA 1, 167 A Crim R 329.  In that case also Dr Sutisno had undertaken an exercise in facial and body mapping, comparing photos of the appellant with CCTV images and concluding that they depicted the same person.  At [246] ff, the Court examined her evidence and arrived at the same conclusion as that in Tang : her evidence of similarities between the images was admissible but her positive identification of the appellant was not.  As it happens, Professor Henneberg had been called for the defence at that trial and the court referred to his evidence, critical of that of Dr Sutisno, at [265] - [267].  Obviously, the admissibility of his evidence was not in issue.  131Mr Stratton took no issue with Professor Henneberg's expertise as a biological anthropologist and anatomist.  He submitted, however, that the evidence did not meet the two-fold test of s 79 of the Evidence Act , as it did not involve any area of specialised knowledge based on the professor's training, study or experience, and his opinion was not wholly or substantially based upon that knowledge.  132Mr Stratton referred to the description of the offender in the CCTV footage in the professor's expert certificate, set out at [74] above.  Stripped of the technical jargon, he argued, those observations were simplistic descriptions of the offender.  Particularly was that so of the observations that the man was right handed and ""carried himself straight"", which were not observations which could be said to be based on any training, study or experience.  He noted that the comparison between the images of the offender and the appellant were made purely by observation, and no measurements were taken.  133He relied upon the evidence of the witnesses in the defence case, both on the voir dire and at the trial, to submit that Professor Henneberg's opinions ""did not have the indicia of a scientific opinion.""  He noted the lack of evidence about the validity, reliability and error rate of the professor's methods, together with the absence of any satisfactory evidence of peer review.  134Mr Stratton was critical of Professor Henneberg's oral evidence about the hypothetical incidence of a person sharing the characteristics of the offender in the Australian male population by the application of the product rule, arguing that that erroneous approach told against his qualification to give evidence in this area.  The fallacy was exposed in the agreed document later furnished to the jury and, indeed, in Professor Henneberg's separate document.  As to that latter document, Mr Stratton added, there was ""no or very little logical or empirical basis"" for the professor's estimates of the prevalence in the community of the features to which he referred.  135The Crown prosecutor submitted that Professor Henneberg did no more than give evidence of similarities in a manner expressly sanctioned by the Chief Justice in Tang .  She emphasised that he did not purport to identify the appellant as the offender.  She argued that Professor Henneberg was shown to have relevant expertise and, unlike Dr Sutisno in Tang , fully exposed his methodology for critical examination.  The criticisms of his evidence by the other experts, she said, were properly matters for the jury to assess.  She cited the observation of the Chief Justice in Tang that, for the purpose of s 79, the ""focus of attention must be on the words 'specialised knowledge', not on the introduction of an extraneous idea such as 'reliability':"" [137].  As she put it in oral submissions, s 79 does not create a ""threshold test"" for the admissibility of evidence in an area of specialised knowledge based upon ""acceptance of scientific standards.""  All that is necessary is that the expert witness demonstrate a ""knowledge which is specialised, namely, that it derives from an area beyond the experience of a lay person.""  136As to the lack of measurement of the person in the CCTV footage and the appellant in the forensic photographs, the Crown prosecutor relied on Professor Henneberg's evidence that his analysis was qualitative, rather than quantitative.  On the question of statistics, she submitted that the jury could not have been misled by the oral evidence the professor gave on that topic in the light of the agreed document and his own document later furnished.  The effect of that material was that the incidence in the community of men sharing the characteristics of the offender could not be calculated and, indeed, in his expert certificate the professor had made it clear that statistical analysis was ""not a practical approach.""  137She argued that, in any event, Professor Henneberg's careful examination of the photographic material qualified him as an ""ad hoc expert"", relying on an observation of the Chief Justice in Tang at [120] and the cases to which his Honour there referred.  That was the view taken of the evidence of Dr Sutisno of similarities between the person in the CCTV footage and the appellant in Murdoch : [296].  138We were not referred to any appellant authority in which body mapping was subjected to critical analysis.  The lack of research into the validity, reliability and error rate of the process, identified by Dr Kemp, is of concern.  Professor Henneberg's use of the product rule in his hypothetical statistical calculation and his virtual identification of Ms Pauline Hanson as the person in the newspaper, which proved to be erroneous, are matters properly to be taken into account in assessing the reliability of his evidence as an expert.  His assessment involves an observation of two sets of images and a comparison of anatomical features which he detects in them, without measurements and without the aid of technology such as computerised enhancement of the images and photographic superimposition, the methods adopted by Dr Sutisno in Tang .  139However, this is not the occasion to examine the science of body mapping or to undertake some general appraisal of Professor Henneberg's approach.  As the Crown prosecutor rightly said, the question is whether he had specialised knowledge, beyond the reach of lay people, which he brought to bear in arriving at his opinion.  That question fell to be answered by reference to the task which he undertook.  140That task was to make an anatomical comparison between relatively poor quality CCTV images of a person covered by clothing from head to foot with images of the appellant.  Applying his specialised knowledge, Professor Henneberg claimed, he was able to detect not just a measure of similarity but ""a high level of anatomical similarity"" between the two persons.  How he was able to do that when no part of the body of the offender in the CCTV images was exposed was, in my view, never satisfactorily explained.  141It may be that his experience enabled him to make appropriate adjustments for photographic distortion in the CCTV images.  However, it is not apparent on the evidence how his undoubted anatomical expertise equipped him to take account of the clothing.  Notably, he said that he could make observations of the ""head shape, nose and face profile"" of the offender, notwithstanding that his head was covered by a balaclava.  True it is that that garment appeared to him to be ""well adhering to the surface of the skin"" and, as noted at [56] above, Mr Brooks at the Willoughby Hotel described the balaclava worn by the relevant offender as ""close fitting.""  Nevertheless, this is no answer to the cogent criticisms of this part of the evidence by the other experts.  142Whatever might be said about Dr Sutisno's expertise in the light of the decisions in Tang and Murdoch , her critique of Professor Henneberg's evidence was, as I have said, consistent with those of Dr Kemp and Mr Porter.  Among the points she made, noted at [105] above, was that it would not have been possible for the Professor to assess the features of the head of the offender, which were not visible because of the balaclava that person was wearing.  Mr Porter noted that, generally, the features of the offender were not visible in the images because they were ""all covered by clothing (and of unknown clothing layers)"": [94] above.  Dr Kemp challenged the professor's ability to ""accurately discern face and head shape"", noting that he could not know the characteristics of the clothing being worn, how the clothing adhered to the face and head, and whether the offender was wearing anything else underneath such clothing as was visible: [86] above.  143Professor Henneberg's evidence about his experience of the clothing industry, set out at [87] and [107] above, appears to be confined to the size and hang of garments, and their relation to ""body shape and posture.""  This may mean that he has a facility in taking account of the clothing worn by someone in determining anatomical characteristics of the torso and limbs, although how he could assess the thickness of the clothing and whether there were multiple layers of it is not clear to me.  However that may be, the evidence does not convey that his experience extends to the observation of anatomical features of the head and face of a person whose head is entirely covered by a garment such as a balaclava.  144Whatever might be made of the professor's observations of the offender's body shape through his clothing, his observations about the shape of his head and face were clearly vital to his conclusion that there was a high degree of anatomical similarity between that person and the appellant.  It does not appear to me that those observations could be said to be based upon his specialised knowledge of anatomy.  Generally, I am persuaded by Mr Stratton's submission that his description of the offender was ""simplistic"".  It may well be that the jury would have required expert evidence explaining the effect of photographic distortion in the CCTV images.  Subject to that, I am not persuaded that the comparison of the images of the offender with those of the appellant was a task which the jury would not have been able to undertake for themselves: cf Smith v The Queen [2001] HCA 50, 206 CLR 650.  145Indeed, with every respect to Professor Henneberg, I am of the view that his evidence raised the very problem about expert evidence in this area described by Dr Kemp at [115] above.  It tended to cloak evidence of similarity in a mantle of expertise, described by Mr Stratton as a ""white coat effect"", which it did not deserve.  146Ground 1a is made out.  This would lead to an order that there be a new trial of the robbery counts, unless the remaining evidence was insufficient to justify leaving those counts to a jury.  However, I find it unnecessary to decide that matter because I am satisfied that, even with Professor Henneberg's evidence, the verdicts of guilty on those counts cannot be sustained.  Ground 5  147This brings me to ground 5, which is that the convictions on the robbery counts are unreasonable.  148In assessing the Crown's circumstantial case on the robberies, certain inferences arising from the evidence were not in dispute in this court.  The conclusion that the two robberies were perpetrated by the same offenders was open to the jury.  So was the conclusion that in each robbery the offenders used a red Audi of the same model as that stolen from Mosman some days earlier.  The appellant's criminal involvement with that car, either as thief or receiver, was clearly established by his being found in possession of a key for it about three months after it was stolen.  There was evidence that the Audi was the only vehicle of that colour and model reported stolen over the relevant period, although, of course, that is of significance only if the vehicle at the scene of the robberies was stolen.  Someone burnt out the stolen vehicle after the appellant's arrest but, of itself, that evidence is equivocal as to whether the vehicle was destroyed to conceal its theft or its use in the robberies.  149The evidence that the appellant had access to the premises at Tempe searched by police was itself circumstantial, but that conclusion was also open and was not challenged before us.  There police found $25,000 in cash, bundled in denominations and secured by rubber bands in accordance with the practice at the Willoughby Hotel.  However, that was a practice commonly adopted in the hotel industry and, in any event, the money was found more than three months after the robberies.  I should add that there was evidence, to which I have not so far referred, that the appellant had not been in full time employment over the three years prior to his arrest, and that early in February 2008 his partner and her mother were able to purchase a reasonably expensive car.  150On the other hand, there was no eye-witness identification of the robbers at either hotel.  It is for this reason that the evidence of Professor Henneberg loomed large.  However, in the light of the matters to which I have already referred and, in particular, the compelling critique of the professor's approach in the evidence of the other experts, I am satisfied that it was not open to the jury to find the high degree of anatomical similarity between the offender and the appellant for which he contended.  At most, it established a number of similarities between the two which were unremarkable, individually or in combination.  That being so, I consider that his evidence was of little weight.  Nor do I consider that the jury, left to themselves, could have found any significant similarities between the CCTV images and the photographs of the appellant.  151Of course, such descriptions as the witnesses at the hotels were able to give of the robber said to be the appellant were confined to his height and build.  They were of such generality as to be of little or no assistance to the Crown case.  Mr Stratton noted, however, that the witnesses' estimate of the height of that man varied between 5' 5"" and 5' 9"", or 165 to 175 cms.  Some of the forensic photographs of the appellant show him standing next to a scale, from which it appears that his height is a little over 180 cms but less than 190 cms, that is, of the order of 6' or a little more.  Obviously, the witnesses' estimate of the height of the robber in question are unlikely to be accurate.  However, to most of us a person of 6' or more is noticeably tall, and it is of some significance that no-one described the robber in that way.  152As Mr Stratton properly acknowledged, the evidence raises significant suspicion that the appellant was involved in the robberies and, certainly, points to his having been up to no good in some unspecified way in the period leading to his arrest.  Nevertheless, on the robbery counts I am satisfied that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt.  This was not a case turning upon the credibility of witnesses whom the jury had the advantage of having seen and heard.  It turned primarily upon inferences from uncontested evidence, together with disputed expert evidence.  As with the counts of stealing and receiving the Audi, this court is as well placed as the jury to assess that evidence.  It is a case in which ""a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which the jury ought also to have experienced"": M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, in the joint judgment at 494.  153Since preparing these reasons I have read in draft the judgment of Beazley JA.  Her Honour has examined the evidence relating to the robberies in greater detail and has concluded that, absent the evidence of Professor Henneberg, there was an adequate circumstantial case against the appellant.  However, in the light of the whole of the material, I remain of the view that the evidence does not rise above the level of significant suspicion.  Of course, it is consistent with the appellant's guilt but, in my view, it does not prove it to the requisite standard.  154Accordingly, on each of the third and fourth counts I would quash the conviction and enter a verdict and judgment of acquittal.  This outcome does not entitle the appellant to immediate release because he is not yet due for release in respect of the sentence passed upon him for the sixth count, possessing the proceeds of crime, which was not the subject of appeal.  155HARRISON J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of both Beazley JA and Hidden J.  I agree with Hidden J's detailed analysis of the appellant's challenge to the evidence given by Professor Henneberg and with his conclusion that the appellant must succeed on ground 1(a).  However, I agree with Beazley JA that ground 5, in which the appellant contended that his convictions on the robbery counts were unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence, should be rejected and that in the light of the appellant's success on ground 1(a), the verdict should be quashed and there should be a new trial.  **********

		12 December 2011",2011-11-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758315,R v AB (No. 2) [2011] NSWCCA 256,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ : I agree with Johnson J. 

2HOEBEN J : I agree with Johnson J and the orders which he proposes. 

3JOHNSON J : On 14 October 2011, the Court gave judgment in this Crown appeal, allowing the appeal and making orders which effectively increased the period of imprisonment which the Respondent is to serve for his offences: R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229 (""the principal judgment""). 

4By letter dated 28 October 2011, the solicitor for the Crown wrote to the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal, at the request of Mr Corr, counsel for AB. The letter brought to the Court's attention, for the purpose of Rule 50C Criminal Appeal Rules , what were said to be two errors in the principal judgment. Thereafter, written submissions on behalf of the Crown and the Respondent were filed on 4 November 2011. 

The Issues Raised 

5Both the Crown and the Respondent contend that: 

(a) there has been a slip made in the calculation of the period of aggregation of the notional sentences, creating a three-month gap between the expiry of the sentence on Count 3 and the commencement of the sentence on Count 4, during which period the Respondent would not be serving a sentence; 

(b) it was not open to the Court to impose an aggregate sentence pursuant to s.53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as s.53A does not apply to sentences for offences in respect of which a plea of guilty had been entered prior to the commencement of that section on 14 March 2011. 

6The Respondent submitted further that there has been an arithmetical error in the calculation of the total sentence and that this should be corrected pursuant to s.43 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . 

Consideration of Application 

7Both the Crown and the Respondent request the Court to make orders under Rule 50C Criminal Appeal Rules to overcome the agreed difficulties identified at [5] above. 

8Rule 50C allows the Court to set aside or vary an order in the circumstances outlined in the Rule where application is made within 14 days after the order is entered. I am satisfied that the application was made within the time specified in the Rule. 

9I accept that the letter dated 28 October 2011 is sufficient to constitute an application under Rule 50C: R v Green and Quinn [2011] NSWCCA 71 at [27]-[30]. 

10As mentioned in R v Green and Quinn at [23], Rule 50C was introduced in 2007 following the decision of this Court in R v Burrell [2007] NSWCCA 79; 175 A Crim R 21. 

11This Court has held that Rule 50C may be utilised where there has been some misapprehension of fact or law, not solely attributable to the applicant, which materially affected this Court's judgment in the appeal: Alramadan v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) No. 2) [2008] NSWCCA 69 at [7]; Kauwenberghs v R (Cth) [2009] NSWCCA 201 at [8]-[10]. The Court has power, in any event, to correct accidental slips or omissions so as to ensure that orders finally made reflect the intention of the Court: R v Green and Quinn at [21]. 

12With respect to the first issue raised, it is clear that there is a gap of three months from 27 September 2013 from the conclusion of the notional sentence on the third count and the commencement of the notional sentence on the fourth count. It is appropriate to remedy this slip. 

13The second issue raised concerns the commencement of the provisions allowing aggregate sentencing for New South Wales offences. The topic of aggregate sentencing was touched upon in the principal judgment at [11], [127]-[143]. Although there was some discussion at the hearing before this Court on 16 August 2011 concerning the commencement date of the statutory scheme for aggregate sentencing, with 14 March 2011 being identified for that purpose, a further significant part of the transitional provisions was not picked up by the parties or members of the Court. 

14The amendment made by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2010 , which introduced the aggregate sentencing scheme, applies to the determination of a sentence for an offence whenever committed, unless a court has convicted the person being sentenced of the offence, or a court has accepted a plea of guilty and the plea has not been withdrawn, before the commencement of the amendment on 14 March 2011: Clause 62, Schedule 2, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . 

15The Respondent pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 2 March 2010 and was thereafter committed for sentence. He adhered to those pleas of guilty in the District Court. Accordingly, as the Respondent pleaded guilty to the charges prior to commencement of ss.44(2A) and 53A, it was not open to this Court to impose an aggregate sentence under s.53A or a single non-parole period under s.44(2A) as part of an aggregate sentence. 

16Each of the issues raised by the parties constitutes a misapprehension of fact or law, not solely attributable to the parties, which materially affected this Court's judgment in the appeal. Orders may be made under Rule 50C to remedy the position. The aggregate sentencing error would also be amenable to correction under s.43 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 : Erceg v District Court of New South Wales [2003] NSWCA 379; 143 A Crim R 455; R v Finnie (No. 2) [2004] NSWCCA 150. However, the parties have applied to the Court under Rule 50C, and that is the provision which ought be utilised in the circumstances. 

17Subject to mention of the further matter raised on behalf of the Respondent, it is appropriate that the Court make orders under Rule 50C to remedy the position. 

18In his written submissions, Mr Corr contended that there has been a further arithmetical error in the calculation of the sentence beyond the matters agreed between the parties. I do not accept the arguments advanced in support of this proposition. 

19I am satisfied that the appropriate course is that the Court make orders to remedy the matters agreed between the parties as requiring further orders of the Court. This course will give effect to the intention of the Court in determining the appeal. 

Appropriate Orders 

20The submission of the Crown on the appeal, which was accepted by the Court, was that the individual sentences for the offences should not be increased. Rather, if the Crown appeal was allowed, the Crown submission was that there should be increased levels of accumulation so that the Respondent would be required to serve a significantly longer period of imprisonment for his offences, with an increased minimum term. 

21In sentencing the Respondent other than by use of aggregate sentencing, it is appropriate that the Court should maintain the approach of not increasing the individual sentences. 

22The Court should maintain the approach taken at [141] of the principal judgment that the minimum period of imprisonment which the Respondent should be required to serve for his offences is a period of four years and nine months, with an appropriate period of conditional liberty being available after release on parole. 

23I consider that the appropriate course is to impose fixed terms of imprisonment on Counts 1, 2 and 3. In the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that fixed term sentences are appropriate for these counts to give effect to the Court's intention: s.45 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . 

24A largely cumulative term of imprisonment for three years, comprising both a non-parole period and a balance of term, will be imposed on the fourth count. The sentence on the fourth count will comprise a non-parole period of one year and four months with a balance of term of one year and eight months. A finding of ""special circumstances"" ought be made flowing from the substantial level of accumulation of the sentences, warranting a variation in the statutory ratio under s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on the fourth count. 

25Because the head sentence on the fourth count will involve imprisonment for three years, the Court will make an order under s.50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 directing the release of the Respondent on parole at the end of the non-parole period. This order will work in the interests of the Respondent. 

26There will be a very substantial measure of accumulation, which will result in a total effective minimum period of four years and nine months, with an effective balance of term of one year and eight months. 

27To allow a single coherent understanding of all orders to be made, the appropriate course in this case is to set aside the entirety of the orders made by the Court on 14 October 2011 and to make orders to give effect to this judgment. 

 
28I propose the following orders: 

(a) pursuant to Rule 50C Criminal Appeal Rules , orders made by the Court on 14 October 2011 are set aside; 

(b) Crown appeal allowed; 

(c) sentences imposed in the District Court on 9 March 2011 with respect to the first, second, third and fourth counts are quashed; 

(d) on the first count, the Respondent is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of three months commencing on 28 May 2010 and expiring on 27 August 2010; 

(e) on the second count, the Respondent is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 28 June 2010 and expiring on 27 December 2011; 

(f) on the third count, the Respondent is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 28 November 2011 and expiring on 27 November 2013; 

(g) on the fourth count, the Respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for three years commencing on 28 October 2013 and expiring on 27 October 2016, with that sentence comprising a non-parole period of one year and four months commencing on 28 October 2013 and expiring on 27 February 2015 and a balance of term of one year and eight months commencing on 28 February 2015 and expiring on 27 October 2016; 

(h) the sentence imposed in the District Court on 9 March 2011 for the offence of driving whilst disqualified, pursuant to a certificate under s.166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 is confirmed; 

(i) the orders for disqualification made in the District Court on 9 March 2011 are confirmed; 

(j) under s.50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, it is directed that the Respondent be released on parole on 28 February 2015.

2758316,R v Tuan Anh TRAN [2011] NSWSC 1480,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 

1On 6 December 2008, Paul Elliott was murdered. He was shot by Michael Christiansen; the co-offender was Tuan Anh Tran. The Court is required to sentence Mr Tran who has pleaded guilty to the murder of Mr Elliott. 

2Mr Christiansen has already been sentenced by Latham J on 29 July 2011 for a number of offences including this murder for which Mr Christiansen was sentenced to a non-parole period of 15 years and three months and a balance of term of five years and nine months. 

Facts 

3Agreed facts are before the Court from which the following is extracted (with some minor amendments relating to the description of the persons involved): 

""1. In or about September 2008, Mr Tran supplied Mr Elliott with a large commercial quantity of the prohibited drug methylamphetamine. The purity of the methylamphetamine within the admixture was at a level unacceptably low for the deceased's purposes. Consequently a dispute developed between the two men. Mr Elliott returned most of the drugs to Mr Tran and demanded money. Mr Tran was unable to comply with his demand. Consequently the deceased threatened Mr Tran with violence. 

2. Mr Tran was introduced to Mr Christiansen (a convicted co-offender in this matter) at a park in Glebe in the afternoon of 4 December 2008. At that meeting Mr Tran gave Mr Christiansen a package containing 2,985g of the methylamphetamine. This was methylamphetamine returned to Mr Tran by Mr Elliott. Mr Tran and Mr Christiansen reached a understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that Mr Christiansen would provide physical protection to Mr Tran at a planned meeting with Mr Elliott in which Mr Tran intended renegotiating the terms and conditions of the supply of methylamphetamine. Both Mr Tran and Mr Christiansen contemplated the possibility that Mr Christiansen might shoot and kill Mr Elliott as a possible incident in the execution of the renegotiation of the supply of methylamphetamine. 

3. Surveillance footage revealed that on 4 December 2008 at 2:35pm, Mr Christiansen removed a hand gun from the storage unit he leased under a false name. An optical device was installed inside that storage unit on 26 November 2008, pursuant to a Surveillance Devices warrant. Mr Christiansen used the storage unit to store drugs and firearms. At 5:40pm on 4 December 2008 Mr Christiansen put the package containing the methylamphetamine into the storage unit. 

4. Mr Tran travelled to Melbourne on Friday 5 December and met with Mr Elliott. Mr Tran arranged that they meet in Sydney on 6 December 2008. Mr Elliott later told his girlfriend, ""I have to go to Sydney, to a meeting. If this doesn't go right, you might not see me again."" Mr Elliott also said that he was chasing up an outstanding debt, which was owed to him. 

5. Mr Tran arrived back in Sydney on the night of Friday 5 December 2008. 

6. Earlier that day Mr Christiansen purchased a large metal tool box with wheels from a sheet metal manufacturer in St Peters. 

7. Mr Tran and Mr Christiansen were aware that Mr Elliott had previously served a sentence of imprisonment for the aggravated burglary of Victorian laboratory that lawfully manufactured methylamphetamine. They were aware that Mr Elliott committed this offence with other armed gunmen. This offence was the subject of Gotcha - one of the books in the Underbelly series that documented the crimes of various Melbourne underworld figures. Mr Tran and Mr Christiansen were informed that Mr Elliott: was in the habit of carrying a firearm; had a reputation as a ""stand over man""; and was an associate of a notorious Melbourne underworld family (""the Morans""). 

... 

9. Early on Saturday morning 6 December 2008 Mr Elliott and his girlfriend prepared to travel to Sydney. Mr Elliott was observed, by his girlfriend, moving something wrapped up in a towel from his car towards the hired Holden Statesmen. The towel was old and faded. The object was about 40 centimetres in length and about 10-15 centimetres wide. Mr Elliott was holding the towel as if there was something wrapped inside it. At the time Mr Elliott was wearing gloves. Mr Elliott had been seen, by his girlfriend, in possession of a gun in about March or April 2008. He had kept it wrapped up in a black sock and secreted in the driver's side door. 

10. Mr Elliott and his girlfriend arrived in Sydney at about 3:40pm on Saturday 6 December 2008. Soon after checking into their hotel at Wolli Creek, Mr Elliott told his girlfriend that he had to go out and meet someone. As he left he said, ""I will be back in an hour."" 

... 

12. That same afternoon Mr Christiansen drove to Belmore where he collected Mr Tran. Mr Christiansen then drove to [the murder scene]. Mr Christiansen reversed his van, containing the large metal box he had earlier purchased, onto the driveway of the property. 

13. Mr Christiansen went inside and to the back of the house and Mr Tran waited outside. A short time later, Mr Elliott arrived and spoke with Mr Tran as they entered the house. Mr Elliott said to Mr Tran, ""Why are we meeting here"". Mr Tran replied, ""I have some money for you."" Mr Elliott said, ""That's not good enough"". Mr Elliott then loudly questioned whether there was someone else in the house and started entering other rooms. 

14. Mr Elliott entered the back room where Christiansen was standing with his firearm drawn. Mr Elliott drew his firearm. Christiansen fired several shots from his firearm at the chest and head of Mr Elliott - who died as a result of those gunshot wounds. Mr Elliott did not discharge his firearm. 

15. Mr Christiansen carried the empty metal box into the house. Mr Tran and he placed Mr Elliott into the metal box. They then moved the metal box into Mr Christiansen's van. 

16. Mr Tran drove Mr Elliott's vehicle to the Redfern area. Christiansen followed in his van. Mr Tran left Mr Elliott's vehicle and gave the keys to Christiansen who drove his van to his home in Annandale. 

17. Mr Tran arranged with others to attend and to clean the room where Mr Elliott had been fatally shot. This included portions of the carpet and underlay in the room where Mr Elliott had been fatally shot. 

18. Mr Christiansen arranged with others to dispose of the box containing Mr Elliott at sea the next day."" 

4Following those events Mr Christiansen, with others, disposed of the body by drilling holes into the box and dropping it into deep water about 12 kilometres to the east of Sydney Harbour. Mr Christiansen also set the deceased's car alight. 

5On 16 December 2008, Mr Christiansen was arrested on other charges at a location at which were found property belonging to Mr Elliott. In that property was a piece of paper containing a fingerprint of Mr Tran. Mr Christiansen was also found in possession of low-grade amphetamine. The police interviewed Mr Christiansen on 21 January 2009 and he made detailed admissions including the role of Mr Tran in the events just described. 

6As a consequence of the material provided by Mr Christiansen, surveillance device warrants were obtained and conversations of Mr Tran were recorded which also implicated him in the murder. 

7In an interview with the police, Mr Tran informed the police that he was the middle man in a drug deal in which the seller would not give the money back, which caused a dispute to arise between Mr Tran and Mr Elliot. The meeting was ostensibly to resolve that dispute and Mr Tran engaged Mr Christiansen as a bodyguard for protection. The agreed facts are consistent with that version and also consistent with Mr Tran's version that Mr Christiansen shot Mr Elliott when Mr Elliott was investigating or examining the house. Mr Tran admitted, at that interview, to helping Mr Christiansen load Mr Elliott into the metal box. 

8On 4 August 2010, police charged Mr Tran with the murder of Paul Elliott from which date Mr Tran has been in custody and the Court will commence the sentence to be imposed from that date. Mr Tran waived a committal hearing and on 1 April 2011, the Court was informed that the matter might be short. Notwithstanding that indication, a plea of not guilty was entered on 6 May 2011 and a trial fixed for 29 August 2011. 

9There was a change of legal representation and on 23 August 2011, on the application of the new defence counsel, the trial date was changed to 5 September 2011. Counsel conferred with Mr Tran on 28 August 2011. On 1 September 2011, the Crown and the Court were each informed that there would be a plea. The jury panel was cancelled and the plea was formally entered on 5 September 2011. The timing of the plea was not the earliest available time. Nor was it the latest time. Notwithstanding the late plea, given the number and identity of the witnesses that were otherwise due to be called (exhibit D), the plea has a significant utilitarian value. Further, while not going to utilitarian value, guilt may have depended to a large degree on the testimony of a co-offender who may have had significant credibility issues, which emphasises the acceptance by Mr Tran of his responsibility in this crime. 

10I allow a discount for a plea of guilty of approximately 7.5 percent: section 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (hereinafter, ""the Act""); R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; 115 A Crim R 104. 

11From the foregoing agreed facts, it is clear that Mr Tran's intention was that Mr Christiansen provide protection because of the inherent and known danger posed by Mr Elliott. The fact that, on the agreed facts, Mr Tran's purpose in engaging Mr Christiansen was to protect Mr Tran from the notorious violence of Mr Elliott is a factor that is relevant to determining the seriousness of the offence in question. The Crown alleges that Mr Tran should be sentenced on the basis of joint criminal enterprise, to which counsel for Mr Tran does not take issue. It is therefore unnecessary to deal with the principles of joint responsibility, including extended common purpose. However, it is clear that Mr Tran had a real and reasonable fear that, if the meeting with Mr Christiansen were to be held, his life was seriously at risk. 

12It should also be noted that the agreed facts before the Court in this exercise are different from the facts in which Mr Christiansen was sentenced in that it is now clear that Mr Tran did not have a role in obtaining the box in which Mr Elliott was conveyed after his death, and therefore, the Court is unable to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr Tran had taken any steps prior to the murder, which disclose an anticipation, expectation or actual foresight that the death would occur. 

13In the circumstances, I take the view that Mr Tran's involvement in the murder and culpability in the offence is less than that of Mr Christiansen. Taking into account the nature of the offending only, in which term I include the physical acts of the offender and their consequences together with the circumstances personal to the offender that are causally connected to the commission of the offence such as his state of mind, I consider that the objective seriousness of the offence is slightly above mid-range; see Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154 at [22]. 

14I agree with the comments of Latham J when sentencing Mr Tran's co-offender ( R v Christiansen [2011] NSWSC 840), where her Honour said, 

"" 47 I accept that the essence of the agreement between the offender and Tran was the provision of the offender's services as ""muscle"", in the event that Tran could not resolve his dispute with the deceased. However, even allowing for the fact that the murder may not be strictly characterised as a contract killing, there is considerable force in the Crown's submission as to the objective gravity of the offence on the basis of the factors outlined at [43] above. 

48 The offender's decision to provide lethal force in furtherance of Tran's interests as, in effect, a business transaction, at a time when he was fully cognizant of the gravity of his behaviour, exhibits a very high degree of moral culpability. The offender acted in furtherance of the agreement with Tran by killing the deceased and putting into effect the plan that the offender had formulated to conceal the offence and dispose of the body, if that need should arise. 

49 An assessment of the objective gravity of the offence takes place against the background of the factors established by the evidence on sentence. ... "" 

Sentencing principles 

15As is clear from by section 3A of the Act, the purposes of sentencing any offender, even those charged with murder, seek to reflect what are often, if not necessarily, conflicting goals. In serious crimes such as murder the importance of punishment and public deterrence loom large. These include the protection of society, personal and public deterrence, retribution and reform. 

16Each of those factors, particularly the protection of the community, personal and public deterrence, and punishment, must have regard to the gravity of the circumstances viewed objectively, within the range of crimes that may fall within the offence charged. The objective seriousness of an offence points most obviously to the factors that require protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, and to retribution and denunciation. 

17Reform or rehabilitation may also be significantly affected by the objective circumstances of the offences, but is a factor affected most obviously by the subjective circumstances and the capacity for rehabilitation. That capacity for, and the likelihood, if any, of, rehabilitation in turn impacts upon the degree to which a sentence is fixed that ensures the protection of society and the personal deterrence of the offender. There is usually no single correct sentence and the often-complicated interplay of considerations or guideposts points in different directions: Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465. 

Subjective factors 

18Exhibit 1 in these proceedings is a report of Dr Richard Furst, consultant forensic psychiatrist, in relation to Mr Tran. The psychiatric history reported by Dr Furst includes the fact that Mr Tran fled from Communist occupied Vietnam with his family in 1987 and that the trip by boat from Vietnam to Australia was the subject of pirate attack. Mr Tran spent five years in a refugee camp in Hong Kong during which time life was hard and there were significant drug problems, regular violence and conflict between residents. Mr Tran migrated to Australia in 1992 and was later granted a Permanent Protection Visa. 

19He was initially housed in a St Vincent's de Paul's charitable home. His mother remarried and he has two younger stepbrothers and a younger stepsister. 

20Mr Tran completed year 12 at Marrickville High School but did not perform well academically, after which matters deteriorated for him. He and his family struggled with financial problems. He would work at home sewing and looking after his younger siblings. 

21His mother became ill developing a chronic autoimmune disease and he became extremely concerned about her health and the cost of her medication. His mother was under the care of a specialist at Royal Prince Alfred. 

22Mr Tran does not drink alcohol but has been using illicit drugs from at least 2006 ""in order to escape reality"", being the stress in relation to his mother's condition. 

23According to Dr Furst, Mr Tran displays no indication of cognitive impairment and has a reasonable insight into his condition and substance abuse. He was open to drug and alcohol counselling and other psychological input whilst in custody. This latter aspect discloses a possibility of rehabilitation for which the prospects are, it seems, quite good. 

24Dr Furst opines that Mr Tran ""does not appear to have a major mental illness but presents as sad and tearful, regrets his actions, and feels guilty that he was unable to support his mother or his younger siblings by virtue of his offence and current incarceration"". He is, apparently, still grieving the death of his mother, compounded by his inability, because of his imprisonment, to visit her when she was gravely ill. 

25Dr Furst expresses the view that Mr Tran's mood ""is probably excessive and constitutes an adjustment disorder with depressed mood which is a milder form of depression than Major Depressive Disorder"". Mr Tran presented as remorseful and keen to educate himself during his incarceration. 

26Dr Furst recommends that Mr Tran be placed under the care of Justice Health, with which recommendation, I agree. Justice Health will then be able to monitor his mental health state and provide any counselling and medication if required. Some form of drug and alcohol treatment program whilst in custody would also be extremely useful and offers some significant prospects of rehabilitation. 

27Dr Furst also opines that Mr Tran ""appears to have positive prospects for rehabilitation despite the nature of his offence. He has a history of working in the community and in custody, remains close to his siblings and promised his mother that he would look after them prior to her death. He is motivated to study and to address his substance abuse issues"". I accept this opinion. 

Conclusion 

28Murder is the most serious of offences. It carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 20 years' imprisonment. Each of the foregoing factors are to be considered, along with others, in determining a sentence that is appropriate for the offence and the offender. Plainly, given the seriousness of the offence a full-time custodial sentence is warranted. 

29Earlier as stated, I consider that the objective seriousness of the offence is slightly above mid-range. I allow a discount for the plea of guilty. 

30Whatever may be the subjective circumstances or the prospects of rehabilitation, one cannot loose sight of the fact that a human life has been taken as a result of the conduct of Mr Tran. The material before the Court confirms that the victim's family suffers the consequences of Mr Elliott's violent and premature death. 

31Apart from the nature of the offence committed, the Court also has regard to the fact that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity. Nevertheless, Mr Tran's criminal record is not lengthy and he has good prospects of rehabilitation due to his circumstances and due to his young age. Mr Tran has disclosed remorse, to which Dr Furst attests, and I accept that the remorse is genuine. His plea of guilty confirms his acceptance of responsibility for his actions. 

32I have already set out the circumstances and sentence imposed upon Mr Tran's co-offender. Each of the offenders has a different criminal record. Mr Christiansen was sentenced to a number of offences at the same time. Mr Christiansen's involvement in the murder was objectively at a level of higher culpability and Mr Christiansen was entitled to a significant discount on the basis of the assistance that he gave to law enforcement agencies. In dealing with Mr Tran, the Court must take account of the sentence imposed upon Mr Christiansen, even though the facts upon which the sentence is to be fixed are different from the facts before the Court when dealing with Mr Christiansen. 

33The parity principle recognises that there should be no marked disparity between the sentences of co-offenders that gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance: Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46 ; ( 1984) 154 CLR 606 , Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301. Any difference in the sentence imposed on co-offenders should be rationally based on the differences in their circumstances: Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60 at [254] - [256]. As already stated, Mr Tran is not entitled to the significant discount on account of assistance to police. However, there are other factors, already outlined, that require a sentence at a lower commencing point than was appropriate for his co-offender. Even if there were an irrational disparity between the sentences imposed on these co-offenders, which there is not, it would not entitle me to lengthen Mr Tran's sentence beyond what I consider to be appropriate. 

34Mr Tran has a need for continuing counselling and a lengthy period of supervision in the community. He also has family responsibilities. Those are factors that I also take into account in fixing the sentence. Given the length of the sentence, there is no need for a departure from the statutory ratio for the non-parole period. 

35Taking into account all of the objective and subjective issues, the Court fixes a head sentence of 20 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years. 

Conviction and sentence 

36Tuan Anh Tran, you are convicted of murder in that on 6 December 2008 at Brighton-Le-Sands in the state of New South Wales you did murder Paul Elliott. 

37I sentence you to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 15 years commencing 4 August 2010 and concluding 3 August 2025, the balance of the term being a further five years' imprisonment concluding 3 August 2030. 

38You are first eligible for release on parole on 3 August 2025.

2758322,R v Craig MCGREGOR [2011] NSWDC 242,"Judgment


1Craig McGregor was very interested in chemical reactions. He was also addicted to a range of prohibited drugs. His amateur chemical skills and his drug addiction were a dangerous combination. He has admitted agreeing to manufacture the prohibited drug methylamphetamine. He has been prosecuted for this agreement. 

2The Director of Public Prosecutions has charged him with a conspiracy to manufacture methylamphetamine in an amount not less than a large commercial quantity. Alternatively, the DPP charges him with manufacturing the same drug in an amount not less than the indictable quantity for that drug. 

3What is in issue between the DPP and Mr McGregor was how much methylamphetamine Mr McGregor agreed to manufacture. The DPP says that the conspiracy Craig McGregor was part of was to manufacture a large commercial quantity - or at least a commercial quantity - of methylamphetamine. Craig McGregor denies being part of any agreement to manufacture such quantities. He says that the only agreement he was part of was to manufacture a relatively small amount of methylamphetamine. 

4Hence the issue for me to determine is whether the DPP has satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that Craig McGregor was part of a conspiracy to manufacture either a large commercial quantity or a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. 

5On 21 April 2009 police raided Mr McGregor's unit in Naremburn. They found a large amount of chemicals and chemical equipment and evidence of some chemical reactions which were underway. The unit was an amateur laboratory.

6Mr M L Barr who appears as Crown Prosecutor has marshalled a strong case against Mr McGregor. Mr Barr points to the equipment and the chemicals found in the unit together with evidence from intercepted telephone calls and the fact that one of the co-conspirators was a drug supplier who was in a position to source what was needed. Mr Jason Watts who appears as counsel for Mr McGregor says that, on the other hand, there are explanations for all of this evidence and that the DPP cannot exclude those explanations which must leave me with a reasonable doubt. 

7Both parties elected to have me try this case without a jury. 

8The DPP's case is conveniently summarised in Mr Barr's comprehensive written submissions which are called ""Summary of the Crown Closing Address"" and which I marked MFI 13. I do not propose to refer to those in detail at all. It is sufficient to say that they present a powerful circumstantial case against Craig McGregor as a manufacturer of methylamphetamine in an amount not less than the commercial quantity, if not the large commercial quantity. 

9This was a case which, once that evidence was collected, really had to be prosecuted on the charges which were laid against Mr McGregor. In a sense they cried out for an explanation. 

10Mr Watts called his client Craig McGregor to give evidence in the trial. His evidence also I do not propose to refer to in any detail. He said that there were significantly three things which he was undertaking in his unit. First, he admitted that he was manufacturing a small amount of methylamphetamine. The second thing that he said he was doing was to attempt to manufacture another chemical solution which was not illegal but which he hoped would produce similar effects as prohibited drugs. The third thing which he said that he was doing was undertaking some tests on behalf of one of his co-conspirators, a man named Brett Staas, who was wanting him to undertake certain chemical tests on some material which would be used to manufacture methylamphetamine either one way or another way. 

11This is, as I said, a circumstantial case against Mr McGregor. To some extent there is evidence of a more direct kind in the form of a statement from the other co-conspirator, Clarissa Burrow. That statement became exhibit Z. Ms Burrow was not called as a witness. She admitted to being a drug addict and to having next to no chemical knowledge. Her statement is the kind of evidence about which I would give a jury a warning that it may be unreliable under s165 of the Evidence Act 1995.

12Indeed, I regard Ms Burrow's statement as almost completely unreliable. The reasons for that are fivefold. First, it is unsworn or otherwise unverified. Secondly, it is untested. Thirdly, Ms Burrow admitted to having a drug addiction. Fourthly, she admitted to having next to no chemical knowledge but was making observations about some chemical transactions. Fifthly, she is an accomplice of Mr McGregor. To the extent that Ms Burrow's statement may contain any direct evidence against Mr McGregor, I put no weight on it. 

13When Mr Watts called his client, Mr Barr very extensively and thoroughly cross-examined him. He cross-examined him about all of the equipment and chemicals which were found in his unit. He also cross-examined Mr McGregor about some of the intercepted telephone calls which were part of the evidence produced by the Director of Public Prosecutions. Most of the intercepted telephone calls did not involve Craig McGregor. Most of them did involve his two co-conspirators, Mr Staas and Ms Burrow. Other persons were also involved. There were occasions when Mr McGregor himself was party to a conversation. My understanding is that Mr McGregor's phone was not intercepted but that other telephones were. 

14The intercepted telephone calls, insofar as they captured conversations from Mr McGregor, did not contain any direct admissions by him. There was no direct evidence in the prosecution case of any eyewitnesses who could say that Mr McGregor was involved in the manufacture of a large or commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The case is, so far as I am concerned, almost exclusively a circumstantial case against Mr McGregor. 

15When he was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor, Mr McGregor explained - in a way consistent with being innocent of the more serious charges that he faced - almost all of the propositions that were put to him by Mr Barr. To my observation he did not prevaricate or appear to avoid any questions. He did not give the impression of being compromised by any of the questions which he faced. 

16Being a case which in effect, I regard as exclusively circumstantial, I need to take into account, indeed I must take into account, the kind of direction which I would give a jury who was charged with determining a case such as this. I must apply the principle that the inference or conclusion that Mr McGregor is guilty of manufacturing a large commercial or commercial quantity of methylamphetamine must be a conclusion reached by me beyond reasonable doubt, having taken into account not only the prosecution evidence but also the evidence given by Mr McGregor himself. The inference of his guilt must be the only inference or conclusion which I can draw. That follows from the necessity for the prosecution to satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that Mr McGregor is guilty of the charges which he faced. I would inform a jury that, if at the end of their deliberations, there is more than one conclusion than that favourable to the prosecution, then the prosecution had not proved its case. In a case where an accused person gives evidence, I would direct a jury, and I apply myself the principle, that if I do not positively accept the evidence in support of the accused's, case but that evidence nevertheless leaves me with a reasonable doubt, then I am bound to bring in a verdict of not guilty. It is not the position that I have to believe that the accused is telling the truth before he is entitled to be acquitted of the charges which he faces. 

17This is a case where a good deal of effort has appropriately gone into the preparation of the prosecution of Mr McGregor. There were scientists called to give evidence and a large number of exhibits which showed what was found in his unit. It was like an amateur laboratory. It all presented, in my view, a powerful case supporting the charges which were brought against him. It demanded an explanation. Mr McGregor explained almost all, if not all, of what was put to him about what was found. I do not propose to make a finding as to whether or not I accept that explanation. However what I am comfortable in finding is that Mr McGregor's evidence and the way that he presented it and the answers which he gave in response to the cross-examination, leave me with a reasonable doubt about whether the DPP has made out its case against him. I think that there is a reasonable possibility that the explanation given by Mr McGregor is true. 

18I watched him carefully as Mr McGregor gave his evidence and I listened carefully to the answers which he gave. He was thoroughly and comprehensively cross-examined by Mr Barr who fairly put to him all of the material which was marshalled in the case against him. I regard it as possible that the account that he gave is true. I repeat, I do not need to consider whether or not I am satisfied in fact that his account is true because the conclusion that I have reached leaves me with a reasonable doubt about the prosecution case. 

19Accordingly, so far as count 1 contained in the indictment dated 9 March 2001 is concerned, I find Mr McGregor not guilty of that charge. 

HIS HONOUR: Now am I right Mr Page and Mr Watts in thinking that count 2 is the count that Mr McGregor has pleaded guilty to.

PAGE: Yes your Honour.

20I find Mr McGregor guilty of count 2 in the indictment, namely that he conspired with Brett Staas and Clarissa Burrow to manufacture a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, in an amount not less than the indictable quantity and I convict him of that offence.

		08 October 2012",2011-12-04 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758336,Nicol v Whiteoak & Anor (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 1486,"Judgment 

1The plaintiff claims damages for negligence against the late Steven Whiteoak ( the deceased ), whose executor is the first defendant in the proceedings, and against Mohamed Mogharbel, the second defendant. 

2The deceased was the driver of a 6-metre speed boat owned by his son, the first defendant, in which the plaintiff was a passenger. The second defendant was the driver of a half-cabin cruiser. The two boats collided at dusk, about six o'clock in the evening, on 16 September 2006 on the Georges River near Kangaroo Point. At the time of the collision the boat driven by the deceased was not illuminated and its speed was in the order of 80 kms/hour. The boat driven by the second defendant was illuminated and was travelling at about 35 kms/hour. 

3The deceased died as a result of injuries sustained in the collision. The plaintiff was airlifted by helicopter ambulance from the scene of the accident to St George Hospital. She was put in an induced coma and spent two months in hospital, including two weeks in intensive care. 

The pleadings 

The plaintiff's claim and the first defendant's cross-claim 

4The matters for determination are the plaintiff's claim against the first and second defendants and the first defendant's cross-claim against the second defendant. 

The second defendant's cross claim against the first defendant 

5The second defendant appeared in person. I permitted Ms M Halwani to give him assistance at the bar table, but not to appear on his behalf. At the commencement of the hearing, when I invited the second defendant to respond to the plaintiff's opening if he wished, he referred to his own claim for damages for injuries which he suffered as a result of the collision on 16 September 2006. It was, at first, not clear to me whether he had filed a cross-claim. However, counsel for the plaintiff and the first defendant assisted me in constructing the following chronology. 

6On 22 March 2010, Davies J referred the second defendant to the pro bono scheme. By letter dated 23 September 2010, the Court advised the second defendant that a barrister had agreed to provide assistance. Ultimately, by orders made on 25 November 2010, the Duty Judge granted leave to the second defendant to file a cross-claim, such cross-claim to be filed by 8 December 2010. The second defendant filed a document headed ""Fifth Cross-claim"" on 11 November 2010. On 8 December 2010, he filed a further document, entitled ""Sixth Cross-claim"". In each of these documents, he sought damages against the first defendant. He did not, however, tender the filing fee for the cross-claim. 

7The matter came before Registrar Bradford on 14 December 2010. Ms Halwani sought leave to appear on behalf of the second defendant. The Registrar refused to accept the Fifth and the Sixth Cross-claims on the basis of Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) ( UCPR ) 4.10, since the filing fee had not been paid. 

8Accordingly there is no extant cross-claim brought on behalf of the second defendant. 

The plaintiff's case on liability 

9The plaintiff suffered head injuries in the collision. She gave evidence that she has no recollection of the collision and little recollection of the ensuing weeks. Her last recollection was being in the boat with the deceased at La Perouse on the morning of the day of the collision. She said in evidence that she and the deceased had planned to go up the river and have a picnic lunch. Her next recollection was of a doctor, for whom she used to work, bringing her some yoghurt to St George Hospital. 

10Accordingly, the plaintiff could give little useful evidence about the events leading up to the collision and none about the collision itself or its aftermath. No inference can be drawn against her for not giving such evidence. 

11The plaintiff's evidence on liability comprises the following documentary material: 

(1) the autopsy report for the coroner; 

(2) the certificate of analysis of the deceased's blood and urine pursuant to s 177 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW); 

(3) the statement of Sergeant Hewitt dated 6 December 2006; and 

(4) the coroner's brief of evidence which comprises several witness statements. 

12The autopsy report for the coroner and the certificate of analysis establish that the deceased's blood had a concentration of alcohol of 0.114g/100ml and that his urine had a concentration of alcohol of 0.159g/100ml. Marijuana constituents were detected in the deceased's blood and urine, in the following concentrations: 0.008mg/L and 0.026mg/L. 

13The certificate of analysis records the above concentrations and contains the following passage: 
""The following information may assist in interpreting the toxicology results: 

Alcohol (Ethanol ) 
Increasing blood alcohol concentration (BAC) may gradually lead to slowed reflexes, impaired judgement, obscured observation, and diminished attention through to slurred speech, impaired muscular co-ordination to stupor, convulsions, coma and death. Though factors like body mass, sex and food consumed affect the BAC, on average BAC may rise by 0.013g% (0.009-0.020g%) per hour per drink of a middy (285mL) of beer, or a nip (28.5mL) of whisky. An average elimination rate is 0.2g% per hour. More than 50% of persons would be grossly intoxicated at a BAC of 0.15g%. Lethal blood alcohol concentration, of alcohol alone, is usually in excess of 0.400g%, and is much lower if CNS depressant drugs are present.

14There was no inquest since the deceased's sister, his next of kin, did not require it. 

15In his statement in the coroner's brief, Sergeant Hewitt summarised his conclusions as a result of his investigation as follows: 
""14. About 1am on Sunday 17 September, 2006, I attended the deceased's resident at [address] in company with Senior Constable BAILEY and delivered a death message to the next of kin, Scott Whiteoak, the son of the deceased. 

15. From the statements and certificates gathered it is ascertained that the deceased launched his son's vessel at the St George Motor Boat Club ramp, about 12 midday on Saturday the 16 th September, 2006 incompany with Linda NICOL, whom he had a relationship with for the past eight months. Once launching the vessel the deceased and his partner have travelled to various locations on the Georges River. 

16. About 6pm this date the deceased has been seen travelling east on the Georges River, near Caravan Head at very high speed, outside of the designated channel. When at a point near Kangaroo Point the deceased has re-entered the main channel and collided with another vessel, which was travelling inside the designated channel, heading in a westerly direction. 

17. The starboard midships of the deceased's vessel has struck the bow section of vessel 2, resulting in heavy contact. As a result the deceased was killed instantly and four persons from vessel 2 were thrown down into the water. 

18. A number of private vessels came to the aid of the casualties and were subsequently towed to a waterfront residence at Kangaroo Point, where emergency services responded. 

19. From witness accounts it would appear that the deceased has not travelled at a safe speed to avoid a collision. The master of vessel 2 was travelling at a reasonable speed and was unable to avoid the deceased's vessel. 

20. It is also apparent that the deceased was consuming alcohol prior to the collision, returning a blood alcohol reading of 0.114g/100ml, Mid Range Prescribed Concentration of Alcohol. There were also cannabinoids detected from the analysis. 

21. A statement obtained also suggests that the deceased would consume alcohol and smoke marijuana before and during driving vessels or spending time on the water and had been a regular user of marijuana for many years. 

22. From the evidence gathered, it is thought that the deceased failed to navigate in the designated channel and at a safe speed, whilst under the influence of alcohol, which inevitably resulted in the fatality."" 

The first defendant's defence to the plaintiff's claim 

16The first defendant defends the plaintiff's claim on several bases. 

17First, he denies that the deceased was negligent. The basis of this allegation appears to be that the deceased was not the driver of the boat at the time of the collision. 

18Secondly, the first defendant alleges that the plaintiff is not entitled to damages because she was engaging in a dangerous recreational activity within the meaning of s 5L of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) ( the Act ). The particulars of the alleged dangerous activity refer to the deceased's state of intoxication and his failure to comply with various rules in the Navigation (Collision) Regulations 1983 (NSW), including driving at an excessive speed, not maintaining a proper lookout and driving a vehicle whose lights were not activated. 

19Thirdly, the first defendant alleges that the plaintiff's alleged injuries occurred wholly or in part as a result of her own fault and contributory negligence. The particulars of the plaintiff's contributory negligence are, in substance, that she travelled as a passenger in a boat driven by the deceased in circumstances where she knew or ought to have known that he was affected by the prior consumption of alcohol and or drugs to such an extent as to make him incapable of controlling the speed or direction of the boat. 

20The first defendant initially relied on the defence of volenti non fit injuria and alleged that the plaintiff perceived the existence of the danger of a collision and fully appreciated the danger and freely and voluntarily agreed to accept the risk of the danger materialising. However, Mr Newbrun, counsel for the first defendant, conceded in final address that he had not laid the foundation for this defence in his cross-examination of the plaintiff and accordingly did not press it. Later, he sent written submissions to my chambers in which he reversed his earlier forensic decision, with the consent of the plaintiff's counsel. Accordingly, this defence will be considered in these reasons. 

21Although the first defendant pleaded in his defence filed on 21 May 2010, that his liability is limited by the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Act 1989 (Cth) and the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims 1976, he indicated at the commencement of his address that he neither pressed that defence, nor the defence that the whole of the deceased's estate has been fully administered and there are no assets of the estate remaining. 

Findings on liability 

The applicable law 

22Parts 1 and 2 of the Act apply to the plaintiff's claim since it is a claim for damages for harm alleged to have resulted from the negligence of the deceased and or the second defendant. 

The negligence of the deceased 

23The first defendant sought to establish, by cross-examination of the plaintiff, that the plaintiff had been driving the boat at the relevant time and that the deceased was, accordingly, not negligent. The plaintiff denied that she drove boats and insisted that she refused to do so because she did not have the wherewithal to pay for any damage if there was any kind of collision or other mishap. Because of her lack of memory of the day in question, she was unable to give evidence of whether she took control of the boat at all on that day. 

24The only evidence that there was a possibility that the plaintiff, rather than the deceased, was in control of the boat on that day was a statement of Mr McKirdy, a friend of the deceased, which was contained in the brief to the coroner. Mr McKirdy said: 
""I have known Linda to be in control of boats and she did have a medium level of experience boating [sic]. Linda new [sic] her limits and did not drive very often."" 

25This evidence is insufficient to displace the plaintiff's evidence, and, at best raises a possibility only that the plaintiff was in control of the board. 

26I find, on the balance of probabilities, that the deceased was in control of the boat on the day of the collision, and that he was driving the boat immediately prior to, and at the time of, the collision. 

27For the reasons which are given in more detail below, the collision between the boat driven by the deceased and the boat driven by the second defendant occurred because the deceased drove at excessive speed in circumstances where his line of sight did not permit him to see the second defendant's vehicle before it was too late for him to take evasive action. The plaintiff, who was a passenger on the deceased's boat, suffered serious injuries as a result of the impact of the collision. 

28I regard the documentary evidence referred to above as uncontroverted, since the first defendant served a notice to admit the authenticity of the documents and also gave notice to the plaintiff that he wished to tender the documents himself pursuant to s 67 of the Evidence Act . The evidence referred to above is sufficient to establish that, and I find, the collision was caused by the deceased's negligence. 

29I find, for the reasons which follow, that: 

(1) the relevant risk of harm was the risk that the deceased's boat would collide with another vessel or a fixed obstacle such as a channel marker, or the shore, and thereby cause personal injury or death, damage to property and economic loss; 

(2) the risk of the deceased's boat colliding with another vessel or a fixed obstacle was foreseeable in circumstances where it was being driven at an excessive speed and in a direction that did not confer the benefit of a clear view on its driver; 

(3) the risk was not insignificant; 

(4) a reasonable person in the position of the deceased would have taken the precaution of slowing the boat to a lesser speed when navigating the area in the vicinity of Bald Face Point and Kangaroo Point. 

30Accordingly, a finding of negligence is not excluded by s 5B of the Act. None of the principles outlined in s 5C have any particular application to the instant case. I propose now to apply the general principles for which provision is made by s 5D of the Act. 

31The precautions which ought to have been taken to avoid or minimise the risk of harm were, in the main, the act of slowing the boat so that it did not pose a danger to other vessels or fixed obstacles. 

32The reckless way in which the deceased manoeuvred the vessel on which the plaintiff was a passenger was a necessary condition of the harm caused to the plaintiff. Furthermore I consider it to be appropriate that the scope of the deceased's liability extends to the harm caused to the plaintiff. The deceased, as the person in control of a vessel in motion, is the principal person responsible for its manoeuvres. If he failed, as I have found he did, to take reasonable care to drive it in a manner and at a speed appropriate to the circumstances, so as not to put others, including himself and his passenger at risk, then it is appropriate that responsibility for the harm should be imposed on him, or, in the event of his death, as occurred here, on his estate. 

33I am satisfied that the plaintiff has discharged the onus of establishing that the deceased's negligence caused the collision, and accordingly, that her injuries are a result of the deceased's negligence. 

The alleged negligence of the second defendant 

34Mr Newbrun submitted that there was evidence from which I could infer not only that the second defendant had been negligent but also that his negligence had been a cause of the accident. He pointed to the statements of Mr Graham and Mr Jamieson in support of the particulars of negligence in the Amended Fourth Cross-Claim. Their statements are contained in the coroner's brief, and were tendered by the plaintiff, at the request of the first defendant who said that the statements were necessary background to the statement of Sergeant Hewitt, which was the subject of the s 67 notice. 

35Mr Graham lived at Stuart Street, Blakehurst, which is on the waterfront of the Georges River. He deposed to being on the verandah of his residence and seeing the second defendant's boat travelling from Bald Face Point to Kangaroo Point. He estimated this boat to be travelling at 35 kms/hr. He also deposed: 
""This boat didn't seem to have any navigation lights on. At the time it was dusk. I kept watching the boat and it headed to go up the Georges River. The boat turned to head between the channel marker and the first boat that is moored at the tip of Kangaroo Point. It appeared that this boat was going to travel inside the port marker and a yacht that is moored at the tip of Kangaroo Point. This is because I saw this vessel to be stern on to me."" 

36Mr Jamieson was on board a vessel which was moored at Blakehurst. He deposed to seeing the second defendant's boat travelling from Bald Face Point to Kangaroo Point. He deposed: 
""The direction that the half cabin was heading, it appeared that it was going to go very close to the port mark or inside it. This port mark is located at the north east tip of Kangaroo Point."" 

37Mr Newbrun ultimately abandoned his earlier submission that, had the second defendant sounded his horn, he would have been able to avoid the collision or mitigate its force. Nonetheless he pressed a submission that the second defendant's steering of the boat close to the port mark made a contribution to the resulting collision. He conceded that the causal contribution made by the second defendant's steering to the collision was significantly less than the negligent acts and omissions of the deceased. 

38It is not clear to which of the particulars of negligence of the cross-claim, this matter relates. Particular (l) is a possibility, and reads as follows: 
""In breach of Navigation (Collision) Regulations 1983, Rules 9(f) and 34(e), failed to navigate with particular alertness and caution when driving the half-cabin cruiser near a bend where moored vessels were situated, namely driving the half-cabin cruiser in close proximity to or inside the channel marker position at the tip of Kangaroo Point on the Georges River, and without sounding one prolonged horn blast."" 

39However, if the evidence referred to above relates to particular (l), then it would seem to be irrelevant because of the concession referred to above, that the sounding of a horn would have made no difference. 

40Particular (h) provides: 
""Failed to alter the half-cabin cruiser's course to starboard so as to avoid a collision in breach of Rule 14 of the Navigation (Collision) Regulations 1983."" 

41Rule 14 of the Navigation (Collision) Regulations 1983 provides: 
""(a) When two power-driven vessels are meeting on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses so as to involve risk of collision each shall alter her course to starboard so that each shall pass on the port side of the other. 

(b) Such a situation shall be deemed to exist when a vessel sees the other ahead or nearly ahead and by night she could see the masthead lights of the other in a line or nearly in a line and/or both sidelights and by day she observes the corresponding aspect of the other vessel. 

(c) When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether such a situation exists she shall assume that it does exist and act accordingly."" 

42I do not consider the second defendant to have been in breach of this regulation. Nor am I satisfied that any of the particulars of negligence alleged in the Amended Fourth Cross Claim has been made out. The second defendant was only a cause of the collision in the strict 'but for' sense. Had his vessel been in a different place, it may not have collided with the deceased's vessel. 

43The sentence extracted from Sergeant Hewitt's statement above (which is based on a number of witnesses statements to similar effect) is sufficient to establish that the second defendant was not negligent: 
""The master of vessel 2 was travelling at a reasonable speed and was unable to avoid the deceased's vessel"" 

44I find that the second defendant was unable to avoid the deceased's vessel. Further, I find, in accordance with the overwhelming evidence in the coroner's brief, that the second defendant's boat was illuminated. I do not regard Mr Graham's speculation that it may not have been to be of sufficient weight to displace the evidence of other witnesses who deposed that it was illuminated. 

Whether the plaintiff was engaged in a dangerous recreational activity 

45The first defendant alleges that the deceased is not liable in negligence for harm suffered by the plaintiff, since the harm suffered was a result of the materialisation of an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity engaged in by the plaintiff. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was engaged in a dangerous recreational activity. 

46Section 5K of the Act defines ""dangerous recreational activity"" as: 
""... a recreational activity that involves a significant risk of physical harm."" 

""Recreational activity"" is defined as including: 
""(a) any sport (whether or not the sport is an organised activity), and 

(b) any pursuit or activity engaged in for enjoyment, relaxation or leisure, and

""Obvious risk"" has the same meaning as it has in Division 4. 

47By s 5K ""obvious risk"" in s 5L has the same meaning as it has in s 5F. Section 5F provides: 
""(1) For the purposes of this Division, an obvious risk to a person who suffers harm is a risk that, in the circumstances, would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of that person. 

(2) Obvious risks include risks that are patent or a matter of common knowledge. 

(3) A risk of something occurring can be an obvious risk even though it has a low probability of occurring. 

(4) A risk can be an obvious risk even if the risk (or a condition or circumstance that gives rise to the risk) is not prominent, conspicuous or physically observable."" 

48As Mason P said in Lormine Pty Ltd and Anor v Xuereb [ 2006] NSWCA 200, at [31]: 
""The principles as to how an activity is to be characterised to determine if it is a ""dangerous recreational activity"" (ie a recreational activity that involves a significant risk of physical harm) are discussed in Falvo v Australia Oztag Sports Association [2006] NSWCA 17 and Fallas v Mourlas [2006] NSWCA 32. The defendant bears the burden of proof in establishing a defence under s 5L. The question is to be determined objectively and prospectively. The standard lies somewhere between a trivial risk and one that is likely to occur. Significance is to be informed by the elements of both risk and physical harm. The characterisation must take place in the particular context in which the plaintiff places himself or herself (see Fallas at [38]-[50], [92])."" 

49The recreational activity in question can be viewed at various levels of generality. Travelling on a motor vessel in a protected waterway such as the Georges River may not be dangerous at all if the driver of the vessel is not intoxicated and is taking due care. However where, as here, it was dusk, the boat was not illuminated, it was travelling at such a speed that the sound of its motor could readily be identified at a distance and remarked upon and, I infer, the driver was intoxicated, the recreational activity of boating on a river had become, by those circumstances, dangerous. 

50However, it does not follow, merely because the deceased was engaged in a dangerous recreational activity at the time of the collision, that the plaintiff ought also be regarded as so engaged. In the instant case the evidence shows that the deceased engaged in a dangerous recreational activity since he was in charge of a power boat, which did not have its lights on, after dusk while under the influence of alcohol. The plaintiff was a passenger on the vessel. There is, however, no evidence from which I can infer that the plaintiff engaged, in any positive sense, in the dangerous recreational activity in which the deceased was engaged. For the reasons given more fully below, the evidence does not exclude various possibilities which are inconsistent with her having engaged in the dangerous recreational activity. For example, the plaintiff may have pleaded with the deceased to stop drinking, let her off, slow down, put the lights on or sound the horn. 

51The first defendant submitted that the dangerousness of the recreational activity ought be judged by reference to the minutes immediately preceding the collision, rather than to the whole of the period from the time the deceased and the plaintiff got on the boat on 16 September 2006. He said that the description given by Maryanne Korbi, whose statement formed part of the brief to the coroner, gave a reliable indication from a person who was in the vicinity of the accident when it occurred. Ms Korbi stated: 
""4. Later on, at around dusk, I can't say what time it was exactly as we didn't have a mobile phone or watch, but I remember the lights on the channel were flashing. I think the channel marker just to my left was flashing white. There was another channel marker a long way away, just off Kangaroo Point, it was flashing red. 

5. At about this time I heard the sound of an engine that was rather loud. It was coming from my right near Como Bridge. I turned and looked toward the noise and saw a white coloured boat. I was horrified at the speed at which the boat was travelling, I have never seen a boat go that quick. I've never seen any boat travel at that speed on the Georges River. Looking at a street directory I would estimate that the boat was off Green Point, Como when I first saw it. There was a lot of spray coming from the back of the boat and the front or tip of the boat was angled up. 

6. I watched the boat go past us. The boat was travelling close to the opposite side of the river to where we were fishing. I said to Thomas, Tony and Chloe, 'This guy has got a death-wish, he's going to end up killing someone if not himself . ' The boat past [sic] our position, I noticed the motor noise didn't change so he was still going fast. This got our attention as we discussed how he was going to negotiate the bend at Kangaroo Point. We all kept looking in that direction. I could see the red light flashing at Kangaroo Point and that's when we lost sight of him. 

7. Moments later we all heard an explosion and I also felt something like a vibration. It was very loud it felt very close. Chloe said, 'He's hit the flashing light'. I said, ' The light is still flashing, he's hit something just around the bend not the light' ."" [Emphasis in original] 

52I accept Mr Newbrun's submission about the time during which the matter must be assessed. There is no evidence that the deceased was engaged in a dangerous recreational activity in any period other than that immediately prior to the collision. Indeed, that the danger associated with the recreational activity was so short-lived has, in my view, a significant bearing on the extent to which the plaintiff can be said to have engaged in it. 

53Mr Newbrun submitted that there was a number of matters which, taken together, compelled an inference that the plaintiff did not object to the deceased's risk-taking behaviour in the minutes prior to the collision and therefore could be said to have engaged in the same dangerous recreational activity in which the deceased was engaged. 

54He relied on each of the following matters which he contended established that the plaintiff was both a thrill seeker and a risk taker, and that she therefore participated in the same activity as the deceased immediately prior to the collision: 

(a) The plaintiff drove a sports car, a Mazda MX6, with a V6 engine which she purchased second-hand about three years prior to the accident, and admitted that she not only enjoyed driving it but also enjoyed being seen in it; 

(b) The plaintiff had owned horses and had ridden them in endurance events; 

(c) The plaintiff had raced sailing boats regularly, although not in the two years prior to the accident; 

(d) The plaintiff had undertaken waterskiing a couple of times a year; 

(e) the plaintiff regularly went out on powered boats, including with the deceased; she enjoyed the freedom of being on the water and the wind on her face; 

(f) The plaintiff had gone up in a hot air balloon when on a recent holiday in Egypt; 

(g) The plaintiff had experimented with heroin when she was nineteen, and it was probably as a result of this that she contracted Hepatitis B; 

(h) The plaintiff had snorted cocaine as a teenager three or four times; 

(i) The plaintiff, as an adult, had taken cannabis in the form of joints, although not in the months prior to the accident; 

(j) The plaintiff was a heavy drinker; and 

(k) The plaintiff had been convicted of a mid-range drink driving offence about fourteen years prior to the accident, as a result of which she was not permitted to drive for four months. 

55Mr Newbrun said further that the plaintiff was obviously a strong, independent woman who was perfectly capable of objecting to any behaviour of which she did not approve and making her views known. He also submitted that the plaintiff's evidence that the deceased listened to her concerns and tended to do what she asked him to, ought lead me to infer that she did not object to his conduct since, if she had objected, he would have desisted. 

56Mr Newbrun also submitted that the plaintiff was a person who was prepared to act in disregard of her own interests, and that this tended to establish that she would not have objected to the deceased's reckless driving of the boat immediately prior to the accident. He relied on the plaintiff's evidence that in the past she had, for about four years, been in a violent relationship, in the course of which she was regularly beaten senseless and also her previous drug use, and in particular her use of heroin. 

57I consider this submission to be an extraordinary leap in logic, and I reject it. To suggest that a woman who has successfully extricated herself, ten years previously, from a violent relationship, obtained treatment for psychological problems as a result of it, and obtained regular employment for which she qualified herself by doing a course, would have been prepared by reason of those matters to be an active participant in a highly dangerous manoeuvre while a passenger in a speedboat is fanciful and at odds with experience. 

58I find that the plaintiff's use of heroin was as she disclosed in evidence: that she had experimented with it when she was a teenager, more than twenty years prior to the accident, and she had not used it since that time. I do not consider this to be relevant to the issues for determination in this case. Nor do I consider that her prior use of heroin bears on the plaintiff's credibility. 

59In addition to the matters referred to above, Mr Newbrun also relied on the circumstance that the plaintiff was prepared to travel overseas on her own. I do not consider that circumstance to be probative of the issues in this case. 

60Mr Newbrun spent a deal of time in the hearing cross examining the plaintiff about whether she was a heavy drinker, and the extent to which she had an alcohol problem. He was presumably seeking to establish that her heavy drinking made her a risk-taker, that she drank heavily on the day of the accident, and that the disinhibiting effects of alcohol meant that I should find that she engaged in the activity in which the deceased was engaged prior to the collision. 

61Mr Newbrun also relied on the statement of Sergeant Gorick, which was included in the brief to the coroner. Sergeant Gorick stated: 
""I observed an esky and a number of beer cans and wine bottles floating in the water. I could not be positive but strongly suspect that this debris was from WHITEOAK's vessel."" 

62Even were I to assume that Sergeant Gorick's suspicion was correct and the debris came from the deceased's vessel, this does not, without more, establish that the deceased and the plaintiff consumed alcohol from those receptacles on the day of the accident, and if so, in what proportion. 

63There is neither evidence of what the plaintiff's blood alcohol concentration was at the time of the accident, nor evidence from which her consumption on that day can be deduced. Although I am prepared to infer that the plaintiff and the deceased drank alcohol together on the day of the accident, since it was the plaintiff's evidence that that is what they intended to do, it was their usual practice, and the defendant's blood alcohol reading establishes that he did so, there is insufficient evidence from which I could infer how much the plaintiff drank, and to what extent she was affected by alcohol in the minutes immediately preceding the collision. 

64In any event, I accept, as a matter of common experience that views differ about what constitutes heavy drinking. The plaintiff's daughter Rachel, who does not drink, has described her mother as a heavy drinker, but the plaintiff is resistant to that description and maintains that she is not an alcoholic. Whether the plaintiff is a heavy drinker or not, the fact remains that, as I have said above, the evidence of her drinking habits is not sufficient for me to make a finding about her consumption on the day of the accident, except to the extent referred to above. 

65Mr Newbrun also sought to obtain the plaintiff's agreement that she was a heroin user, based on some notes to that effect in the St George Hospital file, the tender of which I rejected and which is the subject of a separate judgment given on 29 November 2011: Nicol v Whiteoak & Anor [2011] NSWSC 1467. He put to her that she had puncture marks on her right anterior elbow area from heroin injections. The plaintiff denied the proposition and observed that this was unlikely in any event since she was right-handed. 

66Mr Newbrun also suggested to the plaintiff that she consumed a substantial quantity of alcohol on the day of the accident. I accept the plaintiff's evidence that she does not recall how much she consumed on that day. 

67Mr Newbrun submitted, in respect of the deceased, that he was intoxicated but not particularly so, since his blood alcohol level was only in the mid-range and he was, as the statement of Mr McKirdy indicates, a seasoned drinker. Therefore it could not be inferred that he was particularly affected or disinhibited such as would incline him to override the wishes of the plaintiff as to how he should drive the boat. Mr Newbrun accepted that I could not find, on the balance of probabilities that the deceased was affected by cannabis at the time of the accident, because the long half life of such substances in the body means that their presence indicates only that cannabis was taken in the previous week. 

68Mr Newbrun submitted that because the plaintiff had been present when he was consuming alcohol on that day she had participated in his loss of inhibitions and had therefore participated in the dangerous activity which may have been a result of his ingestion of alcohol. 

69The instant case is quite some distance from that of the passenger who hands the keys to the car to an obviously intoxicated friend, who is an inexperienced learner driver, and asks her to drive her home ( Williams v GIO [1995] NSWCA 516 per Cole JA, with whom Meagher JA agreed). A point of significant distinction is that in the motor vehicle cases, the relevant decision made by the passenger is, generally, whether to get into the motor vehicle when the driver is intoxicated, since drivers do not usually drink while driving. Boats are, however, different in this respect in that the plaintiff and the deceased may have been completely sober when they got onto the boat that morning. 

70The first defendant relied on the report of Professor Starmer to support the proposition that the plaintiff must have been aware of the deceased's increasing intoxication. However, Professor Starmer stated that: ""The signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxication increase as a function of blood alcohol concentration and vary to some extent among individuals"". There is no material before me which would enable me to determine to what extent, if at all, the deceased was exhibiting the so-called 'cues' that, in the first defendant's submission, would have given the plaintiff some forewarning that the deceased would be likely to act as he did and drive in the reckless and dangerous manner which ultimately led to the collision. I shall return to this matter when considering whether the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. 

71However, there are matters that go the other way and might tend to suggest that the plaintiff objected to the defendant's handling of the boat in the minutes prior to the collision and the defendant disregarded her objections. First, she was very fond of the deceased and considered that they had a future together and ""should have been together"". It is unlikely in those circumstances that she would collaborate in any turn of events that expose either the deceased or herself to a considerable risk of physical harm. Secondly, she was a mature woman who had a regular, stable job which she enjoyed. She was also the mother of a daughter, had a good social life and was living with a close friend. 

72I consider that the evidence referred to above permits of no more than speculation. The possibility that the plaintiff went along with the deceased's recklessness can no more be excluded by the evidence than the possibility that the plaintiff objected to it and demanded, fruitlessly, to be allowed to get off the boat. 

73In the absence of any evidence to implicate the plaintiff in the dangerous aspects of the otherwise relatively safe recreational activity of travelling on a boat in a protected waterway such as the Georges River, I find that the first defendant has not discharged the burden of proof of establishing a defence under s 5L of the Act. 

Whether the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence 

74Before considering the allegation of contributory negligence pleaded by the first defendant, I note that the Act, in Part 6, makes specific provision where a person is intoxicated and, in certain circumstances, creates a presumption of contributory negligence and mandates a minimum reduction in damages of 25% in circumstances where the presumption applies. 

75Neither of the defendants sought to rely on Part 6. However, for completeness, I propose to set out my reasons for deciding that it does not apply lest it be thought that it has been overlooked. 

76Part 6 applies to the instant case by reason of s 47(1). Section 48 provides relevantly that a reference to a person being ""intoxicated"" is a reference to a person being under the influence of alcohol. No party contended that the duty of care or standard of care owed to the plaintiff by the deceased was affected by the fact that she was probably intoxicated. 

77Section 50 provides: 
""(1) This section applies when it is established that the person whose death, injury or damage is the subject of proceedings for the recovery of damages was at the time of the act or omission that caused the death, injury or damage intoxicated to the extent that the person's capacity to exercise reasonable care and skill was impaired. 

(2) A court is not to award damages in respect of liability to which this Part applies unless satisfied that the death, injury or damage to property (or some other injury or damage to property) is likely to have occurred even if the person had not been intoxicated. 

(3) If the court is satisfied that the death, injury or damage to property (or some other injury or damage to property) is likely to have occurred even if the person had not been intoxicated, it is to be presumed that the person was contributorily negligent unless the court is satisfied that the person's intoxication did not contribute in any way to the cause of the death, injury or damage. 

(4) When there is a presumption of contributory negligence, the court must assess damages on the basis that the damages to which the person would be entitled in the absence of contributory negligence are to be reduced on account of contributory negligence by 25% or a greater percentage determined by the court to be appropriate in the circumstances of the case. 

(5) This section does not apply in a case where the court is satisfied that the intoxication was not self-induced."" 

78It has not been established that the plaintiff was, at the relevant time, intoxicated to the extent that her capacity to exercise reasonable care and skill was impaired. Accordingly s 50 does not apply and I do not need to determine whether the presumption of contributory negligence would otherwise arise. 

79The allegation in the first defendant's defence of contributory negligence involves similar considerations to those addressed above in the determination of the question whether the plaintiff herself engaged in the dangerous recreational activity which was being engaged in by the deceased. 

80Whether or not a passenger in a vehicle driven by a negligent driver is to be regarded as guilty of contributory negligence is a question of fact. For example, it may be that if the owner of a vehicle gives the keys to a car to a person whom the owner knows to be intoxicated and asks that person to chauffeur the owner home, the owner/passenger can be said to have acquiesced in the driver's negligence such that it is appropriate to discount the passenger's damages on the grounds of contributory negligence. 

81In Joslyn v Berryman (2003) 214 CLR 552, the High Court considered the appropriate test for determining whether there was contributory negligence in the context of an intoxicated passenger accepting a lift from an intoxicated driver. It found the test to be an objective one. This is, in any event, mandated in the instant case by s 5R of the Act. 

82McHugh J articulated the issue in the following terms, at 566: 
""Hence, the issue is not whether a reasonable person in the intoxicated passenger's condition - if there could be such a person - would realise the risk of injury in accepting the lift. It is whether an ordinary reasonable person - a sober person - would have foreseen that accepting a lift from the intoxicated driver was exposing him or her to a risk of injury by reason of the driver's intoxication. If a reasonable person would know that he or she was exposed to a risk of injury in accepting a lift from an intoxicated driver, an intoxicated passenger who is sober enough to enter the car voluntarily is guilty of contributory negligence. The relevant conduct is accepting a lift from a person whose driving capacity is known, or could reasonably be found, to be impaired by reason of intoxication."" 

83Even if the deceased was not exhibiting any obvious signs of intoxication, perhaps because he was a seasoned drinker, a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff would have been able to appreciate that his capacity to drive the boat was being compromised at least to some degree by the alcohol he was ingesting in the course of their afternoon together on the Georges River. Since there were only the two of them on the boat a reasonable person in her position would have been in a position to see him drinking and assess how much alcohol he had been drinking over the hours since they got on the boat at La Perouse. 

84Even if, until the minutes immediately before the accident, the deceased had been driving the boat in a reasonable fashion, the plaintiff was arguably in a different position to other persons on the river who might have observed the deceased at the helm. As Kirby J said in Joslyn , at 598: 
""Other witnesses who saw her after the accident might say that she showed no signs of intoxication. But Mr Berryman knew differently. This will commonly be the case where a driver and passenger have engaged, together or close by, in an extended bout of alcohol consumption over a continuous interval."" 

85However, in the instant case, there is scant evidence of what happened on the boat prior to the collision, since the two people present cannot give evidence about it: the deceased because he was killed by the impact, and the plaintiff because the impact deprived her of the recollection of the relevant period of time. Although I infer that the deceased must have imbibed a considerable quantity of alcohol on the boat, in the presence of the plaintiff, the evidence is not sufficient to establish that a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff could or should have appreciated the extent to which the deceased's judgment was affected, at a time when she could have done anything to minimise the risk of harm to herself. There is no evidence that the manner in which the deceased was handling the boat was in any way noteworthy or negligent until immediately prior to the collision. 

86Furthermore, even had she appreciated it, I do not have evidence that would enable me to determine whether the plaintiff asked him to go ashore to allow her to disembark, or pleaded with him to drive more slowly or to turn the lights on, or sound the horn. She may have done all, or none, of those things. He may have skolled a large quantity of wine immediately before performing the dangerous manoeuvre which led to the collision, at a time when she was powerless to stop him, or to extricate herself from the danger his conduct exposed her to. 

87For the foregoing reasons the first defendant has not discharged the onus of proving that the plaintiff was guilty of any contributory negligence. 

The defence of volenti non fit injuria 

88In order to establish this defence, the first defendant must prove the following three matters: first, that the plaintiff knew of the factual circumstances that were dangerous; secondly, that the plaintiff knew that these circumstances constituted a danger and that she was cognisant of the nature and extent of that danger; and thirdly, that she freely and voluntarily decided to risk that danger ( Negligence - volenti non fit injuria (1991) 65 ALJ 685). 

89In Carey v Lake Macquarie City Council [2007] NSWCA 4, McClellan CJ at CL, after summarising the authorities, put the integers of the defence that the defendant is required to prove in the following terms, at [85]: 
""1. That the plaintiff perceived the existence of the danger; 

2. That he or she fully appreciated it; 

3. That he or she freely and voluntarily agreed to accept the risk."" 

90Section 5F of the Act defines obvious risk and s 5G provides for a rebuttable presumption that a person who suffered harm is aware of a risk of harm if it was an obvious risk. The danger was that of being a passenger in a boat which was travelling at excessive speed at dusk in a waterway where there were inlets and promontories which impeded line of sight. There was an obvious risk of harm to the plaintiff in those circumstances. Since the plaintiff could not give evidence to rebut the presumption, the effect of these provisions in the instant case is that the first defendant has established the first two matters listed above. 

91However, there is no presumption that assists the first defendant to prove the third matter. Mr Newbrun was left to reiterate his argument that the plaintiff was a risk-taker and that the deceased tended to comply with the plaintiff's requests as a basis for an inference that the plaintiff, by remaining while the deceased was engaged in the dangerous driving on the boat, was the result of her free and voluntary agreement to the risk of harm, rather than any other reason. Such other reasons could include that she was unable to deter the deceased, and that she feared that the risk of harm of jumping out of a speeding boat would not necessarily be less than remaining in the vessel. 

92I find, for the reasons set out above, including those set out in relation to the consideration of contributory negligence, that the first defendant has not discharged the onus of proving that the plaintiff freely and voluntarily accepted the relevant risk. Accordingly, the defence of volenti non fit injuria fails. 

Liability of the deceased and the second defendant 

93For the reasons already given, I am not satisfied that there is any evidence of negligence on the part of the second defendant which implicates him in the collision. He simply happened to be the driver of a boat that was in the path of the deceased's boat when he performed the reckless and dangerous manoeuvre that led to the collision. 

94There is ample evidence of the deceased's negligence. 

95It follows that there will be judgment for the plaintiff against the first defendant, judgment for the second defendant on the plaintiff's claim and judgment for the second defendant/cross-defendant on the plaintiff's cross-claim. 

96Contributory negligence not having been established, there is no reduction of the plaintiff's damages on that, or any other, basis. 

The plaintiff's credibility 

97The first defendant submitted that I should find the plaintiff to be an unreliable witness. 

98Mr Newbrun spent considerable time cross-examining the plaintiff about her drug use prior to the accident. There appear to be two purposes to these questions: first, he wished to establish, as I have set out above, that she was a reckless risk-taker; and secondly, he sought to undermine her credibility. The difficulty with the latter purpose is that the source of much of his cross-examination were the plaintiff's own admissions about these matters to Dr Roberts, whom she had attended at the request of the solicitors for another party to the proceedings (against whom the deceased's cross-claim has been discontinued) for a medicolegal purpose. 

99The plaintiff was frank to Dr Roberts about her previous drug use, except that she did not disclose her use of heroin at the age of nineteen, although she disclosed it in her evidence. When asked to explain why she did not disclose it to Dr Roberts, she explained, in a way that I found to be both credible and understandable, that it was not something of which she was particularly proud. 

100The plaintiff was forthcoming in her evidence about matters which went against her interest. Although she acknowledged her disabilities, she did not appear to exaggerate them. She admitted that she could do most things for herself in Forster and that she was driving again. Indeed, it is possible that her evidence reflects a more positive view of her capacity, than is the fact. I note that Mr Cowell, her treating clinical psychologist, considered that ""she may have been putting on a brave front to make it appear that things were fine"". 

101The plaintiff's recollection was very vague about the day of the accident and the ensuing weeks and months, which is consistent with the serious head injury which she sustained. Otherwise, she gave her evidence in a straightforward way and appeared to have a relatively good recollection of past events and events from about two years following the accident onwards. 

Assessment of damages 

The plaintiff's circumstances prior to the accident 

102The plaintiff was born on 29 July 1962. She was, accordingly, 43 at the date of the accident, and 49 at the date of hearing. She has one child, a daughter Rachel, who was born on 30 August 1984. The plaintiff has brought Rachel up as a single parent. 

103The Plaintiff was in a violent relationship in her young adulthood. She gave evidence, which I accept, that she had an adverse emotional response to this relationship about 13 years ago, in 1998, which has been described as ""post traumatic stress disorder"". The disorder manifested itself in insomnia, nightmares, being ""jumpy at loud noises"", not liking people to be standing behind her and a tendency to imagine the worse case scenario as being the most likely scenario. 

104The plaintiff gave evidence that she struggled with this condition for some years before ultimately having herself admitted, about 9 years ago, to Jarrah House, a residential treatment facility for women. She admitted that she exaggerated the extent of her misuse of alcohol in order to obtain admission. The plaintiff considered this to be something of a ruse in the sense that she did not regard herself as being alcoholic, although she was, at the time, dependent on alcohol to assist her to sleep at night. 

105After she was discharged from Jarrah House, Prozac was prescribed for her. From that time until the accident, she continued to take 20 mg of Prozac a day. She described it as turning her life around, as getting her life back. She was able to obtain employment and sleep at night time. The Prozac also ameliorated the nervousness to which she had previously been subject. 

106The plaintiff continued to drink alcohol, which she initially described as 'social drinking'. 

107Prior to April 2004, she embarked on a 28-week ""Medical Terminology Office and Computing Course"" at TAFE, in the course of which she was trained to use a computer, in order to equip herself for a job as a medical receptionist. 

108In about April 2004, she started working as a medical receptionist at the Woolooware Medical Centre, which was about three minutes walk from where she was then living. She continued to work there until the accident for approximately 26 hours a week. She was paid at casual rates in that she was not paid when she was on holiday and had no long service leave. Her tasks included keeping records, attaching results to such records, answering the telephone, managing billing records and assisting the doctors with making sure that patients who were taking Warfarin were taking it at the right level. She gave evidence that the job involved dealing with emergencies and that no two days were the same. She considered that the job required a degree of flexibility on the part of the receptionist to deal with such situations as they arose. 

109She enjoyed the job and in particular ""the responsibility of it all"". She gave evidence that she would still be working in that employment but for the accident. 

110The plaintiff was a qualified gymnastic teacher and coach and had earned money from such activities, the details of which are not revealed in the evidence. 

111Her leisure activities included riding horses, skiing and going to the gym. 

112Prior to the accident, the plaintiff was living in a house she shared with her daughter Rachel, a close friend Deborah Harper and Mrs Harper's daughters who were aged about six and nine at the time of the accident. Rachel was 22. The plaintiff described herself as ""strong and independent"" and as having a lot of friends in Cronulla. 

113The plaintiff gave evidence that she was happy prior to the accident. She had returned from a holiday in Egypt three weeks before the accident. She had travelled on an organised tour but had not otherwise had a travel companion. She had been in an intimate relationship with the deceased for about ten months and thought that they ""had a future together"". 

Injuries and disabilities sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident and resultant treatment and operations 

114There is no real dispute between the parties about the plaintiff's injuries and disabilities. They are amply substantiated by the medical reports tendered by the plaintiff. However, the effect of these injuries and disabilities on the plaintiff's earning capacity and need for attendant care services are a matter of substantial dispute. The opposing positions will be referred to in my assessment of damages below. I propose now to set out my findings on the plaintiff's injuries and disabilities. 

115I am satisfied that the plaintiff suffered traumatic injury to the brain which caused a subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracerebral haemorrhage. She was in post-traumatic amnesia for two weeks after the accident. 

116I am satisfied that the plaintiff suffered the following multiple orthopaedic injuries to her body: skull fractures, fracture of the left orbit (fracture to the floor and medial wall of the left eye socket), multiple fractures to the face including fracture of the nose, fractures of both arms including a compound fracture mid shaft of the left humerus, injury to the left shoulder, fracture of the right acetabulum (hip joint), fractures of the pelvis, fractures to the left leg (a compound fracture of the mid shaft of the left tibia, and a comminuted fracture of the left fibula), and a fracture of the right heel and ankle (calcaneus fracture). 

117The plaintiff underwent several operations for these injuries including: open reduction and internal surgical fixation of the left humerus using a plate, open reduction and internal surgical fixation of the left tibia using a metal nail, repair of right acetabulum fracture, osteectomy of fractured right heel, plastic surgery on left tibia wound using a local flap of skin and a skin graft, closed reduction and skin graft of the fractured nose and debridement of the left leg and both knees. 

118When the plaintiff regained consciousness left peroneal compartment pressure syndrome was diagnosed and she underwent an anterior compartment peroneal fasciotomy cutting away the surrounding fascia to relieve the pressure on the affected nerve. 

119On 8 November 2007 a surgical excision of the spur of bone that developed over the fractured right heel was performed. This procedure was complicated with a pressure sore which became infected with extensive skin breakdown over the right heel. This required subsequent treatment and prevented the plaintiff from walking on the affected leg for an extended period. 

120In addition to multiple lacerations and contusions, the plaintiff suffered degloving injuries to her left leg and both knees in which extensive sections of the plaintiff's skin were torn off the underlying tissue. 

121I am satisfied that the plaintiff has suffered extensive physical and psychological pain and discomfort as a result of the tragic and traumatic circumstances of the accident and her multiple injuries. When the plaintiff regained consciousness she was informed that her partner had been killed in the accident. I accept that her partner's death exacerbated the plaintiff's post traumatic stress disorder. 

122The plaintiff was advised by Dr Deva, plastic surgeon, to have revision operations to ameliorate the scarring on her face and back as well as on the left leg, both arms and both knees. I accept that the plaintiff has been unable to afford to have these operations, despite her embarrassment about the prominence of these scars, but that, if her financial means permit it, she would have these operations. 

Residual pain and disability at the time of the hearing 

123The plaintiff fractured her skull in the accident and continues to feel itchy around the affected area, but because the itch is subcutaneous she cannot relieve it by scratching it. She has a blind spot the width of a matchstick in the vision of the left eye due to an injury to her left eye socket. 

124She had diplopia on the left side, which has resolved but for some period she had to tape her eye at night to stop the eyelid and the eye from drooping. The fractures to her nose have resolved. 

125She had multiple fractures to both arms. Her left arm is heavily scarred. She cannot carry any weight with her left arm and when she applies any pressure to it or uses it in any substantial way, she can feel the screws inside the arm. She cannot sleep on her left side because of injuries to the left shoulder. Her right arm has healed although her wrists are weak in both sides. 

126She fractured her right hip and pelvis. Her right hip still clicks from time to time. 

127Her left leg was degloved and has left her with considerable scarring, including a large scar to the left shin which measures approximately 15 cm in length and 6 cm in width. She continues to feel pain in her left foot and left knee, in part because of the pressure caused by the metal insert which goes from the knee to the foot. This partly explains why it is difficult for the plaintiff to carry anything heavy. 

128She fractured her right heel and ankle. She wears slip-on flat shoes to mitigate the effect of a lump on her right heel which is a bony prominence consequential on the malunion of her heel fracture. Although the spur was excised by surgery in 2007, she is still limited in the range of shoes that she can wear. 

The plaintiff's life after the accident 

129The plaintiff gave evidence that she had a lot of painful memories and had no energy in the aftermath of the accident. 

130She was in hospital for two months during which time she obtained assistance from her daughter and her friends, who brought food to the hospital and attended to tasks that needed to be done, such as paying rent for the plaintiff. 

131After two months she was discharged from hospital and went home to where she had been living prior to the accident. Both Deborah Harper and the plaintiff's daughter Rachel looked after her for the period of her recovery. Another friend, Joanne Johnson also helped. Rachel had intended to leave for London at around the time of the accident, but she deferred her departure for about a year so that she could look after the plaintiff. The plaintiff was in a wheelchair when she came out of hospital and was still on a blow-up mattress because it was softer on her body and the fractures she had sustained in the accident had still not healed. 

132During the first two months at home following discharge, the plaintiff needed assistance with transfers, toileting, clothing, bathing and cooking. 

133She gave evidence that she was ""a lot slower"" after the accident, that she cries every day and becomes confused. She is not happy to leave the house and she spends a considerable amount of time alone but the solitude makes her feel worse. 

134The plaintiff moved to Forster in October 2010 because she could no longer afford to live in Sydney on the disability benefit she receives by way of social security payment. She has not yet made friends in Forster, although one of her cousins lives in the vicinity. She has, however, arranged to join a bowling club and meet a woman she met there once a fortnight. She continues to take Prozac. She drives an old automatic Ford station wagon, which she uses to drive to her cousin's place, twenty minutes south of Forster. 

135From time to time, her cousin, and her acquaintances in Forster help her with domestic duties, but she largely manages these on her own. 

136The plaintiff does not engage in the recreational pursuits in which she engaged prior to the accident. She does yoga but finds it difficult to balance. 

137The plaintiff has not been in any paid employment since the accident. When she was in Sydney she did a single day's voluntary work at Sutherland Hospital, explaining the areas of the hospital to visitors. In the past two months she has done some voluntary work at Forster at the Kindy Gym which is run by the YMCA. She attends twice a week, for two hours on a Tuesday and two hours on a Thursday. She assists small children to play on the mats and beams. For example, she holds a child's hand while the child walks along a beam and makes sure that the children roll over on the big padded mats. She did not, however, consider herself to be reliable in her attendance. 

138She has not applied for a job because she has been unable to find a job which she considers she could do. She says that she would not be able to do her previous job because she does not trust her memory and could not be relied upon not to make mistakes. She cannot stand for long periods and if she is required to do so she tends to lean on one leg. She is not good at managing stairs and tends to panic on public transport. 

139She does not have a computer and has rarely used one since the accident. She has been taught to use a computer on a terminal in the Commonwealth Bank so that she can pay her mobile phone bill, and does so, albeit with the assistance of Bank staff. She principally uses her mobile phone to keep in touch with Rachel who now lives permanently in London. She does not have an email address. The plaintiff gave evidence that she tried to use the computer in the library but found it confusing because there was no one to assist her. 

140Her sleeping pattern is erratic. She generally wakes at four and, if she cannot return to sleep, she gets up and watches television and makes herself a cup of tea. 

141A friend, Joanne Johnson, has arranged for the plaintiff's rent and her electricity to be taken out of her pension every fortnight because the plaintiff is troubled by bills and anxious lest she forget to pay them on time. 

Damages for non-economic loss 

142The determination of damages for non-economic loss is governed by s 16 of the Act. 

143The plaintiff has undoubtedly suffered very serious injuries which have affected much of her body and her mental capacity. I accept the first defendant's submission that she has made a remarkable recovery. Her recovery, however, is far from complete. She has physical and mental disabilities which will continue for the rest of her life. She suffers from pain, discomfort and embarrassment as a result of her injuries. She has lost confidence in her mental capacity because of the brain injury. The negligence of the deceased has robbed her of much of her former feistiness, vigour, confidence and capacity. 

144She is at substantial risk of arthritis in several joints because of the traumatic fractures which she sustained in the course of the collision. Although she remains an attractive woman, she has been disfigured by scars on her face and her limbs. 

145Notwithstanding her injuries, and scarring, she presented as a confident and articulate woman who was willing to extend herself to the extent to which she could, and who wanted to be self-reliant, as she had been before the accident. It was these characteristics which make me more inclined to accept that her judgment of her limitations and of the effect of the collision on her life is substantially realistic. In particular, I accept that she will try to overcome the emotional difficulties which the collision has caused her, and that she will endeavour to engage more fully in the lives of those around her, but that it is unlikely that she will ever work again in a regular, demanding and responsible job. She continues to suffer from an inability to deal with the world in the way in which she did prior to the accident and regularly retreats into her flat where she remains alone. She does not like solitude, and has made some attempts to seek out the company of others. 

146The plaintiff contends that 50% of the most extreme case is appropriate. The first defendant contends that this figure is excessive. Neither counsel referred me to earlier decisions of courts for the purpose of establishing the appropriate award in the proceedings. I do not propose to exercise the power conferred on me by s 17A of the Act to refer to such decisions. In the exercise of my discretion I find that the severity of the plaintiff's non-economic loss is 50% of the most extreme case. 

147I confirm that the maximum amount for the most extreme case is $520,000. Accordingly, I award $260,000 for damages for non-economic loss in light of my finding that the severity of the plaintiff's non-economic loss is 50% of the most extreme case. No interest is payable on this head of damages. 

Damages for past economic loss due to loss of earnings 

148An analysis of the plaintiff's 2006 income return, being the last full financial year prior to the accident, shows that she was earning $460 per week, after deductions for income tax and Medicare levy. 

149The first defendant submits that the plaintiff could have returned to work about two years after the accident when the care she was provided by friends lessened. 

150The plaintiff submits that she will be unable to work again. 

151Although it may sometimes be the case that a plaintiff might not make attempts to find employment pending the resolution of proceedings for damages for negligence, it was not put by the first defendant to the plaintiff that she had adopted this approach. Nor do I detect any material in the evidence to suggest that the plaintiff has not explored such options as may be available. Her preparedness to work as a volunteer at the local YMCA does not demonstrate an earning capacity; rather it demonstrates an acknowledgement that she ought not put herself in a situation where she has to perform to standards of which she considers herself to be incapable of achieving. Medical practitioners whose reports are in evidence have noted the plaintiff's desire to return to work. I find that her inability to find suitable employment is a result of her injuries rather than any lack of motivation on her part. 

152The plaintiff underwent neuropsychological testing by Ms Flanagan in December 2007. Ms Flanagan considered her work tolerance to be very restricted and noted that she was likely to make an unacceptable number of errors even if she worked only a few hours a day. She underwent further neuropsychological testing conducted by Dr Roberts for medicolegal purposes on 7 June 2011. Quite properly Dr Roberts defers to medical opinion on whether the plaintiff has suffered any permanent neurological impairment. I do not otherwise find Dr Roberts' report of assistance since it is based on a history of substance abuse which is inconsistent with my findings. In particular, she appears to have based her opinion in part on the assumption that the plaintiff was a heroin user at the time of the accident. 

153I accept the plaintiff's submission that she was not able to work in the period from the time of the accident until the time of the hearing because of injuries sustained in the accident. I assess the plaintiff's loss of earnings for the past at the rate of $460 per week. It is 271 weeks since the date of the collision. I award damages of $124,660. 

154The plaintiff is entitled to interest on these damages under s 18 of the Act. I request that the parties calculate the applicable interest and bring in short minutes of order reflecting their calculations. 

Loss of past superannuation benefits 

155I have calculated this head by reference to 11% of the net figure for past economic loss. 

Damages for future economic loss due to the deprivation of earning capacity 

156I have recorded in the reasons above my impression of the plaintiff's prospects of employment. Although she is articulate and motivated, there are many obstacles placed in her path by the injuries she sustained in the collision. She is incapable of standing for long periods and therefore would not be able to perform work as a shop assistant, checkout operator TAB operator or in a hotel. She cannot lift with her left arm which substantially compromises her ability to lift larger or heavy objects and therefore she would be unable to perform a job such as store packer or even cleaner or child care assistant. Although she has no difficulty in sitting for long periods, her ability to remember and concentrate has been compromised by the accident, which would make her ill-suited for a job as a receptionist. She used a computer in her pre-accident job, but has rarely used one since the collision. It is possible that this gap could be improved by her doing a course of some sort, but I do not consider there to be any real prospect that this would result in remunerative employment. 

157Although I find her to be well-motivated, I do not consider that she would be an otherwise attractive proposition for an employer on the open labour market because of her disabilities. It is likely that her resilience and determination will lead her to do more volunteer work, which is less demanding and more flexible than jobs for which remuneration is paid. 

158There is some medical support in the reports tendered both by the plaintiff and by the first defendant in these proceedings for the plaintiff's having some ongoing earning capacity. For example, the first defendant relies on a report prepared by various experts under the auspices of the ""Vocational Capacity Centre"", the conclusion of which is that the plaintiff can work full time in a sedentary position. 

159However, the opinions to the effect that the plaintiff's working capacity has survived the collision, when properly analysed are subject to qualifications. For example, Dr Harris, the plaintiff's treating orthopaedic surgeon, opined in a report dated 2 July 2008 that since the plaintiff could walk (although not stand for any lengthy periods) she could be expected to be able to perform sedentary office work. Dr Burke, the orthopaedic surgeon relied upon by the first defendant, expressly qualifies his opinion about her work capacity by express reference to her brain injury. 

160I find that it is not the plaintiff's orthopaedic injuries which prevent her from doing such work: rather it is her mental capacity and the effect of the brain injury on her ability to remember and concentrate. 

161The first defendant submits that if I find there to be a loss of earning capacity for the future, I should find that the plaintiff would have worked until aged 65. The plaintiff submits that due to the change in pension entitlements, she would have worked to age 67. 

162The first defendant submits that it would be appropriate to award damages, if at all for the future, on the basis of a cushion of between $50,000 and $60,000, including superannuation. 

163The first defendant cross-examined the plaintiff to the effect that she enjoyed travelling and would not have worked consistently in any event in the future. However, I accept that the plaintiff had reached a stage of life where she was determined to have a regular and demanding job and take holidays only in so far as they fitted in with her employment. 

164My impression of the plaintiff is that she has a good work ethic and enjoyed the things that money can buy: a sports car, an overseas holiday, horses and so on. Furthermore her preference for living in Sydney and her relatively modest earnings before the collision, would have, in my view, on the balance of probabilities, resulted in her continuing to work as a medical receptionist. Since she worked in the order of 26 hours a week, I consider that she would have been willing and able, but for the collision, to continue in that employment until the age of 67 and continuing to earn at a rate commensurate with the rate of her earnings immediately prior to the collision. 

165I am satisfied, as I am required to be by s 13 of the Act, that these assumptions constitute the plaintiff's most likely future circumstances, but for the injuries she sustained in the collision. 

166Mr Goodridge submitted that there was evidence to support a market income for a medical receptionist of $495 per week, which is calculated by dividing the gross weekly market rate of $786 by 38, multiplying the result by 26 and then applying current tax rates. Mr Newbrun did not accept this calculation and contended, in a document sent to my chambers after the hearing had been concluded that the correct figure was $474, if one worked from the same gross figure used by Mr Goodridge. 

167Although I accept that the rates for part time work do not necessarily bear a strict mathematical relationship to the rates for full time work, rates for full time work include other benefits that are not included in casual rates and therefore would tend to result in a lower figure if the division is performed on them as I have set out above. This figure, $495, is less than 10% higher than the plaintiff was earning at the time of the accident in 2006. Accordingly, I consider that it is reasonable to assume that the plaintiff's loss for the future ought be measured by reference to $495 per week, irrespective of which party's figure as to the precise net income that arises from the current gross figure is correct, rather than $460 per week, which is the figure I have used for the plaintiff's loss for the past. 

168Accordingly I award $262,969 for future economic loss due to deprivation of earning capacity, calculated as follows. The multiplier for 18 years at a discount rate of 5% is 625. The net weekly earnings, for the reasons given above, are $495. A discount of 15% for the vicissitudes of life must also be applied. 

Loss of future superannuation benefits 

169I have calculated this head by reference to 11% of the net figure for future economic loss. 

Damages for past attendant care services 

170The plaintiff has particularised her need for care arising from injuries sustained in the collision by reference to various periods, which are set out in the table below. 

171The first defendant submits that the award for damages for past attendant care services should include no more than 14 hours a week of care for two years or 104 weeks. Mr Newbrun submits that the plaintiff has no ongoing need for care, and has had no such need since she moved to Forster. Contrary to this submission, I accept that the deceased's negligence has created a continuing need for care since the date of the accident and that the need for care will continue for the rest of the plaintiff's life. 

172The evidence corresponds with the plaintiff's claim for care while she was in Sydney, and accordingly my award of damages on this basis reflects the particulars, except in relation to the period from 12 January 2008 to October 2010. The particulars specified 10 hours a week for this period but the plaintiff gave evidence that she required 2 hours a day. I award the amount sought in the particulars for this period although the plaintiff's evidence could, on one view, have supported a higher figure. 

173Since the plaintiff moved to Forster in October 2010, her evidence is that she has needed 4 hours a week of assistance. Mr Newbrun cross-examined the plaintiff to the effect that she would not need as much help carrying the shopping upstairs if she lived on a lower level in an apartment block. He also put to her that she could cook, clean and iron for herself, a proposition with which she agreed. I do not regard this cross-examination as undermining in any substantial way the plaintiff's evidence in chief. She has achieved a substantial degree of independence and self-reliance; however, I consider that her remaining disabilities have created a need for care, which has been, since October 2010, of the order of 4 hours a week. 

174Accordingly I award damages for past gratuitous attendant care services as set out in the following table: 





Period 

Finding 

Award 


16 Sep 06 - 10 Nov 06 
(the period during which the plaintiff was in hospital) 

21 hours a week for 8 weeks @ $27 per hour 

$4,536 


11 Nov 06 - 10 Jan 07 
(the early recovery period after the plaintiff returned home) 

56 hours per week for 9 weeks @ $27 per hour 

$13,608 


11 Jan 07 - 11 Jan 08 
(the year after the early recovery period) 

35 hours per week for 52 weeks @ $27 per hour 

$49,140 


12 Jan 08 - 1 Oct 10 
(the period before the plaintiff's move to Forster) 

10 hours per week for 141 weeks @ $27 per hour 

$38,070 


2 Oct 10 - 29 Nov 11 
(the period from when the plaintiff moved to Forster, to the hearing) 

4 hours per week for 60 weeks @ $27 per hour 

$6,480 


TOTAL 


$111,834 


Damages for future attendant care services 

175The plaintiff's evidence was that since she moved to Forster she has prevailed on neighbours to assist her when required, but that she would prefer to pay for care, as long as she is living in Forster, rather than have to impose on people who are not close friends. Even if she returns to Sydney, as is her preference, she no longer wants to impose on friends. I consider her preference to be reasonable and understandable. However, although the higher rate of $35 has been particularised, the plaintiff has not adduced evidence that the cost of the provision of such care will exceed the amount allowable for gratuitous attendant care services under the Act. Accordingly, I propose to make the award on the basis that the plaintiff will be able to procure such attendant care services for $27 per hour. 

176The plaintiff's case is that she requires 4 hours a week for the future. Mr Goodrich submitted that this figure is necessarily a broad brush figure but covers periods during which she may be incapacitated by reason of future surgery or where she may be affected by arthritis as well as periods when her needs are less, but she still needs help with more strenuous physical tasks and carrying objects of any substantial weight. 

177I accept that the figure of 4 hours a week is a reasonable average approximation of the plaintiff's needs for the rest of her life. I accept that, in the plaintiff's circumstances, such care will not be provided gratuitously, although she has been able to rely on the charity of friends, well-wishers and Samaritans in the past, since her daughter Rachel left for England approximately a year after the accident. Accordingly I award damages at the rate of $27 per hour for 4 hours a week for the rest of the plaintiff's life, which, according to the table for Medium Life Expectancies, Australia, 2011, is 39 years, which gives rise to a multiplier of 909.9. This amounts to a figure of $98,269. 

Out of pocket expenses: past and future 

178The past out of pocket expenses have been agreed in the sum of $23,616. The plaintiff claims an allowance of $30,000 for future out-of-pocket expenses. The claim is made based, in part, on the possibility of future surgery. The plaintiff gave evidence that she has not had such surgery performed to date because she is not in a financial position to pay for it. The evidence of Dr Deva, which is unchallenged, is that surgery to revise her multiple scars could be done in two stages, at an approximate total cost of $25,000. In these circumstances, I make an award of future out of pocket expenses on the basis claimed by the plaintiff. 

Schedule of damages 

179For the foregoing reasons I award damages as follows: 





Head of damages 

Amount 


Non-economic loss: 50% 

$260,000

		05 December 2011",2011-12-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758341,RR v R [2011] NSWCCA 235,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ: On 14 September 2009 the appellant was arraigned before her Honour Judge Hock at the Newcastle District Court on the following charge: 

""That he on 22 March 2008 at [RT] in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with [MW], she then being under the age of 10 years. 

Section 66A Act No. 40/1900."" 

2Section 66A of the Crimes Act 1900 carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years, with a standard non-parole period of 15 years. 

3The appellant pleaded not guilty but was found guilty by a jury on 18 September 2009. 

4On 23 April 2010, the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of nine years to commence from 10 October 2008 and to expire on 9 October 2017, with a balance of term of three years to expire on 9 October 2020. 

5The appellant has appealed against conviction and sought leave to appeal against sentence. His appeal against conviction relies on two grounds: 

(1) Her Honour erred in allowing the prosecution to rely upon the appellant's denial as a lie evidencing a consciousness of guilt and, consequently, erred in giving a ""lies used as evidence of a consciousness of guilt"" direction. 

(2) In summing up, the trial judge failed to properly put the defence case. 

The evidence at the trial 

6Having regard to the nature of the grounds of appeal it is necessary, in my view, to consider the evidence placed before the Court at the trial, the closing by each of counsel for the Crown and the appellant, and the directions given by her Honour to the jury. 

7Primary reliance was placed by the Crown on the evidence of the complainant MW. In fact, she did not give evidence at the trial but rather a DVD of her evidence at a previous aborted trial for the same offence was played before the jury. 

8The evidence given by MW in chief primarily consisted of verifying a record of interview which took place between her and a Detective Senior Constable Aitken on the evening of 22 March 2008, the day the incident in question occurred. 

9During the course of the interview MW said she was playing hide-and-go-seek with the appellant's seven year old son, LR, at the rear of the appellant's premises. She said she went to hide in the shed, which she described as a room with a microwave, air-conditioner, PlayStation, TV, blanket, lounges, tools and clothes. She said the appellant was in the shed, that he was wearing bluey black pants and a shirt, and that ""there was a hole in his pants too when he did it ... where his rude part was"" (interview Q 144 - Q 148). She said he was standing in front of her and she was also standing (Q 230). She stated that he covered her mouth with his hand so she could not say anything, put a red blanket taken from the lounge over her head, told her to open her mouth wide and then put his ""rude part"" or ""doodle"" in her mouth (Q 90 - Q 230). In the interview, she said she knew that ""dick"" was another word for ""the rude part"" or ""doodle"" (Q 159), and circled where his ""rude part"" was on a diagram of a boy given to her by the police officer (this diagram was in evidence before the jury). She said that she had said no to the appellant but he just yelled at her and she had to do it (Q 175). She said that he moved it back and forward in her mouth for a little while (Q 179 - Q 181), and had his hands on top of her head ""tight ... Just holding it down"" (Q 235 - Q 237). She said that ""nothing came out of his doodle before he stopped"" (Q 201). When he stopped she asked if she could watch a movie with LR inside (Q 189) and he said yes (Q 202). She stated he said ""Don't tell our secret"", ""don't tell anybody"" (Q 137, Q 203). MW said she felt terrified ""Cause he did it""(Q 209 - Q 210). She said when she went with LR to watch the movie she then said ""can I go to mum first and then [LR] said yes"" (Q 202). She said she then went home and told her mother what had happened (Q 139 - Q 140). 

10During the course of the interview the following exchange occurred: 

""Q78 OK. So, can we make an agreement today to only tell the truth, to only tell what actually happened? 
A About [the appellant]? 

Q79 Yep, yep. Just tell, tell the truth. Can we make an agreement to do that? 
A He forced my head, pushed my head down, made me suck it. 

Q80 OK. 
A That's the real truth. 

Q81 OK. 
A I ... the words, ... mum ... going ... ..., say 'em. 

Q82 Yep. OK. 
A I said, I know the words mum."" 

MW's mother, LW, was not in the room at the time of interview. Defence counsel relied upon this exchange, particularly the words ""I know the words mum"", in closing to suggest that LW had coached or otherwise influenced MW's evidence. 

11In cross-examination she was asked if she had practiced what to say with her mother or anyone else before going to see the policeman: 

""Q: And before you went to see the policeman that night did you practice what you were going to say to the policeman? 
A: No. 

Q: Did you practice with mum or anyone else? 
A: No."" 

12In cross-examination it was suggested to her that she was playing with LR at the front of the appellant's house but she maintained she was playing at the back. She agreed that she often played hide-and-seek with LR, sometimes outside, sometimes in LR's house and sometimes in the shed. She agreed that on the day in question she was playing dirt castles with LR and got dirty hands and dirty clothes and that the appellant told her and LR to go inside and wash their hands because the rain was getting heavy. She agreed that thereafter she went inside to watch a DVD, but the power and lights were off for a time and then the lights subsequently came back on. She agreed that after the DVD started she said to LR she wanted to go home to see her mother. 

13Subsequently in her cross-examination she stated that she played hide-and-seek before she and LR washed their hands. She rejected the suggestion that the hide-and-seek game could have taken place on another day. She also stated that she was sure that the blanket she saw in the shed was a red one, not a blue one. 

14MW was then asked whether she recalled an incident which occurred on another day. She agreed she remembered playing hide-and-seek and on that day she was sitting on the appellant's lap under a red blanket. She said that she was not sure whether the blanket in question on that day might have been blue not red. She again, however, asserted that she was sure she was playing hide-and-seek on the day in question. At the conclusion of her cross-examination the following exchange occurred: 

""Q: [MW], nothing bad happened on this day, did it? 
A: I'm not sure. 

Q: Well you've told use that [RR] made you suck his doodle? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And you're only a little girl and I don't want to get you confused. Do you remember telling the police that? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: [RR] really didn't do that, did he? 
A: I didn't hear you. 

A: [RR] didn't really do that, did he? 
A: I'm not sure."" 

15However, in re-examination she was asked the following question without objection: 

""Q: Now at the end of my friend's question of you, he asked you - he said to you 'You told the police that [RR] sucked your doodle - [RR] made you suck his doodle' and you said yes. And then he put to you that he didn't really do that and you said you weren't sure. Now what did you mean by that? Are you saying to the jury that you aren't sure whether [RR] made you suck his doodle that day? 
A: He did."" 

16The appellant's mother LW gave evidence. She said that she and her family including MW lived across the road from the appellant and that on the day in question she gave MW permission to go to the appellant's premises and play with LR. 

17She said she was away from her house for about 15 minutes and she saw MW about 2 1/2 minutes after she returned. She stated that MW appeared to be white, scared, crying and angry and that she told her that ""[RR] made me suck his cock"". She said MW told her that: 

""she was playing hide-e-go-seek with [LR] and [LR] was counting and that she had asked [RR] where to hide and [RR] said 'You can hide here in the shed' ... She said that he had made her, he yelled at her for her to suck his dick and then she continued saying how he was making her, he was going back and forth motion. She told me that she didn't like it and I told her that what he had done wasn't right and that we would talk to the police about it and get something done about it. ... She told me that [RR] was standing in front of her, he told her to hide in the shed and to sit down on the lounge or chair that he had in the shed he threw a blanket over the top of her head, and then he did the back and forth motion and nearly made her feel sick ... I'd asked her where [LR] was at the time and she said she didn't know, that she'd just come straight home to tell me."" 

18She stated that she went to the appellant's home and that the appellant was standing in the doorway saying, ""I didn't do it. I didn't do it"" or ""I didn't know nothing about it"". She claimed she said ""That's not what my daughter's saying to me at the moment. She's come home in a hysteric mess and she's confused and upset and she's just told me that this is what you made her do"". She said that the appellant said MW had walked into the toilet while he was having a pee. 

19After this occurred she rang the police and told them her daughter had been sexually assaulted. 

20LW was then permitted to refresh her recollection from a statement she made on the date of the incident. She said having read that statement that MW said that the appellant was yelling at her while he was in the process of doing it to open her mouth wider and that he told her to keep it a secret. 

21LW was cross-examined extensively about the terms of the conversation that she had with the appellant. She agreed that as she approached him she said ""You, you bastard"" and that the appellant said, ""What have I done"". She stated that when MW came to her house she used the word ""doodle"" not ""rude part"". 

22She rejected the contention that RR did not say to her anything about taking a pee in the toilet. However, she agreed that after the appellant denied the incident she said, ""That's a load of crap she's in tears"" and that he said, ""That's not true, that's not true"" and ""I didn't do it. I didn't do it"". She agreed that her statement to the police did not talk about taking a pee in the shed but she denied that was a lie. She agreed that she spoke to MW about the incident after the police arrived and before the formal interview, but maintained that MW told her about RR ""making her suck his doodle"" before LW asked her about it. 

23In those circumstances, the critical challenges to MW's evidence were first that the appellant said to her ""What have I done"" rather than ""I didn't do it"" when he was initially challenged, and that she lied when she said that the appellant said to her that MW came across him when he was in the toilet in the shed. 

24The appellant's son LR gave evidence. In chief he said that he was playing dirt games and monkeys in a barrel with MW in the little patch of dirt in his backyard. He said at the time his father was either in the shed or standing in front of the shed. He said that when RR was in the shed he was sitting down. 

25LR said that at some point the appellant asked him and MW to go inside. They did and he (LR) put a DVD on, but MW said she would check if her mother was home. 

26In cross-examination LR did not accept that he was playing with MW out the front but repeated that they were playing dirt castles near the shed. He stated that the appellant told him and MW to go and wash their hands and after than that they had a go at hide-and-go-seek and then they put on a video or DVD. 

27He was asked about a previous interview in which he had participated and recalled that he had told the interviewer about a hide-and-seek in the shed and that he had found MW in the shed and under a blue blanket. He affirmed that it was his recollection that this happened on 22 March, which he recalled as the ""police incident day"" and the ""third day of Easter"", and that he found MW on the appellant's lap on her knees facing away from the appellant, under the blanket. He said he then had a go at hiding, she found him, they played dirt castles again, and then they went inside. He said that his dad's clothes were sometimes on the floor of the shed, and that when his dad came into the house after they had been sent inside, he had changed clothes. 

28The former de facto partner of the appellant gave evidence that the appellant kept his work clothes in the shed, that they were rarely washed, and often strewn about the floor. She said the complainant and her son, LR, often played in the shed. 

29A Detective Sergeant Lawson gave evidence. He attended the home of LW and MW on the afternoon of 22 March. He observed MW sitting with her mother holding her tightly. He recalls MW mumbling something and MW saying, ""Blanket over head"". He also recalled her saying, ""I couldn't see he yelled at me open your mouth"". The appellant gave Detective Sergeant Lawson permission to search the shed, which he did. He said the shed was untidy and contained a number of blue blankets. He stated in cross-examination that there were no red blankets there, and that on first arriving at the W premises LW summarised what she said MW had recounted to her, in front of MW. 

30A Mr Bruce, an analyst at the Division of Analytical Laboratories, gave evidence. He gave evidence that no testing was done on the blankets he received. Testing of semen was conducted on the complainant's dress but no semen was detected. 

31He gave evidence that DNA was recovered from a tape lift taken from the inside right front area of the appellant's jeans. He said that the DNA appeared to be a mixed profile that originated from two individuals, one male and one female. He stated that the female contributor had the same DNA profile as the complainant and the male contributor of the DNA matched the DNA profile of the appellant. A similar result was obtained from a tape lift taken from the inside left front fly area of the jeans. 

32Samples were also recovered from tape lifts taken from the outside right front area of the jeans and the outside left fly area. The DNA appeared again to be a mixed profile that originated from two individuals. The major profile was consistent with originating from the appellant and the complainant could not be excluded as the minor contributor. Mr Bruce said the most likely source of the minor contributor's DNA was a high yield source such as saliva, blood, semen or vaginal secretions. Three centimetre-square pieces of the jeans were taken from the inside fly area and tested for the presence of saliva, but none was found. 

33In cross-examination Mr Bruce agreed it was possible that the minor contributor to the DNA on the inside of the jeans could have deposited that DNA by touch, although it was more likely the source was a high yield source such as saliva, blood, semen or vaginal secretions. He agreed he could not say how long the DNA had been on the jeans. 

34The appellant did not give evidence but an electronically recorded interview between him and Detective Senior Constables Aitken and Cornes was admitted into evidence. 

35The appellant stated during that interview that he had come home from his work at the wrecking yards and saw his son LR and MW playing in the front in a mud puddle near the tap (Q 99). He stated that he was in the backyard trying to work out why the power had cut out (Q 101). 

36The appellant stated he did not take much notice of LR and MW until it started raining (Q 150 - Q 151) and then he walked around the front and told them to get out of the rain and wash their hands (Q 152 - Q 154). He stated that he probably went into the shed to grab some screwdrivers and to check the power board (Q 164). 

37He stated that when MW went home he was sitting on the front step. 

38The appellant was asked the following questions concerning whether either MW or LR had been in the shed that afternoon: 

""Q213 Whilst you were out in the backyard, did you see [MW] or [LR] out in the backyard? 
A Yeah, I told them to go and wash, wash their hands and that. 

Q214 OK. 
A 'Cause they were covered in mud and it was flogging down rain. 

Q215 Yes. 
A To get out of the rain. 

Q216 And whilst in the shed, did [MW] come in the shed at all? 
A No, not that I can recollect, no. No. No. 

Q217 No. 
A No. 

Q218 OK. So whilst, because, I've been informed that whilst, did [MW] and [LR], did they play any games like hide and seek? 
A Couldn't tell you. 

Q219 OK. So you didn't ask, say, for, for, for [MW] to hide in the, she could hide in the, in the shed? 
A No. 

Q220 OK. So, I've just been informed that [MW]'s gone into the she [sic] where you were standing. 
A No, no, no-one went into the shed this evening. 

Q221 Well it's this afternoon I'm talking about 
A Yeah. Well - 

Q222 When [MW] was there. 
A - yeah, well no-one's been in the shed."" 

39During the interview RR persistently denied the allegations against him. His denials are summarised in the concluding portion of his interview: 

""Q228 Where you were standing and, facing, facing her, where you've asked her to open, open her mouth. What can you tell me about that? 
A I can't tell nothing about it because it's something that never happened. 

Q229 OK. She said then what's allegedly happened, that she said, No, so then you've yelled at her, where you've asked, told her to open her mouth, which - 
A I don't even raise my voice to my own kids. 

Q231 Then after you yelled at her, she has opened her mouth where you've pulled your penis out from a hole in you jeans, so the fly of your jeans, and placed it in her mouth. What can you tell me about that? 
A I can't tell you anything, like, [LR], my son and her are thick as thieves. 

Q232 Mmm hmm. 
A And like wherever she is, he is. And like, you've got me at a loss, like - 

Q233 OK. 
A - [LR] spoke to his mother and, yeah, what. 

Q234 Yes. OK. I'll just finish off. And once, once you've done that, this is what the allegations are, that you've placed a blanket over her head and put your hands on top of her head, put, forcing her head down, and then you've moved her [sic] penis in and out -- 
A You're kidding me. 

Q238 Yes. OK. And then she's, you've told her not to say anything because it was, Our secret. 
A No."" 

40Prior to counsels' addresses to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor indicated that she was relying on the material from answers 216-226 of the transcript of the interview of the appellant, where the appellant denied that whilst he was in the shed MW was in the shed with him at all, as a lie evidencing consciousness of guilt; this amounting to a claim that he had no opportunity to commit the offence as alleged by the complainant. Counsel for the appellant responded that he did not think that he could be heard against the Crown in that regard, although he stated that the evidence as recorded was open to at least two interpretations. However, he said he could not oppose a direction concerning consciousness of guilt and, at least implicitly, that the Crown could rely on the evidence for that purpose. 

41Immediately prior to the commencement of closing addresses to the jury the trial judge said that she would not be ""canvassing the evidence in detail with the jury in summing-up so that the parties should take the jury to such parts of the evidence as they see fit."" There was no protest to this course. 

42In her closing address the Crown relied on the following matters as evidence on which the jury could rely beyond reasonable doubt. First, that MW gave credible evidence and was not shaken on any of the key elements of the evidence. Second, the fact that MW made immediate complaint, relying on the evidence of LW and Detective Sergeant Lawson. Third, that MW's evidence was supported by the evidence given by LR, and that when LR came into the shed trying to find MW he found her under a blanket with the appellant. Fourth, the Crown said the DNA evidence supported its case and finally, that the interview with the appellant was at odds with the evidence of LR and MW on key elements. She stated (T 10) that if the jury found that the appellant was untruthful on the key issue of whether he was in the shed with MW and MW was under a blanket, and the jury found that his denial was a deliberate lie told by the appellant out of a consciousness of guilt, it corroborated the Crown case that sexual intercourse with MW occurred. 

43Later in her closing (T 18-20) the Crown referred to questions 216-226 in the interview and said the jury could find those answers were lies arising out a consciousness of guilt. The Crown said, however, that the jury could only use that material in that way if they found that it was a deliberate lie, that it related to a material issue, that the motivation for telling it must be a realisation of guilt or fear of the truth and that it must be shown to be a lie by evidence independent of the complainant. 

44Counsel for the appellant in his address requested the jury to look at the whole of MW's evidence, saying he did not propose to quote large lumps of it. However, he made specific reference to that portion of the evidence to which I have referred above where MW said she was not sure if the appellant ""didn't really do that"". He also referred to the re-examination and to MW's denial that anyone told her what to say coupled with her statement ""I know the words mum"" and her lack of recollection as to what she meant. 

45So far as LW was concerned he pointed to the discrepancy in LW's evidence between her saying that after she confronted the appellant he said ""What have I done"" as compared to ""I didn't do it. I didn't do it"". 

46In relation to the evidence of LR counsel for the appellant made the following remarks: 

""Now the next witness to give evidence in that chronological order I was talking about, was [LR]. You might have noted that [LR] did not tell a story that might have come from his father. Despite his father telling the police that [MW] and [LR] were like - I'm using paraphrasing here, 'two peas in a pod', they were always together. You will recall that [LR] was not interviewed for some time. There is not one hint, not one suspicion that [RR] on returning home has gone and spoken to [LR] and said, 'This is what you must say'. [LR] has given his little boy version and you would not dismiss it. You would not be dismissive of any of it. You'd look at the contradictions to what is said by [MW], because they are important contradictions. 

[LR]'s evidence should concern you because in the important things, they are largely at odds with [MW]. My friend wants to have them mirror images. They are largely at odds with each other. [LR] says that they were outside playing dirt castles, then they played hide-and-seek, this is in the back yard. Keep in mind they were in the front and we know they were playing near the tap, but outside playing dirt castles, then hide-and-seek. He found her in the shed, both my client and [MW] were seated, was [LR]'s memory. [MW] was on his knee. He described in detail the blue two toned blanket you will recall. He then talked about another game of hide-and-seek in which he got to hide. Remember he talked about hiding behind the lounge. Then there were more mud castles. You're dirty, it's going to rain. They washed in the cat's water and went inside and there was a game of hide-and-seek inside where [MW] hid and hid in his sister's bedroom. Then they went to put the DVD on and [MW], before it started, [MW] said she was going home to check if mum was there. Hurry back he said, or words to that effect, was his evidence. And as she went, dad was sitting on the step having a smoke and she went past him to go home. Not that can't sit with [MW]'s version. It can't sit with a terrible assault. 

This is your life experiences, this is where your commonsense comes into it. If the crown's version is to be believed, [MW] was terribly assaulted, and then she played another game of hide-and-seek and then she played a game of dirt castles and then they washed their hands and went inside and then they played another game of hide-and-seek in the bedroom and then they put the DVD on and then she said she will go home. How does that sit with your life experiences and your commonsense? How does that sit with what you known to happen in the real world? It's not the way of these things. Commonsense might tell you say. Examination of the evidence would raise the doubt."" 

47So far as the DNA evidence was concerned, counsel for the appellant pointed out that Mr Bruce was not able to say how long it had been there, in what order it was deposited or how it was deposited. Counsel also pointed out that no saliva was detected, that MW's DNA could have been transferred by touch, that MW played in the shed often and that RR's clothes were often strewn about. He said: 

""You might be surprised if [MW]'s DNA was not on it, seeing the kiddies apparently played in there regularly. 

Certainly it's a shame that there's not tested for [LR]'s and others. Certainly a shame, which might give you great comfort if the inside leg for instance or either of these legs of these trousers had been tested and what say [LR]'s, or what say, what say [MW]'s DNA was found down the back of the calf somewhere... You don't know because the evidence is silent."" 

48In answer to the record of interview and in particular the questions relied on as evidence of consciousness of guilt, counsel for the appellant made the following remarks: 

""But let me put it to you that you have a look at what he said and have a look at the way he said it. Have a look at his demeanour, his presentation. He is, in my respectful submission, an open book. 'And whilst in the shed did [MW] come in the shed at all?' Page 18, question 216. 'No, not that I can recollect, no, no, no.' He'd just been finished asking about 'Did you go in the shed? You'd probably been in and out of the shed?' 'Yes, more than likely.' He's not saying, 'I didn't go anywhere near the shed.' He's the one that volunteers about urinating behind the shed but says 'No one walked in on me.' What a great excuse, what a great excuse, maybe that's where she got the seed of the idea of this terrible allegation. He's not looking to create that sort of lie."" 

49The trial judge, in her summing-up, referred to the evidence of Dr Bruce and stated that it was not challenged and, accordingly, ""unless it was unbelievable, you [the jury] would have to have a good reason to reject it"" (SU 7). In relation to the evidence of MW she emphasised that the Crown depends on her word and therefore it was necessary to look very carefully at her evidence. She referred to MW's evidence in chief and stated that counsel for the appellant relied particularly on the last question ""[RR] didn't really do that did he"" and MW's answer ""I'm not sure"". She also referred to re-examination by the Crown Prosecutor, who asked MW ""Are you saying that you aren't sure whether [RR] made you suck his doodle that day?"", to which MW answered 'He did"". 

50Her Honour noted that in his record of interview the appellant absolutely denied that he committed the offence. She also noted that there was a complete denial of the allegation that he was in the shed with MW. 

51After referring to this denial the trial judge again emphasised that the Crown case depended very heavily on accepting MW as a witness of truth. She then referred to other evidence which the Crown said supported MW's evidence, the first being immediate complaint. In this context she referred to the evidence of LW, but referred to the fact that counsel for the appellant suggested LW would not be accepted as a reliable witness. 

52Her Honour then referred to the evidence of LR. She stated that counsel for the appellant suggested LR's evidence did not support the Crown case. She said that counsel for the appellant had reminded the jury that LR said he found MW seated not standing, whereas MW said she was standing in her first account, and that LR's evidence was that she was under a blue blanket whereas the complainant's evidence was that it was a red blanket. She also referred to the fact that counsel for the appellant had reminded the jury that LR's evidence was that they had played other games before MW went home, and that if that was accepted it was inconsistent with MW having been sexually assaulted as she said. 

53In relation to the DNA evidence her Honour pointed out that counsel for the appellant had referred to the fact that there was no blood, semen or saliva found in testing by the laboratory, and the testing did not establish when the cellular material was placed on the jeans, how long it had been there, or how it came to be there. She also referred to the suggestion that it may have arisen from touching. 

54Her Honour then returned to that portion of the evidence said to establish consciousness of guilt. In that context she gave a direction consistent with what was suggested by the High Court in Edwards v R [1993] HCA 63; (1993) 178 CLR 193 at 210-211. 

55At the conclusion of the trial judge's address, counsel for each party were asked whether they wished her to add anything. Counsel for the appellant said that he did not require anything more to be said. 

56In their deliberations the jury had available to them the DVD of the appellant's interview of 22 March 2008, the DVD of MW's interview of that date, the transcript of the evidence of MW at the previous trial and a transcript of LR's first interview with the police. 

The appellant's submissions on the first ground of appeal 

57The appellant in his written submissions, in reliance on the decisions of this Court in R v Sutton (1986) 5 NSWLR 697 and R v Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234, submitted that it was only in rare cases that a lie told by an accused could amount to corroboration as evidence of consciousness of guilt. He submitted that whether the statement said to be a lie is capable of providing corroboration is a question of law to be decided by the trial judge. He submitted that only lies which suggest that the liar cannot give an innocent explanation of proved facts are capable of providing corroboration and that to amount to an admission of guilt the only reasonable inference from the circumstances must be that he knew that if he told the truth he would be found guilty. 

58At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the appellant focused principally on the evidence which was said to independently establish that the appellant lied when he said that MW had not been in the shed on the day in question, namely, the evidence of LR. She submitted that to establish that RR had lied the jury must have accepted LR's evidence, and if they had the jury would have to find RR innocent because what LR observed was inconsistent with what MW said occurred. She further submitted that if ""the evidence was capable of rationally bearing upon the proposition that the appellant lied about being in the shed, the question then was whether he was lying about being in the shed because of the fear of the truth of the complainant's allegations or whether he was lying because he was fearful of his son's observations."" She submitted that if there was an explanation consistent with innocence it was important that the trial judge put it to the jury. She relied in this regard on the decision of this Court in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52. 

59Counsel for the appellant conceded that the matters the subject of this ground were not raised at the trial. In particular she conceded that no objection was taken by counsel for the appellant to the Crown relying on the alleged lies as evidencing consciousness of guilt, or to the direction given by the trial judge on this issue. In these circumstances she accepted that r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applied. However, she asserted that the error amounted to a miscarriage of justice. 

The Crown's submissions on the first ground 

60In its submissions the Crown pointed first to the fact that counsel for the appellant at the trial neither objected to the Crown relying on the answers to questions 216-226 in the interview of the appellant as lies demonstrating consciousness of guilt, nor to the direction proposed by the trial judge. The Crown submitted that the direction in fact was beneficial to the appellant. The Crown submitted that the direction given satisfied the requirements of Edwards v R supra as adapted to the evidence in this case. 

61The Crown also submitted that leave under r 4 should not be granted, submitting that it should be inferred that the decision not to object to the use by the Crown of the lies as consciousness of guilt or to the direction was for sound forensic reasons, citing R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174, and that for leave to be granted under r 4 the appellant must show he had lost a real chance of acquittal, something which had not occurred in the present case. 

62The Crown in particular pointed out that at the time the appellant gave the interview containing the alleged lie his son had not made any statement and, therefore, the appellant had no knowledge of what his son would say. 

Consideration 

63As I indicated the appellant placed reliance upon what was said by this Court in R v Heyde supra in support of the proposition that the Crown should not have been permitted to use the answers to questions 216-226 as lies evidencing consciousness of guilt. In that case, Gleeson CJ, who agreed with Clarke JA, made the following comments (at 236-7): 

""If, by evidence or admission, it is proved that an accused person has told a lie, that is to say, made a deliberately false statement, in court or out of court, then, provided various conditions are fulfilled, the jury may regard the lie as demonstrating a consciousness of guilt and may treat the lie as corroboration. The conditions in question are discussed in various cases referred to in the judgment of Clarke JA including, R v Lucas, (Ruth) [1981] 1 QB 720. However, commonsense and ordinary human experience indicate that a judgment as to whether a lie reveals a consciousness of guilt, although one which people not infrequently make, may, depending upon all the circumstances, be very difficult. People tell lies for many reasons other than a consciousness of guilt. For example, a person may tell lies to escape a false accusation, just as a person may be put to flight by the threat of unjust arrest."" 

Whilst the conclusion of Clarke JA was to the following effect (at 246): 

""My conclusion is that there is only a very limited class of lies by an accused which are capable of constituting corroboration of the evidence of a prosecution witness. For my part I think that the most helpful test is that which emerges from Eade and that it is only lies which suggest that the liar cannot give an innocent explanation of proved facts, or that he is unable to account for what witnesses say they saw in any way consistent with his own innocence which are capable of providing corroboration."" 

64In that case Clarke JA at [244] suggested that both the primary facts (the statement said to constitute the lie and the fact it was a lie) and the inferred fact (that the lie demonstrated consciousness of guilt) must each be proved beyond reasonable doubt. However, as was pointed out by the plurality in Edwards v R supra (at 210), an admission constituted by the telling of a lie may be considered with other evidence, and for that purpose does not have to be proved to any particular standard of proof but may be considered with other evidence which as a whole must establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 

65R v Sutton and R v Heyde were decided before the High Court decisions in Edwards supra and Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 (on circumstantial evidence generally) and it is to Edwards and subsequent New South Wales cases, rather than to Sutton and Heyde, that reference should be made for the principles applying to lies as consciousness of guilt. 

66The circumstances in which lies can be used as evidencing consciousness of guilt, in my opinion, were correctly summarised by Simpson J in R v Lane [2011] NSWCCA 157 at [56]-[58]: 

""[56] The principles applicable to evidence of lies told by an accused person as evidencing consciousness of guilt were comprehensively spelled out in Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193. They had their origin in Reg v Lucas (Ruth) [1981] QB 720 as summarised (uncontroversially) by McHugh J in Edwards (although in a dissenting judgment as to their application). They are (I have slightly paraphrased): 

(1) the lie must be deliberate; 

(2) the lie must relate to a material issue; 

(3) the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth; 

(4) the statement said to constitute a lie must clearly be shown to be a lie by admission or by evidence; where evidence of the lie is tendered as corroboration of the evidence of a witness, the evidence showing that the statement is a lie must be from a person other than that witness. 

[57] In the joint judgment of Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, the following appears: 

'But not every lie told by an accused provides evidence probative of guilt. It is only if the accused is telling a lie because he perceives that the truth is inconsistent with his innocence that the telling of the lie may constitute evidence against him. In other words, in telling the lie the accused must be acting as if he were guilty. It must be a lie which an innocent person would not tell. That is why the lie must be deliberate. Telling an untruth inadvertently cannot be indicative of guilt. And the lie must relate to a material issue because the telling of it must be explicable only on the basis that the truth would implicate the accused in the offence with which he is charged. It must be for that reason that he tells the lie. To say that the lie must spring from a realisation or consciousness of guilt is really another way of saying the same thing. It is to say that the accused must be lying because he is conscious that 'if he tells the truth, the truth will convict him'. 

[58] Underlying the four propositions stated by McHugh J (and echoed in the joint judgment) is an initial proposition that is so obvious that it hardly needs to be stated (and usually is not). That is that the statement made by the accused said to be a lie is factually false or wrong. That a statement is factually false or wrong does not necessarily connote that it is a lie - that is what is meant by including in the requirements that it is a deliberate lie. (Where such evidence has been admitted for the stated purpose, it is always necessary that the trial judge give a direction drawing to the jury's attention possible alternative reasons that the accused person might have lied. That issue does not presently arise.)"" 

67In the present case the lie identified was that MW was not in the shed on the day in question. Having regard to the answers given by the appellant to questions 216-226 in the interview, there can be little doubt that that was what the appellant was asserting. 

68The second question was whether the jury could find it was a deliberate lie. The evidence was contrary to the evidence of MW and, more importantly, to that of LR. If the jury accepted that LR was correct when he said that he saw MW and RR in the shed that day, the jury could find the appellant was lying, particularly in circumstances where the denial took place on the same day that the incident in question was said to have occurred. 

69Counsel for the appellant placed great stress on what was said to be the inconsistencies between the evidence of MW and LR; the colour of the blanket, the position MW was in when found by LR and, importantly, that MW agreed that an incident of the nature of that described by LR had occurred on a different day. The latter matter formed the basis of the appellant's submission that if LR was believed the jury should have entered a verdict of acquittal. 

70In my opinion, it was open to the jury to accept the evidence of LR to the effect that he saw MW and RR in the shed on the day in question. It was, of course, a matter for the jury to evaluate the discrepancies in the evidence of MW and LR as part of their determination of whether the offence was proved beyond reasonable doubt. However, it was open to them to conclude that LR was correct in saying that he saw MW and RR in the shed on the day in question, whilst not accepting other parts of his evidence to the extent it differed from that of MW. 

71In the present case, the lie plainly related to a material issue, namely the fact that MW and RR were in the shed together on the day in question. 

72The fourth matter referred to by Simpson J in Lane at [56], namely that the evidence demonstrating the statement was a lie should come from a person other than (in this case) MW, was satisfied in the present case by the evidence of LR. 

73It follows in my view that the trial judge was justified in permitting the evidence to go to the jury as evidence of consciousness of guilt. 

74Thus far I have dealt with the matter without reference to r 4. Its effect was summarised by McHugh J in Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 as follows (at [72]): 

""There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the appellant's conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, a trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the appellant. Where the evidence was admissible, but the trial judge had a discretion to limit its use, the burden on the appellant is greater: the appeal can succeed only if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the discretion would have been exercised in favour of the appellant and that, if it had, it is more likely than not that the appellant would have been acquitted."" 

75Subsequent cases have established that the following matters are important in considering the operation of r 4: 

(a) The requirements of r 4 are not mere technicalities. The Court of Appeal Act 1912 does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which could or should have been raised at the first trial: R v ITA supra at [94], citing with approval R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; (2001) 123 A Crim R 310, 319. See also Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170]. 

(b) The appellant must establish that he or she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted: Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20]-[21]. 

(c) A failure by counsel to take objection or to raise an issue on summing-up may be explicable by the fact that he said nothing hoping to gain an advantage at a later stage, or that he took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, he saw no injustice as to what was being done: Germakian v R [2007 NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 at [10]-[13]; Sanchez v R [2009] NSWCCA 171; (2009) 196 A Crim R 472 at [62]. 

(d) An unexplained failure to take the point at the trial is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness and adequacy of the summing-up: Tekely v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [89], [130]-[133]. 

76Having regard to these matters, even if I was of the view that the trial judge was in error in permitting the evidence to go to the jury as evidence of consciousness of guilt, I would not have granted leave under r 4 as I do not consider that the appellant has demonstrated a miscarriage of justice. There was a significant body of evidence apart from the alleged lie on which the jury could have convicted the appellant. Most significantly, there was the evidence of the immediate complaint to LW and later to Detective Sergeant Lawson. There was also the DNA evidence which, although by no means conclusive, supported the Crown case. In these circumstances I am of the view that the appellant has not made out that there was a miscarriage of justice. 

The appellant ' s submission on the second ground of the appeal 

77The appellant submitted that whilst a trial judge does not have to summarise all the evidence given in a trial, it must put the defence case squarely before the jury. In particular he submitted that the appellant was entitled to a summing-up which would enable a jury from the terms of the summing-up itself to comprehend and understand the defence case: R v Veverka [1978] 1 NSWLR 478. He submitted that this obligation is not affected by s 161 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

78The appellant contended that the summing-up of the defence case was inadequate. The appellant submitted that the trial judge did not sum-up on the following issues: 

""the substance of the appellant's account; 

the support for the substance of the appellant's account that was derived from the complainant's cross examination; 

the support for the defence case that was derived from the cross examination of the complainant insofar as she agreed that what the appellant's son described occurred on another day; 

the potentially innocent explanation for the alleged lie if the jury were ultimately satisfied of the account of the appellant's son; 

that the appellant was not guilty of the offence as alleged by the complainant if the appellant's son's evidence was to be accepted; 

the important inconsistencies in the account of LR and the complainant. That is, the incident said to give rise to the sole count on the indictment could not have occurred if the interaction was as described by LR and 

the appellant's account of his experience with his daughters over the years and his disbelief at the allegation."" 

79The appellant detailed the relevant aspects of the evidence on which the trial judge failed to sum-up in the following terms: 

""4.1 The appellant accounted for his conduct on the day in question consistently and at length in the record of interview. None of the details of his case formed part of the summing up. Apart from LR's account of the game of hide and seek LR's account was entirely consistent with that of the appellant. 

4.2 It was the appellant's case that whilst he alone had care of the complainant and his son for a brief period on the day in question the complainant did not come into the shed with him. 

4.3 He said that the two children were playing in the yard, they were playing in the mud, it began to rain and he told the children to wash their hands and go inside. 

4.4 He said the children had asked if they could play in the shed but he told them they could not because there was no power either in the house or in the shed on account of a blackout. 

4.5 The power cut was confirmed by other evidence including the appellant's wife and from a report from the power company. 

4.6 After the children washed their hands they went into the house, he followed and went and opened the front door and had a cigarette. 

4.7 Shortly after the appellant said that they could not play in the shed the complainant went home. 

4.8 Before the complainant left the appellant became aware that the power came on in the house as his son was playing with the video. 

4.9 At no point did he raise his voice with the complainant. (This was supported by the evidence of his son) 

4.10 Albeit that no evidence was called as to the appellant's good character, the appellant raised his character in sofar as he asserted in his ERISP that 'he didn't raise his voice with his own kids' and 'like I've got two daughter of my own, one through a previous relationship and that, and kids ... associate with each other all the time and they sleepover and what not and, like I just cannot believe that allegation.' (No character direction was given or requested.) 

4.11 Whilst he was out the front of the house the complainant's mother came over swinging an axe handle around and she wasn't making sense. 

4.12 He denied having ever told the complainant's mother that the complainant had walked in on him having a pee. 

4.13 The appellant said that the complainant would come over virtually everyday to play with his son and they would spend a lot of time playing in the shed. 

4.14 The appellant did not change clothes and provided them to the police. According to the appellant's wife these work clothes were clothes that the appellant would wear for days and weeks in a row and were left strewn about in the shed. 

4.15 The appellant's son (LR) gave evidence that he and the complainant were playing outside, it began to rain, his father told them to wash their hands and they came inside. Later he said that he and the complainant played hide and seek in the shed whilst playing in the yard. 

4.16 LR described a game of hide and seek and he described that as having been played inside at one point during which the complainant hid under a bed (this was not the complainant's account) and that at another time he found the complainant in the shed, on his dad's knee under the blue blanket which is kept in the shed. 

4.17 Whilst LR's evidence was that a hide and seek game did occur on the day in question his observations were entirely inconsistent with the conduct alleged by the complainant said to have given rise to the sole count on the indictment. 

4.18What LR described of the hide and seek game was that: 

The complainant hid under a bed his sister's room; 

That he found her in the shed under the blue blanket; 

This happened right after we played dirt castles; 

The complainant was on her knees, on his dad's lap, crouching down, facing away from his dad and his dad was sitting on the lounge. LR lifted up the blanket and could see her. 

This account was entirely inconsistent with the crown case and incapable of constituting the event giving rise to the sole count on the indictment. The complainant's account made, inter alia, no reference to being found by LR nor the incident having taken place in circumstances where she was on her knees, facing away from the appellant and found by LR rolling onto the lounge. 

The complainant was facing the wall and not wearing shoes. 

The complainant accepted that the events as described by LR occurred on another day. This was of critical importance to the defence case because if this were so, there was no support to be found for the complainant's version in the evidence of LR. 

LR did not hear his father shout at the complainant in the manner described by the complainant at such time as they were playing hide and seek. It was the complainant's account that she could hear LR proximate to the shed when the appellant was alleged to have screamed at her more than once to 'open wide'. LR denied hearing this. 

4.19 It was the defence case that the hide and seek game as described by the appellant's son (LR) occurred on a day other than the date in question. This was explored with LR and he denied it. Clearly LR was not a witness who could be described as unreliable because of a motive to protect his father. It otherwise became apparent during the trial that LR was not aware of the nature of the allegation against his father. Importantly however the complainant was cross examined to the effect that this game, as described by LR, was played on another day and she accepted the same. 

4.20 What was significant about this evidence of the complainant was that it supported the appellant's case that the observations of LR were correct but that they occurred on another day. Moreover these observations were capable of explaining transference of DNA. 

4.21 In addition the complainant's concession significantly undermined the cogency of any argument that LR's evidence was capable of establishing that the appellant had lied in a material respect when he denied that the complainant had been in the shed that day. 

4.22 Moreover, accepting that the jury were satisfied that LR was describing an incident that took place on the day in question, the appellant's lie (established by the same) concerning the children being in the shed could not be regarded as material. Rather any reluctance to admit these events was a lie in an immaterial respect and incapable of constituting an admission to the offence. 

4.23 No reference was made in the summing up to the evidence that the complainant had had ample access to the shed which was otherwise capable of explaining transference of DNA. 

4.24 The appellant's wife described the appellant as flabbergasted over the allegations made by the complainant's mother. When she asked the appellant about what had occurred he said that 'They wanted to go in the shed' and he said to them 'You're not playing in the shed.' He told them to go inside and LR put a DVD on."" 

The Crown ' s submissions on the second ground of appeal 

80The Crown pointed to the fact that no objection to the summing-up had been taken by counsel for the appellant at the trial. To this it might be added that counsel did not demur when, immediately prior to the summing-up, her Honour indicated that she would not be canvassing the evidence in detail with the jury. The Crown in these circumstances relied on r 4. 

81The Crown accepted that the trial judge had the responsibility of putting the defence case fairly before the jury; however, it pointed to the fact that it was a relatively short trial and that the complainant's evidence comprised her video recording to the police and her evidence from a previously aborted trial. The Crown also pointed out that the record of interview of the appellant was played to the jury on the third morning of the trial (the last day of the evidence). As I indicated earlier (at [56]) the jury had available to them in their determination the DVD of the appellant's interview of 22 March, the DVD of MW's interview of that date, the transcript of the evidence of MW at the previous trial and a transcript of LR's first interview with the police. 

82In these circumstances, the Crown submitted, it was not necessary to identify and repeat the points made by the defence, and in particular relied on what was said by Wood CJ at CL in R v Davis [1999] NSWCCA 15 and R v Williams [1999] NSWCCA 9; (1999) 104 A Crim R 260. 

83Further, the Crown submitted that the trial judge properly put the defence case in any event. 

Consideration 

84In R v Veverka supra, Street CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, referred to the principle enunciated by Barwick CJ in Pemble v R [1971] HCA 20; (1971) 124 CLR 107, to the following effect: 

""Whatever course counsel may see fit to take, no doubt bona fide but for tactical reasons in what he considers the best interest of his client, the trial judge must be astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law. This involves, in my opinion, an adequate direction both as to the law and the possible use of the relevant facts upon any matter upon which the jury could in the circumstances of the case upon the material before them find or base a verdict on whole or in part."" ( Veverka at 480) 

He also emphasised (at 482) that a summing-up must contain an adequate presentation of the defence case to enable the jury from the terms of the summing-up itself to comprehend and understand what the defence case is ; See also CC v R [2010] NSWCCA 337 at [25]. 

85In R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 this Court stated (at 105): 

""A summing-up should, in every case, not only include directions as to the ingredients of the offence which the Crown has to establish and an explanation of how the relevant law may be applied to the facts of the particular case, but it should also include a collected resum e of the evidence which relates to each of those ingredients and a brief outline of the arguments which have been put in relation to that evidence"". 

In R v Tillot (Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 April 1991, unreported) Hunt J said that the trial judge's obligation to collect the evidence and the outline of the arguments applies to those ingredients (elements) which were in dispute at the trial (and not, as Zorad might suggest, every element of the offence). Similarly, in Condon v R (1995) 83 A Crim R 335 the Court emphasised (at 347) that the task of the trial judge is not merely to give formal directions of law as to the legal elements of the offence, but to explain to the jury the application of these elements to the respective cases of the Crown and the accused. 

86The application of these principles does not mean that the trial judge is obliged to summarise all the events at the trial. So much is made clear by s 161 of the Criminal Procedure Act . In R v Williams supra, Wood CJ at CL, with whom Spigelman CJ and McInerney J agreed, made the following observation as to the application of these principles in short, single issue trials: 

""[42] His Honour went into no greater depth in dealing with the prosecution case. In a single issue trial as short as this, when the summing-up concluded within a morning and followed immediately upon the address of defence counsel, I am unconvinced that it was necessary for the trial judge to have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the kind that the appellant now contends for. His Honour's assessment of the position was made evident by the observation as to the eloquence of the defence submissions concerning the complainant's credibility, which he said would 'still be ringing' in the jury's ears. 

[43] The common sense and intelligence of the jury requires respect, as does the experience of trial counsel who, in this case, expressly stated that he did not require any further direction or redirection. 

[44] I am unpersuaded that in a short trial, where the focus was on the complainant's credibility, anything would have been achieved by yet another restatement of that issue or of the points made either by the Crown or by the defence. The position is likely to be otherwise in a complex and lengthy trial, to which the observations in Domican are particularly apposite. It would also have been otherwise had the trial judge here undertaken, for example, a detailed analysis of the Crown case and then dismissed the defence case in short terms. What is required is a fair balance when any excursion into the issues and evidence is undertaken. Again I am of the view that leave should be refused to argue this ground under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules . 

[45] Without wishing to labour the point which has now been made many times, I would repeat the observations that I made in PAH concerning the need for trial counsel, among whom I include both the Crown Prosecutor and defence counsel, to be vigilant in ensuring that any necessary directions or redirections are sought at trial. A clear risk of a miscarriage of justice will need to be identified, before this Court would intervene, where complaint has not been made at the trial. Particularly is that the case in relation to those matters which are well recognised as potentially calling for warnings."" 

87His Honour made similar observations in R v Davis supra (at [24]): 

""Where the summing-up in a short trial has followed hard on the heels of a defence address, particularly where the appellant has not offered any evidence, very little is likely to be achieved by a reiteration of the evidence or of the points made by counsel in their closing addresses. To so require would be to credit the jury with little in the way of intelligence or common sense. An exercise of judgment is always required, on the part of the trial judge, to frame the summing-up in a way that is helpful to the jury. To elevate the observations in RJC and Zorad to a requirement that, in every case, regardless of its length or complexity, the trial judge must identify and repeat the points made by defence counsel, the relevant evidence, would be to go too far. Counsel should be expected to contribute in this regard, and to disclose whether they seek more, by way of summary [of] the evidence and of the submissions, than the judge proposes."" 

88The fundamental task of the trial judge is to ensure that the accused has a fair trial. The position was summarised by the plurality of the High Court in RPS v R [2000] HCA 3; (2000) 199 CLR 620 in the following terms (citations omitted): 

""[41] Before parting with the case, it is as well to say something more general about the difficult task trial judges have in giving juries proper instructions. The fundamental task of a trial judge is, of course, to ensure a fair trial of the accused. That will require the judge to instruct the jury about so much of the law as they need to know in order to dispose of the issues in the case. No doubt that will require instructions about the elements of the offence, the burden and standard of proof and the respective functions of judge and jury. Subject to any applicable statutory provisions it will require the judge to identify the issues in the case and to relate the law to those issues. It will require the judge to put fairly before the jury the case which the accused makes."" 

89The extent that the requirement of a fair trial will involve a detailed analysis of the evidence will depend, as was pointed out in R v Williams supra and R v Davis supra, on the particular circumstances of the trial. 

90In the present case the trial was short and the jury had most of the evidentiary material available to them in the jury room. Further, counsel did not complain as to the course adopted. These matters, although by no means decisive, do point to the fact that the appellant received a fair trial. 

91The appellant's complaints can be divided into four categories. The first is that the trial judge failed to adequately refer to the evidence of LR. I have set out in some detail (at [46] above) the remarks made by counsel for the appellant on that evidence in his address to the jury. He emphasised the inconsistency with the evidence of MW, referring in particular to LR stating that he found MW on the appellant's knee and the description of the blue blanket in detail. He pointed out in his address that LR's evidence of what occurred after MW left the shed was inconsistent with an assault of the nature of that alleged. The trial judge in her summing-up referred to each of these matters. The fact that she did not refer in detail to the evidence which supported these submissions does not seem to me of great significance in circumstances where the jury had very recently heard it. 

92In these circumstances, it seems to me that the trial judge fairly put the appellant's case to the jury on this issue. 

93The second category which is related to the first is that the trial judge did not deal specifically with the complainant's evidence that the events described by LR occurred on another day, and that this was capable of explaining the transfer of the DNA. This evidence must be considered in the context that the defence case at trial was that the events described by LR occurred on the day in question and that that evidence should have led the jury to have reasonable doubt as to MW's version of the events. The appellant having sought to make use of the evidence in that way cannot, in my opinion, complain of an absence of a fair trial because of the failure of the trial judge to put to the jury a version of the events on which he was not relying: See Darwiche v R supra. 

94The third category of evidence is the appellant's record of interview. That was the last piece of evidence the jury saw and heard and the jury had a copy of the DVD. Counsel for the appellant emphasised that the jury should look at what he said and how he said it. Her Honour noted the appellant's absolute denial of the offence. In these circumstances, it was not necessary, in my opinion, for the trial judge to go through the aspects of the evidence of the appellant's interview referred to in pars 4.2-4.14 of the appellant's submissions referred to above, particularly when no particular reliance was placed on this evidence by counsel who appeared for the appellant in the court below. 

95The fourth category was the evidence of the appellant's wife to the effect that the appellant was flabbergasted at the complaint and that the appellant wore his work clothes for days and weeks in a row and they were left strewn about the shed. (See pars 4.14 and 4.24 of the submissions referred to above.) No reliance was placed on this evidence by counsel for the appellant and it does not seem to me that a failure to refer to it deprived the appellant of a fair trial. 

96In these circumstances, ground 2 of the grounds of appeal has not been made out. 

97Thus far I have dealt with the matter without reference to r 4. However, having regard to the course of the trial and the matters to which I referred when I considered the application of this rule in respect of the first ground of appeal (see at [76]) it does not seem to me that there was any substantial miscarriage of justice. In those circumstances, I would not grant leave under r 4 to raise this ground of appeal. 

98It follows that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 

The application for leave to appeal against sentence 

99The sole ground of appeal against sentence was that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. It was not suggested that the trial judge made any errors in her approach to sentencing. 

The remarks on sentence 

100In her remarks on sentence the trial judge set out the facts as summarised above. She had regard to the victim impact statement and noted that the offence had had a very serious effect on the child MW and her relationship with both adults and other children. 

101Her Honour stated that in assessing the objective gravity of the offence she took into account that it was isolated and opportunistic and that the form of sexual intercourse was enforced fellatio rather than penile/vaginal intercourse. She noted MW was only five years old at the time of the offence and that the younger the child the more serious the offence. She noted the offender was informally in a position of responsibility towards the complainant. In these circumstances she found that the offence was moderately below the mid-range of objective gravity. 

102So far as the subjective circumstances of the appellant were concerned, she noted that the appellant was 47 years old at the time of sentencing (46 at the time of the offence), that he had left school at 14, and could read and write but not well. Her Honour noted that he had four children from his first long term relationship and four from the relationship he was in at the time of his offence. She noted that the latter group of children were taken into care by the Department of Community Services in October 2009. 

103Her Honour noted that the offender had a history of heart disease, having stents inserted in 2009, and had also had a stroke which affected his left leg and his mobility. He had abused amphetamines for many years and his intellectual functions were found to be borderline to extremely low. Her Honour also noted that he had apparently suffered a head injury in custody some years before which led to memory problems and possibly changes in his personality. 

104Her Honour noted that he had a relatively minor criminal history including convictions for drug offences, driving offences and dishonesty offences but no prior history of sexual assault matters. 

105Her Honour found that the prospects for rehabilitation appeared to be reasonable and would be enhanced by his participation in a suitable programme for sex offenders. 

The appellant ' s submissions 

106In his written submissions the appellant contended that the sentence was manifestly excessive. In support of this ground he relied by comparison on three cases. The first of these was Eedens v R [2009] NSWCCA 254. In that case the appellant was sentenced by the sentencing judge to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of nine years and a balance of term of three years for an offence under s 66A of the Crimes Act involving fellatio with a nine year old girl. A similar offence with an eight year old was taken into account on a Form 1, whilst an offence under s 66C(1) involving a similar incident with a 13 year old was also taken into account. The sentence was arrived at after a 25 percent discount for early plea. 

107On appeal, this Court found error and proceeded to resentence. The Court found the offence was significantly below the mid-range of objective seriousness and taking into account the offences on the Form 1, sentenced the offender to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of six years and two months, with a balance of term of two years and one month. Removing the 25 percent discount for the early plea this translated into a head sentence of 11 years and a non-parole period of eight years and three months. There were no significant mitigating factors to distinguish that case from the present case. 

108The second case on which reliance was placed was the decision of this Court in R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575. That was a Crown appeal involving forced fellatio with a strong subjective case. It was held (at [27]) that the offence fell somewhere below the mid-range of an offence under s 66A. The Court took into account an additional offence of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act and imposed a sentence of a non-parole period of two and a half years with a balance of term of two and a half years. Removing the discount of 25 percent for the early plea, this translates into a head sentence of six years and eight months with a non-parole period of three years and four months. 

109The third case on which reliance was placed was another Crown appeal R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172. This involved six offences against one child, three of them being offences of having sexual intercourse contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act , with three being offences of indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2) . Fullerton J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, accepted that it was reasonably open to the sentencing judge to find that the three offences under s 66A fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of that nature (at [38]) but that the acts of indecent assault were in the mid-range and well above the lower end of that range (at [40]). Her Honour imposed a total term of nine years with an effective non-parole period of seven years and six months. In respect of the individual offences under s 66A her Honour imposed three concurrent terms of nine years with a non-parole period of six years. 

The Crown submissions 

110The Crown pointed to the maximum term for the offence and to the standard non-parole period. The Crown submitted that her Honour was entitled to be cautious about the appellant's rehabilitation prospects and that the appellant's previous criminal history did not entitle him to leniency. The Crown pointed to the age of the child, the fact that the offence involved a gross breach of trust and the impact on the victim. The Crown submitted that the sentence was not manifestly excessive. 

Consideration 

111The fact that the sentence may be thought to be severe does not mean that it was manifestly excessive. In asserting that the sentence was manifestly excessive the appellant, in effect, is asserting that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: See House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. Put another way, it must be concluded that the length of the sentence is such that there was some misapplication of principle even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons: See Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [58]; Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [58]-[59], [75]-[76]. 

112In considering whether or not a sentence is manifestly excessive, it is important to bear in mind what was said by Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [6]: 

""Manifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion. A sentence is, or is not, unreasonable or plainly unjust; inadequacy or excess is, or is not, plainly apparent. It is a conclusion which does not depend upon attribution of identified specific error in the reasoning of the sentencing judge and which frequently does not admit of amplification except by stating the respect in which the sentence is inadequate or excessive. It may be inadequate or excessive because the wrong type of sentence has been imposed (for example, custodial rather than non-custodial) or because the sentence imposed is manifestly too long or too short. But to identify the type of error amounts to no more than a statement of the conclusion that has been reached. It is not a statement of reasons for arriving at the conclusion. A court of criminal appeal is not obliged to employ any particular verbal formula so long as the substance of its conclusions and it reasons is made plain. The degree of elaboration that is appropriate or possible will vary from case to case."" 

113In the present case it is not in dispute that her Honour was entitled to find that the offence was moderately below the mid-range of objective gravity for the offence and to take into account the objective and subjective factors to which I have referred. The question is whether, taking these factors into account along with the maximum term of imprisonment for the offence and the standard non-parole period, the sentence was manifestly excessive. 

114In my opinion, a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of nine years was manifestly excessive. Although, as I indicated, the maximum term of imprisonment and the standard non-parole period for a contravention of s 66A indicates the gravity of the offence, the sentence seems to be disproportionate to an appropriate sentence for an isolated offence, but rather one more appropriate for significantly more serious or consistent criminality. 

115Her Honour described the offence as isolated and opportunistic. She also found that the offence was moderately below the midrange of objective gravity. Further, although the offence was a serious one against a five year-old child, her Honour noted it involved enforced fellatio rather than penile/vaginal intercourse. It seems to me in those circumstances that a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of nine years is one which is unreasonable and unjust. It is true this followed a plea of not guilty and there was absence of any remorse. Against this it must be remembered that her Honour found that the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable. 

116It is evident that in imposing a sentence on the appellant the sentencing judge took into account the standard non-parole period as a reference point. Having regard to the state of the law as then perceived (see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168) she was justified in doing so. However, as the High Court has subsequently pointed out in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154 at [31] the standard non-parole period is not the starting point for sentencing for a midrange offence after conviction. 

117Her Honour in sentencing stated that she had been referred to a number of cases by the Crown and considered that R v AJP supra and Eedens v R supra were apposite to the present case. 

118A long line of authorities caution the use of sentencing statistics or simple sentence comparison when determining the outcome of a sentence appeal. In R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368, Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Allen J and Loveday AJA agreed) said: 

""It is quite wrong to compare the sentence under challenge directly with that imposed upon another offender (who is not a co-offender) simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. What must be looked at is whether the challenged sentence is within the range appropriate to the objective gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender, and not whether it is more severe or more lenient than some other sentence (other than that of a co-offender) which merely forms part of that range. As Mason J said in Lowe (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 612: 

'The reference to an appropriate sentence is apt to be misunderstood. Generally speaking, a sentence within a limited range of years is appropriate to the circumstances in which the offence was committed and to the character, antecedents and conditions of the offender.'"" 

119In R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247; (2004) 149 A Crim R 38 at [48], the Court held that, at the most, ""other cases can do no more than become part of a range for sentencing"" (see also R v Araya [2005] NSWCCA 283; 155 A Crim R 555), and in Hili v R; Jones v R supra, French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ said (at [54]): 

""In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa ( [2010] NSWCCA 194) , Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: 'Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts.' But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix 'the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence'. Past sentences 'are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence '. When considering past sentences, 'it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned'."" (emphasis as added in Hili v R. ) 

120It is therefore necessary to exercise caution when considering the submissions of the appellant that his sentence is manifestly excessive when compared against other offenders' sentences for the same offence. Nevertheless, such cases ""can, and should"" provide a yardstick against which this Court may examine MRW's sentence, and help to establish a ""limited range of years appropriate to the circumstances in which the offence was committed"", particularly where care has been taken to note the subjective circumstances in which the offences subject of comparison were committed, and the character, antecedents and conditions of the respective offenders. 

121Each of the cases referred to in the appellant's submissions involved either offences against a number of children ( Eedens, AJP ) or multiple offences against a single child ( PGM ). The sentence in the present case was significantly higher than the sentences imposed in AJP and PGM and higher than that in Eedens . To the cases referred to by the appellant there can be added R v HJWG [2011] NSWCCA 50, where an aggregate non-parole period of eight years with a balance of term of three years (after allowing for a 25 percent discount for plea) was ordered for one count of aggravated indecent assault on a child under 10 years in contravention of s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act, two counts of aggravated indecent assault in contravention of s 61M(1), and one count of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 (digital penetration) in contravention of s 66A. The sentence was described by the Court of Criminal Appeal in that case as severe but not manifestly excessive having regard to the standard non-parole period. The actual sentence for the contravention of s 66A was a non-parole period of six years with a balance of term of three years. 

122Her Honour gave no explanation as to why she imposed a sentence significantly higher than the sentence imposed in AJP supra (where, on a Crown appeal following a guilty plea for an act of fellatio on an eight year old, the sentence was increased to a head sentence of five years with a non-parole period of two years and six months) or Eedens supra. 

123Having regard to those matters, in my opinion, the sentence in the present case was manifestly excessive and it is necessary to resentence the appellant. 

124There is no dispute that the offence was moderately below the mid-range or that the subjective factors taken into account by her Honour were matters which could be taken into account. In addition, we have been furnished with three affidavits concerning the appellant's current position. They demonstrate that the appellant has sought to engage in educational programmes including a literacy course. They also indicate the appellant is having continuing difficulty with his health and since his imprisonment has had a mild stroke resulting in numbness in his left arm and has contracted a minor case of Hepatitis C. These are subjective factors which, in my opinion, can be taken into account in considering the appropriate sentence. 

125Although, in my opinion, the sentence was manifestly excessive, the offence was a serious one and warrants a significant term of imprisonment. Taking into account the findings of the trial judge, the maximum term of imprisonment, the standard non-parole period for the offence and the matters referred to in par [115] I am of the opinion that the appropriate sentence is one of eight years with a non-parole period of six years. 

126In these circumstances I would make the following orders: 

(1) Appeal against conviction dismissed. 

(2) Grant leave to appeal against sentence and allow the appeal. 

(3) Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court and in lieu thereof sentence the appellant to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 6 years with a balance of term of 2 years. The sentence is to date from 10 October 2008 and the appellant is eligible to be released on parole on 10 October 2014. 

127JAMES J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of the Chief Justice and the judgment of Johnson J. On the conviction appeal I agree with the judgment of the Chief Justice. On the sentence appeal I agree with the judgment of Johnson J. 

128JOHNSON J : I have had the advantage of reading the draft judgment of the Chief Justice. I agree with his Honour's reasons and proposed orders concerning the conviction appeal. 

129I regret to say that I have reached a different conclusion with respect to the sentence appeal. In my view, the ground of appeal concerning sentence has not been made out. Although leave to appeal against sentence should be granted, the appeal ought be dismissed. I should explain why I have reached this conclusion. 

130With due respect to the Chief Justice, I do not agree with his Honour's approach to determining the ground of manifest excess. Further, upon application of the appropriate principles, I do not consider that the ground has been established. 

131The experienced sentencing Judge in this case was undertaking a discretionary task in sentencing the Appellant after trial. As the High Court has stressed, sentencing involves a process of instinctive synthesis: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 373 [26]. 

132Of course, that process is not undertaken in a statutory vacuum. The maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period are "" two legislative guideposts "" which a sentencing Judge must take into account: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154 at 1162 [27]. The maximum penalty for an offence under s.66A Crimes Act 1900 is imprisonment for 25 years and the standard non-parole period is one of 15 years. 

133As the Chief Justice has observed at [101] and [113], the sentencing Judge here found that the offence was moderately below the mid-range of objective gravity and this finding was not challenged on appeal. No other finding of the sentencing Judge is challenged on appeal. 

134A number of sentencing decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal for sexual assault offences against children, including offences under s.66A Crimes Act 1900, were placed before the sentencing Judge and were referred to in her Honour's remarks on sentence. The Chief Justice refers to these decisions in his judgment. 

135This Court has observed that where a sentencing court is provided with other sentencing decisions, it is important that the purpose for which the information is provided be identified and kept in mind: Van Haltren v R [2008] NSWCCA 274; 191 A Crim R 53 at 77-79 [73]-[81]; R v Dinh [2010] NSWCCA 74; 199 A Crim R 573 at 583-584 [60]. 

136In the passage cited by the Chief Justice at [119], the High Court in Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 537 [54] referred with approval to the statements of Simpson J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 243 FLR 28 at 98 [303]-[305], concerning the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. 

137The Chief Justice refers as well to a long and consistent line of authority in this Court which disapproves of a manifest excess ground being argued by reference to a few sentencing decisions. These many cases include R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371; R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247; 149 A Crim R 38 at 47 [48]; R v Araya [2005] NSWCCA 283; 155 A Crim R 555 at 567 [69]-[70]; Han v R [2009] NSWCCA 300 at [32]-[39] and Stock v R [2011] NSWCCA 49; 206 A Crim R 574 at 587-588 [48]. 

138The High Court has said, with respect to consistency of sentencing, that what is sought is consistency in the application of relevant legal principles, not some numerical or mathematical equivalent: Hili v The Queen at 527 [18], 535 [48]. 

139At [114], the Chief Justice expresses the opinion that the sentence in this case was manifestly excessive. His Honour expresses the view that the sentence "" seems to be disproportionate to an appropriate sentence for an isolated offence"" but was ""rather one more appropriate for significantly more serious or consistent criminality "". 

140His Honour then refers to sentences imposed in R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575, Eedens v R [2009] NSWCCA 254, R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172 and HJWG v R [2011] NSWCCA 50. It should be observed at once that AJP and PGM were both Crown appeals so that resentencing of the offenders in those cases by this Court would have involved a measure of restraint. 

141His Honour observes that the sentencing Judge was referred to Eedens , AJP and PGM . The Chief Justice at [117] notes that the sentencing Judge said that the decisions in AJP and Eedens were apposite to the present case. At [122], his Honour notes that the sentencing Judge gave no explanation as to why she imposed a sentence significantly higher than the sentence imposed in AJP or Eedens . 

142It is appropriate to set out that part of her Honour's remarks on sentence which refers to AJP and Eedens (ROS4): 

"" I have been referred to a number of cases by the Crown prosecutor. They are set out in the Crown's written submissions and I will not record all of them in these remarks. I have, however, read the cases and considered them carefully, in particular, R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434 and Eedens v R [2009] NSWCCA 254 which are apposite to this particular case "". 

143Her Honour then proceeded in a manner which sheds light upon the way in which the authorities were used on sentence (ROS4-5): 

"" In assessing the objective gravity of the offence, I have taken into account that it was isolated and opportunistic and that the form of sexual intercourse was enforced fellatio rather than penile-vaginal intercourse. While age is an element of this offence, this child was extremely young, only five years old and the range for such an offence under s.66A is up to ten years. The authorities make clear, the younger the child the more serious the offence. Further, the emotional harm she suffered was substantial, as is evidenced by the contents of the victim impact statement and as was conceded by counsel for the offender. In addition, the offender was informally in a position of responsibility towards the complainant, he having been left in sole care of her and his own son for a short period of time. 

Weighing all those factors, I find that the offence falls moderately below the mid-range of objective gravity for such an offence. For that reason the standard non-parole period does not apply, but does remain as a reference point. A further reason for not imposing the standard non-parole period is that the offender has not previously been convicted for an offence of this type, accepting that good character has less weight in cases of sexual assault. I have also taken into account his poor state of health at a relatively young age and the fact that this is his first lengthy period of imprisonment at this age ."" 

144In my view, the sentencing Judge was referring to AJP and Eedens not as mathematically comparable sentences to be applied to this case, but as authorities where the circumstances provided greater assistance to the discretionary determination of sentence for this Appellant. A reading of the transcript of sentencing submissions in the District Court does not suggest that the parties were inviting her Honour to engage in a mathematical comparison of sentences in these other cases. Submissions made in the District Court appear to have related to sentencing principles and factors which bear upon an assessment of objective seriousness. 

145With the greatest of respect, I consider it to be erroneous to read more into her Honour's approach than this. In particular, I consider that this Court would be falling into error if the construction was to be adopted that her Honour was in some way required to explain why she imposed a sentence upon the Appellant which was significantly different from the sentences imposed in AJP and Eedens . Such an approach would be contrary to sentencing principles applicable to first instance sentencing courts and contrary to principles concerning the determination by this Court of a sentence appeal on the ground of manifest excess. 

146The Chief Justice at [115] refers to the description of the offence as isolated and opportunistic, and the sentencing Judge's assessment of objective gravity, and then says that "" in those circumstances "" a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of nine years is unreasonable and unjust. With respect, I do not agree. 

147It will be apparent immediately that a most significant feature of the present case is that it involved a five-year old victim, an age well removed from the age limit of 10 years which demarcates a s.66A offence. None of the cases referred to before her Honour, or before this Court, involved a five-year old victim. Her Honour referred expressly to the child in this case being "" extremely young, only five years old and the range for such an offence under s.66A is up to ten years "". The offence in this case involved penile penetration of the mouth of the five-year old girl. Her Honour had referred earlier in the remarks on sentence to the harm done to the victim as a result of the offence (ROS2-3): 

""The victim impact statement details the impact this offence has had on this child. I note she has had to undergo blood tests, and as at October 2009, the date of the statement, she was engaged in counselling once a week. Her mother has noticed a significant change in her personality. From being extroverted and confident, she has become quiet, constantly worried and insecure. Quite clearly and understandably, the offence has had a very serious effect on the child and on her relationships with both adults and other children."" 

148Her Honour had regard to the fact that the offence was "" opportunistic "". The finding that the offence was "" isolated "" was to be understood in the context of the immediate complaint by the child to her mother followed by the speedy arrest of the Appellant. The fact that an offence of this type (committed against a five-year old victim) was proved after a contested trial, relates to the fact that there was early complaint and an opportunity to gather physical and forensic evidence which implicated the Appellant. As her Honour observed, the existence of DNA evidence obtained from clothing "" was no doubt a compelling consideration during the jury's deliberations "" (ROS2). 

149The experience of the criminal courts is that offences of this type committed against very young victims are difficult to investigate and prosecute successfully where the charge is contested. The Appellant in this case went to trial and was convicted by the jury. The discount applicable to other offenders who plead guilty, and any allowance for contrition and remorse which may exist in other cases, had no application to the Appellant. 

150Her Honour had regard to subjective factors bearing upon sentence and no ground of appeal challenges these findings. 

151By asserting manifest excess, the Appellant alleges that the result embodied in the sentencing Judge's order was unreasonable or plainly unjust. No specific error is alleged. Rather, the Appellant asserts that it was to be inferred from the result that there was a failure to properly exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the sentencing court: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505. 

152Appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases. Rather, intervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the reasons: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 605 [58]; Hili v the Queen at 538-539 [58]-[59]. That this Court may have exercised the sentencing discretion differently is not the test: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15]. 

153The sentence passed in this case was substantial. However, it lay within the proper range of sentence for this offence committed by this offender. No error has been demonstrated in the exercise of sentencing discretion in this case. In particular, it has not been demonstrated that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust so as to satisfy the requirements for a ground based upon manifest excess. 

154I agree with the Chief Justice that the appeal against conviction ought be dismissed. However, with respect to the sentence appeal, I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.

2758352,ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266,"Judgment
1ARS (""the appellant"") was convicted on 15 April 2010 on one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child contrary to s 66EA of the Crimes Act 1900 (""the Act""). The appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment with a head sentence of 14 years. The appellant has appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against his sentence.
2Because the appeal against conviction raises at least in part questions of mixed law and fact, strictly speaking leave was required to appeal against the conviction (Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 5(1)(b)). However, no point on this issue was taken at the hearing of the appeal. To the extent necessary leave should be granted to appeal against conviction.
3The indictment charged the appellant with one count of a contravention of s 66EA of the Act. In the alternative, the indictment charged the appellant with 13 counts of various sexual offences contrary to s 66C(2), s 61M(1), s 66C(4) or s 61J(1) of the Act. In addition, the indictment described seven separate offences. Those described offences could be used in determining whether there was a contravention of s 66EA. They were not, however, alternative counts. 
4Because of its importance to a number of grounds of the appeal the indictment should be set out in full.

The complainant's evidence
5It is also convenient before considering each ground of appeal to summarise the evidence given by the complainant at the trial.
6The complainant was born on 11 February 1991. Her mother and the appellant entered into a relationship around 1993. When the complainant was about 10 or 11 years old she, her mother and the appellant moved to a farm outside Bathurst (the farm). The appellant spent weekends at the farm but spent most weekdays away on business. The complainant alleged that the appellant began to sexually assault her while she was living at the farm. Towards the end of 2004 the complainant and her mother moved to Dee Why in Sydney with the appellant. The complainant alleged that she was sexually assaulted at these premises as well as on the appellant's two boats, which were moored near Sydney. In 2005 the complainant, her mother and the appellant moved into a house on Pittwater Road in Bayview. By 2007 the family had moved to another house in Bayview, in Kennedy Place. The complainant gave evidence that the appellant sexually assaulted her at both of these houses. The complainant also gave evidence about abuse occurring in New Zealand and Queensland during family holidays. The complainant was aged between 11 and 16 during the time of the alleged offences. 
7The complainant reported the alleged abuse to her mother in November 2007. Her mother took her to a doctor that afternoon, who reported the incidents to the Department of Community Services. The appellant was not aware at this point that the complainant had made allegations to her mother or her doctor. 
8In December 2007, the complainant had a conversation with the appellant on her mother's mobile telephone. The complainant alleges that this conversation occurred on 20 December 2007, while the appellant alleges that a variation of this conversation occurred on 11 December 2007. The complainant gave evidence that she recorded the conversation on her mother's mobile telephone and later on a dictaphone that the complainant's mother had allegedly purchased so that the complainant could record her own thoughts. During the conversation the appellant made a number of general statements about what had transpired between himself and the complainant, which could be characterised as general admissions. He did not make any statements about specific incidents. 
9The complainant and her mother reported the complainant's allegations and surrendered the dictaphone recording to the police in late 2007.
The evidence in relation to count 2
10The complainant stated that the incident giving rise to count 2 occurred when she was 11. The indictment stated that it occured between 28 February 2002 and 28 February 2003. The complainant gave evidence that she was on a ride-on lawn mower with the appellant. She said she sat in front of him between his legs and was in charge of steering the mower. She said the appellant put his hand under her crop top and began squeezing her breasts. She said he squeezed her left breast to indicate she should steer the mower to the left and her right breast to indicate that she should turn right. She said that the appellant then put his hand on her knee and moved it up her thigh before touching the inside and outside of her underpants. She gave evidence that he touched her on the inside and outside of her vagina. The complainant stated that the appellant told her that it was a secret and not to tell her mother. She stated that at this stage she was not aware that she had been sexually assaulted.
The evidence in relation to count 3
11The complainant stated that the events subject of count 3 occurred a few weeks after the incident on the ride on mower (T 90). The complainant stated that she was lying between her mum and the appellant in their bed, as she often did in the mornings. She was wearing pyjamas and underpants. She stated that her Mum left the bedroom for a period of time and the appellant put his hand on her knee, then moved it up her thigh to her vagina where he touched her on the inside and outside of her pyjamas. She stated that after a few minutes he moved his hand inside of her underwear and stroked her vagina on the inside and outside. She stated that this became routine behaviour, which occurred once or twice per week for the next year or so.
The evidence in relation to count 4
12The complainant gave evidence that approximately seven or eight months to a year after the appellant first touched her he began asking her to touch his penis. She gave evidence about the first occasion on which this occurred. She stated that after he touched her in the usual way (starting with his hand on her knee, moving up her thigh, touching the outside of her underpants and then touching the inside and outside of her vagina) the appellant moved her hand onto his penis, on the outside of his pants, and that she pulled her hand away. She stated that eventually her touching his penis became a part of the routine sexual activity. She stated that the first few times this occurred she touched the outside of his pants, but that after some time he began to pull his pants down and request that she touch his bare penis. The Crown relied upon the appellant's digital penetration of the complainant for this charge.
The evidence in relation to count 5
13Count 5 related to an alleged incident at a water tank (T 95-96). The complainant gave evidence that she and the appellant drove out to a water tank on their property at the farm. The complainant alleged that at the water tank the appellant touched the inside and outside of her vagina. She said she was in year 7 at the time.
The evidence in relation to count 6
14The complainant's evidence in support of count 6 described how the appellant's conduct towards her progressed to oral sex. She stated (T 97) that when she was in year 8 and aged 13 he asked her: ""Do you want me to suck your pussy?"" She said she could not speak and did not respond but that he began to put his mouth on her vagina. She described that oral intercourse became part of the routine sexual activity, particularly when her mother was out of the house and she and the appellant were alone for an extended period of time. The complainant stated that oral intercourse occurred on her parents' bed at the farm, on the bed on the appellant's boat, and at various places in the houses in which they subsequently lived.
The evidence in relation to count 7
15The complainant described count 7 as an incident of oral sex that occurred on the appellant's boat (T 99), sometime between 1 November 2003 and 11 February 2005. The complainant stated that there was a bedroom with a bed on the lower level of the appellant's boat. The complainant said that it was common for her and the appellant to go onto the boat without her mother. She stated that one time the appellant sat her on the edge of the bed and laid her backwards so that her knees were hanging over the edge of the bed. She stated that he touched her breasts and pulled down her pants. She stated that he put his finger inside her vagina and put his mouth on her vagina as well. She said that he would say: ""squeeze your tits"" or ""touch my cock"" when this type of conduct occurred.
The evidence in relation to count 8
16The complainant gave evidence that during the summer of 2004-2005 she lived at Dee Why with the appellant and the complainant's mother. She was between years 8 and 9 at school. The complainant alleged that one night when the appellant was tucking her into bed (as he would do most nights) he placed his hands on her vagina and inside her pants. She also gave evidence that she touched his penis on this occasion.
The evidence in relation to count 9
17The complainant gave evidence that after the sexual contact had been going on for some time it progressed to what was described as ""spooning""(T 113). The complainant stated that the appellant would lie behind her, touch her breasts from behind and then pull down her pants and put his penis in between her legs. She stated that he would hold his penis in between her legs and get her to grab it from the other side. She described that she put her hand through the front of her legs and moved it backwards and forwards. She stated that he would sometimes ejaculate between her legs. The complainant gave evidence that sometimes the appellant would rub lubricant on her breasts, stomach, in between her legs, in her vagina and on his penis. She stated that the appellant tried to push his penis into her vagina but that it hurt and she squirmed away or squeezed her legs together. It became clear in the Crown's closing address that the conduct involving lubricant was the subject of count 9 and the remaining conduct was the subject of count 10. The complainant also stated that the incident with the lubricant occurred on more than one occasion but that the first occasion was at Pittwater Road, Bayview, between 1 December 2005 and 31 January 2006.
The evidence in relation to count 10
18The complainant gave evidence that while the family lived at their house in Pittwater Road, between 1 December 2005 and 31 January 2006, the appellant produced a condom and asked her whether he should put it on. She stated that she told him not to. The complainant claimed not to have seen the condom or the packet (T 113, T 118). The complainant stated that the touching then went on as it usually did. The complainant also referred to the evidence she had given in respect of count 9 where she stated that the appellant was ""spooning"" her and tried to put his penis in her vagina but that she squirmed away because it hurt and because she did not want to have sex. She stated that he was not very forceful when he tried to put his penis in her vagina. 
The evidence in relation to count 11
19The complainant gave evidence in relation to count 11 that while she had her learners' driving license the appellant took her for a practice drive. She stated that she stopped the car at the Whale Beach car park. She stated that the appellant was in the front passenger seat and she was in the driver's seat. The complainant gave evidence that the appellant reached over and touched her in and on her vagina with his hands. She could not identify the exact dates but isolated two possible dates: 17 February 2007 and 12 March 2007. She said that by this stage she had had a conversation with the appellant in which she indicated she wanted the physical relationship to stop.
The evidence in relation to count 12
20The complainant gave evidence that count 12 involved sexual activity, which followed a fight between herself and the appellant about whether her friend was allowed to stay the night before a geography excursion. She gave evidence that she had invited a friend to sleep over the night before the school excursion and that the appellant had become very angry as a result. The complainant stated that after the argument the appellant was very apologetic and she ended up spending the night in his bed. She stated that during the night the appellant touched her in and on her vagina with his hand, had her touch his penis and placed his mouth on her vagina. This incident was said to have occurred sometime between 1 January 2007 and 31 March 2007.
The evidence in relation to count 13
21The complainant gave evidence that the incidents supporting count 13 followed another fight between herself and the appellant at their home and in the absence of her mother. The complainant stated that after she and the appellant resolved their argument she spent the night in his bed. The complainant alleged that he placed his finger inside and outside of her vagina and put his tongue on and in her vagina. The complainant estimated that this occurred in the first half of 2007, after what she described as an argument about her making contact with her natural father. She also said the event occurred at Kennedy Place and it was the same as the Pittwater Road incident.
The evidence in relation to count 14
22Count 14 related to an incident that was alleged to have occurred while the complainant was watching the movie, Schindler's List, in her bed. She stated that the appellant came to check on her and then climbed into bed with her. She stated that he placed his hand underneath her pants and placed it on and in her vagina. She said she thought that this incident occurred in the Easter holidays of April 2006 and that she was 15 at the time.
The evidence in relation to described offence (a)
23The complainant described an incident at Christmas time in 2003 when she was spending time on the appellant's boat. The complainant stated that when her mother walked the dogs each morning the complainant would spend approximately half an hour to an hour alone with the appellant. The complainant stated that she remembered the appellant touching the inside and outside of her vagina while she and the appellant were lying in her mother and the appellant's bed. 
The evidence in relation to described offence (b)
24The complainant gave evidence in relation to described offence (b) that the complainant and appellant were lying in bed when the appellant began to discuss a boy, J, whom she had professed to like. The complainant reported that the appellant asked whether she would like him to take her to J's house so that she could have sex with him. She said that the appellant then began to touch her and said: ""Just pretend that I am [J]"" (T 109). She said that he put his hands on and in her vagina and that he put his mouth on her vagina.
The evidence in relation to described offence (c)
25The complainant stated that described offence (c) occurred during school holidays in 2006. The complainant reported that she was watching the live action Peter Pan film from her bed during the day. She stated that the appellant knew that she found the lead actor in the film attractive. The complainant gave evidence that the appellant came into her room and lay in bed with her, then began to touch her. The complainant said that while touching her, the appellant asked her to pretend that he was the actor in the film. She said he touched her with his hands in and on her vagina.
The evidence in relation to described offence (d)
26Described offence (d) related to an event that was said to have occurred in 2006 while the appellant, the complainant and the complainant's mother were visiting relatives in New Zealand. The complainant gave evidence that while staying at her grandparents' house she found herself in the spare room with the appellant. She stated that she was reading a book and he was reading the paper, and that he touched her on and in her vagina after putting his hands on her knee and moving it up her thigh.
The evidence in relation to described offence (e)
27In relation to described offence (e), the complainant gave evidence that the appellant produced a condom at her house in Kennedy Place. She described the incident as the same as the incident at Pittwater Road (the subject of count 10) without providing further details. When asked to elaborate she said that the appellant had rubbed lubricant over her body, inserted his penis from behind her and rubbed it between her legs. She said that the rubbing of his penis between her legs did not last very long, ""until he ejaculated usually"" (T 120).
28In circumstances where the jury was not satisfied as to described offence (e), the Crown also pleaded an alternative attempted offence. Although an attempt to commit an offence under s 61J(1) is not sufficient for liability under that provision, an attempted offence in respect of s 61J(1) is sufficient for the purposes of proving a sexual offence under s 66EA (see s 66EA(12)(b)).
The evidence in relation to described offence (f)
29The complainant gave evidence that while staying at her grandparents' house in New Zealand in 2007 she and the appellant were lying in the spare room of the house in the double bed. She stated that he touched her on and in her vagina and she touched his penis.
The evidence in relation to described offence (g)
30The complainant identified described offence (g) as the final time that sexual contact occurred between her and the appellant. She stated that in the holidays between school terms in 2007 she travelled to the Gold Coast with her mother and the appellant. The complainant stated that ""things happened"" between her and the appellant at two different hotels at which they stayed. She gave evidence in respect of events at the Versace Hotel at the Gold Coast, stating that she was left alone with the appellant while her mother went to use the internet in the lobby. She stated that while she was watching a movie the appellant began to rub her body because it had oil on it, possibly from a massage. She stated that he then started placing his hand on and in her vagina, had her touch his penis, and put his mouth on her vagina.
Section 66EA
31Many of the issues raised by the grounds of appeal concern the construction and effect of s 66EA. In considering the various grounds of appeal it is, therefore, important to have regard to precisely what the Crown must prove to establish an offence under that section. 
32Section 66EA provides as follows:
""66EA Persistent sexual abuse of a child
(1)  A person who, on 3 or more separate occasions occurring on separate days during any period, engages in conduct in relation to a particular child that constitutes a sexual offence is liable to imprisonment for 25 years.
(2)  It is immaterial whether or not the conduct is of the same nature, or constitutes the same offence, on each occasion.
(3)  It is immaterial that the conduct on any of those occasions occurred outside New South Wales, so long as the conduct on at least one of those occasions occurred in New South Wales.
(4)  In proceedings for an offence against this section, it is not necessary to specify or to prove the dates or exact circumstances of the alleged occasions on which the conduct constituting the offence occurred.
(5)  A charge of an offence against this section:
(a) must specify with reasonable particularity the period during which the offence against this section occurred, and
(b)  must describe the nature of the separate offences alleged to have been committed by the accused during that period.
(6)  In order for the accused to be convicted of an offence against this section:
(a)  the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence establishes at least 3 separate occasions, occurring on separate days during the period concerned, on which the accused engaged in conduct constituting a sexual offence in relation to a particular child of a nature described in the charge, and
(b)  the jury must be so satisfied about the material facts of the 3 such occasions, although the jury need not be so satisfied about the dates or the order of those occasions, and
(c)  if more than 3 such occasions are relied on as evidence of the commission of an offence against this section, all the members of the jury must be so satisfied about the same 3 occasions, and
(d)  the jury must be satisfied that the 3 such occasions relied on as evidence of the commission of an offence against this section occurred after the commencement of this section.
(7)  In proceedings for an offence against this section, the judge must inform the jury of the requirements of subsection (6).
(8)  A person who has been convicted or acquitted of an offence against this section may not be convicted of a sexual offence in relation to the same child that is alleged to have been committed in the period during which the accused was alleged to have committed an offence against this section. This subsection does not prevent an alternative verdict under subsection (10).
(9)  A person who has been convicted or acquitted of a sexual offence may not be convicted of an offence against this section in relation to the same child if any of the occasions relied on as evidence of the commission of the offence against this section includes the occasion of that sexual offence.
(10)  If on the trial of a person charged with an offence against this section the jury is not satisfied that the offence is proven but is satisfied that the person has, in respect of any of the occasions relied on as evidence of the commission of the offence against this section, committed a sexual offence, the jury may acquit the person of the offence charged and find the person guilty of that sexual offence. The person is liable to punishment accordingly.
(11)  Proceedings for an offence against this section may only be instituted by or with the approval of the Director of Public Prosecutions.
(12)  In this section:
child means a person under the age of 18 years.
sexual offence means any of the following:
(a)  an offence under section 61I, 61J, 61JA, 61K, 61L, 61M, 61N, 61O, 66A, 66B, 66C, 66D, 66F, 73, 74, 78H, 78I, 78K, 78L, 78N, 78O, 78Q or 80A,
(b)  an offence of attempting to commit an offence referred to in paragraph (a),
(c)  an offence under the law of a place outside New South Wales that would, if it had been committed in New South Wales, be an offence referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).""
33There are a number of matters of importance to be noted about the section. First, it is a necessary element of a contravention that on three separate occasions on separate days a person engages in conduct which constitutes a sexual offence. It follows that a jury has to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a sexual offence was committed against the complainant on three separate days. However, as s 66EA(5)(a) makes clear, while it is not necessary to specify the precise day the offence occurred, the nature of the separate offence must be specified.
34The Crown, in its written submissions, seemed to suggest on a number of occasions that the unfairness inherent in latent duplicity does not have the same relevance for an offence under s 66EA as it would in respect of a charge for a separate offence. I do not believe this is correct. Although it is not necessary to identify the precise date on which the offence occurred it remains necessary to identify the particular sexual offences, which cumulatively give rise to a contravention of s 66EA. This is consistent with what was said by the majority in KRM v R [2001] HCA 11; (2001) 206 CLR 221 at [17], [68] and [137]. Unfairness arising from latent duplicity can arise in circumstances where the evidence called in respect of a particular offence relied upon contains duplicity. 
35That being said, it is undoubtedly correct that s 66EA does place an accused person in a position of significant forensic disadvantage compared to a person charged with a particular sexual offence. That arises inevitably from the fact that neither the date nor the exact circumstance of the offence need to be established and by the fact that the jury can be invited to find the offence established by considering a number of particularised offences without necessarily having to identify the particular sexual offences which led them to the conclusion that a contravention of s 66EA had occurred. As was said by Underwood J in Emery v R [1999] TASSC 141; (1999) 110 A Crim R 221 at [2], the statutory prescription of the crime necessarily results in an indictment which is duplicitous.
36Two things follow in my opinion. First, a court should ensure that a jury is directed as to precisely what is required to constitute a contravention of the offence and to point out to the jury the difficulties confronting the accused in meeting allegations which are vague as to the date and the exact circumstances (see KRM v R supra at [70] per Gummow and Callinan JJ).
37The other matter that has to be borne in mind is this: given that the legislature has made it clear that the date and the exact circumstance of the offence are not required to be proved, and given that the legislature at least implicitly accepts the conclusion that the Crown can proceed on the basis of a number of alleged sexual offences (only some of which may be proved beyond reasonable doubt) the fact that the accused is thereby placed at a forensic disadvantage does not of itself lead to the conclusion that there is a defect in the indictment or that the accused was denied a fair trial.
38With that background I turn to the grounds of appeal. 
Ground 1: The trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the tape recording that became exhibit Y
39This ground of appeal relates to the admission of a tape recording made by the complainant of a conversation between her and the appellant, which is said by the complainant to have taken place on 20 December 2007. The substance of what was said by the appellant as recorded on that tape was accurately summarised by the Crown in its submissions (at [72]) to the following effect:that he is sorry;that he would shoot himself if it would make things better for the complainant;that he cannot make up for the past;that he was aware that he could be sentenced to 20 years for what he had done;that he asked for forgiveness;that he did not know why he had done it and that he would never do it again;that he knew that what he was doing was wrong;that he knew what he was doing was child abuse.
40After a lengthy voir dire the trial judge in a judgment of 25 June 2009 held that the tape was admissible.
41In his judgment on this issue the trial judge noted that it was the Crown case that the conversation constituted a general admission by the appellant to the conduct asserted in the count of persistent sexual abuse of the complainant and along with other evidence could be regarded as encompassing the charged sexual conduct. His Honour noted that the complainant stated that it was a true recording and no part of the conversation had been deleted or otherwise modified.
42The trial judge commenced by considering how the evidence was obtained. Given that the recording was made by the complainant (and her mother) without the appellant's knowledge or consent, his Honour held that the recording of the conversation breached s 5(1)(b) of the Listening Devices Act 1984 (now repealed).
43Having concluded that the evidence was illegally obtained, his Honour proceeded to consider whether the evidence was admissible having regard to the provisions of s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995. His Honour accepted that it was necessary for the Crown to demonstrate that ""the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting it"" (interlocutory judgment 25 June 2009, at 14). 
44Section 138 of the Evidence Act states:
""Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence 
(1)  Evidence that was obtained: 
(a)  improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or 
(b)  in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, 
is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. 
(2)  Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning: 
(a)  did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or 
(b)  made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission. 
(3)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account: 
(a)  the probative value of the evidence, and 
(b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and 
(c)  the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and 
(d)  the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and 
(e)  whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and 
(f)  whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and 
(g)  whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and 
(h)  the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.""
45In considering the issues raised by s 138, the trial judge first considered the integrity of the recording. His Honour reviewed expert evidence called by each party concerning the integrity of the recording and concluded that the damage to the tape recording identified by the expert called by the appellant, Mr Garde, occurred whilst the tape was in police custody. His Honour rejected the proposition that there was a reasonable possibility that the tape was edited (interlocutory judgment 25 June 2009, at 34).
46His Honour then concluded that contrary to the evidence of the complainant and her mother (GW), GW was likely to have assisted in the recording. However, he stated it did not follow that the recording was not authentic. He came to the view that there was no reasonable evidence of the editing of the recording (interlocutory judgment 25 June 2009, at 37). 
47His Honour having concluded that the tape was not tampered with then considered the matters required to be taken into account under s 138(3) of the Evidence Act. He concluded that the evidence had strong probative value and that the evidence was important as it provided ""clear and independent evidence of the detail, complexion and nature of a significant conversation touching upon the allegation of sexual assault and the nature of the relationship between the complainant and the accused"" (interlocutory judgment 25 June 2009, at 41). He referred to R v Dalley [2002] NSWCCA 284; (2002) 132 A Crim R 169 at [3] where it was held that the more serious the offence the more likely the public interest required the admission of the evidence. He concluded that the offences were of a serious kind. 
48His Honour then proceeded to consider the matters referred to s 138(3)(d), namely, the gravity of the impropriety of the contravention. He found that although the complainant may have been aware that there might have been some impediment to the use of the recording in proceedings against the appellant, he could not conclude that she knew it was unlawful. 
49His Honour noted that although GW stated that in some circumstances she would record a conversation even though it was illegal he could not be satisfied that at the time she participated in the recording she knew it was unlawful or was reckless as to that possibility (interlocutory judgment 25 June 2009, at 52) However, he recognised there were strong policy reasons why the law should be upheld, so as not to encourage conduct of the type in question where persons engage in unlawful investigation in circumstances where they are not then subject to the accountability afforded by the legislation. He stated that the breach was serious, noting that advanced technology enabled the alteration of this kind of evidence. He also noted that the investigation was in the hands of the police at the time of the recording and the means by which such a recording could be obtained by warrant were available upon proper application. 
50So far as s 138(3)(e) was concerned, his Honour repeated his conclusion that he was not satisfied that the complainant or GW knew it was illegal to record the conversation or were reckless as to the possibility that the recording was unlawful. 
51So far as s 138(3)(h) was concerned, his Honour described the fact that the police could have obtained a warrant, which would ensure the integrity of the evidence, as a significant factor in the balancing exercise.
52His Honour concluded that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in the way the evidence in question was obtained. He found there was no unfair prejudice to the appellant in the tender, noting that the trial involved serious criminal conduct. He noted that while there was an element of collusion between the complainant and GW in procuring the recording, the complainant was a principal party.
Ground 1: appellant's submissions
53In his written submissions the appellant accepted that the evidence had substantial probative value, though he argued that it was an overstatement to describe the evidence as a compelling admission. The appellant contended that the finding of the trial judge that he could not be satisfied that the breach by the complainant or GW occurred in circumstances where they either knew that what they were doing was illegal or were recklessly indifferent to it reversed the onus which was placed on the Crown under s 138(3)(d) and (e) and that no determination favourable to the Crown could be made under the provision. He submitted that when that finding is taken with the seriousness of the breach, the safeguards required to ensure the integrity of the evidence, and the ease with which a warrant could have be obtained, the Crown was unlikely to have satisfied the onus.
54The appellant also submitted that the trial judge failed to consider the complainant's evidence that she commenced to record the conversation on her mother's mobile phone. The evidence was that this was for less than a minute. He pointed to the fact that no recording was found on the phone, stating that this raised further issues as to the credibility of the complainant. He also submitted that this issue should have been raised in the directions to the jury.
55In oral submissions, senior counsel for the appellant properly accepted that the reasoning of the trial judge in concluding that the tape was not tainted was not amenable to challenge (T 10). However, he emphasised what he described as the incorrect reversal of the onus in considering s 138(d) and (e) and submitted that in determining what was a finely balanced decision, this factor should have lead to rejection of the evidence or that at least it indicated such uncertainty that this Court, not being in a position to assess the credibility of the complainant and GW, could not be satisfied that the trial judge acting properly would inevitably have admitted the record of interview.
56The appellant argued that this Court should be concerned that the complainant and GW had been found by the trial judge to have been dishonest about GW's involvement in the recording, suggesting that this undermined their credibility on all matters related to the recording, and particularly, undermined their statements as to whether they knew that the recording was illegally obtained.
Ground 1: Crown submissions
57The Crown submitted that the transcript was of very great importance, describing the admissions contained in it as ""simply devastating"" (written submissions at [71]). It submitted that consistent with what was said by Johnson J in Sepulveda v R [2006] NSWCCA 379; (2006) 167 A Crim R 108, the recording was correctly admitted. The Crown emphasised that the only requirement in s 138(d) and (e) was to take the matters in those subsections into account. It was further emphasised that it was open to the trial judge to accept part of the evidence of the complainant and GW to the effect that they did not believe the recording was unlawful, whilst rejecting the evidence that GW was not complicit in the recording.
58The Crown also emphasised that the complainant had a legal right to engage the appellant in conversation, to repeat the conversation and to give evidence about it. The Crown submitted it was not a case of unjustified bugging of a conversation between two people who were ignorant of the recording.
59The Crown submitted that the finding of the trial judge as to the integrity of the tape meant that the recording had to be regarded as an accurate representation and of great importance in what was described as a word-against-word case. It was submitted that the fact that the safeguards against impropriety were bypassed had less weight in the circumstances where there was a finding that the recording had not been compromised.
Ground 1: consideration
60In Sepulveda v R supra, this Court considered the application of s 138 of the Evidence Act to an illegally recorded conversation between the appellant in that case and a person he was alleged to have sexually assaulted. Although it was found in that case that the purpose of the recording was to assist the police in the investigation of the offence and not to blackmail the appellant, the evidence appeared to be silent as to whether or not the complainant knew that what he was doing was unlawful.
61In the course of his judgment Johnson J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, made the following comments at [149]:
""It is necessary to consider whether the recording was admissible under s 138 Evidence Act. The findings of fact of the trial judge concerning JD's purpose and motive in making the recording are relevant. At both trials, the contents of the recording were held to be highly probative and it was held that there was no unfair prejudice to the Appellant in the tender of the recording. The trials of the Appellant involved serious criminal charges. This was not a case where a covert recording was made by a third party of a conversation between two other parties. JD was a principal party to the recorded conversation. JD (a layman) undertook the recording of his own initiative and was not acting as an agent of the police. It was his evidence that he intended to take the recording to the police and, in due course, he did so. The evidence obtained was of high probative value and of great importance in the proceedings. If the trial judge had come to exercise the s 138 discretion and to have regard to the factors in s 138(3) of the Act, then, given his Honour's findings of fact, the Crown would have demonstrated that the recording ought be admitted under s 138. In my view, such a conclusion would have been reached even after full weight was given to the statutory purpose underlying s 5 Listening Devices Act 1984. The trial judge would have been satisfied that the desirability of admitting the evidence of the recording outweighed the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in the way in which this evidence was obtained."" 
62In the present case it was not suggested on the appeal that the recording was made for any purpose other than to assist in the prosecution of the appellant: the complainant gave evidence that she recorded the conversation so that people would believe her accusations against the appellant. Although the material on the recording could not be said to be direct admissions of any of the charged or uncharged acts, the recording has considerable probative value for the reasons elaborated in my consideration of ground 2. Having regard to the findings of the trial judge that the integrity of the tape was not compromised, it seems to me consistent with the approach in Sepulveda supra that his Honour was correct in finding that the Crown had established that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting it having regard to the way it was obtained.
63Nor do I think the trial judge's reasons were infected by the error of reversing the onus of proof in the manner contended for by the appellant. What is required by s 138(3) is that the matters referred to in it be taken into account. In the present case, his Honour expressly gave consideration to ss 138(3)(d) and (e). His statement to the effect that he could not conclude that either the complainant or GW knew the taping was unlawful or were recklessly indifferent to that consequence was made in the context of consideration of those subsections.
64Second, his Honour was conscious of who bore the onus of proof of establishing that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting it. He expressly stated that the onus was borne by the Crown (see [43] above). What he said later must be considered in that context. It does not seem to me that his later remarks the subject of this ground of appeal meant that he reversed the onus or, in some way, placed an evidentiary burden on the appellant to establish any matters arising under s 138(3) which were in dispute. 
65Third, and aligned with what I have said above, s 138(3), in my opinion, does not require a positive finding one way or another that the complainant or GW acted unlawfully or recklessly. If the trial judge was unable to reach a conclusion one way or another on this issue, he would be entitled to proceed on that basis in considering the matters raised in s 138(3)(d) or s 138(3)(e). It would result in the matter not being taken into account one way or the other in considering the gravity of the offence for the purpose of s 138(3)(d), and render s 138(3)(e) an essentially neutral factor in the evaluation process.
66Finally, even if contrary to the views I have expressed above, the trial judge erroneously proceeded on the basis that the appellant bore the onus of establishing that the complainant and/or GW acted unlawfully or recklessly, I am of the view that the ultimate decision to admit the evidence was correct. Even if the complainant and/or GW knew that recording the conversation was unlawful or were recklessly indifferent to that fact, in my opinion, it was still appropriate to admit the recording. The recording was of a conversation to which the complainant was a party, having regard to the nature of the case it was of significant probative value, the offence was a serious one and the evidence established to the satisfaction of the trial judge that the tape had not been tampered with. In those circumstances, it seems to me that irrespective of the knowledge or reckless indifference of the complainant and GW to the question of illegality, the recording was correctly admitted under s 138.
67It does not seem to me that this conclusion is affected by the failure of the trial judge to consider the complainant's evidence that she commenced to record the conversation on her mother's mobile phone. Whether or not it raised an issue as to the complainant's credibility having regard to the finding of the trial judge on the question of the authenticity of the tape, it does not seem to me to affect the question of admissibility.
68For these reasons, in my opinion, ground 1 has not been made out.
Ground 2: The trial judge failed to deal adequately and erred in his direction in relation to the tape recorded conversations
Ground 2: appellant's submissions
69In his written submissions the appellant contended that both the Crown and the learned trial judge failed to properly consider that the evidence sought to be tendered was in fact tendency evidence or being used for a tendency purpose. He submitted first that to the extent that the material was being used as an admission, the jury should have been directed that they needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the content of the recording amounted to an admission. Further, he submitted that the evidence was in fact being used as tendency evidence, namely, as demonstrating a sexual interest in or a propensity to sexual misconduct with the complainant and that the jury should have been directed that they needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conversation amounted to an admission of that tendency before they could use it. He emphasised that the need for a clear direction was particularly important given the nature of the charges, and that evidence of general misconduct over time was not evidence in support of count 1 or the subsequent alternative counts in the indictment.
70The appellant submitted that the jury should have been directed to the effect that the Crown asserted the evidence was an admission by the appellant that he had a tendency to act in a particular way, that is to engage in sexual misconduct with the complainant and to have a sexual interest in her. They should have been directed that they could only use the evidence for a tendency purpose if they were satisfied of the tendency beyond reasonable doubt.
71So far as the recording was concerned, the appellant submitted that the jury should have been directed that if they thought there was a reasonable possibility that the tape was not authentic they should not have regard to its contents. 
72The appellant also submitted that the jury should have been directed as to the purpose of the legal framework of the Listening Devices Act and that failure to comply with that Act impacted on the appellant's ability to test the authenticity of the recording. He submitted that the trial judge was required to warn the jury that the appellant was placed at a forensic disadvantage. 
73In his oral submissions, senior counsel for the Crown submitted that the trial judge's direction that the Crown argued that the recorded conversation amounted to a general admission of improper sexual conduct towards the appellant (SU 87) and his direction that if the jury found that the recording amounted to a general admission it could properly support the occurrence of the conduct (SU 88), were incorrect. He submitted that this demonstrated a misunderstanding of how the evidence would be used, namely, as tendency evidence.
74In relation to the direction concerning the authenticity of the tape recording, senior counsel for the appellant referred by way of analogy to what was said by this Court in R v Slattery [2002] NSWCCA 367 at [93]-[94], concerning the need to give a warning to the jury of the forensic disadvantage faced by the accused in that case as a result of his inability to examine a weapon for the purpose of rebutting certain ballistics evidence. He submitted that the jury should have been warned of the disadvantage to the appellant caused by the illicit way in which the recording was obtained, and that the safeguards provided for in the Listening Devices Act had not been complied with. In these circumstances, he said it was not sufficient simply to tell the jury that if they thought there was a real possibility that the evidence of Mr Garde (the expert called by the appellant) favouring the appellant, when taken in conjunction with other evidence, may be correct, they should proceed on that basis.
Ground 2: Crown submissions
75In its written submissions the Crown emphasised that the evidence was not tendered as tendency evidence and that the Evidence Act defines tendency evidence by reference to the purpose for which it is tendered (see Evidence Act dictionary; L'Estrange v R [2011] NSWCCA 89 at [59]). However, the Crown accepted that the fact that the evidence has not been admitted on a tendency basis does not avoid the risk it will be used by the jury for that purpose.
76Further, the Crown submitted that the prosecution did not seek to use the evidence for the purpose of tendency reasoning. The Crown submitted that the prosecution opened and closed the case on the basis that the evidence constituted a general admission and the trial judge summed up on this basis. The Crown submitted that this was consistent with the approach accepted as appropriate by this Court in Rolfe v R [2007] NSWCCA 155; (2007) 173 A Crim R 168.
77The Crown also submitted that the trial judge clearly summed up on the basis that the finding in relation to the authenticity of the recorded conversation and whether it constituted a general admission were matters for the jury. It was also pointed out in its submission that whilst the trial judge did not do so on this specific occasion his Honour had pointed out on a number of occasions that the jury had to be satisfied of factual issues beyond reasonable doubt.
78In relation to the direction concerning the tape, the Crown pointed out that such directions were not sought by the appellant at the trial and consequently r 4 applied. The Crown also pointed out that no specific anti-tendency direction was sought at the trial. 
79In oral submissions, the Crown identified the admission as being that there was an ongoing sexual relationship, which could be used in support of other evidence in relation to the charges.
Ground 2: consideration
80In Rolfe v R supra, the appellant was charged with 10 sexual offences. Part of the evidence against the appellant consisted of letters written to the child's mother expressing remorse. The letters did not contain specific admissions of any of the charged offences. They were not tendered as tendency evidence. In the course of his judgment, Giles JA, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, made the following comments:
""[62] At common law evidence of uncharged sexual conduct between the accused and the complainant has long been admitted, as evidence relevant to place the offences alleged in their context and enable proper evaluation by the jury, and to show a ""guilty passion"" (better described as sexual desire or feeling of the accused for the complainant): R v Wickham (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, No 60108 of 1990, 17 December 1991); R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 515; 66 A Crim R 419 at 422; R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 at 708; 98 A Crim R 71 at 77-78.
...
[64]  Evidence of a 'guilty passion' has been regarded as tendency evidence, so that where the relationship evidence is not introduced only to provide context and background, but is directed to the accused's sexual desire or feelings and through them the likelihood that the charged sexual conduct occurred, ss 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act come into play: R v AH at 708-709; 78; R v Greenham [1999] NSWCCA 8 at [23]; Qualtieri v The Queen (2006) 171 A Crim R 463 at [74].
...
[67]  Where the evidence is by way of admission by the accused of sexual activities with the complainant, and is not attributed to particular occasions being occasions other than those of the charged sexual conduct, in my view an additional relevance can arise. Such an admission that the accused engaged in sexual conduct with the complainant, whilst non-specific as to the charged sexual conduct and not of itself sufficient to prove that conduct, is relevant not on the bases of context and background and of ""guilty passion"" earlier mentioned, but because when taken with other evidence the jury could regard it as relating to or at least encompassing the charged sexual conduct and supporting that the charged sexual conduct occurred. If accepted, it could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the conduct charged against the accused (see Evidence Act, s 55). It will, of course, require an assessment of the admission, understood in its own context; for example, marked generality may mean that the admission can not properly be taken to encompass the charged conduct.
[68]  This can be illustrated from a case not involving sexual conduct, R v Centraco [2005] NSWCCA 11. Centraco was charged on three counts of obtaining money or a financial advantage by deception, by cashing cheques drawn on her employer's bank account without authority and receiving payment of cheques drawn on the bank account and other payments deposited into her own bank account without authority. She acknowledged in a statutory declaration owing 'approximately $150,000' to her employer, which was a little less than half the amount the subject of the charges, and undertook to pay it back. Was the statutory declaration admissible?
[69] Hidden J, with whom Howie and Hislop JJ agreed, said -
[15] In exchanges with the Bench in the course of argument, several possible bases of admission of the statutory declaration were canvassed. However, in my view, the simple answer to the problem is that argued by the Crown Prosecutor in this Court. In every trial of an accused on a number of counts it is necessary that each count be considered separately, but it is likely that there will be some evidence which is common to some or all of them. In the present case evidence that the appellant acknowledged indebtedness to her employer in the circumstances alleged by the Crown was relevant to all three counts. Particularly was this so given that the Crown case alleged a pattern of dishonesty over an extended period of time, the three counts merely representing the different methods employed. The evidence was available as an admission of a fact relevant to each of the counts although, of course, it could not have been determinative of any of them. Whether the amount of the acknowledged indebtedness corresponded with the amounts the subject of any one or more of the counts is not to the point. In that regard, it should be remembered that, even on the Crown case, the statutory declaration was made out before the appellant's alleged defalcations had been formally investigated, at a time when the full extent of them might not have been known.
[16]  From the passage of the summing up quoted above it is apparent that this is precisely how the evidence was left to the jury. In particular, his Honour explained that it was relied upon by the Crown as a 'general admission' in respect of the three charges, that it did not relate to any particular charge and that, of itself, it was incapable of proving any of them. Earlier in the summing up he had given an appropriate, indeed emphatic, direction about the need for separate consideration of each of the three counts. The statutory declaration was admissible for the reasons explained to the jury by his Honour and it does not appear to me that there was any danger of the jury using it impermissibly as tendency evidence.""
81In the present case the Crown adduced the evidence not on the basis of tendency evidence to which s 97 would apply but on the basis of a general admission. Thus in opening to the jury the Crown made the following remarks:
""On 21 December [the complainant] taped a conversation that she had with the accused. She pretended during that conversation she hadn't yet told her mother what he had done to her. You will hear this tape members of the jury and you will hear what the Crown says are out of his own mouth admissions to sexual misconduct with his stepdaughter."" (T 41)
In closing the Crown made the following remarks:
""The Crown says you can rely upon that tape as containing a confession by the accused to maintaining a sexual relationship with his stepdaughter, [the complainant]. It represents admissions to the offences in a general sense. He admits the sexual abuse on that tape, members of the jury, and that's the only meaning reasonably that you can attribute to it, the Crown submits. The content is consistent with only that. I mean there are other subjects touched upon, certainly, but the overarching meaning that you can derive from the words that are spoken is consistent only with him agreeing with [the complainant] or explaining, apologising essentially for a lot. His sexual abuse of her. 
... 
The admissions in general, they don't prove any one particular count in the indictment, or any particular episode that's described by the complainant, but if you're satisfied that the accused is admitting to a sexual conduct and a relationship and a sexually abusive relationship with [the complainant], that evidence can properly support the occurrence of the conduct charged, and described in the indictment."" (T 2577-2578)
82In his summing up the trial judge, after referring to the use the Crown submitted the jury should make of the recording, made the following comments (SU 88):
""If you find that the recording amounts to a general admission by the accused of sexual conduct towards the complainant, whilst that may not refer to any particular episode, that evidence of admission could properly support the occurrence of the conduct charged and described in the indictment.""
83The approach adopted by the Crown and by the trial judge in his summing up is consistent with what was approved in Rolfe v R supra. The evidence was not sought to be used as tendency evidence. The trial judge's direction as to the use to which the evidence could be put was therefore correct, in my opinion.
84There remains, of course, the risk that the evidence could be used as tendency evidence. This risk also affects evidence of uncharged acts. However, as I indicate subsequently in this judgment the trial judge made a general anti-tendency direction. 
85The analysis above is not affected, in my opinion, by what was said in the High Court in HML v R [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 235 CLR 334, in considering the admissibility of uncharged acts. In that case, Hayne J, with whom Gummow and Kirby JJ agreed, made the following comments (at [156]):
""Evidence that shows that the accused had a sexual interest in the complainant may also be important in assessing the credibility and coherence of the complainant's evidence generally and, in particular, the account of the events that constitute the offence as charged. But the relevance of the evidence of other sexual conduct or events lies in the proof of demonstrated sexual interest in the complainant. The relevance of such evidence in a particular case may or may not be sufficiently captured by describing it as evidence about the nature of the relationship between the complainant and the accused. To describe the evidence as 'relationship evidence' or evidence of 'guilty passion' is to assert the relevance of the evidence.""
86In the present case the evidence was said to constitute an admission of past sexual conduct. Such evidence, in this case, would be relevant and important in assessing the complainant's credibility and providing evidence of the relationship in which the events occurred. It may be accepted that the fact that the admission was made and the fact they were admissions were matters to be proved beyond reasonable doubt (see HML supra). The direction of the trial judge accommodated this. In the passage of the summing up referred to at [82] above, the trial judge emphasised that the question of whether the recordings constituted admissions was a matter for the jury. In relation to the recording he made the following remarks in the context of the expert evidence called in respect of the tape (SU 91):
""It is not a case of choosing between their evidence [that is, the evidence of the experts]. If you think that there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence of Mr Guard [sic] favouring the accused when taken in conjunction with all the other evidence may be correct you should proceed on that basis. In other words in determining whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt you are required to take into consideration the reasonable possibility that the evidence of Mr Guard [sic] when taken in conjunction with all the other evidence may be correct. If you think that there is no reasonable possibility of the evidence of Mr Guard [sic] being correct and that the evidence of Mr Ringrose is correct then you should proceed accordingly.""
87His Honour had previously given a general direction that facts comprising the elements of the offence must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
88The appellant criticised the direction concerning the expert evidence saying the jury was not given much guidance on what it meant. The appellant suggested that the jury should have been told that if there was a reasonable possibility the recording was not authentic they should reject the evidence. In my opinion, this adds very little to what the jury was in fact told. They could hardly have been in any doubt that the authenticity of the tape was a matter in issue and that the expert evidence was directed to that question. In those circumstances no further direction was required. 
89Further, it does not seem to me any further direction was required as to the forensic disadvantage in which the appellant was placed by virtue of non-compliance with the provisions of the Listening Devices Act. Unlike the weapon in R v Slattery supra, the tape was available for examination and was in fact extensively examined. In these circumstances, there does not seem to be any realistic forensic disadvantage in respect of which a warning should have been given.
90Finally, none of the directions which the appellant says now should have been given were sought at the trial. In these circumstances, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. 
91I deal with r 4 in more detail later in this judgment. However, to the extent that this ground of appeal relates to the need for further and different directions leave should not be granted as it does not seem to me that there is any miscarriage of justice. The directions seem to me to have adequately indicated to the jury the issue to which the evidence could be put and the matters of which the jury had to be satisfied before they made use of it. In this regard it must be remembered that the trial judge gave a general anti-tendency direction in the following terms (SU 63):
""However, I must give you some important warnings with regard to this evidence of other acts. You must not use this evidence of other acts as establishing a tendency on the part of the accused to commit offences of the type charged or that he is the sort of person who would commit the types of crimes with which he is charged. You must not substitute the evidence of other acts for the evidence of the specific alternative counts or described offences on the indictment. You must not reason that because the accused may have done something wrong to [the complainant] on other occasions which are not the subject of any count he must have done so on the occasions on the indictment. You must keep in mind at all times the very limited basis that you, the jury, can take that evidence into account. You need to focus your attention on the evidence that bears on each specific charge in the indictment. Your decision as to whether the Crown has proved the elements of each offence beyond reasonable doubt must be made on the evidence that is led in relation to each of the counts separately.""
92For these reasons ground 2 of the grounds of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 3: The trial miscarried because of the Crown submission, which was not corrected, to the effect that the appellant's evidence in relation to the recording being made on 11 December 2007 was evidence of deliberate manipulation of evidence for an ulterior purpose
93This ground relates to the following remarks made by the Crown in the course of his closing address:
""Before going into the details of why the Crown submits to you that the conversation must have occurred on 20 December as [the complainant] described, another question you might be considering is why there has been this assertion of 11 December? The Crown says the reason you might think this assertion has been made by the accused is because the additional editing time, it would create in your mind. If it happened on 20 December, and I'll come to some evidence about this in a moment, and [GW] tells the police about it the very next day including some content of it, she's only got that evening period within which to do what, on the accused's version, is a very significant alteration of this conversation. So by placing it on 11 December, the Crown says the accused is trying to create incorrectly and something that you will be concerned about, a lengthier period during which editing could have occurred. So 10 days, rather than less than a day, if you accept that the conversation took place on the 20th. 
If you were to find that the recording took place on 11 December, then you would need to reject the evidence of [the complainant] and GW about this and of course that might lead you to question their credibility on other matters. That might be another reason why this suggestion has been made."" (T 2586)
94The appellant submits that this comment invited the jury to reason that the only reason the appellant raised the issue of the call being made on 11 December 2007 was to create an opportunity for the editing of the tape. He said that the submission was akin to consciousness of guilt reasoning and would have been taken as a kind of perversion of the course of justice. 
95In his oral submissions, senior counsel for the appellant accepted that a consciousness of guilt direction was given. He also accepted that the essence of his complaint was the absence of a direction correcting the impression the submission may have made.
96The Crown submitted that there was an issue as to whether the recorded conversation took place on 11 December 2007 or 20 December 2007, although the jury did not need to resolve this if they accepted the integrity of the tape. It was submitted that all the prosecutor was doing was making the point that the jury may have wondered why the date was important and the reason was that it would enhance the appellant's submission that there was more time for editing the tape. The Crown pointed out that the prosecutor told the jury that if the conversation took place on 11 December it would create credibility issues for the complainant and GW on other matters.
97The Crown also pointed out that the prosecutor did not say it was a lie as evidence of consciousness of guilt.
98Importantly, the Crown submitted that no issue was raised by experienced trial counsel concerning the conduct of the trial nor was any direction sought in respect of it. The Crown submitted that quite apart from r 4, the absence of complaint provides an indication that the comment did not have the effect now alleged.
Ground 3: consideration
99In my opinion, the remarks made by the prosecutor, taken in isolation, went beyond what would be expected in a fair and balanced address. The remarks did impute a motive to the appellant in seeking out an argument that there was more time to edit the tape and to impugn the integrity of the complainant and GW.
100That being said, I do not think that the remarks led to a miscarriage of justice. The prosecutor did not allege that the lie was evidence of consciousness of guilt, the trial judge gave a direction in terms suggested in Zoneff v R [2000] HCA 28; (2000) 200 CLR 234 (SU 123) and the fact that no objection to the direction was taken by counsel for the appellant would tend to indicate that the remarks may well not have had the effect contended for in the overall context of the address. 
101It follows from what I have said that in circumstances where r 4 applies the appellant has not established that there was a miscarriage of justice and leave should not be given to raise this ground.
Grounds 4 & 5
102It is convenient to deal with these grounds together. They are as follows:
""Ground 4: The trial was unfair due to the structure of the indictment and the trial judge erred in declining to quash it or make appropriate orders in relation thereto at the commencement of the trial.
Ground 5: The trial and sentence proceedings miscarried because for [sic] the structure of the indictment and the combination of errors described in the following grounds.""
Grounds 4 & 5: appellant's submissions
103The appellant submitted in relation to ground 4 that the structure of the indictment was unfair in that there was a procedural bias in favour of count 1. He submitted that the presence of 13 alternative counts and seven described offences had an accumulated prejudicial effect and invited compromise by the jury. 
104The appellant acknowledged that in R v Fitzgerald [2004] NSWCCA 5; (2004) 59 NSWLR 493 at [13], Sully J saw no reason why the terms of s 66EA would prevent the charging of seven individual counts, but submitted that the present indictment was far more unwieldy. He submitted that the direction of the trial judge as to the forensic disadvantage in which the appellant was placed did not cure the prejudice.
105Further, the appellant submitted that the indictment required him to respond to 20 allegations occurring between 28 February 2002 and 3 October 2007. The appellant submitted that the defence case focused on attempting to exclude the possibility that any of the incidents could have occurred. However, that process was impossible by virtue of the breadth of the indictment.
106So far as ground 5 was concerned, the appellant submitted that the validity of a charge depends on drafting an indictment and providing particulars that comply with the requirements of s 66EA(5), and that the indictment in question failed to do so. Instead it denied the appellant a fair trial, the only possible defence being a bare denial.
107Orally, senior counsel for the appellant emphasised the difficulty which arises in determining the precise basis on which the jury found the offence proved. He referred to the difficulty this raised in sentencing and the difficulty this would raise on the appeal if it was found that the jury was not entitled to find a contravention of some but not all of the charges. 
108Senior counsel accepted that the overall question in relation to each of these grounds was whether the appellant received a fair trial.
109He submitted that the section did not envisage an ambit claim where the jury could pick three offences over a five-year period. He submitted reasonable particularity could not encompass a period of five years. He submitted that s 66EA(8) provided some support for this proposition. 
Grounds 4 & 5: Crown submissions
110The Crown submitted that the reliance on alternative counts was completely in accordance with s 66EA(10). The Crown contended that the submission that there were too many alternatives did not amount to a defect on the face of the indictment and that no application for a stay based on abuse of process had been made.
111So far as the structure of the indictment was concerned, the Crown pointed out that the framing of the individual counts as alternatives was consistent with the structure of s 66EA, particularly s 66EA(8), s 66EA(9) and s 66EA(10).
112So far as ground 5 was concerned, the Crown submitted that it was the nature of sexual exploitation of children that the relationship continues over months and years leading to numerous cases of sexual acts. It submitted that in itself an indictment containing 10 to 20 counts is not confusing, complex or necessarily inviting compromise and that there is nothing in the legislation which required the Crown to artificially limit the number of actual acts relied upon.
113It submitted that the Crown led evidence in detail outlining the particular offences, the subject of the alternative counts, and designated incidents. It was pointed out that the appellant filed a lengthy alibi notice and both the complainant and GW were extensively cross-examined on the matters raised in it.
114In oral submissions the Crown pointed to the detailed particulars of the alternative charges which were given prior to the trial, describing the incidents by reference to the statement of the complainant and identifying the acts relied upon (Annexure C to the Affidavit of Steven Thomson, sworn on 30 August 2011). 
Grounds 4 & 5: consideration
115I have set out s 66EA above and emphasised that the section itself can lead to an indictment which is inherently duplicitous and one which can place the accused in a position of significant forensic disadvantage. I indicated at [36] the need to direct the jury as to what is said to constitute each sexual offence relied upon in support of the allegations that the section was contravened. In R v Fitzgerald supra, Sully J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, after considering the impact s 66EA had on the decision of the High Court in S v R [1989] HCA 66; (1989) 168 CLR 266, made the following comments [12]:
""Leaving aside for the moment any relevant curial authority, it seems to me that the enactment of s 66EA if it really is intended to make fair by statute what the High Court held to be unfair in the absence of some such provision, entails these propositions:
(1) Proof beyond reasonable doubt that a person has sexually abused a child on three or more occasions will constitute, without more, a contravention of s 66EA.
(2) In particular, it is unnecessary to prove beyond reasonable doubt:
(a) When, precisely, each foundational act of abuse occurred; but it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the dating and timing of each such act lies somewhere within a temporal span, the terminal dates of which have been laid with reasonable precision in the indictment;
(b) 'The exact circumstances' of each such foundational act of abuse; but it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the nature of the alleged foundational act answers the description which is itself stated with reasonable precision in the indictment.""
116In the present case it does not seem to me that the period during which the offences occurred was not specified with reasonable particularity. The start date and the end date for each offence were precisely stated. There does not seem to me to be a basis for limiting the period in respect of which the offences occurred if the nature and timing of the actual foundational offences are made known to the accused and ultimately to the jury. In the present case the nature of each separate offence was set out in the indictment and as the Crown submitted, particulars of the foundational offences were supplied by the Crown. So far as the complaint that the width of the indictment meant that the only defence available was a ""bare denial"", that must be considered in the context that the appellant evidently had sufficient detail to give an account of his movements at the time of the alleged offences and to extensively cross examine the complainant and GW on the allegations in fact made. It does not seem to me that in these circumstances the appellant was limited to a ""bare denial"".
117In those circumstances it does not seem to me that the structure of the indictment denied the appellant a fair trial. It follows that ground 4 of the grounds of appeal is not made out.
118What I have said above is not conclusive of ground 5 which deals with the question of whether the trial and sentence proceedings in fact miscarried because of the structure of the indictment. As the appellant submitted, the basal question on the issue is whether, as a result of the structure of the indictment, the appellant was denied a fair trial.
119The question must be considered in the context of s 66EA. The fact that the appellant was placed at a forensic disadvantage because of the structure of the section does not mean of itself that he was denied a fair trial. The trial judge recognised the existence of the forensic disadvantage and directed the jury to take that into account. He gave the following direction (SU 102):
""In the circumstances I direct you that the accused is at some forensic disadvantage in the sense he may be unable to meet these allegations of sexual misconduct effectively as he might otherwise have done having regard to the ambit times in which the offences alleged to have been committed and the fact that the complainant has not been able to specify or specifically define by a particular date the occurrence of the alleged offences.""
120In circumstances where detailed particulars of the indictment were provided it does not seem to me that the appellant was placed at any greater forensic disadvantage than would arise purely by virtue of the structure of s 66EA. In those circumstances, the trial did not miscarry merely because of the structure of the indictment.
121Although ground 5 of the Notice of Appeal, in its terms, incorporates the subsequent grounds it is more appropriate to deal with those grounds separately.
122The appellant's submissions also refer to the difficulties which would arise if the appeal was made out in relation to some but not all the grounds of appeal. It is more convenient to deal with this issue and the problems which arise on sentencing subsequently in this judgment.
123For these reasons, in my opinion, grounds 4 and 5 are not made out.
Ground 6: The trial judge erred in not requiring the jury to identify the three counts relied upon for count 1 or to give directions regarding clarity or certainty as to the direct counts or ""described offences"" about which the jury was satisfied
124In his written submissions, the appellant pointed out that once the jury had agreed on three separate offences there was no requirement for them to proceed further with their deliberations. He submitted that in those circumstances a failure to enquire meant there could be no certainty as to whether the elements of the offence were established.
125The appellant further submitted that if on appeal an error is identified in relation to any one of the alternative counts or described offences then subject to the proviso the verdict must be set aside. Even in relation to the proviso it was submitted that the Court cannot assume that the jury would have accepted other counts and cannot substitute alternative counts. 
126The appellant also pointed to the difficulty in sentencing, submitting that the sentencing judge can only sentence him for that of the offences of which he was convicted and not for criminal acts in respect of which no jury determination may have taken place.
127The Crown submitted that no application of this nature was made at trial and r 4 applies. In written submissions the Crown pointed to the fact that there was no issue on the correctness of the direction by the trial judge to the jury as to the elements of s 66EA and that it should be assumed that the jury had entered a verdict consistent with those directions.
128The Crown also pointed out that generally speaking there would need to be special reasons or circumstances to make such enquiries and that in the context of the South Australian equivalent to s 66EA, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia described such enquiries as unwise and unnecessary: R v N, SH [2010] SASCFC 74 at [7]-[12].
Ground 6: consideration
129The statute does not require that the jury in delivering a verdict under s 66EA, specify the foundational offences on which the verdict was based. In these circumstances, it is difficult to see how the trial miscarried as a result of failure to question the jury on these issues. This is particularly so given that such enquiries were not sought by counsel for the appellant. Further, it does not seem to me that, assuming adequate directions on the issue, the Court was not entitled to assume that the jury had properly considered the elements of an offence under s 66EA. As I indicated there was no dispute as to the adequacy of these directions in this case.
130Further, seeking such information after the jury had delivered a verdict, although it may be of assistance on appeal or sentence (as to which, see below), could not affect the outcome of the trial. In these circumstances, the conviction arising from the verdict of the jury could not be set aside on this ground. 
131Finally, the courts have consistently emphasised that generally speaking courts should be reluctant to enquire of juries on what basis they reached their verdict; R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 379; R v N, SH supra. In the present case, for the enquiry to be of any real utility it would have to encompass not only the question of which foundational offences led the jury to convict but also which of the remainder they in fact considered and rejected. It does not seem to me desirable to make enquiries of the jury in this fashion. More relevantly, the trial judge did not err in failing to do so.
132It follows that ground 6 has not been made out.
Grounds 7 & 10
133As the matters relied on in relation to ground 10 are also relied on in relation to ground 7 it is convenient to deal with them together. 
134Ground 7 is as follows:
""Particularity, relationship evidence, context evidence and evidence of uncharged acts:
(i) There was inadequate particularity in charged acts
(ii) The trial judge erred by referring the jury to evidence of uncharged acts as evidence capable of supporting charged acts.
(iii) There was a real risk that 'relationship evidence', 'context evidence' and 'evidence of uncharged acts' was misused.""
Ground 10 provided as follows:
""The trial judge erred by directing the jury to consider uncharged acts and failed to particularize [sic] sufficiently the acts alleged in support of Count 9.""
Grounds 7 & 10: appellant's submissions
135The appellant submitted that, given the evidence called in relation to the alternative counts and the described offences, the additional evidence of uncharged acts was unnecessary.  The appellant further submitted that there was a real risk the jury would use the evidence of uncharged acts as evidence in support of the charged counts or as evidence of propensity. The appellant submitted that the evidence of the uncharged acts was entirely interwoven with the evidence of charged acts or described acts and unwittingly both the trial judge and the Crown referred to uncharged acts in support of charged offences. The appellant emphasised that it was not sufficient to demonstrate a general pattern of sexual misconduct, and the need to prove the actual commission of separate acts constituting sexual offences as required by s 66EA.
136In relation to count 9, the appellant referred to the fact that the evidence supporting it lacked particularity and the direction of the trial judge referred to other uncharged acts when describing the conduct in support of count 9. It was submitted that it was indicative of a level of confusion at the trial in relation to the use of charged and uncharged acts.
137In support of ground 10, it was submitted that the trial judge described multiple acts, any one of which could be considered to support a charge of assault with an act of indecency for count 9. The appellant submitted that the summing up provided no way of determining which acts were relied upon for the charged offence and which were tendered as context or similar fact evidence.
138It was submitted that the summing up described a series of acts collectively as ""spooning"", rather than describing single acts, and that the further conduct was described in a general manner.
139The appellant acknowledged that at the commencement of the summing up for count 9 there was an attempt to provide specificity, but stated it was not reflected in the balance of the summing up. He submitted that the summing up did not make it clear whether the incident relied upon for count 9 was or was not the first time lubricant was introduced.
140The appellant submitted that ultimately on count 9, the trial judge referred to a number of different incidents, any one of which could amount to a sexual offence. He submitted the basis on which the evidence was left to the jury allowed for the real possibility that different jurors may have had different incidents in mind when they agreed that a sexual offence had occurred for the purposes of s 66EA.
Grounds 7 & 10: Crown submissions
141The Crown referred to the directions that were given to the jury in relation to the uncharged acts and submitted that no further direction was ever sought. It was submitted that r 4 applies. The Crown also noted that the appellant consistently sought to take advantage of the relationship evidence by cross-examining the complainant, suggesting that the evidence of the complainant as to the extent of the sexual relationship showed that she was unreliable. His counsel also addressed the jury on this basis. 
142The Crown submitted that having regard to the manner in which the Crown had pleaded the charge in the indictment the relevant particulars were known to the appellant, namely, the offence had occurred at Bayview during a two-month period between December 2005 and January 2006. The Crown submitted that although the incident may have given rise to an argument that there was more than one indecent assault, in reality there was one continuous act. 
143The Crown pointed out that the evidence given by the complainant on count 9 referred to a specific incident at Bayview and although the complainant's answers referred to a number of occasions where similar incidents occurred she gave evidence of a particular occasion. The Crown acknowledged that certain parts of the summing up of the trial judge crossed over into the allegations on count 10. However, it was submitted that no redirection was sought and that r 4 applied.
144The Crown made certain general submissions in relation to grounds 8 to 14. In particular, it was suggested that the approach the Court should take was that if any of the grounds of appeal were made out, the Court should consider how many offences were left and whether any of the successful grounds impacted on the credibility of the complainant. The Crown submitted that if they did not and there were more than three counts left then there was no miscarriage of justice. 
145A similar approach was suggested in relation to the submissions of the appellant in respect of ground 12, which said that counts 7, 12 and 13 and described offences (b) and (g) were bad for latent duplicity.
Grounds 7 & 10: consideration - rule 4
146Because the Crown submitted that r 4 applied in relation to these grounds and the subsequent grounds in which it was submitted there was no evidence fit to go to the jury or that there was latent duplicity, it is convenient at this stage to deal with the scope of r 4. Rule 4 provides as follows:
""No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.""
147The effect of the rule was summarised by McHugh J in Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 as follows (at [72]):
""There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the appellant's conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice.  Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence.  In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling.  Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the appellant.  Where the evidence was admissible, but the trial judge had a discretion to limit its use, the burden on the appellant is greater:  the appeal can succeed only if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the discretion would have been exercised in favour of the appellant and that, if it had, it is more likely than not that the appellant would have been acquitted ... ""
148Subsequent cases have established that the following matters are important in considering the operation of r 4:
The requirements of r 4 are not mere technicalities.  The Criminal Appeal Act does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which could or should have been raised at the first trial:  R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at [94], citing with approval R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; (2001) 123 A Crim R 310, 319.  See also Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170].
The appellant must establish that he or she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted:  Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20]-[21].
A failure by counsel to take objection or to raise an issue on summing-up may be explicable by the fact that counsel said nothing hoping to gain an advantage at a later stage, or that counsel took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, counsel saw no injustice as to what was being done:  Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373;  (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 at [10]-[13]; Sanchez v R [2009] NSWCCA 171;  (2009) 196 A Crim R 472 at [58]-[61].
An unexplained failure to take the point at the trial is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness and adequacy of the summing-up:  Tekely v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [88], [130].
149The essence of grounds 7 and 10 is that the trial judge wrongly admitted relationship evidence and did not give adequate directions to the jury as to the use to which it could be put. In particular, the appellant submitted that the trial judge in his directions concerning ground 9 incorporated relationship evidence and evidence of uncharged acts along with evidence of the actual offence such that there was the possibility that the jury used the relationship evidence in reaching the conclusion that the alleged offence, the subject of ground 9, was established. These seem to be matters falling with the ambit of r 4. In those circumstances, in order to obtain leave to raise the matters the subject of grounds 7 and 10, the applicant would have to demonstrate that there was a miscarriage of justice.
150The position is different in respect of those grounds of appeal which contend there was no evidence to enable particular charges to be left to the jury (ground 11 relating to count 10 and ground 13 relating to described offence (e)).
151It does not seem to me that an error in leaving a particular count to a jury could be described as an omission to direct. In consequence, in my opinion, r 4 had no application to this complaint.
152The position is more difficult so far as it relates to the question of latent duplicity (ground 12 in relation to counts 7, 12 and 13 and described offences (b) and (g)). In R v Khouzame & Saliba [1999] NSWCCA 173; (1999) 108 A Crim R 170, a case of alleged latent duplicity, Kirby J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said at [35] that r 4 did not apply to issues of duplicity.  In saying this his Honour relied on R v Locchi (1991) 22 NSWLR 309. By contrast, in R v DH [2000] NSWCCA 360, Stein JA, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, took the view (at [20]) that r 4 could apply in such circumstances.
153Although it seems to me that any problem arising from latent duplicity could be cured by either requiring the Crown to elect or by a clear direction, on the present state of authority and, in particular, where the point was not fully argued, the Court should proceed on the basis that r 4 does not apply. The only case which directly considered the application of the rule in a case of latent duplicity was R v Khouzame & Saliba supra. R v Locchi supra concerned duplicity on the face of an indictment whilst in R v DH supra Stein JA, while stating r 4 did apply, did not elaborate on the reasons for this and ultimately found that there was no latent duplicity. His opinion in those circumstances was obiter.
Grounds 7 & 10: consideration
154As indicated earlier, the relationship evidence was submitted without objection and there was extensive cross-examination on it. It is correct that the particular sexual offences relied on for the purpose of s 66EA have to be proved and that it is not sufficient to prove the offence by evidence of general sexual misconduct (see KBT v R [1997] HCA 54; (1997) 191 CLR 417 at 422, 423, 432, 433; KRM v R supra at [16]-[17]).  Likewise, it is important that the question not be left to the jury in such a way that it would be possible to reason simply from the frequency of the alleged occurrences that the appellant committed the acts complained of (S v R supra at 287). However, in the present case the trial judge gave a specific direction as to the limited use to which evidence of uncharged acts could be put. At the start of the summing up he made the following comments:
""The accused is entitled as is the Crown to a separate consideration of each of the offences charged. It would be quite wrong ladies and gentlemen to say simply because the Crown has proved one of the alleged offences that it follows that the accused must be guilty of another offence or the other offences. It follows that if you find that the accused is not guilty of one of the offences he must be not guilty of the other offences. Each offence alleged must be considered separately in the light of the evidence ..."" (SU 2)
155Whilst he subsequently gave the following direction:
""At the time the complainant commenced to give evidence of this kind, I gave you directions how the evidence could be used and how it could not be used. It is important that I again explain to you the relevance of the evidence of other acts. At the time, I directed you that the evidence of other acts was admitted for the purpose of placing the complainant's evidence of the particular acts relied upon by the Crown to prove the offences set out in the indictment into what the Crown says is a realistic context. The purpose of placing the complainant's evidence of other acts before you was so that the complainant's allegations and the evidence about how she responded to sexual activity with the accused at the times alleged in the indictment could be understood and evaluated. The Crown submits that this evidence of ongoing acts explains why the complainant firstly behaved in the way that she did when she submitted to the accused. Secondly why the complainant was compliant in relation to the sexual acts. Thirdly why the complainant did not rebuff the accused. Fourthly why the complainant did not show distress or resentment towards the accused. Fifthly the ongoing nature of the acts the Crown submits explains why [the complainant] did not complain or tell anyone about what the accused was doing to her for many years. Sixthly why the accused was confident that she would not complain."" (SU 61)
156No objection was taken to these directions. The appellant, in my opinion, has not demonstrated that any miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the admission of the relationship evidence or the general direction given by the trial judge in respect of it. It follows that leave should not be given under r 4 to raise ground 7 to the extent it relates to the use of relationship evidence.
157Ground 10 deals with a specific direction in relation to count 9. I have summarised earlier the evidence given by the complainant in relation to this count. However, in addition, she stated that an incident of the nature in question occurred at Pittwater Road, Bayview (T 112) and also gave the following additional evidence in examination in chief:
""Q. ... on Friday you were giving some evidence about some events that happened when you lived at Bayview?A. Yeah. 
Q. Do you remember what year it was when you moved to Bayview?A. The end of 2005.
Q. Which makes you at the end of 2005 14, is that right?A. Yes.
Q. You told us that there was a day when [the appellant] spoke to you about what you could do if you fell pregnant and you said you were very scared and on that occasion you also described a bottle of lubricant, is that correct?A. Yes.
Q. Whereabouts did that occur?A. In Mum and [the appellant]'s room at Bayview.
Q. You told us that he rubbed the lubricant on you and he said he would do that from behind. What did he do from behind?A. Rub like pour the liquid on to my breasts and my tummy and rub it in when it turned warm in between my legs and on his penis.
Q. What did the lubricant look like, the bottle?A. It was a clear white, white kind of bottle. It was clear liquid.
Q. How large was it?A. About this big (indicated).
CROWN PROSECUTOR: About 7 or 8 centimetres.
HIS HONOUR: Yes.
CROWN PROSECUTOR
Q. After he rubbed the lubricant on you and it went warm, what did he do?A. Then he would put his penis between my legs.
Q. On this particular occasion I think you said you were in his bed?A. Yes.
Q. What did he do that time?A. When he rubbed his penis in between my legs and I would put my hand in between my legs to sort of hold on to it through there and he would rub backwards and forwards and sometimes he would with his hand point his penis up into my vagina but that would hurt so I would sort of squeeze my legs together.
Q. You've just described the incident in your mother's bed with [the appellant] with the lubricant. Was there only one such occasion?A. No.
Q. How many times did that kind of thing occur?A. I don't know, couldn't say.
Q. Was the lubricant used more than once?A. Yes.
Q. You told us that there was an occasion when [the appellant] got a condom out. Can I just clarify with you, where did that occur?A. Once I remember at Bayview and once at Kennedy Place Bayview as well.
Q. The first incident when you said Bayview, which home was that?A. The Pittwater Road."" (T 117-118)
158The complainant thus specifically identified the first occasion when an incident, the nature of that complained of, took place and that it took place at Pittwater Road, Bayview.
159In the opening address of the Crown in relation to this count, the following comments were made:
""For alternative to count 9 that is a different charge to the ones we have looked at so far, it is a charge of indecent assault, and the allegation there is that the accused put some liquid on his and the complainant's body and he rubbed his penis on her genitals, and whether or not such an act is considered to be indecent is a question for you as members of the community. I expect the evidence will be ultimately the accused ejaculated on the complainant."" (T 35-36)
160During closing addresses the Crown made the following remarks about count 9:
""[The complainant]'s evidence about this incident was this -
'Well, at this stage it had been going on for a long time now so it became quite natural and I knew one time Mum was not in the house, we were alone, and [the appellant] touched me like the other times with his hands down my vagina and at this stage I remember the spooning started. So [the appellant] would be lying behind me and he would start by touching my breasts from behind me and then pull down my pants from behind and put his penis in between my legs from behind me and he would hold his penis in between my legs and get me to grab it from the other side of my legs. So I put my hand through the front of my legs and moved forwards and backwards.'
She said that happened around the time of Pittwater Road, Bayview. She said:
'He sometimes ejaculated in between my legs and it always really upset me, but one day when that happened, [the complainant] said to me not to worry because if I fell pregnant he could arrange an abortion and it would just be a secret and that really scared me. I was really, really scared of that.' - [the complainant] said - 'Sometimes he would get this little bottle of lubricant out of his side drawer. It was just cold and gooey. He would rub it on my breasts and my tummy and in between my legs and in my vagina and on his penis and either do that from behind.'
She said,
'Once he got on top of me and put his penis in between my legs and tried to push it into my vagina, but I would squirm away and that would hurt me.'
I think that evidence actually relates to the next count, members of the jury and I'll come back to that."" (T 2523)
161The written directions given by the trial judge to the jury under the heading ""The occasion involving lubricant - Pittwater Rd Bayview"" contained the same description as was given by the complainant. A general description was given of spooning, her rubbing his penis in between her legs, him rubbing lubricant over her body and his penis, him ejaculating between her legs.
162The written directions to the jury also contained evidence about the appellant trying to push his penis into her vagina. Thus, in common with the Crown, the written directions strayed into the evidence relating to count 10.
163The oral direction to the jury was to the following effect:
""Now ladies and gentlemen the occasion has been described in the trial as the occasion involving lubricant at Pittwater Road, Bayview. The complainant gave evidence of an occasion that occurred in the bedroom occupied by her mother and the accused at Pittwater Road, Bayview. She said that this occurred at a time just after she had finished year nine at school. The complainant said that by this time the acts involved what she referred to as spooning. She said that the accused would be lying behind her and would start by touching her breasts from behind her. She said that the accused would pull down her pants from behind and put his penis in between her legs from behind her. She said that the accused would hold his penis in between her legs and get her to grab his penis. She said that she would put her hands through the front of her legs and move backwards and forwards. 
The complainant said that when she was at Pittwater Road the accused produced a bottle of lubricant. She said that the accused rubbed the lubricant on her breasts and in between her legs and in her vagina and on his penis. She said that the lubricant was cold and gooey, she said that after the first occasion he would produce the bottle from his side drawer. The complainant said that the accused sometimes ejaculated in between her legs and that really upset her. She said that on one day when that happened the accused told her not to worry because if she fell pregnant he could arrange an abortion and it would be just a secret. She said that that really scared her.
The complainant said that on one occasion the accused got on top of her and put his penis in between her legs and tried to put his penis into her vagina with his hand. She said that she did not want the accused's penis to go inside her which she never let happen and the accused never forced that. She said that when the accused would ejaculate on her tummy and over her legs he would get a towel for her to wipe herself and she would have a shower because that would really scare her. She said she was really scared of getting pregnant."" (SU 34-35)
164It is correct that both in relation to the written directions and the summing up, the trial judge went beyond the actual elements of count 9 and strayed into the evidence in relation to alternate count 10 and generalised evidence in relation to similar incidents. However, the evidence, the Crown's address and the summing up refer to the incident at Pittwater Road, Bayview, and what was said to have constituted the offence. In circumstances where the occasion of the offence and the elements of the offence were exposed to the jury, albeit in conjunction with other evidence, the appellant, in my opinion, has not established a miscarriage of justice. In these circumstances leave should not be given under r 4 to raise this ground.
165It follows that grounds 7 and 10 of the grounds of appeal should be dismissed.
Ground 8:  The trial judge erred by directing the jury to consider uncharged acts and failed to particularise sufficiently the acts alleged in respect of count 4
166The appellant submitted that the directions given by the trial judge in respect of count 4 did not direct the jury to the particular evidence in support of that offence but rather invited the jury to accept generalised evidence of sexual acts instead of a specific act.
167He submitted that the evidence of the complainant was also in generalised form and did not describe a specific act capable of amounting to sexual intercourse. He submitted that the evidence of digital penetration was general and not necessarily linked to the incident. He stated the first incident in which the complainant gave evidence of the appellant making her touch his penis made no reference to sexual intercourse and that subsequent evidence she gave did not relate to a specific incident. The appellant also tentatively suggested there was insufficient evidence for this offence to be left to the jury, but this did not form part of the grounds of appeal.
168The Crown submitted that the effect of the complainant's evidence was that she recalled the first time that she touched the appellant's penis and gave an account that on this first time he also placed his fingers inside her vagina. It was submitted that this was consistent with the opening by the Crown Prosecutor.
169The Crown acknowledged that the direction of the trial judge contained aspects of ongoing relationship evidence but submitted that having regard to the directions he made in relation to the use to which that evidence could be put, his references to relationship evidence did not give rise to problems of the nature identified in S v R supra. 
170The Crown also referred to the fact that no objection was taken to the direction of the trial judge at the trial and submitted that in those circumstances r 4 applied.
Ground 8: consideration
171Because of the nature of the submission it is necessary to set out the evidence of the complainant on this count in full:
""Q. What happened when the touching changed? I think you said it progressed. What did it progress to?A. After a while when - the first time I remember this happening was in mum and [the appellant]'s bed at [the farm] and [the appellant] was touching me like before and he moved my hand on to his penis, on the outside of his pants, and at that time I remember moving it away, just being caught unaware, not liking that, and then eventually that became normal and it became a part of it as well.
Q. This first time that you recall that happening, do you know how old you were, how long after the touching it first started happening?A. Seven or eight months to a year maybe.
Q. Do you know whether you were still in year 6 or whether you had gone into year 7?A. I think it was around the time of year 7.
Q. You said that he touched you like he did before. I need to ask you what it was that he did when he touched you on the first occasion when he had you touch his penis?A. It would start with his hand on my knee moving up my thigh, usually touching on the outside of my underwear, at first on my vagina and then underneath my pants, touching on and in, stroking with his fingers.
Q. Did you ever feel pain when he touched you in your vagina on any of these occasions?A. After a while as it became more normal he started to put his finger further in my vagina and sometimes that would hurt, the first couple of times that really hurt and I would squirm away and it would stop and, yeah, that became more normal as well.
Q. Do you know where your mum was when [the appellant] made you touch his penis that first time?A. No.
Q. She wasn't-A. She wasn't there.
Q. What did his penis feel like, can you remember?A. Well, the very first bit was on the outside, and then after a couple of times he would take his pants down and say to me, 'Touch my cock,' and would move my hand to his penis where my hand would be wrapped around his penis and it just felt like skin.
Q. How did you feel?A. Uncomfortable at that.
Q. Did you say anything to him about feeling uncomfortable?A. I remember pulling my hand away the first couple of times and sort of mumbling, 'No,' but I've never spoke."" (T 94-95)
172The questions and answers, particularly the first and fourth, seem to make it clear that what the complainant was saying was that on the first occasion the appellant made her touch his penis, digital penetration also occurred. It is in that context that the address by the prosecution and the summing up by the trial judge needs to be considered.
173In opening the Crown made the following remarks:
""For number 4, an alternative to count 1, the act relied upon is digital penetration again. On that occasion I expect the evidence will be that the accused also placed the complainant's hands on his penis and had her manipulate it."" (T 35-36)
174In the closing address, the Crown made the following remarks:
""The evidence in relation to count 4 which is an alternative to count 1 is a charge of sexual intercourse with a person between ten and 16 who is under authority. 
... 
She said, 
'It would start with his hand on my knee, moving up my thigh, usually touching on the outside of my underwear, at first on my vagina and then underneath my pants, touching on and in, stroking with this fingers.'
And it's penetration that the Crown relies upon for this count."" (T 2516-2517)
175In his summing up, the trial judge referred to the incident as involving digital penetration as well as the complainant touching the appellant's penis. In his written directions headed ""The occasion when the accused made her touch his penis at [the farm]"" he stated the complainant described a particular occasion when she said that the appellant made her touch his penis. He said that the complainant stated this was around seven months to one year after the first incident at the farm and was around the time she was in year 7. He referred to the evidence in these terms:
""The complainant said that from that time the touching of his penis 'became part of it as well'. She said that the accused would start with his hand on her knee moving up her thigh usually touching her vagina on the outside of her underwear and then underneath, touching on and in her vagina stroking with his fingers."" (Written Directions 7)
176In my opinion, taking into account the evidence of the complainant, the opening and closing of the Crown and the direction by the trial judge, the nature of the offence (digital penetration) and the occasion on which it occurred were identified in sufficient detail to the jury. It was appropriate to describe the touching of the penis because it was part of the circumstances in which the offence occurred and helped to distinguish this incident of digital penetration from the other incidents occurring on different occasions. To that extent, in my opinion, the direction was adequate.
177It is correct that the trial judge, in giving the direction, went beyond the circumstances going to the commission of the offence and straight into evidence of uncharged acts. However, having regard to the specific directions given to the jury as to the use that could be made of relationship evidence and evidence of uncharged acts, it does not seem to me that there was any miscarriage of justice. In these circumstances, leave should not be given under r 4 to raise this ground.
178It follows that ground 8 of the grounds of appeal should be dismissed.
Ground 9:  the trial judge erred by directing the jury to consider uncharged acts and failed to particularise sufficiently the acts alleged in support of count 6
179In relation to this count the appellant submitted first that the evidence in support of it lacked sufficient particularity. He submitted that the complainant appeared to be referring to a number of incidents and there was nothing distinctive about the evidence of the alleged offence from the other uncharged acts involving ""oral intercourse"" alleged to have occurred during this period. In this regard he placed reliance on what was said in S v R supra at 271.
180He submitted that the manner in which the offence was put to the jury provided no particularity and clearly referred to multiple incidents and multiple locations. He stated that the evidence of the complainant was sufficiently general that it was not possible for the jury to distinguish between an alleged course of conduct involving cunnilingus and a specific offence.
181The Crown by contrast submitted that the evidence made clear the place where the offence was alleged to have occurred, the farm, and the time frame, namely when the complainant was 13.
182The Crown submitted that the complainant in fact gave evidence that she recalled the particular incident the subject of count 6, namely, the incident on the bed at the farm.  It was submitted that whilst some aspects of her evidence drifted into the generalised relationship it would have been clear to the jury she was being asked about an occasion at the farm being the first occasion the appellant placed his mouth upon her vagina.
183The Crown pointed out that the written directions of the trial judge under the heading, ""Occasion of oral sexual intercourse at [the farm]"", did not suggest the offence in count 6 could be established as having occurred anywhere else and focused on the particular incident which took place.
184The Crown also submitted that this was another instance in which r 4 applied.
Ground 9: consideration
185I summarised the evidence in relation to count 6 earlier in the judgment.  That summary shows that the time, place and nature of the offence were referred to. However, because of the submissions made by the appellant, the complainant's evidence should be set out in detail:
""Q. Did the touching with [the appellant] progress; you told us that it started with him touching and then he had you touch him. Did something else happen?A. Yes.
Q. What was that?A. He began to put his mouth on my vagina.
Q. Can you remember the first time that he did that?A. I'm not quite sure.  I think it might be in my statement. I can't remember at the moment.
Q. How old were you when that sort of touching first happened?A. It was quite a while after it all first started. Maybe the end of year 7, year 8, around that time.
Q. Was anything said?A. Yes. He would say to me, 'Do you want me to suck your pussy?'
Q. Did you understand as a 12 or 13 year old child what that meant?A. I knew that pussy was my vagina.
Q. Did you say anything to him in response when he said that to you?A. I could never, ever speak verbally. I just couldn't ever speak when all those things were said, so it would just be me letting him do that, but I guess it was me saying 'yes' or 'no', but I never said anything.
Q. Why wouldn't you speak?A. I'm not sure. I just sort of got really tight. At this stage it had become normal, but there was still something not quite right about it for me in my naivety, I guess.
Q. Would you tell us what he did when I think your words were that he put his mouth on your vagina. What did he do?A. He would start just by touching, and then after that he would say, 'Do you want me to suck your pussy?' And then he would get down on his knees between my legs on the bed, pull my pants down to my knees and one leg of mine would bend up so my legs would open, he would lay between my legs and hold my legs apart and put his mouth on my vagina.
Q. What would he do with his mouth on your vagina?A. Lick it with the tongue.
Q. Whereabouts?A. In my vagina.
Q. When you say you were on the bed, are you recalling a particular incident on the bed?A. Their bed at [the farm], the boat bed and after that we moved on."" (T 97-98)
186It can be seen from this evidence that the complainant identified the first time that such an incident occurred was when she was in year 7 or 8.  The subsequent questions seem to me to be asked by reference to that evidence. She described what she said occurred and said one instance was on the bed at [the farm].
187The Crown's closing address summarised the evidence to which I have referred above and included the following comments:
""She described him licking in her vagina with her [sic] tongue, and it's the connection between the accused's mouth and the complainant's genitals that's relied upon by the Crown for this count."" (T 2518)
188The trial judge gave written directions under the heading, ""Occasion of oral sexual intercourse at [the farm]"".  The direction was as follows:
""The complainant said that at about the time when she was 13 and still living at [the farm] the accused began putting his mouth on her vagina.  She said that she was in year seven or year eight.  She said that the accused would ask her 'do you want me to suck your pussy'. She said she knew the term 'pussy' was a reference to her vagina.
The complainant said that the accused would commence by touching her and then after he would say, 'do you want me to suck your pussy'. He would then get down on his knees between her legs and pull her pants down to her knees.  She said that her knee would be bent so her legs would be open. She said the accused would lay between her legs and put his mouth on her vagina.
The complainant said the accused would lick in her vagina with his tongue."" (Written Directions 9)
189Having regard to the complainant's evidence, the closing address to the jury, and importantly the direction given by the trial judge, the time, place and nature of this offence were explained to the jury in a manner sufficient for s 66EA. In these circumstances it does not seem to me that in relation to this count the problems identified in S v R supra arise.
190It follows that this ground of appeal should also be dismissed.
Grounds 11 & 13
191Ground 11 is as follows:
""Having regard to the evidence there was insufficient evidence for Count 10 to have been left to the jury."" 
Whilst ground 13 is as follows:
""Described offence 'e' - Having regard to the evidence there was insufficient evidence for the described offence to have been left with the jury.""
192Because these grounds raise similar issues it is convenient that they be dealt with together.
193I have set out the evidence in relation to alternative count 10 and described offence (e). The appellant stated that described offence (e) was similar to the incident the subject of count 10.
194The appellant submitted in relation to each count that there was no evidence of sexual intercourse.  The evidence was that the appellant tried to put his penis in her vagina but she squirmed away because it hurt and she did not want to have sex.
195The Crown referred to the fact that part of the evidence given by the complainant in relation to alternative count 10 was that the appellant's penis touched her vagina. It was submitted that s 61H of the Crimes Act described sexual intercourse as penetration of the genitalia to any extent.  The Crown submitted that in those circumstances there was evidence fit to go to the jury.  Similar submissions were made in relation to described offence (e).
Grounds 11 & 13: consideration
196The trial judge would only be entitled to direct a verdict of acquittal if he concluded that there was no evidence on which a jury could properly convict:  R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 at 81, 83.  In so doing he would have to determine all inferences favourable to the Crown:  R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39.
197In my opinion having regard to the evidence of the complainant, particularly the fact that she said the appellant pointed his penis at her vagina and she squirmed away, there was not evidence fit to go to the jury on this count.  Put shortly, the complainant gave no evidence of penetration whatsoever.
198To that extent ground 11 and ground 13 are made out.
199However, it must be remembered that in relation to each of count 10 and described offence (e) the trial judge directed the jury that it would be open to them to return a verdict of attempted sexual intercourse without consent.  No objection was taken to this direction.  For the purposes of s 66EA, an attempt to commit a sexual offence is sufficient to constitute one of the three offences necessary for a conviction under that provision.
Ground 12: counts 7, 12 and 13 and described offences (b) and (g) are bad for latent duplicity
200It is convenient to deal with each of the counts the subject of this ground of appeal separately.
Ground 12: count 7
201The appellant submits correctly that the written direction on this count said that the evidence of the complainant was that the appellant touched her breast and pulled off her pants and put his finger into her vagina.  The trial judge directed the jury that the complainant had said that the appellant also put his mouth on her vagina.  That direction was consistent with the evidence given by the complainant as summarised above (at [15]).  The appellant also submitted that the Crown's address, referring to both digital penetration and cunnilingus, did not direct the jury to the particular act in support of the charge and stated it was these acts that the Crown relied on for sexual intercourse on that particular count.
202The Crown did not dispute these matters but said r 4 applied.  The Crown further submitted that the argument was logically flawed as it would be impossible for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that digital penetration occurred but not cunnilingus and vice versa.
203As I indicated earlier (at [153]), in my opinion r 4 does not have any application to a ground relying upon latent duplicity.  Further, it was not submitted by the Crown that the two acts encapsulated in the evidence and the directions fell within the exception to the rule against latent duplicity, which arises when the offences were constituted by continuous activity:  see Walsh v Tattersall (1986) 188 CLR 77 at 91, 107.
204That conclusion is not affected by the Crown's submission that it would be ""illogical"" for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of one but not the other of the two acts said to constitute the offence.  That submission, however, does have relevance in relation to the proviso which I will deal with shortly.  
205It follows that the ground of appeal so far as it relates to count 7 is made out.
Ground 12: count 12
206An identical problem arose in relation to count 12.  The evidence of the complainant in relation to this count is summarised in [20] above.  The Crown in both opening and closing described the offence as an allegation of digital penetration and cunnilingus.  The trial judge in his directions described it in similar terms.  
207Similar submissions were made by each party in relation to this count. For the same reasons I have given in relation to count 7, the submissions of the Crown should be rejected.  It follows that this ground of appeal so far as it relates to count 12 is made out.
Ground 12: count 13
208As with count 12 the complainant's description of the offence (see [21]), the opening and closing by the Crown and the direction by the trial judge referred to two acts which would constitute a sexual offence, digital penetration and cunnilingus.  
209Similar problems thus arise as with count 12, and for the reasons given in relation to counts 7 and 12, this ground of appeal is made out so far as it relates to count 13.
Ground 12: described offence (b)
210An identical situation arose in respect to described offence (b).  The evidence referred to in relation to described offence (b) described acts of both digital penetration and cunnilingus (see [24] above).  The Crown Prosecutor's address and the summing up of the trial judge relating to the incident described both acts without specifying which one was the subject of the particular described offence.  In these circumstances, for the reasons given in relation to count 7, this ground of appeal is made out so far as it relates to this described offence.
Ground 12: described offence (g)
211The evidence in relation to described offence (g) (see [30] above), referred again to both digital penetration and cunnilingus.  The Crown Prosecutor in his address and the trial judge in his directions referred to both acts without specifying which one constituted the described offence.  In these circumstances, for the same reason as given in relation to the other counts the subject of this ground of appeal, this ground of appeal is made out.
Grounds 14 & 15
212These grounds of appeal were not pressed.
The Proviso
213It follows from what I have written above, that the appellant has been successful in making out his challenges to count 10 of the indictment (ground 11), described offence (e) of the indictment (ground 13) and counts 7, 12 and 13 of the indictment and described offences (b) and (g) (ground 12).  None of these findings, which are favourable to the appellant, in any way impeach the veracity of the complainant which the jury must have accepted in relation to at least three of the charged or described offences and also do not in any way impeach the remaining nine alternative counts and four described offences.
214In these circumstances it is necessary to consider whether the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act applies and whether the appeal should be dismissed on the ground that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.
215There will have been a substantial miscarriage of justice if the appellant has lost the chance of an acquittal that was fairly open to him or, put another way, a real chance of acquittal.  Unless it can be said that a jury acting reasonably on evidence properly before it and applying the correct standard of proof would inevitably have convicted, the verdict must be set aside:  see Wilde v R [1988] HCA 6; (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 372.  As was said in Glennon v R [1994] HCA 7; (1994) 179 CLR 1 at 8-9, to apply the proviso the court must be satisfied that in the absence of the misdirection the jury would inevitably have reached the same verdict.  That is so even if the case against the appellant is otherwise a strong one. (See also Weiss v R [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [41]-[47], and Carney v R; Cambey v R [2011] NSWCCA 223 at [72]-[92].) 
216In the present case there is no way of knowing which counts the jury considered and relied upon in convicting the appellant under s 66EA.  The Crown submitted that the proviso should be applied if, following consideration of the grounds of appeal, there were more than three counts or described offences remaining and the successful grounds did not affect the credibility of the complainant.  This was based on the proposition that the jury in entering a verdict under s 66EA must have accepted the complainant's evidence and, therefore, either found or would have found some of the other alternative counts or described offences established beyond reasonable doubt even if the jury's verdict was based on one of the counts suffering from latent duplicity.
217I do not think that this broad proposition is necessarily correct.  Although the case was undoubtedly a strong one, having regard to the admission by the appellant on the telephone recording and the evidence of the complainant, it does not seem to me that it would inevitably follow that the jury would have convicted in reliance on other counts.  This does not mean however the proviso cannot operate in circumstances where, if the jury had been properly directed on the counts in question, they would inevitably have convicted.
218It follows that I also do not accept the appellant's submission that if one or more grounds of appeal are made out then the proviso has no operation because the jury may have convicted on one or more of the counts which were the subject of a successful appeal, and thus could not have properly determined that the requisite three offences to constitute a contravention of s 66EA had occurred.
219In those circumstances it is necessary, in my opinion, to have regard to each of the successfully challenged counts in question to see if there was a substantial miscarriage of justice in the sense which I have described.
220In relation to count 10 and described offence (e), although I have found that there was insufficient evidence to establish sexual intercourse, in each case the trial judge properly left the alternative of attempted sexual intercourse to the jury.  The evidence of the complainant, whilst not establishing sexual intercourse, clearly establishes attempted sexual intercourse.  In those circumstances, assuming that the jury in fact convicted in reliance on count 10 and described offence (e), if they had been directed that they could only consider attempted sexual intercourse for the purpose of these incidents, in my view the jury inevitably would have so convicted given that the jury clearly accepted the complainant's evidence.  
221It follows, so far as this count and described offence are concerned, that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice.
222So far as counts 7, 12, 13 and described offences (b) and (g) are concerned, there are three alternatives.  First, no reliance was placed on them by the jury in reaching their verdict.  In these circumstances the error will not occasion any substantial miscarriage of justice.  Second, the jury rejected the complainant's evidence on some or all of these counts and described offences.  In those circumstances once again there would be no substantial miscarriage of justice as it would follow that the jury relied on other counts and described offences in reaching their conclusion.  
223The third alternative is that the jury relied on one or more of these counts and described offences in reaching their conclusion but some members relied on the act of digital penetration and others on the act of oral intercourse.  Although at first glance this may seem problematic, reliance on these counts or described offences would inevitably mean that the jury accepted the evidence of the complainant as to what occurred in relation to these acts. It follows, in my opinion, that had the jury been properly directed that they could only take account of one of the two single acts, they would inevitably have reached the same conclusion.  There was no cross-examination in relation to these counts to the effect that only one of the two impugned acts occurred.  Nor was such a proposition suggested to the jury by counsel for the defence.  Further, although I have concluded that r 4 does not apply, I am fortified in the view that I have reached by the fact that counsel for the defence took no issue at trial as to the manner in which these counts were left to the jury.
224In those circumstances, in my opinion, the errors to which I have referred did not lead to a substantial miscarriage of justice.
225It follows that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.
The appeal against sentence
226In sentencing the appellant, the trial judge adopted the Crown submission that the sentencing should proceed on the basis that each of the foundational sexual offences referred to as alternative counts or described offences, occurred.  He acknowledged that in proceeding to sentence on the count for which the offender was convicted (namely the offence under s 66EA), before he took into account any foundational offence he must be satisfied that each occurred within the date set out in the indictment, and satisfied as to the nature of each offence.  He proceeded on that basis, finding that all of the foundational offences, except the one of penile penetration the subject of count 10, had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.  He acknowledged that the uncharged offences could not be used to increase the penalty provided under s 66EA, and that the fact that the foundational offences may be representative of a broader course of conduct could not be taken into account as an aggravating feature (Remarks on Sentence 28).
227The appellant submits that the trial judge erred by taking into account on sentence offences for which the offender was not convicted.  The appellant submits that he should have been sentenced on the basis that he committed only three offences.
228In support of this submission the appellant placed particular reliance on what was said by Spigelman CJ in R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209; (2000) 112 A Crim R 466 where his Honour (at [74]) cited with approval what was said by Lord Bingham CJ in R v Kidd [1998] 1 WLR 604:
""A defendant is not to be convicted of any offence with which he is charged unless and until his guilt is proved. Such guilt may be proved by his own admission or (on indictment) by the verdict of a jury. He may be sentenced only for an offence proved against him (by admission or verdict) or which he has admitted and asked the court to take into consideration when passing sentence: see Anderson [1978] AC 964. If, as we think, these are basic principles underlying the administration of the criminal law, it is not easy to see how a defendant can lawfully be punished for offences for which he has not been indicted and which he has denied or declined to admit.
It is said that the trial judge, in the light of the jury's verdict can form his own judgment of the evidence he has heard on the extent of the offending conduct beyond the instances specified in individual counts. But this, as it was put in Hutchison [1972] 1 WLR 398 at 400; [1972] 1 All ER 936 at 937; (1972) 56 Cr App R 307 at 309 is to 'deprive the appellant of his right to trial by jury in respect of the other alleged offences'. Unless such other offences are admitted, such deprivation cannot in our view be consistent with principle.""
229The appellant submitted that in the present case to sentence on the basis that more than three foundational offences occurred would involve the appellant being sentenced for more offences than those for which he was convicted.  It is submitted that in these circumstances the trial judge fell into error in his approach to sentencing.  He submitted that a sentence for more than three offences was inconsistent with the jury's verdict:  see R v Isaacs supra at 378.
230The difficulty with the appellant's submission is that he was not being sentenced for the commission of three offences or, for that matter, for the commission of three representative offences.  He was sentenced for a contravention of s 66EA(1), which related to the commission of three or more sexual offences on three or more separate occasions during a period.  If the jury entered a verdict on this offence and, as will generally be the case, do no more than this, it is not inappropriate in my opinion for the trial judge to consider which of the foundational offences were established beyond reasonable doubt so as to sentence in accordance with the verdict of the jury.  Although the question does not appear to have been considered in this State (the remarks of Sully J in R v Fitzgerald supra were made in the context of a plea of guilty for an indictment under s 66EA relying on seven foundational offences), what I have said appears to me to be consistent with the approach taken by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Tasmania in Emery v R supra.  In that case Slicer J made the following remarks (at [32]):
""Two examples can be given of the effect of these competing considerations.  The first is that the verdict of the jury might reflect satisfaction only as to one period of the relationship or as to a limited number of occurrences, yet the sentence might reflect the whole of the charge or all of the particulars charged.  In the circumstances, the jury might not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there had been an act of rape.""
Whilst Evans J made the following remarks (at [44]):
""The learned trial judge expressly sentenced the accused on the basis that one of the unlawful sexual acts upon which his conviction was founded was the rape which occurred on the fifth occasion.  In my respectful view, his Honour was quite correct in sentencing the accused on this basis.  His Honour was obliged to determine the factual basis for the sentence.  In doing so, he was obliged to adopt a view of the facts which was consistent with the verdict.  He was not entitled to proceed on any view of the facts necessarily negatived by the jury's verdict.  Authorities in which these principles have been recognised in this jurisdiction include:  Prokopiec [1982] Tas R 170;  (1982) 7 A Crim R 116, Gill (unreported, Supreme Court, Tas, No 134 of 1989, 10 October 1989), Bresnehan (1992) 1 Tas R 234, Parker (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, Tas, No 81 of 1993, 21 July 1994) and McKenzie [1999] TASSC 54.""
231The approach was also consistent with what was said by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in R v D (1997) 69 SASR 413 where the Court considered the appropriate method of sentencing under the South Australian equivalent to s 66EA.  In that case Doyle CJ made the following remarks (at 420):
""In my opinion, the approach to be taken under s 74, in a case like the present one, is this.  The court should identify the different offences involved and the maximum punishment that they attract.  In the present case the offences are unlawful sexual intercourse with a child above the age of twelve years, that attracts a maximum punishment of seven years imprisonment, and indecent assault on a child above the age of 12 years, that attracts a maximum punishment of eight years imprisonment.  It is not necessary to identify the number of offences committed with any precision, although if that can be done readily, there is no reason why it should not be done.  An approach which requires one to identify the number of offences with precision, would simply reintroduce the very problem at which s 74 is aimed.  It is sufficient to make an assessment in a general way of the frequency of the offending.  In my opinion one should then consider the likely sentence if the offender fell to be sentenced under the provision that creates the relevant offence or offences, as distinct from under s 74, and on the basis that the offender is sentenced in respect of a number of representative offences, those offences being treated as offences which are part of a course of conduct involving similar conduct.
In this way, the court will still have regard to the duration of the offending, the seriousness of the offences involved, and the frequency of the offending.  But the court will not be accumulating a series of maxima produced by multiplying the number of individual offences that can be identified by the applicable statutory maxima."" [emphasis added]
232The approach referred to in R v D supra was recently followed by another decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in R v Fleming [2011] SASCFC 75 at [19]-[23].  
233Such an approach does not, in my opinion, involve sentencing in a manner inconsistent with a verdict of the jury and is consistent with the duty of the judge to determine the facts relevant to the exercise of his or her discretion on sentencing:  see R v Isaacs supra at 378; Cheung v R [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1 at [4]-[8], [161]-[166].
234It follows that the ground of appeal in relation to sentence is not made out.
235In these circumstances leave to appeal against sentence should be allowed but the appeal dismissed.
236JAMES J: I agree with Bathurst CJ.
237JOHNSON J: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

2758359,R v Kirchner [2011] NSWSC 1516,"Judgment 

1The offender, Aaron John Kirchner, stands for sentence for the murder of Scott Bryan. He was arrested on 23 April 2010 in Queensland. He pleaded not guilty to the offence in the Local Court, but admitted his offence on 19 October 2011, on the day that the hearing was due to commence in this Court in Queanbeyan. The plea was entered before the jury was empanelled. In entering his plea, the offender said that it was on the basis that he had aided and abetted in the murder. It is common ground that it was not the offender who fired the shot which killed Scott Bryan. 

2Also before the Court is a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 in relation to a charge of buy a firearm without a license. It is common ground between the parties that this charge should be dismissed. 

3The maximum penalty for the crime of murder is life imprisonment (s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900). The maximum penalty for a person who aids and abets the commission of an offence, a principal in the second degree, is the same as for the person who actually commits that offence (s 345 of the Crimes Ac t). A principal in the second degree is a person who is present, aiding and abetting or encouraging the person who actually commits the offence, but plays no part in the commission of the offence and is not present as a part of a joint criminal enterprise (see Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; (1998) 197 CLR 316). 

4Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ('the Act') requires that a sentence of life imprisonment be imposed if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme, that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence. The Crown did not seek such a sentence in this case. It was argued for the offender that such a sentence could not be imposed, this being an offence not falling within the worst category. The offender was a principal in the second degree, with his culpability falling below that of the co-accused, without significant aggravating circumstances arising to be considered on the sentence. I am satisfied that those submissions must be accepted. 

5The Parliament has also imposed a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment under s 54A of the Act for an offence of murder falling in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of such offences. A non-parole period is the minimum period that an offender will serve in prison for the offence, before being released on parole for the balance of the sentence. Both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period are factors which must be taken into account on sentencing, even in the case of a plea, in the way recently discussed in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 85 ALJR 1154. Also to be noted in this case, however, is the view that the standard non-parole period does not apply to offences of aid and abet murder (see R v Aoun [2006] NSWSC 800 at [40]; Aoun v R [2007] NSWCCA 292). 

6Also to be taken into account is s 44(2) of the Act, which specifies that ""[t]he balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more"". If there is to be any adjustment, it must not be such as to reduce the non-parole period below the minimum term which justice requires the offender to serve (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628). 

7In this case, the effect of s 23 of the Act must also be considered. It allows a lesser penalty to be imposed on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned, or any other offence. The section provides a range of specific factors which must be considered. It also requires that the sentence imposed as a result, must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence in question. 

The Evidence 

8The offender did not give evidence, but the parties agreed on the facts. They were that Scott Bryan and the offender's co-accused, had been friends for a number of years. They were both being treated for schizophrenia, probably developed as the result of chronic cannabis abuse, or at least exacerbated by such abuse. The offender was employed by the co-accused in a lawn mowing business. They both regularly smoked cannabis. 

9Scott Bryan was not employed. He lived alone and was medicated for his mental illness and for a blood clot condition. He was unable to walk long distances as a result of this condition. He was reported missing by a mental health worker in December 2008. 

10On 5 December 2008, police attended Scott Bryan's unit. It was found locked. His wallet, keys and his medication, as well as a bowl with cannabis residue and a bong were found there. There was no sign of foul play, a struggle, or any intended long term departure. His mobile phone was not found. On 12 December when police returned to the unit, there was no evidence that anyone had entered. 

11In April 2009, the co-accused, was interviewed by police while in custody on unrelated matters. He denied any knowledge or involvement in the disappearance of Scott Bryan. 

12Scott Bryan's body was discovered at about 9.30am on 23 June 2009 in a thickly vegetated area near a creek bed in the Nelligen area where the co-accused lived. A shallow grave with a boot and dark coloured T-shirt were found protruding from the ground. The post mortem established that the cause of death was a shotgun wound to the head. 

13On 30 June 2009, the offender was interviewed by police, but he denied any involvement in Scott Bryan's death. In April 2010, he was arrested in Queensland. He then made admissions to being present at the time of the murder, but maintained that the co-accused committed the murder; that he was not aware of what the co-accused had planned to do; and was shocked when he witnessed the shooting. He also denied assisting the co-accused with the murder, or burying the body, but assisted police in a re-enactment of the murder at the crime scene. He was then charged. 

14On 5 May 2011, the offender was interviewed again. He then made admissions to assisting the co-accused with the burial of Scott Bryan's body on the morning after the murder. The plea of guilty entered in October 2011, acknowledged that shortly before the murder, the offender became aware that the co-accused intended to kill Scott Bryan. It also acknowledged that by his presence and willingness to assist, if necessary, the offender aided and abetted in the murder of Scott Bryan. 

15Also in evidence were the offender's criminal history, which showed a number of offences, in respect of almost all of which small fines were imposed. There was also a three year license disqualification and 100 hours community service order, for a driving offence and another disqualification of nine months. In the case of an offence for possessing a knife, a fine and good behaviour bond were imposed. 

16There were various documents in evidence, including transcript of police interviews in which the offender made various admissions; a report of Dr Peter Ashkar, a consultant forensic psychologist who had examined the offender; letters from Josephine Kirchner and Ross Kirchner, which both spoke of the offender's troubled childhood and behavioural problems; and various documents from the Crown brief which exemplify correspondence written by the co-accused since his arrest. 

17Dr Ashkar's report indicated that the offender is aged 27 years, a single man with no children. He was lucid and showed no signs of perceptual disturbance or disordered thought. The offender gave an account of his family background and life, describing a happy childhood and stable family environment. He was treated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, between ages 10 to 13 years. He had no other psychiatric history, but had commenced to smoke cannabis as a teenager. He carried a knife and had poor school attendance, before leaving school aged 15 years. He then worked as a labourer, began but did not complete a horticultural apprenticeship and later began working in the co-accused's lawn mowing business, approximately six months before the murder. He then mixed in a circle of friends, some of whom used drugs and engaged in crime. 

18He reported a history of hazardous cannabis use, smoking most days between ages 15 and 17 and intermittent use subsequently, including in the twelve months preceding the murder. He reported then using up to one gram of cannabis per day. He reported no alcohol abuse. 

19He knew the co-accused for about two years. They were not friends, it was a work relationship. He only knew Scott Bryan as a friend of the co-accused. He feared the co-accused after the murder. He stopped working for him and later left the Batemans Bay area to search for employment elsewhere. He was in fear for his safety and did not go to police, because he feared that he would be implicated in the murder. 

20The offender expressed certain regret, telling Dr Ashkar: 

""I feel really bad about everything. Really bad that Scott Brian(sic) had to die, that I saw it and did nothing about it basically. Since I've come to gaol, there have been times where I have been scared. I don't know how it's affected my family. It can't be a good thing. I've got to live with it now. It's certainly not going to be something I'm going to forget."" 

21Dr Ashkar administered various tests to assess the offender's cognitive functioning, mood and personality functioning. His opinion was that: 

- the offender was a man of average to high average intelligence, with difficulties with aspects of his cognitive function, involving working memory, divided attention and impulse control, consistent with his history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This may have contributed to poor judgment and decision-making. Cannabis use was likely to have exacerbated his cognitive difficulties and contributed to his poor judgment and decision making at the time of the offence. 

- The offender had no serious mental illness. His cannabis dependence disorder was in remission with his incarceration. There were no serious symptoms of anxiety, depression or psychological trauma and he had considerable psychological resilience. He was not a violent offender, or a violence risk. He had strong intellectual resources and considerable educational and vocational potential. 

- There was a risk of cannabis relapse after release from a controlled environment and he should then participate in a relapse prevention program and should be assessed for management of a possible attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 

The parties' cases 

22The only significant issue lying between the parties was the amount of discount to which the offender was entitled to receive on sentence, in the circumstances which here arose for consideration. 

The Court's sentencing task 

23The Parliament requires that the sentence imposed on the offender be determined having in mind the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Act. Those purposes are: 
""(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
(c) to protect the community from the offender, 
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community."" 


24The sentence imposed must reflect the gravity of this offence, viewed objectively (see R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354). The offender's guilty plea must be taken into account (s 22 of the Act). Section 21A also requires that consideration be given to specified aggravating and mitigating factors revealed by the evidence, as well as any other objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of this offence. Consideration must also be given to general and specific deterrence in the sentence imposed. For reasons which will become apparent, it seems to me that both general and specific deterrence have a particular role to play in the sentence imposed in this offence. The sentence which is finally imposed must also be reasonably proportionate to the circumstances of the crime committed (see R v Sc ott [2005] NSWCCA 152 at [15]). 

The seriousness of the offence 

25The agreed facts and the other evidence I have referred to, reveal that this was a serious offence. While the offender did not plan to kill Scott Bryan and did not himself fire the shot which killed him, he became aware shortly beforehand of what the co-accused proposed to do. By his plea, the offender has acknowledged that by his presence, he was willing to assist, if necessary, in that awful undertaking. The following day the offender helped bury Scott Bryan's body, thereby helping avoid detection of his crime. He later persisted in his denials of his offence, up to the day that the hearing was to commence. 

26The offender has given no evidence himself to explain his actions. The evidence provided some insight into the offender's troubled teenage years, when problems with drug use emerged. At the time of the offence he was a habitual drug user, mixing in a circle of people involved in crime and drugs, but there is no suggestion that he was drug affected on the day of the offence. There is evidence that he was in fear of the co-accused after the offence. Given evidence of what the co-accused has written while in custody, it may be accepted that the offender had a basis for such fear. Without evidence as to the offender's experiences before the offence, what led him to provide the co-accused with the assistance disclosed by the evidence, may not be speculated about. None of this sheds any light on the nature of the offending which here arises for consideration. 

27Nevertheless, it must be accepted that the offender's moral culpability for the murder was lower than that of the co-accused, who appears to have implemented what he had planned and with the offender's assistance, disposed of the body to conceal the murder. Notwithstanding his lesser responsibility for Scott Bryan's death, there can be no question that the offender's conduct was reprehensible, giving rise to the need for both general and specific deterrence to feature in the sentence imposed upon him. 

28The offender's various later accounts of his involvement and the plea which he finally entered late, show an acceptance arrived at only a considerable time later, of his responsibility for his grave criminal conduct. That was something which plainly only grew slowly. For a long time the offender was content for his offence to remain hidden and when first confronted, content to deny his responsibility for his actions. 

29That an acceptance of his guilt and remorse for what he had done eventually grew must, however, be accepted and taken into account. That, however, does not reduce the objective seriousness of this offence. While it must be accepted that the co-accused's moral culpability for the killing is higher than that of the offender, his offence is also a serious one, in respect of which a punishment which acts as a real deterrent, must be imposed. 

Aggravating factors 

30It was accepted by the offender that aggravating factors arose to be considered under s 21A(2)(c) and (e) of the Act. They were that a shotgun was used to kill Scott Bryan and that it was a killing committed in company. 

31I accept the submission that in considering these factors, account must be taken of the fact that it was the co-accused who fired the shotgun which caused Scott Bryan's death and that the offender's presence at the shooting, is in the circumstances of this offence, in the nature of an element of the offence, rather than as a separate aggravating factor. 

Mitigating factors 

32It was common ground that mitigating factors specified in s 21A(3)(b), (e), (g), (h), (i) and (k) all arise to be considered in this case. They are: 

""(b) the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity, 
... 
(e) the offender does not have any record (or any significant record) of previous convictions, 
... 
(g) the offender is unlikely to re-offend, 
(h) the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender's age or otherwise, 
(i) the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if: 

(i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and 

(ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both), 
... 
(k) a plea of guilty by the offender (as provided by section 22), 

..."" 



33The agreed facts reveal that the offender had no foreknowledge of the proposed killing, until very shortly before the shooting. He was not involved in any planning of the offence. He has no prior offences for violence and otherwise, a series of relatively minor offences, as I have described. There is evidence of family support. On the evidence, Dr Ashkar's assessment that he is not a violent offender, or a violence risk, may be accepted. His belated plea reflects an acceptance of his responsibility for his actions. In the circumstances, I accept that the likelihood of the offender re-offending is not high and that he has relatively good prospects of rehabilitation. 

34There is also various evidence of remorse, including that flowing from the guilty plea and from statements made by the offender to police and to Dr Ashkar. The plea was entered late, but I accept, as was argued, that consideration must be given to the fact that was in part in circumstances where there were delays because of the offender's custodial situation. Also to be taken into consideration is that the plea followed various assistance earlier provided to police and co-operation in relation to the preparation of the matter for trial, which also evidenced remorse (see R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; (2006) 172 A Crim R 151). There is also a promise of future assistance, which is also consistent with real remorse. 

The discounts 

35The offender's plea was only entered on the day the matter was listed for trial, but before the jury was empanelled. It was common ground that it is within my discretion in those circumstances to grant the offender some discount for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty, in accordance with the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgment in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. The maximum discount for an early plea is 25%, but it was accepted that such a discount is not available in these circumstances. 

36On the Crown's approach, while this plea was late, it nevertheless saved the community great expense, with the result that a discount in the range 10-15% was available. On the case put for the offender, the plea entered before the jury was empanelled saved great inconvenience to members of the public and to witnesses. It was also to be considered that even beforehand, agreements had been reached which had reduced the witnesses to one, being the officer in charge. In the result, a discount in the order of 15-20% was warranted. 

37The purpose of a utilitarian discount is as explained by Spigelman CJ, namely, that it reflects the benefits which flow from a guilty plea for the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system as a whole, as well as to witnesses, especially victims, who, as the result of such a plea, are spared having to give evidence and the personal rumination of traumatic events, which is inevitably involved in that process. These benefits must be identified by a trial judge when sentencing, in order to provide an incentive to offenders to enter such a plea, so that such benefits will, in fact, be derived (see R v Thomson; R v Houlton at [115] - [123]). 

38In this case, I am satisfied that given the time and circumstances in which the offender's plea was entered, he must have some discount on this account. In my assessment, a discount of the amount proposed for the offender would be too high, given the time that the plea was entered, notwithstanding that there was some prior assistance in relation to evidentiary matters. That assistance must certainly be taken into account, but even when considered together with the very late plea, the circumstances do not warrant a discount of the level proposed. 

39In this case also to be considered is a discount for assistance. Section 23(2) of the Act requires that consideration must be given to the following factors: 

""(a) (Repealed) 
(b) the significance and usefulness of the offender's assistance to the authority or authorities concerned, taking into consideration any evaluation by the authority or authorities of the assistance rendered or undertaken to be rendered, 
(c) the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender, 
(d) the nature and extent of the offender's assistance or promised assistance, 
(e) the timeliness of the assistance or undertaking to assist, 
(f) any benefits that the offender has gained or may gain by reason of the assistance or undertaking to assist, 
(g) whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of the assistance or undertaking to assist, 
(h) any injury suffered by the offender or the offender's family, or any danger or risk of injury to the offender or the offender's family, resulting from the assistance or undertaking to assist, 
(i) whether the assistance or promised assistance concerns the offence for which the offender is being sentenced or an unrelated offence, 
(j) (Repealed)"" 



40It is also settled that where discounts on both heads arise for consideration, a combined discount should be specified, because there will be certain common considerations arising to be taken into account (see R v Thomson; R v Houlton at [160] for instance). 

41The evidence here established that despite his initial denials, the offender later gave useful assistance to the police, as well as an undertaking to give evidence in the proceedings against the co-accused. The Crown's case was that this evidence would be of considerable assistance, it being the only available first hand evidence of the shooting. It is also corroborative of other evidence to be led as to admissions made. Those submissions must be accepted. 

42There is also evidence that threats have been made against the offender by the co-accused. It was common ground that as a consequence of his assistance, he will continue to be at risk of harm during incarceration, which will be under more onerous conditions as a result. That must be accepted. These are also matters which must be taken into account. 

43A combined discount of 50% was urged for the offender as a result. That conclusion was not disputed by the Crown, notwithstanding the differences in approach to the discount for plea. 

44For the offender, reliance was placed on R v Sukkar , to support the submission that a combined discount for the plea of guilty and assistance ought to be 50%. There a trial judge had granted a discount of between 20% and 25% for a relatively early plea, entered close to the first reasonable opportunity for the plea to be entered. A composite discount of 45% for that plea and the offender's assistance, was reduced on appeal to 35%, the view taken being that there was limited evidence of assistance, contrition or hardship. This is not such a case, although it was not an early plea. 

45I am satisfied that in the circumstances of this case, a lesser penalty must be imposed on the offender, both for his past assistance and that which he has undertaken to provide in future. Having considered all of the matters I have mentioned, I have concluded that a combined discount of 45% is warranted in this case. In my view, any greater discount would result in a penalty disproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the circumstances of the offender. 

46Sentencing judges must also be careful to ensure that the component of the discount which relates to the promise of future assistance be specifically quantified. That allows the parties to know what the position is and also enables an appellate court to deal appropriately with any application for review brought by the Crown, in the event that such a promise is not fulfilled (see SZ v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 19; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249). In this case, I identify that component to be 20%. 

Standard non-parole period and comparable cases 

47For the reasons which I have explained, the standard non-parole period for the offence of murder, does not reflect the appropriate sentence for this offence. 

48It was submitted that the sentence imposed in R v Aoun , where the offender was convicted by a jury after trial, for being an accessory before the fact to a murder, provides some assistance, in determining what the sentence to be imposed in this case should be. There a sentence of 17 years, 3 months was imposed, with a non-parole period of 13 years. There was in that case no discount. The offence involved a drive-by shooting where the offender's criminality was found to be below that of some of the others involved, but he was found to be an essential cog in the events as they occurred, willing, even if somewhat reluctantly, to assist in effecting the death or serious injury of another human being and giving advice as to how this should be effected. On appeal this was considered to be a heavy, but not manifestly excessive sentence (see Aoun v R ). 

49Here, too, the offender's criminality was less than that of the co-accused, but the offender was not an essential cog in the shooting, he provided no advice as to the commission of the offence, but was, nevertheless, prepared to assist if necessary and did assist in the burial of Scott Bryan's body the following day in the bush, so that the murder could be concealed. It follows that while Aoun v R was of some assistance in assessing the matters which here arise for consideration in determining the sentence to be imposed, at the end of the day each case must be assessed in the light of its own facts. 

Special circumstances 

50In this case, I am also of the view that there should be a finding of special circumstances warranting a small reduction in the proportion of the sentence to be represented by the non-parole period. This reflects that this is the offender's first prison sentence; that he would be assisted by participation in a relapse prevention program, when released on parole; and that he will serve his sentence in protection, as the result of threats to which he has been subjected. That there will be resulting hardship, which must be considered in determining sentence, must be accepted. 

Victim Impact Statement 

51From what I have said about the facts, it will readily be apparent that the circumstances of this offence are tragic. A victim impact statement from the victim's mother was read in Court. She spoke powerfully of the devastating impact of the time that Scott Bryan's awful fate was unknown to her; the circumstances and impact of the finding of his body; and the grief and horror brought by ongoing thoughts about the lonely circumstances of his death. Her words of sorrow for the offender's family were also heartrending, for anyone who heard them expressed in the courtroom. 

52These proceedings can be of little consolation to her, but for myself, I convey my very deepest sympathies for what she has had to endure over the loss of her son. I hope that an understanding of the steps taken by our society to deal with his death, and those who caused it, will bring her some small measure of comfort and peace of mind. 

53In making these comments, I note that the law as to the receipt of victim impact statements is well settled and that I have adhered to that approach in receiving the statement provided in this case. In R v Tzanis [2005] NSWCCA 274, five members of the Court of Criminal Appeal considered the approach established in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76, which has since been followed. They concluded that approach must be adhered to. That means that an unsworn, untested victim impact statement may not be taken into account in sentencing the offender, for reasons which were explained at length by Hunt CJ at CL in 1997 and which I will not deal with further, in this case. 

Conviction and sentence 

54Having considered all of the matters I have mentioned, I have concluded that but for the utilitarian value of the offender's plea and the discount which must be granted in the circumstances before the Court to reflect the offender's past and future assistance, I would have imposed a head sentence of imprisonment of 16 years. With discount, the sentence is 8 years, 9 months and 18 days. I will fix a non-parole period of 6 years. 

55Account must also be taken of the fact that the offender has been in continuous custody since his arrest in Queensland on 23 April 2010, on account of this offence. In this case, it is appropriate to commence the sentence imposed on the offender from that date. 

56Aaron John Kirchner, I convict you of the murder of Scott Bryan. 

57You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years, commencing on 23 April 2010 and expiring on 22 April 2016. I set a balance of term of 2 years, 9 months and 18 days, which is to commence on 23 April 2016 and to expire on 9 February 2019. You will be eligible for release on parole on 22 April 2016. 

58I order that the firearm charge before the Court under the s 166 certificate be dismissed.

		22 November 2013",2011-12-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758362,Hedges v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 263,"Judgment  1BEAZLEY JA :  The appellant was convicted on 15 December 2010 in a judge alone trial before Garling DCJ of one count of drive in a manner dangerous occasioning death contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 52A(1)(c).  He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 3 years and 7 months to date from 4 November 2010 and to expire on 3 June 2014, with a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 4 November 2010 and to expire on 3 November 2012.  2The appellant appeals against his conviction on the ground that the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.  The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against sentence on the basis that his Honour misapplied the guideline judgment in Regina v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343 ;  55 NSWLR 252.  Factual background  3The collision giving rise to the charge occurred on 15 May 2009 on the Pacific Highway at Corindi at about 3 pm.  The appellant was travelling in a southerly direction at the time and had crossed over double white lines onto the northbound carriage when he collided with the vehicle driven by the deceased.  4The sole issue at trial was whether the Crown had established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had not fallen asleep whilst driving on the wrong side of the road.  The issue was refined on the appeal so that the question became whether the Crown had established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had not fallen asleep when he first moved onto the wrong side of the road.  5On the day of the accident, the appellant had driven his Holden Rodeo from his home in the Coffs Harbour area to Tenterfield where he had attended the funeral of a friend.  On his return trip, the appellant stopped once to check and tighten the wheel nuts on one of his tyres and stopped a second time at Grafton to get petrol.  From Grafton, for a period of about 20 minutes, the appellant followed a vehicle driven by a Mr Currie.  Mr Currie had set his cruise control to 100 km/ph and said that the appellant travelled at varying distances behind him from between 10 m to 50 m.  In turn, a vehicle driven by a Mr Tesch was travelling behind the appellant's vehicle.  6As the vehicles approached Corindi, the southbound portion of the highway became two lanes, an inside lane described as 'the cruising lane' and an outside lane described as 'the overtaking lane'.  All three vehicles were travelling in the cruising lane until shortly before the two southbound lanes merged into a single lane.  At all times, the southbound and northbound lanes were governed by double white lines.  7Shortly before the cruising and overtaking lanes merged, Mr Tesch decided to overtake both the appellant's vehicle and Mr Currie's vehicle.  Shortly after that, the appellant overtook Mr Currie's vehicle.  In doing so, he went on to the wrong side of the road and remained on the wrong side of the road until he collided with the vehicle driven by the deceased.  The circumstances of his overtaking and the passage of the appellant's vehicle up to the point of the collision is a critical consideration in determining the issue on the appeal.  I will turn to this in detail shortly.  It is sufficient at this point to note that the appellant's vehicle travelled first in the northbound overtaking lane.  Just before the collision, his vehicle went into the cruising lane, in which the deceased was travelling.  The appellant's vehicle then moved back onto the northbound overtaking lane.  8The deceased was travelling on the northbound carriageway, which at that point on the highway comprised two lanes, a cruising and an overtaking lane.  The deceased was initially travelling in the cruising lane.  It was apparent from the eyewitness reports, including that of Mr Currie, that the deceased, upon seeing the appellant's vehicle on the wrong side and moving into the cruising lane, swerved into the overtaking lane to avoid him.  Unfortunately, the appellant braked and attempted to correct his direction but the two vehicles collided.  The collision occurred in the northbound cruising lane, with the appellant colliding with the driver's side front portion of the deceased's car.  9It was a fine clear day and there was no mechanical problem with either vehicle and the accident was not due to speed.  The speed limit was 100 km/ph.  It is likely that the appellant's vehicle was travelling at or slightly less than 100 km/ph and the deceased's vehicle was travelling at about 80 km/ph.  At the point where the accident happened, there was an elongated gentle curve in the highway to the right.  There was also a slight camber of the roadway to the right, that is, from the southbound across to the northbound side of the highway.  10Measurements were taken at the scene which established that the collision occurred 140 m south of the last marker on the road where vehicles travelling south had to merge into a single lane.  The point of impact was 330 m from the point where the appellant overtook Mr Currie's vehicle.  Evidence as to the place and manner in which the appellant overtook Mr Currie's vehicle was given by Mr Currie and Mr Tesch.  11The appellant had no memory of overtaking Mr Currie.  His last memory was of seeing the deceased's vehicle coming towards him and making a decision to try to avoid it.  In an electronically recorded record of interview (ERISP) given to the police on 19 May 2009, four days after the accident, in answer to Q 24 as to what had happened, the appellant stated that, having refuelled his car at Grafton and having telephoned his mother, he continued on his trip home.  He then explained:  ""[I] just exited not long before it happened, overtaking lanes into, indicated into the right from across to the, the normal lane. And I remember seeing a red car coming at me.""  12In his evidence-in-chief at trial, the appellant gave the following evidence:  ""Q. ... what's the last thing you remember?  A. I remember trying to avoid the red car.  Q. ... prior to that what's your memory?  A. Staying behind a dark coloured medium sized car.""  13The appellant said that he tried to avoid the red car by swerving to his side of the road.  He also said that he did not remember the collision itself and his next memory was waking in a CAT scan machine in hospital.  He had no memory of speaking to anyone at the scene of the accident.  The appellant also said that he remembered that there were a lot of overtaking lanes and that, prior to the last overtaking lane, he had not sought to overtake the car in front.  14In cross-examination, it was suggested to the appellant that he had been travelling slightly downhill just before the accident and that when the road merged into one lane, he took that opportunity to overtake Mr Currie because his vehicle had built up enough momentum to do so.  The appellant denied this and responded that his car was "" well capable "" of overtaking another car at any time.  15The appellant was also referred to his answer to Q 24 in his ERISP.  He said that when he said that he indicated "" into the right ... to the normal lane "", he meant that he had indicated to change lanes, not to overtake Mr Currie.  He said that he indicated at about the same time as the car in front of him indicated to change lanes.  He also said "" there's nothing in my memory ... urging me [to overtake Mr Currie's vehicle] "".  16Mr Tesch commenced overtaking the appellant's vehicle before the two southbound lanes merged into a single lane.  He said he made his decision to overtake because the appellant's vehicle was belching smoke and he had been travelling behind it for some time.  It was not until he overtook the appellant's vehicle that he realised that Mr Currie's vehicle was travelling in front of the appellant.  Mr Tesch said that the appellant's vehicle was very close to Mr Currie's vehicle and described the appellant's vehicle as "" tailgating "" Mr Currie's vehicle.  17Mr Tesch said that he looked at the appellant as he overtook him and observed that he "" was just driving "".  Mr Tesch said that he kept looking in his rear vision mirror and the next time he saw the appellant's vehicle was when it was on the wrong side of the road.  He estimated that he was approximately 30 m in front of the appellant's vehicle at the time of the collision.  18Mr Currie said that the appellant had been driving behind him for about 20 minutes prior to the collision.  Mr Currie said that he was driving at a consistent speed of 100 km/ph using the cruise control on his vehicle.  He said that he had passed through 3 or 4 overtaking zones during this period but the appellant had not attempted to overtake him.  19In the overtaking zone immediately prior to the accident, Mr Currie was driving in the cruising lane until about the point where there was an arrow on the road indicating that the lanes were merging.  Mr Currie said that as he moved in to the right-hand lane, the appellant's vehicle "" came with me "".  He said that at that stage the appellant's vehicle was "" pretty close "" to his vehicle, and estimated a distance of about 5 to 10 m.  20Mr Currie said that once he had merged into the right-hand lane, the appellant's vehicle, "" pretty much decided to go around me straight away "".  He said that this was "" pretty instantaneous "" from when he had moved into the single lane.  21Mr Currie explained what happened then in the following terms:  ""... the vehicle did pass me, it sort of came up level with me and went in front of me a little bit but not much ...  ... so what happened was we moved back into the lane and then the [appellant's vehicle] manoeuvred itself into the - over the double lines and into the overtaking lane for northbound traffic and it went a little bit in front of me.""  22Mr Currie said that the appellant's vehicle travelled about 10 or 20 m past him.  Mr Currie said that he still had his cruise control on at this time and was travelling at a speed of 100 km/ph.  Mr Currie said the next thing he recalled was the appellant's vehicle:  ""... going to the cruising lane on the northbound traffic and ... nearly went completely off the other side of the road.""  23Mr Currie described the appellant's vehicle as "" sort of swaying back and forth in that cruising lane "".  He said it was not swaying much, perhaps "" half a metre or so each side "".  He could not recall how many times that occurred.  Mr Currie said that he looked up at that stage and saw a red car coming around the corner in the cruising lane of the northbound traffic.  Mr Currie said that when he saw the red car, he reduced his speed back to about 90 km/ph.  He said that at about that stage the appellant's vehicle started coming back level with him.  24Mr Currie said that the red car then changed lanes from the cruising lane into the overtaking lane of the northbound carriage.  He said that at this point, the appellant's vehicle was still in the far right lane, that is, in the northbound cruising lane.  Mr Currie's description of what then occurred was as follows:  ""... the next thing I've noticed is the [appellant's vehicle] lurch[ed] forward. It was - it looked as though [the appellant's vehicle] had applied its brakes and it was at that stage [the appellant's vehicle] swerved back into - well swerved - it was - it was like it swerving back onto the other side of the road. At that time the red car also swerved back onto to try and go back into the left lane.""  25Mr Currie explained that the appellant's vehicle was attempting to come back into the northbound overtaking lane.  He said that as the appellant's vehicle:  ""... tried to go into the proper side of the road, the left-hand side of the road ... the red car has also tried to swerve back onto - into the cruising lane of the northbound traffic but there was a collision.""  He said that the collision occurred "" pretty much in line with me "".  26It is convenient at this point to note that the evidence indicated that the appellant travelled approximately 330 m on the wrong side of the road prior to the collision.  However, the evidence did not reveal the distance that the appellant travelled in the overtaking lane of the northbound carriageway before he commenced to drift off into the cruising lane of the northbound carriageway.  27Mr Currie said that he stopped 50 to 100 m along the road and ran back towards the collision.  Other cars had stopped by that time.  He spoke to the appellant, who said that he could not remember anything.  28Mr Currie was asked questions by the Crown Prosecutor as to whether he saw the appellant as the appellant's vehicle came level with him.  Mr Currie said that he didn't see the appellant's face, but "" just noticed that the driver looked like in a normal driving position "".  29In cross-examination, Mr Currie gave the following evidence:  ""Q. You've described to the Court that you start to merge ... the vehicle behind you had also merged behind you but it appeared to continue ... on - over the double unbroken separation lines?  A. That's right.  Q. Are you able to say for any period did you notice that when it merged behind you into that one lane, whether it stayed in that lane for a period or was it just one movement onto the wrong side?  A. We both came into the one lane together and then it sped up and sort of like come close to me and then - and then made its manoeuvre on to the other side of the road and then progressed a little bit further past me, so anyway, it was like it was overtaking me.  Q.  The area that it was overtaking you ... would be an area that you would not ordinarily expect a driver to overtake if it had to continue to obey the rules?  A. That's correct  Q. Because it was on the wrong side of the separation lines?  A. Yes.  ...  Q. You've described the vehicle as moving ahead about 10 to 20 metres at the most?  A. Yeah.  Q. It then moved into the cruising lane for a vehicle travelling north?  A. Yes.  Q. Was it a sudden manoeuvre or just like a veering across?  A. It was like a gradual, it wasn't a sudden movement, no, it was like a - yeah, it was like a gradual movement across.""  30Mr Currie confirmed that he slowed down to about 90 km/ph and said that the appellant's vehicle apparently slowed because it wasn't pulling ahead of him any more, "" it was sort of coming back level with me "".  He described the appellant's movement back into the northbound overtaking lane, after it had been in the northbound cruising lane, as a "" sudden movement "".  31Mr Currie said that when he spoke to the appellant immediately after the collision and the appellant asked him, "" what happened? "", Mr Currie said to the appellant, "" it looks as though you've fallen asleep "".  He was asked what it was that he had observed that led him to that conclusion.  Mr Currie said:  ""... the way that the car was sort of moving back and forth and the fact that the vehicle didn't just progress past me and come back in to my line to overtake me. It veered around me and then went over to the other side of the road and then it was like the - and then the car came back in line with me and then the sudden sort of braking of the vehicle. I remember the car lurching forward and then the car swerving back in to - to try and get on to the other - sort of back on to the right side of the road had led me to believe that this looks though - looks as though the driver of the vehicle had fallen asleep because that's - my initial reaction is you wake up, you've fallen asleep, you put your foot on the brake because that's what goes through your mind, you think 'Oh this is where I am', put your foot on the brake and that'd be your first thoughts to try and come back into the right side of the road. That's just my opinion.""  The Crown case at trial  32The trial was conducted on the basis that the Crown was required to establish either that the appellant was consciously driving the vehicle at the time of the collision or, alternatively, that he did not have a genuine and reasonable belief that it was safe for him to drive in the circumstances.  33As that issue was formulated for the purposes of the appeal, it was whether the only rational and reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence was that the appellant's driving immediately preceding the collision was conscious and voluntary:  see Jiminez v R [1992] HCA 14;  173 CLR 572.  34In this regard, the appellant conceded that if the appellant was conscious at the time that his vehicle first crossed over onto the wrong side of the road in the commencement of an overtaking manoeuvre, that would constitute driving in a manner dangerous.  The question for determination therefore, was whether that was the only rational inference available from the circumstances established by the evidence.  This concession was correctly made:  see Jiminez at 577, where it was recognised that, where a driver falls asleep at the wheel, the relevant period of driving, in determining whether a person is driving in a manner dangerous, is the period that immediately precedes the driver falling asleep.  35The appellant's concession was a departure from the manner in which the matter was conducted before the trial judge.  Before the trial judge, two arguments were in contention.  The first was premised upon the appellant having fallen asleep:  having fallen asleep, the appellant overtook Mr Currie's vehicle driving over double white lines and then continuing in the overtaking lane on the northbound carriageway, passing Mr Currie's vehicle and then drifting to the right, as described in Mr Currie's evidence.  The second contention was that the accused consciously overtook Mr Currie's vehicle.  This contention is the subject of the concession on the appeal.  Trial judge's reasons  36As to the first contention, the trial judge noted that the defence case was that the appellant fell asleep without warning at about the time of his last memory.  His last memory was moving into the right-hand lane on the southbound carriageway behind Mr Currie's vehicle.  His next memory was then of the moment immediately before the collision.  His Honour also referred to the appellant's answers in the ERISP.  37His Honour next referred to the appellant's argument that the Crown had not been able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant:  ""... was in conscious control of his vehicle from that point and that, whilst asleep ... he pulled out, went into the next lane, moved forward for some distance until he got to about 10 to 20 metres in front of Mr Currie's car, he then either slowed at that [point] or around that time and moved to the right consistent with sleep, he was not accelerating any more ... and at some stage came out of that sleep .... on [the appellant's] evidence, it has got to be at the time he regains control of his car ...""  38His Honour noted the argument that if the appellant had been conscious at the time of the overtaking manoeuvre, he would have moved back onto the southbound carriageway once he passed Mr Currie's vehicle.  His Honour also noted that the appellant had never at any point subsequent to the accident said that he had fallen asleep.  Rather, the suggestion that he was asleep had come from Mr Currie's evidence, to which I have referred above.  39His Honour concluded his reasoning on this version of the accident as follows:  ""If I was to accept that I would have to find that, whilst asleep, [the appellant] was able to unconsciously make a movement overtaking Mr Currie's vehicle, driving straight in the line next to Mr Currie for a distance, enough to get in front of him and then to drive to the right hand side.  ... there was no expert evidence in this case as to when the driver can fall asleep or how they can fall asleep or what happens when they fall asleep. But I have got to say that I could not accept, on the evidence in this case, that [the appellant] could have fallen asleep whilst behind Mr Currie's vehicle and then overtaken that vehicle the way in which I have found.""  40Although on the appeal the appellant does not rely on the second version of how the accident happened it, it is relevant to note that his Honour considered that the appellant must have been in a state of alertness, given that he had decided to follow Mr Tesch's vehicle and overtake Mr Currie's vehicle at a speed slightly in excess of 100 km/ph.  In the end result, his Honour did not accept that the appellant had fallen asleep at all.  Was the verdict unreasonable?  41The sole ground of the appeal was that the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence.  Pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(1) on an appeal against conviction, the appellate court is required to allow the appeal if, relevantly, it is of the opinion that the verdict of the jury "" should be set aside, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence "".  This is usually referred to as the first limb of s 6(1).  42The principles governing this ground of appeal are to be found in the plurality judgment of Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v R [1994] HCA 63;  181 CLR 487 at 493-5.  The High Court said that where an appellate court is asked to conclude that a verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence, the court:  ""... is required to determine for itself whether upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty.""  (citations omitted)  See also MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53;  213 CLR 606 at 614-615 [25], 623 [55]-[57].  43In this case, there are two further considerations:  first, that the case against the appellant was purely circumstantial and secondly, that the trial was a judge alone trial.  44Where the Crown case was a circumstantial one, the Court is required to consider and weigh all of the circumstances established by the evidence in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence: R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13;  228 CLR 618 at 637-638 per Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ at 637-638; The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1;  (2009) 83 ALJR 243 at 267 per Kiefel J, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ agreeing; Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 193 at [59]-[61] per Giles JA, Howie and Buddin JJ agreeing.  45The second consideration is that this was a judge alone trial:  see the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 132.  Pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act , s 133, a judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person.  The section further provides that any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury:  s 133(1).  46The principles that apply when there is an appeal from the verdict of a judge sitting without a jury were considered by this Court in R v Moffatt [2000] NSWCCA 174; 112 A Crim R 201 at [3]-[5], where Wood CJ at CL (Foster AJA and Adams J agreeing) stated:  ""[3] The Court of Criminal Appeal is a court of error, and does not proceed by way of rehearing in a way that permits it to substitute its own findings of fact for those of the jury, or of the trial Judge where acting alone: Kyriakou (1987) 29 A Crim R 50, and Kurtic CCA (NSW) 26 February 1996 unreported.  [4] Where, as in the present case, the relevant ground is that the verdict, or more accurately the finding on the question of guilt by the trial Judge (S 17 Criminal Procedure Act 1986) should be set aside upon the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence (S 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912), then it can only intervene if, after making its own independent assessment of the evidence, it concludes that it was not open for the trial judge to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant: M (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493, and Jones (1997) 149 ALR 598. In that event error permitting the substitution of a verdict of acquittal is established: Coombe CCA (NSW) 24 April 1997 at pp 11 and 12.  [5] What is required in this respect is attention to the matters identified in Fleming (1998) 158 ALR 379, Giam (1999) 104 A Crim R 416, and Gipp (1998) 194 CLR 106.""  47In Fleming v R [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250 the High Court observed, at [26] 262, that the first limb of s 6(1) must be seen through the prism of the Criminal Procedure Act , s 33(1).  The Court continued:  ""The first limb will address attention to the evidence upon which the trial judge acted, or upon which it was open to the trial judge to act, in reaching the finding as to ultimate guilt. Approached on that footing [the question is] is that finding 'unreasonable' or one which 'cannot be supported'?""  48The High Court considered it unnecessary to determine whether in cases under the first limb on an appeal from a judge alone an appellate court will only intervene, relevantly, where there was no evidence to support a particular finding, or the evidence was all one way.  See also Keir v R [2007] NSWCCA 149 ; Arun v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 214.  That is not the case here.  I consider that the Court should approach the matter by asking the question whether, upon the whole of the evidence, it was not open to the trial judge to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant.  49In my opinion, on the whole of the evidence, it was open to the trial judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant, including being satisfied that there was no inference consistent with the innocence of the appellant reasonably open on the evidence.  The evidence established that the appellant was conscious when he moved into the overtaking lane behind Mr Currie.  He then travelled past Mr Currie's vehicle, Mr Currie observing that he appeared "" normal "" at that stage, and got about 20 m ahead of Mr Currie before he started to drift to the right.  It is inconceivable that a vehicle could pull out from behind another vehicle and then travel within the bounds of a marked road lane for what must have been between 150 m and approximately 300 m, at a speed exceeding slightly more than 100 km/ph, while the person was asleep.  I should add that in coming to this conclusion, it has not been necessary for me to decide whether the appellant in fact fell asleep when his vehicle drifted further to the right on the northbound lane.  50It follows, that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.  Appeal against sentence  51The trial judge sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 7 months, consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing on 4 November 2010 and expiring on 3 November 2012 and an additional term of 1 year and 7 months expiring on 3 June 2014.  The appellant was also disqualified from driving for a period of 5 years from 15 March 2010.  52The appellant submitted that his Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried because he misapplied the guideline judgment in Whyte . Whyte was a guideline judgment in respect of, inter alia, sentencing for an offence under the Crimes Act , s 52A dangerous driving occasioning death.  53Spigelman CJ, at [204], noted that a frequently recurring case in respect of an offence under the Crimes Act , s 52A had the following characteristics:  ""(i) Young offender.  (ii) Of good character with no or limited prior convictions.  (iii) Death or permanent injury to a single person.  (iv) The victim is a stranger.  (v) No or limited injury to the driver or the driver's intimates.  (vi) Genuine remorse.  (vii) Plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value.""  54The Chief Justice indicated, at [214], that a custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the offender had a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgment.  55At [215], Spigelman CJ referred to the earlier guideline judgment in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 231 in respect of the same offence, where his Honour had noted that in the case of the plea of guilty:  ""... wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) and less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional.""  56At [216]-[217], Spigelman CJ set out those matters that would aggravate the offence, including the extent and nature of the injuries inflicted, the degree of speed, the degree of intoxication or substance abuse, erratic driving, competitive driving or showing off, escaping police pursuit, the degree of sleep deprivation and failing to stop.  57Spigelman CJ also noted his earlier comments in Jurisic that the question, whether any relevant aggravating feature manifested in the particular case, indicated that the offender had abandoned responsibility for his own conduct, involved an element of judgment by the trial judge and in respect of which different trial judges could differ.  It is in that context, that is, in the consideration of the appropriate sentence in circumstances where there were aggravating features, that Spigelman CJ noted that:  ""The period of three ... years, once the threshold of abandoning responsibility has been reached, is a starting point. The presence of additional aggravating factors, or their increased intensity, will determine the actual sentence.""  58His Honour continued, at [228], that the aggravating features to which he had referred were frequently recurring elements which directly impinged upon the moral responsibility of the offender at the time of the offence.  His Honour considered that:  ""Individually, but more often in some combination, they may indicate that the moral culpability is high. One way of expressing such a conclusion is to ask whether the combination of circumstances are such that it can be said that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct.""  59His Honour then confirmed what he had said in Jurisic :  that where in the case of dangerous driving involving death, the offender's moral culpability was high, a full-time custodial head sentence of less than three years would not generally be appropriate.  His Honour also noted that in the case of a low level of moral culpability, a lower sentence would be appropriate.  60Finally, Spigelman CJ, at [232]-[233], reiterated that the purpose of a guideline judgment was as a "" guide "" or a "" check "".  His Honour confirmed the basic principle of sentencing, namely, that the sentence imposed was the result of the exercise of a broad discretion, taking into account all the factors required to be taken into account by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 21A.  The purpose of the guideline was to focus attention on the objective circumstances of the offence.  It was also necessary to take into account the subjective circumstances of the offender.  61This was not a case where the accident was due to excessive speed.  However, the trial judge found that the appellant abandoned responsibility to the extent that he overtook Mr Currie's vehicle in circumstances where he crossed double white lines to do so.  His Honour stated:  ""[The appellant] put himself or his vehicle into a position where it was travelling on the incorrect side of the road towards other vehicles and, in particular, the vehicle being driven by the deceased. I am satisfied that is how he breached the law, that is the way he was driving in a manner dangerous and there were no other aggravating factors other than that.""  (Appeal book 53-54)  62His Honour referred to Whyte , noting the reference in that case to the typical case of an offender with the characteristics referred to in the guideline at [204] (see above at [53]).  His Honour stated that apart from the fact that he did not plead guilty, the appellant fitted into that typical case.  His Honour stated that had there had been a plea of guilty, the guideline suggested that the appropriate sentence was a term of imprisonment of 3 years.  His Honour noted that a court was required to consider any aggravating factors, but found that there were not "" really any aggravating factor s"" in this case.  63His Honour concluded, as this was a typical case, had the appellant pleaded guilty, he would have sentenced him to 3 years imprisonment.  64His Honour's understanding of Whyte was wrong in two significant respects.  As is clear from the guideline judgment, the indicative full-time custodial head sentence of 3 years is in respect of a case where an offender's moral culpability is high, that is, where there was at least one aggravating factor, but more usually a number of aggravating factors acting in combination.  Spigelman CJ adverted to this in Regina v Tadman [2001] NSWCCA 225, at [14], when his Honour, referring to the guideline judgment in Jurisic , said:  ""... it was only the presence of aggravating factors 'to a material degree', which reached the level where it could be said that the offender abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct, that the guideline indicated that a total sentence of less than three years should be regarded as exceptional.""  65In this case, his Honour found that there were no aggravating factors which he was required to consider.  Leaving aside for the moment the question that in this case the appellant did not plead guilty, his Honour's understanding, that the starting point for a case where there were no aggravating features was 3 years imprisonment, was incorrect.  66The second error related to the manner in which his Honour dealt with the fact that the appellant had not pleaded guilty.  His Honour considered that usually, for an early plea, a discount of 25 per cent was appropriate.  He concluded that a fairer way of approaching the matter in this case was to adopt a discount of 20 per cent, which he considered to be "" a more typical plea "".  His Honour calculated the term of imprisonment to be imposed by multiplying the indicative 3 year term suggested in the guideline judgment by 20 per cent in order to arrive at what he considered was the nominal starting point before the allowance of any discount.  67In approaching the matter this way, his Honour failed to recognise that the typical case to which the guideline was directed was expressly predicated upon a plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value.  In such circumstances, the discount for the plea would have been considerably less than the 20 per cent upon which his Honour's sentence was based:  see R v Thomson;  R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 at [161].  68Further, his Honour, in finding that but for the plea of guilty, he would have sentenced the appellant to 3 years full-time custodial sentence, given that this was a "" very typical case "", appears to have failed to recognise that he was required to independently exercise his sentencing discretion, notwithstanding the indicative term of imprisonment suggested in the guideline judgment.  69The Crown accepted that the matters upon which the appellant relied were indicative of error in the sentencing process.  The Crown accepted that it appeared his Honour approached the guideline judgment in a prescriptive manner and, in particular, failed to make an assessment of the relevant moral culpability of the appellant in the commission of the offence.  The Crown recognised that in all the circumstances of this case, it was difficult to say that no lesser sentence was warranted in law.  70Accordingly, it falls to this Court to re-sentence the appellant.  71The appellant was 19 years of age at the time of the accident.  His Honour found that he was a young man of good character.  He was in full time employment at the time of the accident.  His Honour referred to testimonial evidence from persons who knew him well, all of whom spoke extremely highly of him.  He was involved in community and sporting activities in his local area.  His family was supportive.  His father, who appears to have been an admittedly strict parent, described his son as "" respectful and honourable "" and "" a good, decent young man "".  This description of the appellant was reflected in the other testimonials, including that of his employer at the time of the accident.  His employer indicated that the company would do whatever possible to support the appellant in the future.  72Since the accident, the appellant has been diagnosed as suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and associated depression, which was assessed at an extremely severe level.  He has expressed remorse and contrition.  In particular, from the outset, he has expressed concern for the impact of the accident on the deceased's family.  73The one matter of concern is the appellant's poor driving record.  He has convictions for driving whilst suspended, speeding, driving recklessly, furiously or at a speed or in a manner dangerous, and for not complying with the conditions of his learner's permit and his provisional driver licence.  His licence was suspended at the time of this accident.  74The trial judge found special circumstances and there was no dispute about that.  For the reasons given by the trial judge, special circumstances should be found on the re-sentence and the Court should maintain approximately the same ratio between the non-parole period and the additional term found by the trial judge.  75In my opinion, a custodial sentence should be imposed comprising a non-parole period of 15 months commencing on 4 November 2010 and ending on 3 February 2012 with an additional term of 15 months concluding on 3 May 2013.  As the sentence of imprisonment is for a term of 3 years or less, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 50, provides that the Court must make an order directing the release of the offender on parole at the end of the non-parole period.  76Accordingly, I propose the following orders:  1. Appeal against conviction dismissed;  2. Grant leave to appeal against sentence;  3. Appeal against sentence allowed;  4. Quash the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge;  5. Order that the appellant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 15 months commencing on 4 November 2010 and ending on 3 February 2012, on which date the appellant must be released on parole, with an additional term of 15 months ending on 3 May 2013.  77JAMES J :  I agree with Beazley JA.  78FULLERTON J :  I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Beazley JA.  I adopt her Honour's statement of relevant principle without qualification.  While I also gratefully adopt her Honour's summary of the evidence with some augmentation, I am unable to agree with her Honour's ultimate conclusion at [49] that the only available inference on the evidence is that the appellant's actions in commencing what her Honour referred to as 'the overtaking manoeuvre' (thereby crossing the unbroken separation lines) involved a conscious and deliberate decision to overtake Mr Currie's vehicle.  79In coming to that conclusion her Honour found that after crossing the unbroken separation lines the appellant's vehicle travelled 'within the bounds of a marked road lane' for between 150 m and 300 m at speed a little in excess of 100 km/ph.  Were the evidence capable of supporting that finding of fact I would also have difficulty accepting that the appellant was asleep when he crossed the unbroken lines.  In my view, however, the evidence is only capable of supporting a finding that after crossing the unbroken separation lines the appellant's vehicle traveled some indeterminate distance within the northbound overtaking lane before it veered or drifted or gradually moved to the right into the cruising lane and across it until, according to Mr Currie, it went almost 'completely off the other side of the road' before 'lurching forward and then swerving back into ... the right side of the road'.  80Her Honour did not regard it as necessary to decide whether the appellant fell asleep as his car drifted across the northbound overtaking lane and the cruising lane.  I regard that question as inextricably linked to the question whether the only rational inference available from the circumstances established by the evidence is whether the appellant was awake seconds earlier when he crossed the unbroken separation lines.  It seems to me that the only rational explanation for the car drifting or veering off the road and not completing what was described as the 'the overtaking manoeuvre' is that the appellant was asleep at that time.  This is supported by Mr Currie's observation of the appellant's car braking suddenly and swerving back to the left, and the impression he formed, in that moment, that the appellant had been jolted awake from sleep:  Q. So exactly what was the conversation, you went up to him and you said, ""How are you?""  A. Yes  Q. What did he say?  A. ""What happened?""  Q. ""What happened?""  A. Yes  Q. What did you say?  A. I said ""It looks like you've fallen asleep.""  Q. What was it about what you had observed led you to that conclusion?  A. Okay well being - the way that the car was sort of moving back and forth and the fact that the vehicle didn't just progress past me and come back into my line to overtake me.  It veered around me and then went over to the other side of the road and then it was like the- and then the car came back in line with me and then the sudden sort of braking of the vehicle.  I remember the car lurching forward and then the car swerving back in to- to try and get on the other- sort of back on to the right side of the road had led me to believe that this looks though- looks as though the driver of the vehicle had fallen asleep because that's- my initial reaction is you wake up, you've fallen asleep, you put your foot on the brake because that's what goes through your mind, you think, ""Oh this is where I am"", put your foot on the brake and that'd be your first thought to try and come back into the right side of the road.  That's just my opinion.  81Importantly, Mr Currie estimated the time that elapsed from when the appellant moved across the unbroken separation lines to when he was almost completely off the extreme right hand side of the northbound lane as 'about 5 seconds'. He said, 'It was pretty quick'.  Quite apart from the distance the appellant might have travelled in that timeframe, at a speed slightly in excess of 100km/ph, for my part I regard it as unlikely to the point of improbable that having decided to overtake across unbroken separation lines at a speed exceeding 100 km/ph, and in what must have been a state of heightened alertness, the appellant did not complete the manoeuvre but effectively fell asleep while the manoeuvre was being executed and before it was completed.  82The expert evidence led at trial was from a police officer associated with the Ballina Crash Investigation Unit.  He attended the scene on 19 May 2009 for the purposes of preparing his report.  His report of 21 May 2009 was tendered by the Crown.  He also gave evidence.  Despite his qualifications and experience, his evidence in so far as bears upon the distance the appellant travelled within the northbound overtaking lane before veering off, was deficient in material respects.  The only measurement he reported upon was the distance between where the southbound lanes finally merged into one lane and the point of collision identified by a gouge mark on the road surface being.  That measurement was fixed at 140 m.  It appears that he did not take into account the information Mr Currie gave to police concerning the movement of the appellant's vehicle at any time or the relative distance across the roadway that the vehicle must have travelled.  83In addition, no attempt was made until trial (18 months later) to have Mr Currie nominate where the appellant crossed the double lines which he did at that time by marking a photograph where he believed that occurred relative to where he believed he and the appellant first merged to the right to take up a position in the merged single southbound lane.  That became photograph 9 at trial, a copy of which was made available on the appeal.  Given the curve of the roadway and the available perspective to the south in the photograph, designating a particular point of the road surface necessarily involves a risk of parallax error.  Because no scaled or photogrammetric map of the relevant portion of the roadway was produced, this carries, in my view, the very real potential to undermine the reliability of this aspect of Mr Currie's evidence.  His evidence that the time from crossover to where the appellant's car veered or drifted further to the right such that the car was almost 'completely off the other side of the road', was something in the order of five seconds, also undermines the accuracy of his mark on the photograph since, even accepting that the appellant was travelling at something slightly in excess of 100 km/ph at the point of crossover, he would have only travelled something in the order of 150-170 m before being almost completely off the road.  Notwithstanding the potential for the mark on the photograph to be wrong or misleading, the distance from that point to where the two lanes finally merged into one was measured during a view convened by the trial judge to be 189.75 m.  This, together with the 140 m from the commencement of the southbound single lane to the point of collision, then became a critical measurement upon which her Honour placed reliance in concluding that the appellant travelled within a marked lane for some very considerable distance before veering or drifting to the right.  84Finally, although the photographs of the scene taken by the police officer four days after the accident reveal a curve to the right of the road in the direction the appellant was travelling at or near when he crossed the unbroken lines, neither the length nor the radius of the curve nor the camber of the road, also angled to the right and slightly downhill, was measured.  I regard these measurements as important, having the potential to impact upon an assessment of the movement of the car as Mr Currie observed it and whether the appellant was in control of it.  85In addition to the concerns I have expressed about the sufficiency of the evidence to support the proposition that the appellant travelled for between 150-330 m at 100 km/ph in the northbound overtaking lane, I am of the opinion that the competing inference for which the appellant contended on the appeal, namely that he was asleep as the vehicle crossed the unbroken separation lines and woke only when he had crossed to the northbound cruising lane, is reasonably open on the evidence for other reasons.  I have used the phrase 'crossed over the unbroken separation lines' throughout and deliberately to avoid adopting, uncritically, the words Mr Currie used in his evidence when describing what the appellant's car did immediately after both vehicles merged to the right.  The critical question is whether the evidence supports a finding that he crossed over the double lines having decided to overtake Mr Currie.  86I accept that the evidence compels a finding that the appellant was awake and in control of his car when he and Mr Currie merged right from the southbound cruising lane to a single lane.  The appellant gave evidence that he recalled indicating his intention to merge.  In addition, in the process of completing that merging manoeuvre Mr Currie observed the appellant's car travelling behind him at a distance of 5-10 m.  He gave no evidence that the car did anything other than maintain that course over some distance.  Mr Tesch also gave evidence that he actually saw the appellant as he overtook both Mr Currie's car and the appellant's car in the southbound overtaking lane and that the appellant was 'just driving'.  87However, the evidence as to the movement of the appellant's car thereafter (at least up until it is seen by Mr Currie to lurch forward and swerve back to the left) is also consistent with the appellant having fallen asleep immediately before, or at the time his car crossed over the unbroken separation lines.  Mr Currie's evidence was the only evidence bearing upon that question.  Although the appellant had no memory of the episode after remembering merging right into the single lane, he gave evidence that there was nothing motivating him to overtake Mr Currie.  While this is in a sense self serving evidence, it is consistent with the objective evidence that the appellant and Mr Currie had been travelling for about 20 minutes in the southbound cruising lane before being directed by the road signage to merge into a single lane without the appellant having made any attempt to overtake Mr Currie in the available overtaking lane over that time.  88In reviewing Mr Currie's evidence I regard it as essential that a distinction be maintained between what Mr Currie saw and what conclusions he drew (or was permitted to draw) from what he saw.  Although there was no objection taken to those parts of his evidence where he said that the appellant had 'decided' to overtake him or ('decided') to go around him I am alert to the risk of that evidence overwhelming the question that falls to be answered on the appeal.  I consider that it is reasonably open that Mr Currie's evidence that the appellant's car manoeuvred around his car 'pretty instantaneous(ly) after they merged right' and that the car then passed him 'a little bit, but not much' was not a driving manoeuvre (or might not have been) but the appellant's first surrender to sleep.  89I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction.  It is not necessary in these circumstances for me to express any view about the outcome of sentence appeal.  **********

		09 December 2011",2011-12-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758365,MM v R [2011] NSWCCA 262,"Judgment  1BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Fullerton J.  2JAMES J: I agree with Fullerton J.  3FULLERTON J: On 11 December 2009 the appellant was convicted after trial of four counts of sexual intercourse with a child (LP) under the age of 10 years and three counts of indecent assault of the same child.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months.  He appeals his conviction on all counts.  There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence.  4The appellant required an extension of time within which to bring the appeal.  In light of the matters outlined in the affidavit of Brian Peter Dowe, sworn 2 May 2011, the Crown did not oppose leave being granted.  5The charges relate to two discrete occasions whilst the complainant was being cared for at a childcare facility operated by the appellant's mother from her home in Moree. As originally particularised, counts 1 to 4 (two counts of sexual intercourse and two counts of indecent assault) were committed on one afternoon between 25 December 1995 and 16 March 1996 when the complainant was 3 years of age and counts 4 to 7 (two counts of sexual intercourse and one count of indecent assault) were committed on another afternoon between 1 June 1997 and 31 December 1998 when she was between 5 and 6 years of age.  After amendment the timeframe within which counts 1 to 4 were committed was extended to between 16 March 1996 and 1 December 1997 when the complainant was aged 3 and 5 years.  6The appellant filed seven grounds of appeal.  At the hearing of the appeal he relied only on the first and sixth grounds.  The first ground contended that each of the verdicts is unreasonable and cannot be supported on the evidence as provided for in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  The sixth ground contended that the trial judge erroneously granted leave to the Crown to amend counts 1, 2, 3 and 4 to enlarge the timeframe within which the offences were allegedly committed.  The complainant's evidence  7Th e complainant was aged 17 at the time of trial.  She was first interviewed by police on 30 July 2008 when she was almost 16.  The ERISP was tendered as her evidence in chief.  8She gave evidence that the appellant's mother lived in two houses in Moree and that she was cared for at both houses each day from when she was a few months old until she went to pre-school when she was cared for two or three days a week.  Whilst at primary school she was cared for during the school holidays until she was 10 years old and her family moved from Moree to Gunnedah.  9She described the first house as a blue and white house on the lefthand side of the block with a yard at the front and back, and the second a house in Jacaranda Drive.  The evidence at trial was the blue and white house was in Warialda Street, Moree.  The appellant was one of four children - three boys and a girl who lived with their mother.  The complainant said the appellant's mother worked part-time at Coles, mainly in the afternoon, and when she was not at the home the appellant or his younger brother would look after the children.  She said this happened at Clarke Avenue and Jacaranda Drive.  She said that during the school holidays the appellant and his brother looked after her between four and six days out of the two weeks.  10She said that the first incident (comprehended by counts 1 to 4) happened at the blue and white house after the appellant's mother had gone to Coles to work her shift.  She said this was after lunch, maybe 2:00pm.  She thought she had either just started pre-school or it was just before she started pre-school. She said it was in January or February because it was hot and the other children had brought some of their Christmas presents with them to play with.  She had brought a model head on which she did makeup and hair styling.  She said that the appellant (who she thought was in his 20s) had been at work that day either at a mechanic's or the Moree Champion newspaper.  She said she was playing outside with the other children (both older and younger) when the appellant called her inside.  11She said the appellant took her to his bedroom where he put his hands underneath her clothes and touched and rubbed her with his hands around her abdominal area, back, chest and on the outside of her vagina underneath her underwear. She said she was "" probably "" wearing a shirt and shorts.  She said he then looked out the window and took his jeans off (jeans which she said were blue denim, not faded, and of a medium (blue) colour) and, a few minutes later, while he was lying on the bed, he pulled her on top of him, took off her shorts and underwear and inserted his penis into her vagina.  She said that his penis went ""fully"" into her vagina and that he had his penis in her vagina for ""probably five to ten minutes"".  She said that he then started rubbing her again and kissing her and that he told her to pretend his penis was a lollypop and to suck it.  She said she sucked his penis for ""maybe two to three minutes"" and that he kissed her back, chest and vagina. She was not sure if this was the first time the appellant had put his penis into her vagina but it was the first incident that she could remember.  He did not say anything to her at the time he had his penis in her vagina.  12She said someone knocked on the door and the appellant quickly put his underwear and jeans on and told her to put her clothes back on and go outside and play.  As she was walking out the back door, the appellant's girlfriend arrived.  She did not tell anybody what had happened because the appellant had told her that it was ""our little secret "".  He said if she told anyone what had happened it would be her fault and she would get into trouble .  13She drew a diagram of the layout of the Warialda Street house and the appellant's bedroom which was tendered by the Crown at the trial.  14The complainant said that the second incident (comprehended by counts 5 to 7) happened at the house in Jacaranda Drive when she was either in kindergarten or year 1 at primary school. As with the first incident, she said it happened in the afternoon while the appellant's mother was at Coles doing shiftwork.  She said once she started primary school she would go to her grandmother's home after school, from which she reasoned that the second incident occurred during school holidays in late September/early October.  She said she knew it was this time of year because it was just after her birthday in August when she turned 5 or 6.  15She said that on this occasion she was in the lounge room with some other children, playing Nintendo on the television.  Her sister was there but was in a cot in another room.  When the game was over the appellant's younger brother took the children outside to play while the appellant asked her to help pack the game away whereupon he then took her into his bedroom where he took off his clothes and the complainant's clothes.  She said he then put his penis into her vagina and pulled her onto him so that her chest and stomach were on his body with her head was on his chest and stomach.  She said he kissed her and rubbed her along her back and arms.  He also kissed her on her mouth using his tongue and kissed her on her legs.  His legs were wrapped around her and his hands were rubbing her.  She said, ""the head of his penis was all the way in [her] vagina, the same as the first time"" for 15 to 20 minutes.  He then pulled his penis out of her vagina and told her to suck it like a lollipop which she did because she trusted him.  She said she did this for five minutes.  After that he kissed her mouth with his tongue for a further two minutes.  Then he looked at the clock and said "" Oh, mum's going to be home soon "".  He told her not to tell anyone because "" it's our little secret "" and if she did she would be in trouble.  On this occasion when he had his penis in her vagina she said it was hard and when he asked her to suck it like a lollipop it was hard.  16The complainant drew a diagram of the house in Jacaranda Drive and the appellant's bedroom which was also tendered by the Crown.  17In addition to the two incidents comprehending the charges on the indictment the Crown adduced evidence (without objection) that the appellant sexually assaulted the complainant (with full penile penetration) on other occasions when she was aged between 3 and 7.  The uncharged acts were relied upon by the Crown as context evidence.  18The other assaults occurred either in the appellant's bedroom or in the bedroom he shared with his younger brother or in the lounge room.  She said it happened twice in the blue and white house (at Clarke Avenue) and three times at the house in Jacaranda Drive, and that the last occasion was in the appellant's bedroom at Jacaranda Drive when she was in Year 2.  She said she was not assaulted in Years 3 and 4 because she only went to the appellant's mother's house occasionally at that time and that she left Moree in Year 4.  The evidence of complaint  19The complainant first disclosed the sexual assaults in a Church youth group when she was 15.  The students were set the task of writing a three-staged testimony detailing their relationship with Christ entitled - "" Before I trusted Christ, how I trusted Christ and since I've trusted Christ"" .  The complainant wrote the following ""testimonial"" which she read to the group:  At the ages between 4-7, I was sexually assaulted by my babysitter's son.  At this age I didn't understand what was going on and he told me not to tell anyone because it would be all my fault.  So I did what he told me to and I have never told a group of people about this life changing experience.  20One of the elders of the group contacted the complainant's mother and informed her, in general terms, what her daughter had disclosed.  The elder had encouraged the complainant to tell her parents which she resisted for a couple of months before she showed her mother what she had written .  21It was in issue at the trial as to whether it was the complainant or the complainant's mother who named the appellant as the person who had assaulted her.  It was put to the complainant in cross-examination that it was the complainant's mother who suggested that the perpetrator was the appellant:  Q: You didn't actually say to your mother, did you, it was [the appellant]?  Did you?  A: No.  Q: It was your mother's suggestion to you, words to the effect, it was [the appellant], wasn't it?  Is that right?  A: No.  Q: You disagree with that?  A: Yes.  Q: How do you say the discussion was between you and your mother in relation to who it was that you said did this to you?  A: I gave my mum my testimony to read, because I was afraid to tell her myself, and she asked who it was, and I said [the appellant].  Q: Are you sure?  A: Yes.  ...  Q: Do you recall walking over to your school bag and taking out a piece of paper that was entitled, ""[LP's] Testimony""?  A: Yes.  Q: You gave it to your mother?  A: Yes.  Q: You observed your mother read the document?  Is that right?  A: Yes.  Q: She said to you, didn't she, ""It was [the appellant], wasn't it""?  A: I cannot remember.  Q: Do you maintain that it was you that said to your mother, ""It was [the appellant]""?  A: Yes.  Q: You maintain that?  A: Yes.  Q: I suggest to you that it was in fact your mother that said, ""It was [the appellant], wasn't it?""  A: I said it was [the appellant].  22The complainant agreed that the conversation with her mother was the first time she referred to the appellant by name.  Her mother gave evidence that she had suggested to the complainant that the appellant was the person responsible:  Q: Can you tell us what happened when you spoke to her?  What was said and what [LP] said?  A: I spoke to [LP] and I asked her - I said that I was being - speaking to Adam Drakott regarding bible study and that you need to talk to me about something.  She went straight to her school bag, pulled out a sheet of paper and it had on the top heading, ""[LP's] testimony"", and I proceeded to read and on the first lines, the first paragraph, it said that she was sexually assaulted by the babysitter's son.  Q: What happened then, when you read that?  A: She just looked at me, wouldn't say anything, and I said to her, ""It was [the appellant]?""  And she said, ""Yes"".  23The complainant also told two friends and her boyfriend that she had been sexually assaulted but she did not disclose all that had happened to her.  She said the interview with police was the first time she had spoken about it to anyone in detail.  24I n cross-examination she said she did not complain at the time of the assaults because she was scared and so as to protect her parents because she knew that they would worry about her and become anxious. She agreed that she thought that telling her parents would cause family conflict and division but disagreed that was because it was a family member (namely her uncle) who had assaulted her.  She said she was afraid that her parents would not believe her and that they would not want her to live with them.  She denied that she simply agreed with her mother that it was the appellant had assaulted her rather than admitting she made the whole thing up. She denied making up the words ""I was assaulted by my babysitter's son"" to give structure to the bible study assignment. She denied that her mother made it easy by assuming it was the appellant that she had nominated in her ""testimony"" and it was easier for her to agree.  She denied that after telling her mother about being assaulted she had to "" prolong the lie "".  She denied lying in her interview with police.  25The complainant also gave evidence that when she was 14 and at school a woman gave a talk about how she had been sexually assaulted from which she concluded she had also been sexually assaulted.  The complainant said ""... what [the woman] said about the trust and the misleading and trust, and what she was saying refreshed it in my mind"" but that she still felt she could not tell anyone about the assault and that it was not until two years later that she stopped regarding it as a ""little secret"". She was then asked by the trial judge:  Q. Without going into the detail of what the lady said to you, that was what prompted you to understand what had happened to you?  A. Yes that triggered my memory.  26She agreed in cross-examination that after leaving Moree she visited the appellant's family home at Christmas and saw the appellant on those occasions.  The identity of the assailant  27The complainant said the appellant was the only person who had sexually assaulted her.  She said he was "" bald [in the sense that his head was shaved], probably early 20s "" and that when she was 3 he was ""a bit fat"".  She said she could not describe him further because the assaults had occurred over ten years earlier.  When she was aged 3, the evidence revealed that the appellant's older brother had blonde/brown hair that was never close cropped and his younger brother had blonde hair that was short-cut but not shaven.  The evidence was that the appellant's head was not shaven but his hair was short. This was supported by a photograph of the appellant said to have been taken at the time of his graduation in 1996.  The same photograph showed the appellant wearing glasses which the complainant did not mention.  28The complainant was questioned about her uncle, OD.  She said he was in his late 30s when she was aged 3 and that he was fat with short (shaven) hair.  She said that she sometimes spent time with him at her grandmother's house on weekends while her parents were working and after school.  OD lived with her grandmother.  She said she was never told to be careful when she was with OD or cautioned about being with him.  She denied that OD (being her grandmother's son) was the person to whom she was referring in her bible study testimony as ""my babysitter's son"".  In re-examination she said that the appellant and OD both had hair cut short and were fat, but OD was of Aboriginal descent with medium to dark coloured skin while the appellant was white-skinned.  The evidence was that OD was Aboriginal with brown eyes.  A photograph of OD was tendered.  She denied that OD sexually assaulted her and said ""[ OD] did not assault me, [the appellant] did "".  Concessions made by the complainant in cross-examination  29The complainant accepted that in 1995 and 1996, when she was 3 or 4 years of age, the appellant was still at high school and was no more than 18.  She accepted that her recollection that the appellant was in his 20s when he assaulted her must have been wrong (and that it was also wrong that the appellant was working at the local newspaper as a mechanic at that time).  30The evidence also revealed that the appellant's family did not move into the blue and white house at Warialda Street until December 1996 and that the appellant's mother did not make an application for employment with Coles until 12 January 1997.  The complainant accepted that she was wrong about the first incident happening in the blue and white house when she was aged 3, and that she must have been older, and that she was wrong about the appellant's mother going to work at Coles in January or February 1996 (the time of the first incident).  She maintained her evidence that at the time of the second incident the appellant's mother had gone to work at Coles, leaving her in the appellant's care.  The complainant's parents  31The complainant's parents confirmed the babysitting arrangements the complainant described in her evidence and that there were occasions when they collected their daughter from the house at Jacaranda Drive when the appellant's mother was not there and the appellant (and his brothers) were looking after the children.  The complainant's mother said this occurred "" quite a few times "".  She also recalled speaking to the appellant about where his mother was and he said that she was paying bills or she was ""up the street"".  The evidence of the appellant's mother and brother  32The appellant's mother gave evidence that she and her family lived at two premises in Clarke Avenue, Moree over the course of fifteen years, first in a home unit and then in a house.  She sold the house in December 1996 and moved out after the sale.  The family then lived in a house at Warialda Street until November 1997 after which they moved to a house in Jacaranda Drive.  33She said she provided day care for children at the house in Clarke Avenue, including for the complainant who she said was there generally three to four days a week.  She agreed that once or twice a week she left the children for about 20 minutes at a time in the care of the appellant, and her other sons, while she went to the shop.  She did the same at Warialda Street and Jacaranda Drive.  She said she did not go to the shops at any regular or appointed hour.  Because her youngest son was seven years younger than the appellant, she said she would not have left the children in the care of the young boy on his own.  Before she left she would ask the appellant to mind the children.  She expected that he would know that she would be out of the house for some time.  She said she left the house to shop and pay bills on a Friday, because she only had one child in care on that day (not the complainant).  34She said she commenced working at Coles in January 1997.  She said she did not leave the children she was minding to go to work because her shifts at Coles started at 5.30pm or 6.00pm but agreed that there were a couple of occasions in 1997 when she was called in to work at 5.00pm.  In cross-examination by the Crown she agreed that she would have to get ready to go to work to get to Coles to start work at 5.30pm or 6.00pm but she denied ever having left earlier in the afternoon in order to do shopping or attend to banking before starting work.  35She said when the appellant started work, he had an apprenticeship with the Moree Champion newspaper and that he finished at about 2.30pm twice a week.  She agreed that if he were home he would assist her with minding the children.  36The appellant's younger brother said he would have been aged between 11 and 13 in 1996-1998.  He recalled a number of the names of the children that were minded by his mother.  He agreed it would not be uncommon for the appellant to be present with him at the house, however, he did not remember any occasion when the appellant took the complainant away from the other children and took her to a bedroom and did not recall any occasion in 1997 or 1998 when the appellant took her away from him and the other children and into a bedroom.  He said he recalled occasions when his mother would leave the house and leave him and the appellant in charge of the children at Jacaranda Drive but did not recall this occurring at Clarke Avenue or Warialda Street.  He said it was not uncommon for her to go to the shops but for no more than 15 minutes.  He said she never left to go to work at Coles during the afternoon.  37In cross-examination by the Crown he agreed that during the times his mother was at the shops, some children could be playing in one area while others were sleeping in a different area.  He agreed that when his mother was out there could have been times when he was with some children and the appellant with another child.  While he maintained the position that his mother was away from the house for no more than 15-20 minutes, he agreed that because he was young he did not pay attention to precisely how long she was away.  He said he did have an awareness that she would be coming back within a short time.  The appellant's evidence  38The appellant denied that he ever touched the complainant in a sexual way or had sexual intercourse with her.  He did not recall any occasions when his mother would leave him and/or his brothers in charge of the children when they lived at Clarke Avenue, but said it was possible that it happened at Jacaranda Drive, and perhaps Warialda Street, but she would not have been away for long and it did not happen often.  39In cross-examination the appellant disagreed that the complainant was in his family homes with him on many occasions.  He said that in 1996 he would come home from school and then go out again.  He agreed there were times that he watched the children when his mother went out, but that was after 1996.  He said his mother did not have a car in 1996 so it was more convenient for him to go to the shop for her.  He did not recall her leaving the house after he came home from school.  He did not recall his mother going to the shops and leaving him (and perhaps his brother) with the children for 15 to 20 minutes when they lived at Jacaranda Drive.  He could only remember his mother leaving the house to go to work and that was in 1997 and 1998.  He said she left around the same time each day, about 15 minutes before her shift.  40He said he was employed at the Moree Champion at the start of 1997.  When he finished work he would go home, get changed and go to work at Coles.  He worked at the Moree Champion for eight or nine years, after which he worked for Moree Holden.  41He agreed that if the complainant first attended pre-school in 1996, it was possible that he could have watched the children while his mother was out.  He denied asking the complainant to help tidy up or pack up the games while other children went outside.  He said that his younger brother would play with the children and only come to get him if something was wrong, otherwise he sat in the lounge room watching TV.  He said there were a lot of times when his younger brother and the children would have been out of his eyesight.  He did not remember ever attending to a child who was inside the house when others were outside the house.  The question of penetration and the medical evidence  42The complainant's evidence was that the appellant's penis was inserted ""fully"" into her vagina in both of the incidents the subject of the charges on indictment.  43In her interview with police she said in relation to the first incident:  Q: OK.  And then what's happened after he's taken your pants off?  A: Um, he injected his penis into my vagina.  Q: OK.  And do you know if his penis went fully into your vagina or ...  A: Ah, yep.  Q: ... just a little bit or something different?  A: Ah, fully .  Q: Fully.  OK.  And do you remember how that made you feel?  A: Um, uncomfortable, it was really uncomfortable and ...  (emphasis added)  44In cross-examination she confirmed (when addressing the first incident) that by the appellant's penis being ""fully"" in her vagina she meant that the whole of his penis was inside her vagina:  Q: Do you say, do you, that [the appellant] put his penis in your vagina on this occasion?  A: Yes, [he] put his penis into my vagina.  Q: Do you have an actual recollection of that?  A: Yes.  Q: You say that he put his penis fully into you.  Is that right?  A: Yes.  Q: You understand what fully means? That means his whole penis in your vagina .  Is that what you meant?  A: Yes.  (emphasis added)  45She went on to say she thought the appellant's penis was soft when it was inside her vagina during the first incident.  She described his penis (when pressed in cross-examination) as white and hairy.  She said he did not use lubrication:  Q: Can you recall whether the person you say assaulted you used any sort of lubrication?  A: No.  Q: You can't recall or they did not?  A: They did not.  46In relation to the second incident she said that the appellant's penis was ""fully"" inside her and that it was hard:  Q: OK.  So when you said that he had his penis inside your vagina, was it in fully or a little bit or something else ?  A: Ah, yeah, it was in, it was in fully .  Q: OK.  And can you tell me how you know that it was in fully ?  A: Um, because, like, the, like, head bit of the penis was, like, all the way in my vagina ...  ...  Q: ...the second incident we spoke about at Jacaranda Drive ... when he had his penis inside your vagina ...  A: Yeah.  Q: ... was it, do you remember if it was hard or soft or something else?  A: Ah, it was hard.  Q: It was hard.  A: Yep.  (emphasis added)  47She said that lubrication was not used during the second incident and that she did not cry out despite the discomfort or pain she felt on both occasions.  She gave the following evidence (in relation to the first incident):  Q: ...Did you make any noise when you were being assaulted?  A: No.  Q: You can remember not making any noise?  A: Yes.  Q: You didn't cry out at all?  A: I didn't know what was happening, so -  Q: That's not what I asked you.  You didn't cry out did you?  A: No.  Q: Did you experience any pain?  A: Yes.  Q: What sort of pain?  A: I felt quite uncomfortable and scared and my vagina was actually hurting.  48She was asked the following questions by the trial judge and then cross-examining counsel:  Q: Can you describe in more detail the pain that you say you experienced?  A: It hurt when he put his penis into my vagina.  Q: This is his soft penis is it?  A: Yes.  Q: Please go on.  A: The pressure that my vagina would have been small and his penis would have been quite bigger, that it physically hurt on the inside of my vagina.  Q: I see.  You say, ""Would have been"", do you actually remember experiencing or feeling anything?  Anything different at that time?  A: I felt pain inside my vagina.  Q: So you did feel something different in your body?  You say, ""You didn't understand"", but you did feel something in your body is that right?  A: Yes.  49The complainant did not remember experiencing any pain on urinating or any bleeding or discharge from her vagina as a result of the penetrative assaults.  Her mother did not notice any blood on the complainant's underwear.  She confirmed that the complainant did not complain about pain in her vagina to anyone when she was aged three to seven.  50The Crown adduced medical evidence from Dr Leonie Kirkwood, a visiting medical officer specialising in sexual assault at Tamworth Base Hospital.  She examined the complainant on 2 September 2008 and made the following findings:  ...Genital examination was normal.  The hymen was thick and folded, which is normal in that age group.  Forensic swabs and smears were not taken because of the long duration of time since the assaults.  Based wholly or substantially on the above knowledge, I am of the opinion that the normal genital examination does not preclude the assaults as described to me having taken place.  51She gave the following evidence in re-examination of her approach to an examination following a complaint of sexual assault:  When I examine the female genitalia I look at the external genitalia initially, which is when we look at the mons, which is the mound at the top of the genitalia, the labia minora, which are - the labia majora, which are the lips on the outside.  We look at the labia minora which are the lips on the inside.  We look at the area called the posterior fourchette, which is the area where the lips join together at the back, closer to the anus.  We then also look at the hymen.  So that in instances of penetration, penetration may only be of the labia minora or the labia majora.  Penetration does not necessarily mean full penetration of the vagina.  52She based her opinion on the time that had elapsed since the assaults and that in 70-80 per cent of cases where sexual assault involving the genital area is alleged the examination is normal.  She accepted in cross-examination that the examination was also consistent with no sexual assault having occurred.  53Under cross-examination, Dr Kirkwood was asked about the effect of full penile penetration of the vagina of a 3 year old and 7 year old.  She gave the following evidence:  Q: Dr Kirkwood please assume that a 3 year old female has an adult male penis inserted in her fully?  Please work on that assumption?  Would it be reasonable to expect the tissue of the female to be rapidly stretched beyond its elastic limits?  A: Yes.  Q: And would that produce broken blood vessels most likely?  A: Yes.  Q: Would it be most likely to cause a tear of the hymen?  A: Yes.  Q: Would it be most likely to cause obvious bleeding?  A: Yes.  Q: Is it possible in those circumstances that surgical repair would be needed?  A: That's beyond my area of expertise.  Q: Are the outcomes that I've described likely to be similar in relation to the 7 year old child in circumstances of a fully penetrated adult male penis?  A: Yes.  Q: Is a circumstance of repeated penetration, that is over a period of time of up to, if I can ask you, 13 times, is that likely to have more of a deleterious effect upon the female vagina than not?  A: Yes.  54In re-examination Dr Kirkwood confirmed that the expected damage to a child's vagina to which she referred in the above extract was based on the assumption of full penetration:  Q: Right.  So there can be penetration of the female genitalia, including the insertion of a penis, which may not even get to the opening of the vagina, is that correct?  A: That is correct.  Q: So it is a matter of what perception or what is meant by full penetration as to whether it actually reaches into the vagina or is penetrating those other areas making up the genitalia, is that right? ... Is that fair to say, it is a matter of what one means when someone says full penetration?  A: That's correct.  ...  Q: Right.  Your definition that you work on is full penetration is penetrating through all of the organs there, is that correct?  A: That's correct.  Q: OK.  So on that basis and on that understanding is when you spoke of what damage may occur to a young child, is that right, from full penetration?  A:  That's correct.  55In cross-examination she agreed that while the structure of the vagina is complex, thus not permitting the allocation of simple measurements of its length or width, the vagina of a child of 3 years and/or 7 years of age would not have the capacity to comfortably accommodate the erect penis of a young male adult.  The sixth ground of appeal  56The application to amend counts 1 to 4 to extend the timeframe within which the assaults were alleged to have taken place from 11 weeks between 25 December 1995 and 16 March 1996 when the complainant was aged 3 years, to 19 months between 16 March 1996 to 1 December 1997 when she was aged 3-5 years was made on the basis of the complainant's acceptance of the proposition put to her in cross-examination that the appellant's family had not moved to the blue and white house until December 1996 and that they stayed there until November 1997, and her acceptance of what the trial judge then put to her, namely that she could be mistaken as to her age at the time of the first incident. The application to amend the indictment was made at the end of the Crown case.  It is not clear why the Crown did not make the application after the complainant had given her evidence, thereby giving the appellant's counsel an opportunity, at that time, to have the witness recalled to address the change in the particulars of the charge.  That said, defence counsel did not apply to have the witness recalled.  He submitted that the prejudice to the accused could not be addressed or cured by further questioning.  57In seeking to resist the amendment, trial counsel submitted that an accused is entitled to prepare a case referable to the particulars in the indictment and, as counsel, he had prepared a cross-examination of the complainant on that basis.  He submitted that were he to have been put on notice of the materially different range of dates within which it was now to be alleged that the first incident occurred, he would have approached the cross-examination at trial differently, and may even have explored the timeframe in the committal proceedings, an opportunity that his client was now effectively denied.  He informed the trial judge that he was without instructions as to any additional matters that he may have been able to explore in cross-examination, or any opportunity the accused might have lost to account for his conduct or movements over the extended timeframe because of the timing of the Crown's application as his client was not, as he put it, ""of a clear mind to provide instructions with respect to any prejudice that might arise"".  58Sections 20 and 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provide as follows:  20 Amendment of indictment  (1) An indictment may not be amended after it is presented, except by the prosecutor:  (a) with the leave of the court, or  (b) with the consent of the accused.  (2) This section does not affect the powers of the court under section 21.  (3) For the purposes of this section, an amendment of an indictment includes the substitution of an indictment.  21 Orders for amendment of indictment, separate trial and postponement of trial  (1) If of the opinion that an indictment is defective but, having regard to the merits of the case, can be amended without injustice, the court may make such order for the amendment of the indictment as it thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of the case.  (2) ...  59The trial judge granted leave to amend the indictment.  In his Honour's assessment, there was no actual prejudice to the accused by the amendment and the fact that an accused may lose a tactical advantage by reason of an amendment is, without more, not sufficient prejudice for leave to be refused.  His Honour cited Borodin v R [2006] NSWCCA 83 as authority for that proposition.  He also noted that the Crown had at all times made clear that its case was that the first four offences occurred at premises occupied by the appellant's family before their move to Jacaranda Drive.  The only matter that changed in the Crown case at trial was the time when the family resided in the blue and white house which had been fixed by reference to direct evidence and that, as a result, the complainant could not have been aged 3 at the time of the assault but between the ages of 3 and 5.  60His Honour expressly rejected the prejudice said to result from the loss of an opportunity to cross-examine the complainant at the committal.  He was satisfied that at the time the CAN issued it was alleged that the first incident occurred between 16 March 1996 and 22 August 1997, a period of 17 months that was only contracted to 11 weeks when the indictment was settled prior to trial and that cross-examination over an extended period could have been undertaken at the committal.  61On the appeal counsel repeated the submission that trial counsel's diligent preparation and his cross-examination of the complainant to the effect that her assertion that she was 3 years old when assaulted in the course of the first incident must be wrong and her credibility adversely effected, had been neutralised by the amendment and that his client was prejudiced in that sense.  62The trial judge gave reasons for permitting the amendment in a detailed judgment.  Counsel did not identify any error in the reasons given by the trial judge, or in the exercise of the broad discretion inherent in the power under the Criminal Procedure Act in accordance with the test in the House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499, although as Howie J observed in Borodin , the challenge is not to the exercise of the judge's discretion but rather whether there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the amendment of the indictment by rendering the trial unfair.  In that same passage Howie J observed:  ...A miscarriage of justice will be shown where the amendment resulted in an unfair trial, whether that unfairness was a result of tactical decisions made by defence counsel based upon the wording of the charge or otherwise .  63Later in the judgment his Honour said at [25]:  Section 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act permits the court to make orders for amendment of an indictment where to do so would not result in injustice. Relevant injustice does not arise simply because the amendment of the charge deprives the accused of taking a technical point based upon an inconsistency between the statement of the charge and the evidence in support of it. Tactical decisions may have been made by the defence upon the basis of the wording of the charge, but it does not follow that the trial judge should refuse leave to amend the indictment simply because those tactical decisions will be rendered fruitless. It will only be in a case where the accused would be irreparably prejudiced in meeting the charge as amended that leave should be refused.  64In this case, where the appellant's case was that he did not assault the complainant at any time when she was in his mother's care, and that he did not have an opportunity to do so because he was rarely alone with the children and, more specifically, with individual children, irrespective of what premises they were living in at the time, I am unable to see how the cross-examination of the complainant might have been significantly different had the indictment been amended at an earlier point in the trial.  It is also of significance, as I see it, that no application was made to have the complainant recalled before the Crown formally closed its case.  The amendment was made before the appellant was called to give evidence where an opportunity was afforded him to deal with the extended timeframe for counts 1 to 4.  65I am not persuaded that there was any miscarriage of justice resulting from the amendment of the indictment, even at a late stage in the trial.  Ground 6 of the appeal should be rejected.  The first ground of appeal  66Stated shortly, the question that this Court must ask itself when a verdict or verdicts are said to be unreasonable is whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence to sustain a verdict as a matter of law, upon the whole of the evidence it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt.  That is a question of fact which requires the Court to make an independent assessment of the evidence both as to its sufficiency and quality.  In SKA v R [2011] HCA 13 at [11]-[14] French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ reconfirmed this is the test to be applied in accordance with the test as formulated in M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 as per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ as restated by McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ in MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 to reflect the terms of s 6(1) after amendment .  In Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126 Johnson J said:  [32] In exercising that function, the evidence ought not be considered piecemeal: R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 637-638 [46]-[48]; R v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 236 CLR 397 at 435 [128].  This court is required to consider the totality of evidence before the jury.  This involves an assessment of direct evidence of witnesses, and inferences to be drawn from a combination of events: Rasic v R at [29].  [33] In some cases, the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal has not seen or heard the witnesses at trial may have a bearing on the outcome of an appeal on an unreasonable verdict ground...  67The appellant did not submit that the evidence was deficient or insufficient to support a verdict.  He submitted that despite the directions of the trial judge (about which there is no specific complaint) the complainant's evidence, when considered with the other evidence in the trial, was unreliable in a number of critical respects which, taken together, would justify this Court finding that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt.  68In summary, the features of unreliability were identified as:  Â· The medical evidence which rendered it unlikely that the sexual assaults could have occurred as recalled by the complainant and detailed in her evidence - in particular the extent of penile penetration - given the absence of any evidence of trauma when the complainant was physically examined at age 16 and no evidence that the complainant suffered any injury at the time of the assaults;  Â· The complainant's recollection of being sexually assaulted on multiple occasions when she was as young as 3 years old constituted by full penile penetration on 12 or 13 occasions with the occasion the subject of the counts on the indictment being detailed as to time, place and the manner of the assaults and the appearance of the accused including the clothing he was wearing;  Â· T he complainant's early childhood recollection of sexual assault may have been a ""recovered"" memory.  69The Crown submitted that these features of the evidence were all agitated in the trial, in counsel's addresses and were the subject of careful directions from the trial judge.  This, coupled with the advantage the jury had of considering the appellant and the complainant as witnesses, the Crown submitted, would leave this Court well satisfied that the appellant is guilty of the offences on the indictment.  70Although it is necessary that the Court give separate consideration to each of the counts on the indictment, the approach taken by counsel on the appeal was that the complainant's evidence was undermined by such grave doubts about her reliability generally, in particular her evidence concerning the extent of penetration, that none of the convictions is sustainable.  I turn now to consider that challenge.  71The appellant's counsel submitted that there was nothing in the complainant's evidence that operated to qualify her assertion that the appellant assaulted her in excess of ten or a dozen times between the ages of 3 and 7 by inserting his penis into her vagina and achieving full penetration.  He submitted that the potential for the complainant's evidence concerning the extent of penetration to have sourced from her memory as a teenager of her perception as a child of what the appellant did when putting or inserting his penis in her vagina was simply not open on her evidence, despite the trial judge's directions to the jury that they might approach her evidence in that way by taking into account the evidence of Dr Kirkwood.  Counsel submitted that we should not approach Dr Kirkwood's evidence that way, but that we should view Dr Kirkwood's evidence as leaving no room for the complainant's evidence to be regarded as other than wholly implausible, or so lacking in weight that we should conclude that the jury's verdicts were unreasonable.  72Counsel submitted that the complainant was questioned both by police in the interview and by counsel in cross-examination about her actual recollection of what she claimed had been done to her, not her perception or belief as to what had been done.  He placed particular reliance upon the questions and answers extracted in [43]-[46] above. He submitted further that when the complainant referred to the appellant's penis (or the head of his penis) being fully inside her vagina and not a little bit she was describing full penile penetration of the length and width of her vagina by a fully erect penis.  73In addition to her evidence raising no suggestion of a lack of understanding of what was being asked of her, nor any suggestion of a lack of appreciation of what she was being asked to describe, counsel also sought to emphasise that at the time of the interview with police she was almost 16 and by the trial, she was 17 and that we should assume that she would know what full penile penetration of a vagina meant and how it was achieved . That is not an assumption that I am prepared to make, particularly in light of the fact that upon physical examination the complainant's hymen was intact.  No questions were asked (nor could they have been) as to the extent of her sexual experience.  74The Crown prosecutor also submitted that neither should this Court readily conclude that the complainant was describing any particular component of the complex structure of her genitalia when she referred to the appellant's penis being "" injected into in her vagina "" or that he "" put his penis into her vagina "" or even "" all the way in her vagina "" or that she had any current exposure to the genitalia of a male (other than the appellant's ten years earlier whose penis she was unable to describe beyond it being white and hairy). There is force in the prosecutor's submission that the complainant was never asked to describe what she meant by the penis, the whole of the penis, the head of the penis or her vagina and that the cross-examiner's failure to pursue the issue with her cannot be now relied upon as revealing any fundamental flaw in her evidence.  There is also force in her submission that b ecause of the lack of precision in the complainant's description of the mechanics of the penetrative assaults, questions of perception were rife and were properly a matter for Dr Kirkwood to comment upon.  75Taking into account the complainant's evidence and the evidence of Dr Kirkwood, I consider that it was open to the jury to accept that there was penetration of her vagina by some degree properly constituted as penetration as a matter of law, and that she perceived that the penis (or the head of the penis erect or flaccid) had entered her vagina such that she described it as being fully in her vagina, but that the degree of penetration, was well short of complete penetration.  76In addition, there were legitimate questions raised by the evidence concerning the timing and the circumstances of the complaint and the fact that the earlier ""triggered memory"" of the assaults did not result in complaint.  There were also discrepancies in the complainant's description of events and places relative to other evidence in the case.  However, I am not persuaded that either standing alone or when considered with the issue of penetration they undermine the strength of the evidence relied upon by the Crown in support of the charges on the indictment, particularly when the jury had the advantage of seeing the complainant give her evidence and the appellant give his evidence an advantage which this Court does not enjoy.  77I am not persuaded that the jury's verdicts were unreasonable and accordingly I would dismiss the first grand appeal.  Orders  78The appeal against conviction is dismissed.  **********

2758369,Abbosh v R; Bene v R [2011] NSWCCA 265,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with Johnson J. I would only add the following in relation to Ground 5.

2Contrary to what was said by the learned trial Judge, it seems to me that in the context of the present case and the charges proffered against each of the Appellants, there is a very significant difference between the evidence of Mr Qummou to the effect that the Appellant, Bene, had said, ""I'll fuck youse all up"" and the recollection of Mr Hens that Mr Qummou had said that Mr Bene's statement was, ""I'll cut youse all up"".

3In the present case, in permitting the hearsay evidence of Mr Hens to be led, there was, in my opinion, a real danger of unfair prejudice to the Appellants. The evidence of Mr Hens converted what might be described as the general threat deposed to by Mr Qummou to a specific threat which, as Johnson J pointed out, would directly impact on what was in the minds of the Appellants when Mr Abbosh arrived with a knife which was used to ""cut"" two members of the Qummou family.

4The danger of unfair prejudice to the Appellants in those circumstances outweighed the probative value. As the Appellants submitted, that prejudice could have been overcome by the Crown leading evidence from Mr Hens that complaint had been made to him of a threat without the use of the word ""cut"".

5For these additional reasons and the reasons given by Johnson J, I agree with the orders proposed by him.

6JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of Johnson J and with the further remarks of the Chief Justice.

7JOHNSON J: The Appellants, Calvin Abbosh and Saleh Bene, appeal against conviction and sentence, following a joint trial in the Sydney District Court before his Honour Judge Finnane QC and a jury in 2010.

Grounds of Appeal

15The Appellant Abbosh relies upon the following revised grounds of appeal (filed 22 September 2011):

Abbosh Conviction Grounds

(a) Ground 1 - abandoned.

(b) Ground 2 - a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by reason of the learned trial Judge cross-examining the solicitor for the Appellant before the jury.

(d) Ground 4 - abandoned.

(e) Ground 5 - abandoned.

(g) Ground 6 - the trial Judge erred in relation to the directions he gave to the jury concerning joint criminal enterprise and common purpose.

(h) Ground 7 - even if the Court was not persuaded to intervene in respect to any of the grounds referred to above, it is submitted that the conviction should nevertheless be quashed on the basis that it is unsafe and unsatisfactory in the sense referred to by this Court in R v Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396 by reason of the accumulation of matters catalogued in the earlier grounds.

(i) Ground 7(a) - the trial Judge erred in respect of the directions to the jury regarding the defence of self-defence.

Abbosh Sentence Grounds

(j) Ground 8 - the sentencing Judge erred in finding the Appellant's level of participation in the criminal enterprise and the seriousness of the assault put his level of offending at the higher than the middle of the scale.

(k) Ground 9 - the sentences in all of the circumstances were manifestly excessive.

(l) Ground 10 - abandoned.

(m) Ground 11 - the sentencing Judge erred in sentencing the Appellant on the basis that he came to the Markets with the intention of stabbing Ayed Qummou.

16The Appellant Bene relies upon the following amended grounds of appeal (filed 22 September 2011):


Bene Conviction Grounds

(a) Ground 1 - his Honour's directions on joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise were erroneous and gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.

(b) Ground 2(a) - the conviction of the Appellant on Count 2 is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.

(c) Ground 2(b) - the conviction of the Appellant on Count 5 is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.

(d) Ground 3 - his Honour's persistent intervention in the cross-examination of and his comments regarding the evidence of Dennis Miralis gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.

(e) Ground 4 - his Honour's direction as to good character was inadequate.

(f) Ground 5 - his Honour's decision to allow evidence of recent complaint by Fayez Qummou to Robert Hens occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

(g) Ground 6 - his Honour's directions as to the silence of the Appellant occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

(h) Ground 7 - his Honour's directions as to the order in which the jury should consider the various counts on the indictment were erroneous - the jury should have been directed that it could consider its verdict in any order.

(i) Ground 7(a) - the trial Judge erred in respect of the directions to the jury regarding the defence of self-defence.

Bene Sentence Grounds

(j) Ground 8 - his Honour erred in concluding that the Appellant was in possession of a knife.

(k) Ground 9 - his Honour erred in his application of s.54B Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to the sentencing of the Appellant.

(l) Ground 10 - his Honour erred in finding that the offences against Ayed Qummou ""are more serious than mid range offences and warrant a larger non-parole period than seven years"".

(n) Ground 12 - the sentences are manifestly excessive.

Overview of the Crown Case

17As at February 2007, brothers Ayed and Isam Qummou owned and operated a family business known as ""First Class Kebabs"". The business involved three food stalls at the Fairfield Showground Markets (""the Markets"") - a coffee cart, an icecream stall and a kebab stall. Their father, Fayez, their mother, Khawla, and their sister, Christine, as well as a family friend, Narmella Dicho, all helped to operate the stalls.

18The Qummou brothers also rented space in an area between the icecream stall and the kebab stall where they placed a number of tables and chairs for use by their customers. There were signs on each table which read ""First Class Kebab customers only"".

19Fayez Qummou, the father of the two victims, was working on 3 February 2007. At about lunchtime that day, he asked two men (the Appellant Bene and Danny Sulaqa) not to sit at the tables provided for their customers, as they were consuming food purchased from another food outlet.

20The Appellant Bene responded aggressively. Ayed Qummou intervened and asked both men to leave. The Appellant Bene threw $20.00 at him. There was a commotion. The Appellant Bene said: ""I'm gunna fuck youse all up"".

21The Appellant Bene then called his brother, the Appellant Abbosh, on his mobile phone. He said to him, ""Sabar, come to Fairfield markets to First Class Kebabs"". The call was made at 12.34 pm.

22Robert Hens, the Operations Manager at the Markets, received a call at 12.36 pm about the incident. He went with Nathan Laing, a Security Officer, and spoke with Fayez Qummou and Ayed Qummou.

23Mr Hens arranged for the security guard to remain at the stall for about 10 minutes.

24The Appellant Abbosh was driving in his wife's BMW at the time of the call from the Appellant Bene. Telephone records revealed that he telephoned Daniel Malik (a friend) at 12.39 pm, 12.43 pm and 12.45 pm. Mr Malik drove his sister's RAV 4 to the Markets as well.

25At 12.48 pm, the Appellant Abbosh called the Appellant Bene. The two met at the Markets. The Appellant Abbosh then headed towards ""First Class Kebabs"", looking for Ayed Qummou. He encountered Fayez Qummou and pushed him. Fayez Qummou observed the Appellant Bene, Mr Sulaqa and perhaps two other men. The Appellant Abbosh saw Ayed Qummou, and then pulled out a knife and said, ""I'm going to kill you"". He then stabbed Ayed Qummou three times.

26Isam Qummou tried to get the Appellant Abbosh off his brother. As a result, Isam was stabbed to the head and three times to the back.

27Ayed Qummou also felt a thump to his back and felt pain. He turned and saw the Appellant Bene with a knife.

28Later, the Appellants Abbosh and Bene got into a BMW vehicle and left. A bystander took the registration number and provided it to security.

29At the time of the incident, the Appellant Bene was said to be wearing a red shirt with stripes. He was described as overweight and aged between 30 and 40. The Appellant Abbosh was younger, slim and wearing a light top.

30Ayed Qummou suffered stab wounds to the ""upper left quadrant; upper left flank on the abdomen"", a further two wounds to his back and a minor cut to his right forearm.

31Isam Qummou suffered three stab wounds to the back near his neck and a cut to his right temple.

32The Appellant Abbosh was arrested on 5 February 2008. He told police that he had been in Canberra on 3 February 2007. The Appellant Bene was arrested on 14 October 2008. He declined to be interviewed.

33The Crown case against the Appellant Bene was based upon joint criminal enterprise.

Overview of the Case for the Appellant Abbosh

34The Appellant Abbosh gave evidence at the trial. 

35He admitted that he attended the Markets on 3 February 2007 in response to a telephone call from his brother. He said that his brother sounded scared and he wanted to assist him. He said that, upon arrival at the Markets, he parked his vehicle and made a call to the Appellant Bene to find out where he was. His brother told him where the table incident had occurred and the Appellant Abbosh went to that location. He admitted that he was very angry when he spoke to Fayez Qummou.

36The Appellant Abbosh said that Ayed Qummou jumped on him and punched him. He said that he and Ayed Qummou were hitting each other and then he was kicked and punched as well. 

37The Appellant Abbosh said that he looked around for anything that he could hold and saw a knife on the ground which he picked up. He said that he punched Ayed Qummou whilst holding the knife. He said that Isam Qummou approached and grabbed him around the neck and the Appellant Abbosh then used the knife on Isam Qummou. 

38The Appellant Abbosh denied that he had brought a knife to the Markets. 

39He said that after the fight with Isam Qummou, he got up and ran, still holding the knife in his hand. He rang his friend, Daniel Malik, asking him to pick him up. When Mr Malik arrived, the Appellant Bene was already in the car and the Appellant Abbosh jumped in as well. Mr Malik took the Appellant Abbosh straight home.

40The Appellant Abbosh said that he broke the knife in half and threw it in a drain in his street that night.

41The Appellant Abbosh admitted that he had told lies to the police when he claimed that he had been working in Canberra on 3 February 2007. He lied as well when he said that his wife had gone shopping and driven the black BMW vehicle to the Markets. He was also lying when he said that he did not know Mr Malik and when he said that he did not know anyone with a black RAV 4 vehicle. 

42In short, the case for the Appellant Abbosh was that he wounded Ayed and Isam Qummou in the course of acting in self-defence.

Overview of the Case for the Appellant Bene

43The Appellant Bene did not give evidence at the trial.

44His solicitor, Mr Dennis Miralis, gave evidence in the defence case. His evidence was confined to the circumstances in which the Appellant Bene attended the Fairfield Police Station on 14 October 2008, at which time he declined to be interviewed and was charged. 

45Mr Miralis was asked questions by the trial Judge in the presence of the jury, with those events giving rise to grounds of appeal (Bene Conviction Ground 3 and Abbosh Conviction Ground 2). Reference will be made to that evidence in the course of considering those grounds of appeal.

Grounds of Appeal Against Conviction 

46Each Appellant relied upon several grounds of appeal against conviction. Some grounds of appeal are common to each Appellant.

47Several grounds require leave under Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules. With respect to those grounds, it is for the particular Appellant to demonstrate that the ground is arguable and that a miscarriage of justice has resulted so that leave should be granted to rely upon the ground: Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at 319 [72]; R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20; 62 NSWLR 346 at 352-353 [20]-[24].

The Trial Judge's Decision to Allow Evidence of Recent Complaint by Fayez Qummou to Robert Hens Occasioned a Miscarriage of Justice (Abbosh Conviction Ground 5(a); Bene Conviction Ground 5)

48As mentioned above (at [22]), Robert Hens, the Operations Manager at the Markets attended the scene of the initial incident and spoke with Fayez Qummou and Ayed Qummou. Mr Hens said that Fayez Qummou told him what had happened. Unlike the actual evidence from Fayez Qummou to the effect that the Appellant Bene had said ""I'll fuck youse all up"", Mr Hens recalled that what Fayez Qummou had told him was that the man in the red shirt (the Appellant Bene) had said ""I'll cut youse all up"".

49Before Mr Hens was called to give evidence, objection was taken to his giving evidence of Fayez Qummou's complaint.

50The initial objection taken to this evidence from Mr Hens was that the proposed evidence did not fall within the scope of s.66 Evidence Act 1995. His Honour rejected that argument, however, a second argument was raised, seeking the exclusion of the evidence under s.137 Evidence Act 1995. 

51The submission was made by trial counsel for each of the Appellants that Mr Hens should not be allowed to give evidence that the words ""I'll cut youse all up"" had been spoken, given that Fayez Qummou himself had not asserted that the word ""cut"" had been used. It was submitted that there was real prejudice in Mr Hens giving evidence to this effect, which was not consistent with the account of Fayez Qummou. 

52It was submitted that there was particular prejudice against each Appellant, given that the Crown case was that the Appellant Abbosh attended the Markets armed with the knife and inflicted knife wounds to the victims. In circumstances where Fayez Qummou had not asserted that the Appellant Bene had used these words, it was submitted that the evidence ought not be allowed as the prejudicial effect of it would heavily outweigh any probative value which attached to it.

53The trial Judge rejected this submission and allowed the evidence to be given. In the course of a judgment delivered on 24 March 2010, his Honour said (pages 5-6):

""Mr McGrath [counsel for Abbosh], supported by Mr Crawford-Fish [counsel for Bene], has put a further submission and that is according to Mr Hens' statement, the last words uttered to him that what the two men were going to do was uttered in these words. They said they were going to come back and 'cut me up'. During the trial Mr Fayez Qummou said the words were, 'They are going to come back and fuck me up'.

The evidence then was that Mr McGrath's client did come back and ... [not transcribable] ... said he fucked him up, and certainly, on the evidence so far, 'cut him up'. It has been argued that this creates some prejudice under s 137, which is an unfair type. I am unable to see that that is so. It is possible Mr Hens misunderstood 'cut me up' when what was said was, 'fuck me up'. In truth there is no great substantial difference between them in this case, since what occurred, if it occurred, was that Mr McGrath's client came back and in fact, cut him up, cut up Mr Ayed Qummou.

It is obvious that very often witnesses will misunderstand words or interpret what is being said but where what is being said, whichever way it is interpreted, amounts to much the same thing whichever way you look at it, I am unable to see how there is any prejudice at all and I decline to revise my earlier decision.""

54Mr Hens then gave evidence before the jury in accordance with his statement.

55The trial Judge gave written directions to the jury on a number of topics. The written directions contained the following with respect to the complaint by Fayez Qummou (MFI21, paragraphs 45-47) (emphasis added):

""Complaint

45. You have heard evidence that the [sic] Fayez Qummou shortly after the alleged incidents made complaints to Constable Campbell and Mr Hens that the accused Bene and another man had been sitting at his tables, he asked them to go away, they got upset and protested. He again asked them to leave. One of them threw $20 on the table. Mr Fayez Qummou said that he didn't want the money; he just wanted them to leave because the tables were for his customers only. The men got up, swore, made a threat and left. The threat was that they were going to come back and 'fuck them up' and according to Mr Hens 'to cut them up'. If you accept the evidence that those complaints were made, then you can use this evidence in two ways:

46. It can be used to support the credibility of the complainant Fayez Qummou, because, on the Crown case, it shows that he acted consistently by complaining to a person to whom he might reasonably have been expected to complain about events that had occurred. The Crown says that this is the conduct which could be expected of a truthful person who had been assaulted. In other words, it goes to the credit of the complainant as it may increase his credibility.

47. The statements are hearsay, because neither of the persons to whom the complaint was made, was present when the acts occurred. These complaints however, may be taken into account by you in deciding that the events occurred on the day as the [sic] Mr Fayez Qummou has alleged.""

56Oral directions were given to the jury in the summing up along similar lines (SU37-38).

57Mr Game SC, for the Appellant Bene, and Mr Odgers SC, for the Appellant Abbosh, both submitted that the trial Judge erred in allowing Mr Hens to give evidence asserting that Fayez Qummou had told him that the words ""to cut them up"" were used. It was accepted that the evidence of complaint generally was admissible under s.66 Evidence Act 1995. However, in circumstances where Fayez Qummou did not assert that those words had been spoken, it was submitted that the admission of this evidence was highly prejudicial and that it should have been excluded under s.137 Evidence Act 1995.

58It was submitted for the Appellants that an agreed formula of words should have been utilised, with Mr Hens simply stating that Fayez Qummou had told him that the man in the red shirt had uttered a threat towards him, without the inaccurate statement using the word ""cut"".

59The Crown submitted that evidence of complaint was clearly admissible under s.66 Evidence Act 1995. It was submitted that, as the trial Judge observed, very little turned on the question of whether Fayez Qummou had told Mr Hens that the words used were ""I gunna fuck youse all up"" or ""I'm going to cut youse all up"". Whilst acknowledging that, from one perspective, ""cut"" may imply a predetermined decision to use a knife, it was submitted that the comment that he was going to ""fuck youse all up"" raised the overwhelming inference of a desire to inflict violence upon the victims' family.

60The Crown submitted that, in any event, the prosecutor at trial did not rely upon the version including the word ""cut"" as being more significant as opposed to the version including the word ""fuck"". It was pointed out that the Crown prosecutor at trial, in her closing address, had submitted that, whichever formula of words had been used, a threat was involved and that ""Mr Hens may simply have been mistaken about that one word, or he may have recollected it incorrectly, or perhaps Fayez did say 'cut them up'"" (T575.36).

61Thus, the Crown submitted in this Court that the actual word used (whether ""fuck"" or ""cut"") was not as important as the making of an instantaneous complaint and the approach by Fayez Qummou for help from security personnel. 

62The Crown submitted that the evidence was highly probative in the trial and certainly outweighed the danger of any unfair prejudice.

Decision

63It may be taken that the evidence of complaint made by Fayez Qummou to Mr Hens was admissible under s.66 Evidence Act 1995. The difficulty here was that Mr Hens' version of the complaint varied in a most significant way from that of Fayez Qummou.

64It must be kept in mind that the Crown case against the Appellants was that the dispute between the Appellant Bene and members of the Qummou family had led to the Appellant Bene summoning help from his brother. The Crown alleged that soon after the Appellant Abbosh arrived on the scene armed with a knife, which he commenced to use in a violent attack upon Ayed Qummou and then Isam Qummou. The Crown case against the Appellant Bene was based upon joint criminal enterprise on Count 2 and extended joint criminal enterprise on Count 5.

65In these circumstances, the question of what was communicated from one Appellant to the other was most significant, as was the precise nature of the threat made by the Appellant Bene. If the Appellant Bene had said to Fayez Qummou ""I'm gunna cut youse all up"", that evidence was capable of shedding a great deal of light upon what was in the mind of the Appellant Bene, and inferentially the mind of the Appellant Abbosh, when the latter arrived soon after with a knife which was used to ""cut"" two members of the Qummou family.

66Indeed, the reasoning of the trial Judge in allowing the evidence to be given by Mr Hens involved this process of thought (see [53] above). His Honour appears to have approached the issue upon the basis that, (on the Crown case), as the Appellant Abbosh had arrived armed with a knife which he used to ""cut"" the victim, it was likely that Mr Hens' recollection of what had been said was correct. A fundamental problem with this however, was that Fayez Qummou did not assert that those words had been said by the Appellant Bene. 

67Section 137 Evidence Act 1995 is in the following terms:

""In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.""

68This Court has observed that s.137 applies where there is a real risk, and not a hypothetical one, of unfairness arising to the accused from the admission of evidence: R v Lisoff [1999] NSWCCA 364 at [60]. The key term in s.137 is ""unfair prejudice"", in the sense of evidence creating ""a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way"": Papakosmas v The Queen at 324-326 [90]-[94]; R v GK [2001] NSWCCA 413; 53 NSWLR 317 at 324 [30].

69This Court should be cautious in approaching grounds of appeal challenging the refusal of trial Judges to exclude evidence under s.137 Evidence Act 1995. It is always necessary to keep in mind the advantage of the trial Judge making such a ruling in the contemporaneous atmosphere of the trial. 

70Further, this Court (as a court of error) should bear in mind the limited circumstances in which it may overturn a trial Judge's ruling such as a ruling under s.137 Evidence Act 1995. Error may be demonstrated if there is no evidence to support a particular finding, or if the evidence is all one way or if the judge misdirected himself: R v O'Donoghue (1998) 34 A Crim R 397 at 401. The submission here is that there was, in reality, only one correct answer to the objection, namely the rejection of the evidence under s.137 Evidence Act 1995. I accept that submission. The decision fell within the final category of error in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505.

71The admission of the evidence of Mr Hens in this case involves the strong likelihood of the jury misusing the evidence. The Crown closing address left open to the jury the possibility that Mr Hens was correct and that the word ""cut"" had been used. The written directions of the trial Judge reminded the jury directly that Mr Hens had given this evidence, and did not seek to warn the jury against an impermissible use of this evidence in the trial. 

72To my mind, this is a clear case where the Crown ought not to have been permitted to adduce from Mr Hens' evidence that the word ""cut"" had been used. I accept the submission for the Appellants that the appropriate course in this case was to adopt the often-used approach of the Crown leading evidence from Mr Hens, that a complaint had been made to him of a threat without the use of the word ""cut"". The Crown should not have been allowed the opportunity to have this evidence before the jury in circumstances where Fayez Qummou did not assert that the Appellant Bene had used that word.

73In a trial where complex arguments and directions were given to the jury concerning the concept of joint criminal enterprise, the existence of evidence that the Appellant Bene had threatened to ""cut them up"" (according to Mr Hens, but not Fayez Qummou), with the Appellant Abbosh arriving soon after on the Crown case and doing just that, I am satisfied that misuse of this evidence to strengthen the Crown case against each Appellant was virtually inevitable.

74In my view, the Appellants have made good these grounds of appeal. Further, I am satisfied that once the word ""cut"" was deployed in evidence before the jury in the manner which occurred in this case, a miscarriage of justice resulted.

75I am satisfied that these grounds of appeal have been made good.

Other Grounds of Appeal Against Conviction

76The decision with respect to the grounds considered above will lead to an order that the convictions of the Appellants be quashed and, subject to s.8 Criminal Appeal Act 1912, new trials will be ordered.

77It remains necessary to deal concisely with the other conviction grounds and, in particular, those grounds which, if successful, would lead to an order of acquittal: Cornwell v The Queen [2007] HCA 12; 231 CLR 260 at 300-301 [105].

Grounds Based Upon the Trial Judge's Intervention During the Evidence of Dennis Miralis (Abbosh Conviction Ground 2; Bene Conviction Ground 3)

78As mentioned earlier (at [44]), Dennis Miralis was called as the only witness in the case for the Appellant Bene. The forensic purpose in calling Mr Miralis appears to have been related to the ability of the Appellant Bene to speak English. Mr Miralis was called to give evidence concerning the circumstances in which he accompanied the Appellant Bene to the Fairfield Police Station on 14 October 2008. 

79A short way into the evidence in chief of Mr Miralis, the trial Judge questioned the witness in the following way (T525-526):

""His Honour: did he have an interpreter present?
A: No, he didn't.

Q: How would he understand any of this if he didn't have an interpreter and you say he couldn't speak English?
A: Your honour, he understood through my advising him as to what was going to happen in English and that being translated by Calvin Abbosh to his brother in, presumably, Arabic, what the process was going to be once we arrived at the police station, so in fact, I spent approximately 2 hours with Calvin Abbosh and his brother Salah Bene, before presenting him to the police station - 

Q: Do you mean to say-tell me if I am getting this wrong-that you told him through Mr Abbosh, or rather you spoke with him and Mr Abbosh interpreted it, as you understood, and you told him that when he went over there, people would be asking him all sorts of questions and asking him to agree that he understood or he didn't understand, and you told him, although he didn't understand, he should just say, 'yes'. That doesn't seem right to me.
A: Your honour, I spent approximately 2 hours with him. I formed the opinion after I spoke to him about what would happen at the police station, that he understood the process and it was confirmed to me through his brother that he understood what was going to take place once - 

Q: But the police officer who asked him questions, says, 'do you understand this?' is surely entitled to have an honest answer. If the man doesn't understand a word of English, how can he be honestly saying yes to something he doesn't understand?

A: My impression, your Honour, was that he understood because I had given him, in advance, a very detailed rundown of the very specific questions that the police officer was going to ask him, which was effectively, that caution, which was administered to him.

Q: One of the questions they asked was, 'are you on any medication?' 'Do you have a need for a doctor?' 'Do you wish to speak to anyone?' What would he say to these things?
A: I advised him they were questions that were going to be asked of him. I indicated to him that the sooner the interview process was over, the sooner he would be dealt with by a court.

Q: How did he answer the question, 'are you on any medication?' How did he?
A: in relation to that specific question, I don't recall what his response was."" 

80There were further questions asked by the trial Judge in a similar vein through the evidence of Mr Miralis.

81At the end of the evidence of Mr Miralis, in the presence of the jury, the trial Judge said to the witness (T535):

""""Thank you. You can step down. You might notice I didn't say you're excused. I said you can step down, but you can't leave for the moment.""

82Thereafter, in the absence of the jury, the trial Judge raised with counsel the question of whether Mr Miralis should be referred to relevant professional bodies (T536-539).

83The following morning (7 April 2010), application was made by trial counsel for the Appellant Bene that his Honour should disqualify himself. In a judgment delivered later that day, his Honour declined to disqualify himself.

84It is submitted for the Appellants that the trial Judge's intervention in the evidence of Mr Miralis gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. It is submitted that the trial Judge's negative approach to the witness was prejudicial to the Appellant Bene, in whose case Mr Miralis was called, and also the Appellant Abbosh as he had been present with Mr Miralis and the Appellant Bene before they attended the police station. 

85It was submitted that excessive judicial questioning of Mr Miralis had created a real danger that the trial was unfair: R v Thompson [2002] NSWCCA 149; 130 A Crim R 24 at 31-33 [34]-[44]. It was submitted that the trial Judge's questioning of Mr Miralis indicated that he did not accept his evidence. Further, the trial Judge's statement to Mr Miralis at the conclusion of his evidence, made in the presence of the jury, was likely to have enhanced the impression that he did not believe the evidence of the witness.

86With respect to the Appellant Bene, the Crown submitted that the questioning by the trial Judge of Mr Miralis would not have created, in the minds of the jurors, a perception that the trial Judge disbelieved the evidence, nor did it give rise to a miscarriage of justice.

87The Crown submitted that the judicial questioning of Mr Miralis could not in any way have prejudiced the Appellant Abbosh. Further, no complaint or application was made by trial counsel for the Appellant Abbosh, so that leave was required in any event under Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon this ground.

Decision

88This Court has considered the extent and nature of permissible questioning of a witness by a trial Judge in a jury trial (R v Thompson) and in a Judge-alone trial (FB v R [2011] NSWCCA 217 at [84]-[110]). It has been observed that more latitude should be granted to a Judge sitting alone in terms of the nature and extent of permissible judicial questioning of a witness: FB v R at [84]. 

89It is sufficient to observe that it was regrettable that the trial Judge questioned the witness in the presence of the jury in the manner revealed. It was for the jury, as the tribunal of fact, to form its own assessment of the evidence of Mr Miralis, and the use to be given to it in reaching verdicts in the trial, with the task of adducing evidence from him, and testing that evidence, being a matter for counsel appearing at the trial.

90Any concern which the trial Judge may have had concerning the professional conduct of the witness was not a matter to be developed in the presence of the jury. That said, I am entirely unpersuaded that what occurred in this case gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.

91I reject the Appellant Bene's Conviction Ground 3. 

92I refuse leave under Rule 4 for the Appellant Abbosh to rely upon Conviction Ground 2 which, in any event, ought be rejected.

The Trial Judge's Direction as to the Good Character of the Appellant Bene was Inadequate (Bene Conviction Ground 4)

93The Appellant Bene raised good character. The trial Judge gave the jury a written direction concerning good character which is not challenged in this Court (MFI21, paragraph 14).

94However, during the course of the summing up, his Honour made additional observations to the jury on the issue of good character. His Honour said (SU30):

""Mr Bene is a person of good character, a police officer has said he had no previous criminal convictions and you can take that into account in determining whether or not he committed the offence. Now good character is not a sort of shield that prevents anybody ever being convicted of anything. Everyone until he is first convicted is a person of good character. There have been some amazing people who have been convicted in our courts over the years. I suppose the most spectacular fall from grace was that of Mr Allan [sic] Bond, he was a hero in Australia for winning the America's Cup, within a few years he had been convicted of fraud. The fact that he was a person of good character did not prevent a prosecution of him for fraud, nor did it prevent his conviction. No doubt it was taken into account by the jury at the time. Well you are invited to take it into account too. Certainly it has to be said that people of good character are much less likely to commit crimes than people of bad character. I think that is all I can really say about that.""

95Mr Game SC submitted that the trial Judge's direction failed to properly communicate to the jury the significance of good character when it came to the likelihood that the Appellant Bene would have acted in the manner alleged by the Crown. Further, it was submitted that the trial Judge, in his oral directions, did no more than identify the fact that good character had been raised. The balance of the comments on the topic served to diminish and undermine the significance of good character by focusing on the fact that people of prior good character do commit criminal offences, including a discourse about Alan Bond. 

96It was submitted that the direction was inadequate and prejudicial to the Appellant Bene in the circumstances of the trial. 

97The Crown submitted that the evidence of the Appellant Bene's good character was very limited in the trial. It was submitted that the criticism of his Honour's further directions on good character was unfounded, as the trial Judge was entitled to point out to the jury that people do commit crimes for the first time, and that evidence of previous good character cannot prevail against evidence of guilt which they find to be convincing, notwithstanding the previous character of the accused: R v Trimboli (1979) 1 A Crim R 73 at 74.

98The Crown submitted that leave should not be granted under Rule 4 and, in any event, the ground of appeal should be dismissed.
 
Decision

99I am not persuaded that the direction given to the jury failed to communicate the use which the jury could make of evidence of the Appellant Bene's good character. It is noteworthy that no further direction was sought from trial counsel for the Appellant Bene, nor was any objection taken to the content of the written direction on this issue.

100Of course, the trial Judge was at liberty to remind the jury of the self-evident proposition that people do commit crimes for the first time: R v Trimboli at 74.

101The trial Judge placed an unhelpful anecdotal gloss upon the good character direction by the reference to Alan Bond. Such a comment was likely to distract rather than assist the jury. There is a risk that such a gloss will detract from the direction on good character to which an accused person is entitled at law.

102That said, I am not persuaded that the present direction gave rise to any miscarriage of justice. This view is fortified by the absence of complaint by trial counsel for the Appellant Bene.

103I would refuse leave under Rule 4 for the Appellant Bene to rely upon this ground of appeal which, in any event, ought be rejected.

The Trial Judge's Directions Concerning the Silence of the Appellant Bene Occasioned a Miscarriage of Justice (Bene Conviction Ground 6)

104The trial Judge gave a written direction to the jury concerning the Appellant Bene exercising his right to silence when spoken to by police and by not giving evidence in the trial. Those directions are not challenged on appeal (MFI21, paragraphs 51-52). 

105The trial Judge expanded upon this direction during the course of the summing up in a manner which is also not challenged on appeal. However, the trial Judge then said (SU39):

""He is entitled to take the view that, if he does not wish to give evidence - he has exercised that right and I suppose the only effect of it is that he has put nothing before you, himself, about the case. You do not know what he might say because he has not said it.""

106Mr Game SC submits that this remark undermined the onus of proof and invited the jury to consider the failure of the Appellant Bene to give evidence as being a matter of some significance. It was submitted that this additional direction gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.

107The Crown submitted that it would have been preferable if the trial Judge had not added anything to what, up until that stage, had been a model direction on the right to silence both before and during the trial. Although acknowledging that the trial Judge's additional words were unfortunate and problematical, the Crown submitted that the entire direction on the Appellant Bene's right to silence would not give rise to a miscarriage of justice.

108Further, the Crown submitted that no complaint had been made in this respect by trial counsel, so that leave under Rule 4 ought be refused. 

Decision

109It is the case that the trial Judge's written directions and oral directions, up to the point when the challenged remark was made, were correct. The trial Judge's additional remark ought not to have been made. The fact that it was made has given rise to debate concerning the consequences which should flow from it, in the circumstances of this trial.

110The challenged remark provided no assistance to the jury in understanding the otherwise correct direction on the right to silence. At best, it had a tendency to distract or deflect the jury from their task. Although the dynamic nature of a summing up is such that a trial Judge will, at times, seek to add to a direction to assist the jury's understanding, the process requires care so as to avoid distraction or confusion, let alone the giving of an erroneous direction. 

111That said, I am not persuaded that the additional remarks made by the trial Judge in this case gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. Once again, it is noteworthy that trial counsel did not seek a further direction or express any concern that the comment had been made. Although the remarks should not have been made, I do not consider that they had any adverse effect upon the fair trial of the Appellant Bene.

112I would refuse leave under Rule 4 for the Appellant Bene to rely upon this ground which, in any event, I would reject.

Grounds Complaining of Directions Concerning Joint Criminal Enterprise (Abbosh Conviction Ground 6; Bene Conviction Ground 1)

113The determination of grounds considered so far will see the convictions of the Appellants quashed, with the outstanding questions being whether there is an entitlement to acquittal on any count and, if not, whether new trials should be ordered.

114The present grounds of appeal, if successful, would not see a more favourable outcome for the Appellants than orders for new trials. In these circumstances, it is appropriate to consider the grounds relatively briefly.

115This judgment is not the occasion for a further dissertation on the topic of joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise. It will be necessary to have in mind the relevant principles to be applied when considering grounds of appeal which contend that the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.

116Mr Game SC, for the Appellant Bene, submitted that the trial Judge had erred in directions given to the jury concerning joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise and that these errors gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.

117Whilst accepting that the trial Judge did not give the jury accurate directions concerning joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise, the Crown submitted that no miscarriage of justice resulted, with the relevant misdirections operating against the interests of the Crown and in favour of the Appellant Bene, at least with respect to Count 2. 

118With respect to Count 5, the Crown submitted that, although the trial Judge had injected his opinions at several points into the relevant directions, the directions given concerning joint criminal enterprise were not erroneous so that this ground of appeal should be dismissed.

Decision

119The Crown case was that the Appellant Abbosh caused all of the injuries to both victims.

120The Crown relied upon the principles of joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise when it came to the case against the Appellant Bene for Count 2 (where Ayed Qummou was the victim) and principles of extended joint criminal enterprise for Count 5 (where Isam Qummou was the victim).

121In this Court, the Crown acknowledged that the prosecution had put its case against the Appellant Bene in an overly complicated way. 

122The Crown case regarding (relevantly) Count 2 was run on the primary basis that there had been an agreement between the two Appellants that the Appellant Abbosh would assault Ayed Qummou and cause him grievous bodily harm.

123In the alternative, the Crown asserted that if the jury was satisfied that the Appellant Bene contemplated there was a substantial risk that the Appellant Abbosh might form an intention more serious than what they had agreed upon, he could be guilty of a more serious offence by reason of the principles of extended joint criminal enterprise. This approach asserted that the Appellants entered into an agreement to commit an offence as part of the joint criminal enterprise to maliciously wound Ayed Qummou, however, the Appellant Abbosh had ultimately committed a crime outside the agreement (malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm), but that the Appellant Bene, in entering into the joint criminal enterprise, would have contemplated the possibility that the Appellant Abbosh may form such an intent, and yet continued his involvement in the joint criminal enterprise. The Crown submitted to this Court that the trial Judge had not left this alternative to the jury, an approach which was unduly favourable to the Appellant Bene.

124In this Court, the Crown observed that the prosecutor did not open to the jury on what was a potentially further available option concerning Count 2. On this approach, it was open to the Crown to contend that the Appellants had entered into an agreement to commit an offence as part of the joint criminal enterprise to assault Ayed Qummou, however the Appellant Abbosh had ultimately committed a crime outside the agreement (being malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm), but that the Appellant Bene, in entering into the joint criminal enterprise, would have contemplated the possibility that the Appellant Abbosh may form such an intent, and yet continued his involvement in the joint criminal enterprise.

125With respect to (relevantly) Count 5, the Crown acknowledged in this Court that there was an incomplete and inaccurate identification of the Crown case against the Appellant Bene in the Crown opening to the jury. However, the Crown submitted that the closing address by the prosecutor correctly, and in more detail, outlined the manner in which the Crown sought to establish criminal responsibility for these offences against the Appellant Bene.

126In order to establish the criminal responsibility of the Appellant Bene for Count 5, it was necessary that the Crown first establish that the Appellant Abbosh was guilty of the relevant act (in this case, Count 5) and then (as a general proposition), the Crown needed to establish that when the Appellant Bene entered the joint criminal enterprise in relation to the offence occasioned to Ayed Qummou, he (the Appellant Bene) contemplated the possibility that someone would come to the aid of Ayed Qummou, and that he contemplated that the Appellant Abbosh would then act in a manner consistent with the offence alleged (for Count 5 - wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm).

127The relevant law to be applied with respect to joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise may be found in the decisions of the High Court of Australia in McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108 at 114-118 and Gillard v The Queen [2003] HCA 64; 219 CLR 1 at 36 [112]. The principles are summarised helpfully in Report 129 of the NSW Law Reform Commission, ""Complicity"", December 2010, paragraphs 2.20-2.39.

128I am satisfied that the written and oral directions given to the jury concerning joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise in the case against the Appellant Bene were attended by a measure of confusion. It is likely that the element of confusion flowed from the overly complicated way in which the Crown sought to put its case against the Appellant Bene. 

129The Crown case against the Appellant Bene was clearer and stronger on Count 2 than on Count 5. I will return to these issues when considering the unreasonable verdict grounds relied upon by the Appellant Bene. 

130I am not persuaded that the deficiencies in the directions concerning Count 2 with respect to joint criminal enterprise should lead to the upholding of the appeal on this ground.

131The directions with respect to Count 5 are in a different category. A clearer formulation of the Crown case was required, accompanied by appropriate directions of law as to the manner in which the jury should approach its task in considering the case against the Appellant Bene on that charge. Clear directions were required on the concept of extended joint criminal enterprise, and its application to this case.

132Oral directions concerning the case against the Appellant Bene on the Isam Qummou counts (relevantly, Count 5) included the following (SU27-29) (emphasis added):

""When it comes to Isam Qummou both on the Crown case and Mr Abbosh's case, he is an incidental person in a sense. He was stabbed on the Crown case because he came to the assistance of his brother. The person that Mr Abbosh was seeking out was Ayed Qummou, he was not seeking out Isam Qummou. You will recall the evidence that the confrontation between his brother and the Qummous was between his brother, Mr Bene, Fayez Qummou and Ayed Qummou, not Isam Qummou. Isam Qummou had nothing to do with any argument that was conducted near the tables. He was not there when twenty dollars was either placed on a table or thrown on the ground. He was not standing there when Mr Bene said whatever he had to say. He was somewhere else. So how then does the case against Mr Bene in relation to Isam Qummou arise. Well the Crown has to show before Mr Bene can be convicted, first of all the Crown can only get a conviction against Mr Abbosh if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Abbosh in fact stabbed Mr Isam Qummou and did not do so in self defence. There seems no doubt whatsoever that he got stabbed and the only person who had a knife who was doing any stabbing was Mr Abbosh.

So how then does Mr Bene come into the picture with Mr Isam Qummou? Let it be assumed that Mr Abbosh is regarded by you as having the intention of wounding with intent to murder or cause grievous bodily harm to Ayed Qummou. Lets assume that Mr Bene was part of that, he contemplated seeing that his brother had a knife that he might do that. If the facts are as Isam Qummou alleges, he came out to assist his brother and there was a struggle and in the course of that he got stabbed. How is Mr Bene responsible for that? Mr Bene is responsible for that if the Crown establishes beyond reasonable doubt that it was in the contemplation of Mr Bene that his brother might deal with anybody who tried to intervene by stabbing them and causing a wounding.

It has to be less clear that it would be in his contemplation that if his brother did that, his brother might intend to murder the person who intervened or he might intend to cause him grievous bodily harm, that would be less certain. But the Crown puts the proposition to you that that is what was in all the circumstance of the case, particularly if you accept that Mr Bene did attack Mr Ayed Qummou by hitting him or stabbing him in the back, all the circumstances the Crown says point to his having that contemplation.

You might well come to the conclusion that you are satisfied that he had a contemplation, that his brother might intend to wound with intending to kill Mr Ayed Qummou or intending to cause him grievous bodily harm, but that was in his contemplation if somebody else came along he might injure them in some way without thinking that he might intend to kill them or cause them grievous bodily harm.

So it is quite clear you can give completely different verdicts in this case. It is not an all in, all out situation, it would be different of course if both men were armed with knives and both men attacked at the same time and two people were wounded as a result of a joint attack by two men you would not have any difficulty with that. But here you are saying that you were confronted with the situation of Mr Bene not doing the stabbing, but being present, perhaps being there for the purpose of assisting his brother. Perhaps being
part of a joint criminal enterprise to wound Mr Ayed Qummou with intent to murder, but less certainly having that intent in relation to Mr Isam Qummou who appears to have been wounded because he came to the defence of his brother and Mr Abbosh was trying to get away and he struck out and struck him.""


133Mr Game SC submitted that the underlined portions of the summing up in the preceding paragraph illustrate the measure of confusion that was introduced. The term ""agreement"" was not used, with the term ""contemplation"" being used effectively in its place. The somewhat tenuous nature of the case against the Appellant Bene (on Count 5) was discernible in the qualified language used at times by the trial Judge.

134I am persuaded that the directions given in this trial were accompanied by a degree of confusion so that this ground of appeal should be upheld with respect to the conviction of the Appellant Bene on Count 5.

135I am entirely unpersuaded that any problem in the directions concerning joint criminal enterprise operated adversely to the Appellant Abbosh. The Crown case against him was that he was the assailant who wounded the two victims. I reject the Appellant Abbosh's ground of appeal.

Grounds Complaining of Directions Concerning Self-Defence (Abbosh Conviction Ground 7(a); Bene Conviction Ground 7A)

136These grounds of appeal, if successful, would not see a more favourable order for the Appellants than an order for new trials. Accordingly, they may be considered relatively briefly. 

137It will be necessary, however, to bear in mind appropriate directions concerning self-defence when the time comes to consider later grounds of appeal which contend that the verdicts of guilty are unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.

138Mr Odgers SC submitted that the Appellant Abbosh's entire defence turned on the contention that he was acting in self-defence. The trial Judge gave written directions to the jury concerning self-defence (MFI21, paragraphs 53-58). No complaint is made concerning the written directions, nor the oral directions concerning self-defence until the trial Judge added a gloss at the end of the direction.

139Mr Odgers SC contends that the trial Judge misdirected the jury in giving the following direction (SU42-43):

""As I said, before you came to that conclusion that self-defence was even relevant you would have to look at what actually happened. It does not arise unless there is a reasonable possibility of it happening in the way that he said it happened. And a reasonable possibility means a reasonable possibility, not a far flung chance, or perhaps it could have happened somehow or other.""

140Mr Odgers SC submitted that this was a significant misdirection which involved a type of elaboration upon the standard of proof, beyond reasonable doubt. He relied upon the line of authority summarised in a recent decision of this Court in RWB v R [2010] NSWCCA 147; 202 A Crim R 209 at 214-219 [13]-[61]. He submitted that the trial Judge erred in effectively undermining the standard of proof imposed on the prosecution.

141Mr Odgers SC submitted that it was permissible to direct a jury that self-defence did not arise as an issue if the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant Abbosh was the attacker, and that it was permissible to direct the jury that self-defence only arose as an issue if it was a reasonable possibility that Ayed Qummou was the attacker. He submitted, however, that it was a misdirection to elaborate on the meaning of ""reasonable possibility"" in the way contained at [140] above. He submitted that it undermined the high standard of proof imposed on the prosecution and that this elaboration may have had the result that the jury misunderstood the level of proof required to be met by the prosecution. 

142It was submitted that the error was a fundamental one and that, although the point was not taken at trial, leave should be granted under Rule 4 to rely upon it on appeal.

143Mr Game SC adopted the submissions of Mr Odgers SC in support of his corresponding ground of appeal. He submitted that the directions on self-defence were relevant as well to the Appellant Bene. He submitted that leave ought be granted to the Appellant Bene to rely upon this ground of appeal.

144The Crown submitted that the written and oral directions given to the jury on the issue of self-defence, apart from the challenged paragraph, were not attacked in this Court. The Crown submitted that the trial Judge had, on no fewer than seven occasions, outlined correctly to the jury where the onus of proof lay in relation to self-defence. 

145With respect to the challenged elaboration by the trial Judge, the Crown submitted that the remarks were not made to the jury as a way of directly explaining what was meant by the words ""beyond reasonable doubt"". Directions concerning the standard of proof were given elsewhere in the summing up, at a point some distance from the challenged remarks.

146Even if the challenged elaboration could be construed as bearing upon the standard of proof, the Crown submitted that, whilst undesirable, it did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice for reasons explained in RWB v R. The Crown observed that trial counsel for the Appellants did not express any concerns over this direction. Despite seeking redirections on other aspects of the self-defence direction, no redirection was sought on this aspect. 

147The Crown submitted that further arguments made on behalf of the Appellant Bene in support of this ground of appeal ought not be accepted, and that no error had been demonstrated in the directions given for self-defence to the extent that the Appellant Bene relied upon that issue at trial.

148It was submitted that the Appellants should be refused leave under Rule 4 to rely upon these grounds.

Decision

149I am not persuaded there is substance in the submissions made on behalf of the Appellant Abbosh. No complaint is made concerning the directions on self-defence given up to the point where the challenged elaboration was stated. In a manner reminiscent of other grounds of appeal considered in this judgment, the trial Judge added a gloss at the end of otherwise appropriate directions, with the gloss giving rise to controversy in this Court.

150This elaboration by the trial Judge was not helpful to the jury. It would have been better if it was not said. The additional remarks may have distracted or deflected the jury.

151The question whether self-defence is raised, for the purposes of ss.418-419 Crimes Act 1900, so that it should be left to the jury is a matter for the trial Judge, applying the principles in Colosimo v Director of Public Prosecutions [2006] NSWCA 293 at [19]-[24]. Once, as here, the trial Judge decides to leave self-defence to the jury, care is required to frame directions in accordance with applicable statutory provisions and principles. His Honour did so until the challenged elaboration was made. The additional remarks should not have been made.

152That said, I am not persuaded, that the additional remarks in some way compromised the accurate and repeated directions given to the jury on the question of onus and standard of proof. To the extent that it is suggested that the remarks might, in some way, have undermined the direction on standard of proof (a submission I do not accept), I would adopt the same approach as that taken by the Court in RWB v R. No miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated. 

153The Appellant Bene sought to develop additional submissions complaining of error with respect to the self-defence directions. I accept the Crown submission that there is no substance in the argument advanced in support of that ground of appeal.

154The arguments sought to be advanced in this Court with respect to self-defence directions were not raised by trial counsel for either Appellant in the District Court. 

155I would refuse each Appellant leave under Rule 4 to rely upon these grounds which, in any event, I would reject.

Grounds Complaining of Order in Which Jury Was Directed to Consider Verdicts (Bene Ground 7)

156This ground of appeal is entirely procedural. In the circumstances of this appeal, there is no utility in considering this ground of appeal further.

Ground of Appeal Based Upon Alleged Cumulative Errors (Abbosh Conviction Ground 7)

157It was submitted for the Appellant Abbosh that, even if the Court was not persuaded to intervene in respect of any of the earlier recited grounds of appeal, that the convictions should nevertheless be quashed because of the accumulation of matters catalogued in the earlier grounds in accordance with R v Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396. 

158It is sufficient to record that the Appellant Abbosh's appeal against conviction will be allowed following the conclusion with respect to Conviction Ground 5(a). All other conviction grounds of the Appellant Abbosh (considered so far) have been rejected.

159In these circumstances, there is no utility in considering this ground of appeal further.

Grounds of Appeal Contending that Verdicts of Guilty Are Unreasonable or Cannot be Supported by the Evidence (Abbosh Conviction Ground 3; Bene Conviction Grounds 2(a) and 2(b))

160Mr Odgers SC submitted that verdicts of guilty with respect to the Appellant Abbosh were unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. He developed that submission by reference to aspects of the evidence of various witnesses.

161Mr Game SC submitted that the verdicts of guilty with respect to his client on Counts 2 and 5 were unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. He developed submissions by reference to the evidence of prosecution witnesses concerning the involvement of the Appellant Bene in the violence, contending that it was limited and inconsistent. Reference was made to evidence on the topic on whether the Appellant Bene had a knife during the incident and whether he was aware that the Appellant Abbosh had a knife at the time the brothers met at the Markets. He submitted as well that, applying correct principles of joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise, there ought be an acquittal on Count 5.

162The Crown made detailed written submissions contending that the verdicts of guilty with respect to each Appellant were not unreasonable and were supported by the evidence.

Decision

163If either Appellant succeeds on an unreasonable verdict ground, the consequential order would be a verdict of acquittal on the count or counts where the ground had been made good. Accordingly, it is necessary to consider these grounds in some detail. If an unreasonable verdict ground succeeds, the successful Appellant would be entitled to a more favourable outcome than an order for a new trial. 

164The task of this Court when considering a ground such as this was summarised in Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126 at [31]-[34]:

""31 In determining a ground of appeal which asserts, for the purpose of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, this Court is required to apply the test set down in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, and restated in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. The Court is to make an independent assessment of the evidence, both to its sufficiency and quality. This involves a question of fact. The Court is to determine whether the evidence is such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty. The central question is whether this Court is satisfied that the Appellant is guilty of the offence charged in the first count: Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 85 ALJR 571 at 575 [11]-[14], 576-577 [20]-[22]. 

32 In exercising that function, the evidence ought not be considered piecemeal: The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 637-638 [46]-[48]; The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 236 CLR 397 at 435 [128]. This Court is required to consider the totality of evidence before the jury. This involves an assessment of direct evidence of witnesses, and inferences to be drawn from a combination of events: Rasic v R at [29].

33 In some cases, the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal has not seen or heard the witnesses at trial may have a bearing on the outcome of an appeal on an unreasonable verdict ground. In M v The Queen, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson Toohey JJ said at 494-495:

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above.'

34 The M v The Queen formulation of the task of this Court has been emphasised by the High Court in later cases: The Queen v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; 85 ALJR 8 at 14 [33]; SKA v The Queen at 575 [13].""

165I have read the evidence adduced at the trial. In addition, I have had regard to relevant directions of law (including those on joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise) which are appropriate in this case.

Are the Verdicts of Guilty for the Appellant Abbosh Unreasonable or Not Supported by the Evidence?

166It is important to observe that the Appellant Abbosh, in his evidence at the trial, accepted that he was the person who stabbed both Ayed Qummou and Isam Qummou. As a result of this evidence, the two central issues in his trial became:

(a) could the Crown negative self-defence, and

(b) if the Crown could negative self-defence, what was the Appellant Abbosh's intent at the time he stabbed Ayed, and then Isam Qummou?

167In order to negative self-defence and establish the Appellant Abbosh's relevant intent, the Crown relied on evidence of all the circumstances leading to his involvement prior to the woundings and his behaviour after the woundings, to rebut his claim that he acted in self-defence.

168The Crown relied as well on the evidence of members of the Qummou family - Ayed, Fayez, Isam and Christine - that it was the Appellant Abbosh who was the armed aggressor in the two stabbings, and that he had not acted in self-defence.

169The Crown case against the Appellant Abbosh may be summarised as follows:

(a) the Appellant Abbosh had a very close relationship with his brother, and felt very protective of him;

(b) the Appellant Bene, having had an altercation with the victims' family, immediately called his brother on his mobile phone and requested that he come immediately to the Markets - this evidence came from various sources, including the Appellant Abbosh himself;

(c) the Appellant Abbosh attended the Markets promptly;

(d) the Appellant Abbosh then spoke to his brother who indicated to him aspects of the initial altercation with the Qummou family;

(e) the Qummous continued to work at their stall at the Markets after the initial altercation - they did not leave the stall to seek out the Appellant Bene, rather they requested security personnel to assist them;

(f) the Appellant Abbosh was very angry when his brother told him about the initial altercation, and he went to confront the victims' family;

(g) the Appellant Abbosh was armed with a knife which he brought with him to the Markets - the jury and this Court are entitled to reject completely his evidence that he happened to find the knife laying on the ground at the time he was being attacked - the evidence that the Appellant Abbosh produced a knife was given not only by members of the Qummou family, but by William Bimler (T309-310), a witness with no connection with the Qummou family;

(h) no member of the Qummou family was armed, although after the stabbing an attempt was made by Ayed Qummou to obtain a weapon from a hardware stall;

(i) the Appellant Abbosh stabbed Ayed Qummou four times, and then stabbed Isam Qummou three times when he came to assist Ayed Qummou;

(j) the areas on the bodies of each of the victims, where the multiple stab wounds were inflicted, were consistent with the Appellant Abbosh having an intention to cause grievous bodily harm;

(k) having stabbed both men, the Appellant Abbosh ran from the scene, abandoning the BMW at the Markets - flight was left to the jury as evidence of consciousness of guilt and no challenge was made on the appeal to that direction - both the jury and this Court are entitled to use the evidence of flight as demonstrating consciousness of guilt;

(l) the Appellant Abbosh then destroyed the knife and hid the remaining parts of it;

(m) the Appellant Abbosh never sought any medical treatment for any alleged injuries as a result of the claimed attack upon him, and never reported the alleged attack upon him to police or any other authority;

(n) upon being interviewed by the police on 5 February 2008, the Appellant Abbosh deliberately lied by claiming that he was working in Canberra at the time of the offences, denying all knowledge of the incident - he later admitted that he had told extensive lies to the police - the Crown relied on these lies as consciousness of guilt, and the jury and this Court are entitled to use these lies in that way;

(o) unlike the Appellant Abbosh, the Qummou family made immediate complaint after the initial altercation to Mr Hens and sought security assistance - the Qummou family also made immediate complaint to police after the woundings;

(p) on the other hand, the Appellant Abbosh, with his brother, sought out the victims' family and the Appellant Abbosh went to confront them;

(q) there was a consistency to the immediate complaints made by the victims and their evidence subsequently given at trial - it would have been abundantly clear to the jury that the victims' family (who had been long-term tenants of the Markets since 1990) were the victims of a reprisal attack by the Appellants Abbosh and Bene, and not the other way around.

170To my mind, the summary of the Crown case in the preceding paragraph, supported as it is by evidence, constitutes a very strong case against the Appellant Abbosh with respect to Counts 2 and 5.

171I accept the Crown submission that, once the jury had resolved, beyond reasonable doubt, that the Appellant Abbosh had brought a knife to the Markets, and rejected his implausible version of finding a knife on the ground, then his claim of self-defence would run hollow.

172Submissions were made on behalf of the Appellant Abbosh pointing to inconsistencies between the accounts of various witnesses in the trial. I have had regard to the arguments made in this respect. The jury and this Court are entitled to weigh up the inconsistencies in what was a quick and violent attack, where persons were witnessing an unexpected event from different angles. It is the experience of courts that inconsistencies in the accounts of witnesses are likely to occur in such circumstances.

173Likewise, the jury and this Court are entitled to take into account the shock that Ayed, Isam and Fayez Qummou experienced as a result of the unexpected aggressive confrontation and the violent attack involving the use of a knife by the Appellant Abbosh. I am not persuaded that any inconsistencies relied upon by the Appellant Abbosh stand in the way of the acceptance of the core evidence of these witnesses as being truthful and reliable. The evidence of Christine Qummou supported the evidence of Fayez, Ayed and Isam Qummou in significant respects.

174The Appellant Abbosh pointed to aspects of the evidence of Rodney Crossley, Nathan Laing and JT (an 11-year old boy) in support of this ground of appeal. I accept the submissions of the Crown that the evidence of Mr Crossley and Mr Laing relied upon in this respect, was indicative of each witness making observations at a point in time after the Appellant Abbosh had already commenced his attack on Ayed Qummou. 

175I accept the Crown submission that JT did not see the commencement of the fight, but observed a part of the struggle which had been described by Mr Crossley and Mr Laing, and the involvement of the Appellant Bene in that altercation. 

176In any event, none of these three witnesses could be seen as supporting the claim by the Appellant Abbosh that his actions in stabbing the victims were carried out in self-defence. Further, the versions of these three witnesses were not so significantly different from the accounts given by Ayed, Isam and Fayez Qummou that would lead the jury or this Court not to accept their accounts on criminal matters.

177Although there were some features of the evidence of Fayez Qummou which required care in assessment of its reliability, it was and remains necessary to consider his evidence in the context of all the evidence adduced at the trial. It is clear that Fayez Qummou made immediate complaint to Mr Hens of the threat made by the Appellant Bene, with an associated request for security to be present. He made immediate complaint thereafter to police. 

178Submissions were made on behalf of the Appellant Abbosh that the Appellant Bene could not speak English, so that the assertion by members of the Qummou family that he had spoken in English during the initial altercation ought be rejected.

179The jury and this Court are entitled to accept that the Appellant Bene, who had lived in Australia at that time for more than six years, was capable of speaking some English words, particularly swear words when he was angry such as ""I'm gunna fuck youse all up"". The fact that a Crown witness, Rafael Pelli, said that he heard words being spoken in a different language, which sounded ""like Arabic"", is not inconsistent with the evidence of the Qummou family that the Appellant was speaking at times in both Arabic and in English. Further, the evidence of other witnesses, including Nairy Bedrossian, indicated that the Appellant Bene was speaking in English and was also being aggressive during the initial altercation.

180In accordance with the principles set out above at [164], I have made an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and quality. I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant Abbosh was guilty of each of the offences contained in Counts 2 and 5. I have kept in mind that the jury had the advantage of seeing the witnesses give evidence, including the Appellant Abbosh. 

181The verdicts of guilty with respect to the Appellant Abbosh on Counts 2 and 5 are not unreasonable and the verdicts are supported by the evidence. I reject Conviction Ground 3 relied upon by the Appellant Abbosh.

Are the Verdicts of Guilty for the Appellant Bene Unreasonable or Not Supported by the Evidence?

182It is appropriate to first consider the guilty verdict for the Appellant Bene on Count 2. The Crown acknowledges that the Crown case against the Appellant Bene on Count 2 was significantly more cogent than it was for Count 5.

183The Crown pointed (accurately) to the following features of its case against the Appellant Bene on Count 2:

(a) the Qummou family had run the kebab shop and associated stalls at the Markets for many years (since 1990) - the day of these events (3 February 2007) was simply another day for them conducting their business until the behaviour of the Appellant Bene changed everything;

(b) the Appellant Bene, and his friend, Mr Sulaqa, reacted angrily to a simple request that they not eat food from another stall at the reserved tables - it was a perfectly reasonable request from Fayez Qummou, which drew an unjustifiably angry response from the Appellant Bene;

(c) the Appellant Bene took offence to the request that he move and his act in throwing a $20.00 note at Fayez Qummou indicated a measure of disdain;

(d) an altercation then occurred in which the Appellant Bene clearly became angry, with his voice being raised and heard by other persons at the Markets;

(e) the Appellant Bene then threatened Fayez and Ayed Qummou by claiming that ""I'm gunna fuck youse all up"" - if the Appellant Bene had not telephoned his brother immediately, or had his brother not then come immediately to the Markets and come to the kebab stall with his brother to confront the family, then the verbal threat may have been seen as something of an empty gesture - however, the actions of the Appellant Bene in calling his brother, who returned with him to confront the Qummou family, meant that the threat was a sinister and significant one;

(f) the evidence that the Appellant Bene (a citizen of Australia for more than six years) was incapable of using crude English words such as ""I'm gunna fuck youse all up"" was unconvincing - it was entirely plausible and should be accepted that the Appellant Bene spoke English words such as these in anger;

(g) Fayez Qummou made immediate complaint of those words to the organisers of the Markets and requested security help to be posted at his stalls - this evidence supported the version of events given by Fayez and Ayed Qummou, and pointed to the inherent implausibility of the version relied upon by the Appellant Bene at trial (through cross-examination of witnesses) that it was he who was threatened and put at risk;

(h) the Appellant Bene made a telephone call immediately to his brother to come to the Markets - if the Appellant Bene had been threatened, it would have been expected that he would have left the Markets or sought help from security or police, but he did neither, rather he called for reinforcements;

(i) after the Appellant Abbosh arrived at the Markets, his conversation with his brother caused him to become very angry - the jury and this Court are entitled to infer that the Appellant Bene communicated with his brother in a way which stirred up emotion in his brother;

(j) the Appellant Bene then went with his brother (whom the Appellant Bene would have known was angry and upset in light of what he had told him) to the kebab stall, where a confrontation ensued, initiated by the Appellant Abbosh;

(k) the jury and this Court are entitled to accept the evidence of Ayed Qummou that the Appellant Abbosh held a knife above his head and yelled out that he was going to kill Ayed Qummou;

(l) the jury and this Court are entitled to conclude that the Appellant Abbosh had the knife in his possession at the time that he went to the kebab stall - the evidence of the Appellant Abbosh that he simply found a knife lying on the ground, at the time he was being assaulted, was not plausible and was entirely contrary to the evidence of the Qummou family and an independent witness, Mr Bimler, who said that the Appellant Abbosh produced the knife;

(m) a conclusion that the Appellant Abbosh brought the knife with him to the Markets is very significant - having been summoned by his brother to the Markets in response to the altercation, the Appellant Abbosh became very angry and confronted Ayed Qummou, not because of any dispute he had with him, but directly because of what his brother had told him over the telephone and in person - both the jury and this Court should draw the inference that the Appellant Abbosh was acting jointly with the Appellant Bene to achieve what the Appellant Bene had threatened to Ayed and Fayez Qummou - that he would ""fuck them up"";

(n) although, on the Crown case, the Appellant Abbosh was the initial and main aggressor, the Appellant Bene was not simply a passive observer - there was evidence available to the jury and this Court that the Appellant Bene became involved in the physical fight by striking Fayez Qummou;

(o) the trial Judge directed the jury that they were entitled to take the Appellant Bene's flight from the scene as consciousness of guilt, and there has been no challenge to that direction on appeal - flight is an important aspect of this case as the Appellant Bene's case at trial (through cross-examination of witnesses) was to seek to shift the blame to Ayed Qummou and his family - the fact that it was the Appellant Bene who ran from the scene, and not the victims who contacted security prior to the attack and the police immediately after it, fortified the Crown case and emphasised the significance of the Appellant Bene's flight;

(p) when the Appellant Bene fled the scene, he entered a black vehicle in which his blood was located later on two areas of the front console - this evidence pointed to the Appellant Bene bleeding after the incident, this feature being consistent with evidence of his physical involvement in the fight - it pointed to his involvement in a joint criminal enterprise, and not merely as a passive observer.

184I accept the Crown submission that the circumstances recited in the preceding paragraph, when combined together, allowed the jury and this Court to be satisfied that the Appellant Bene meant what he said to the Qummou family - that he would ""fuck them all up"" - and that he put a plan into action by recruiting his brother to come to the Markets to assist him in a violent attack upon Ayed Qummou, in which they subsequently acted in a joint criminal enterprise to maliciously wound that victim with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm. The evidence established that the Appellant Bene was not only present and willing to assist, but actually did assist during the attack, although the acts which constituted the offence in Count 2 were committed by the Appellant Abbosh.

185To the extent that submissions made on behalf of the Appellant Bene sought to place importance on whether the Crown could actually establish whether he had a knife in his possession, I accept the Crown submission that it was not necessary for the Crown to prove that the Appellant Bene was also armed with a knife. 

186It was an essential matter for the Crown to prove that there had been an agreement entered into between the Appellant Bene and the Appellant Abbosh, and this agreement was established on the totality of the evidence.

187Having undertaken an independent assessment of the evidence as to its sufficiency and quality, I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant Bene was guilty of the offence charged in Count 2. 

188Having applied the principles referred to at [164] above, I am satisfied that the verdict of guilty for the Appellant Bene on Count 2 is not unreasonable and is supported by the evidence.

189The Crown case against the Appellant Bene on Count 5 is in a different category.

190It was not part of the Crown case that the Appellant Bene desired to harm Isam Qummou because of the initial altercation. The evidence of the Appellant Bene obtaining his brother's assistance to confront Ayed Qummou, related solely to Count 2.

191For the Appellant Bene to be convicted on Count 5, it was necessary for the jury to be satisfied that, in reaching an agreement with the Appellant Abbosh to maliciously wound Ayed Qummou with intent to do grievous bodily harm, the Appellant Bene contemplated the possibility that other family members would come to Ayed Qummou's assistance and, if they did, that the Appellant Abbosh would then maliciously wound them also, with intent to do grievous bodily harm.

192I accept the Crown submission that the first part of this proposition may not have been that difficult to establish - that being the contemplation by the Appellant Bene that other Qummou family members may come to the assistance of Ayed Qummou. The Appellant Bene had been involved in the initial altercation which involved at least two members of the Qummou family (Fayez and Ayed) so that, when he and the Appellant Abbosh went back to the kebab stall to confront Ayed Qummou, he (Ayed Qummou) would not be by himself. There was a high likelihood that the Appellants would have to confront other persons as well. 

193However, a major difficulty for the Crown was to establish that the Appellant Bene contemplated that the Appellant Abbosh would form the intent required (the intent to cause grievous bodily harm) against someone (such as Isam Qummou) who came to assist Ayed Qummou. It is at this point that there are significant problems for the Crown case on Count 5 against the Appellant Bene.

194I accept the submission for the Appellant Bene that, with respect to Count 5, the foundational offence had to be identified with some precision. Further, the jury should have been directed, and this Court should approach the issue upon the basis that, to find the Appellant Bene guilty on Count 5, it was necessary to establish beyond reasonable doubt that he had in contemplation a substantial or real risk of the Appellant Abbosh using his knife to stab a person who was minded to intervene during the commission of the foundational crime, and in so doing, that the Appellant Abbosh would act with the mental state relevant to the particular count on the indictment (intent to cause grievous bodily harm): R v Dang [2001] NSWCCA 321 at [45]-[46].

195To convict the Appellant Bene on Count 5, it was necessary for the Crown to prove matters which the evidence simply did not support in this case.

196Having undertaken the required independent assessment, I have reached the conclusion that the evidence is not such that it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant Bene was guilty of the offence charged in Count 5. It has been demonstrated that the verdict of guilty on Count 5 is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.

197A consequence of this finding is that the Appellant Bene is entitled to an acquittal on Count 5. 

Conclusions on Conviction Grounds

198In summary, the Appellant Abbosh has:

(a) made good Conviction Ground 5(a), so that his convictions on Counts 2 and 5 should be quashed;

(b) not demonstrated that the verdicts of guilty with respect to Counts 2 and 5 are unreasonable or cannot be supported on the evidence, so that he is not entitled to an acquittal on either count;

(c) not otherwise established any ground of appeal against conviction.

199It was not submitted for the Appellant Abbosh that, if an outcome such as this arose on the appeal, an order for a new trial should not be made. For the purposes of s.8 Criminal Appeal Act 1912, I am satisfied that an order for a new trial should be made in his case.

200In summary, the Appellant Bene has:

(a) made good Conviction Ground 5, so that the convictions on Counts 2 and 5 should be quashed;

(b) succeeded with respect to Conviction Ground 1 in establishing error in directions concerning extended joint criminal enterprise with respect to Count 5;

(c) succeeded on Conviction Ground 2(b) in establishing that the conviction on Count 5 is unreasonable and cannot be supported on the evidence, so that a verdict of acquittal on that count should follow;

(d) not succeeded on Conviction Ground 2(a) with the result that he is not entitled to an acquittal on Count 2;

(e) not otherwise succeeded with respect to any ground of appeal against conviction.

201It was not submitted on behalf of the Appellant Bene that, if his appeal against conviction produced these results, an order for a new trial should not be made with respect to Count 2. For the purposes of s.8 Criminal Appeal Act 1912, I am satisfied that a new trial should be ordered with respect to Ground 2.

Appeals Against Sentence

202Having regard to the outcome of the conviction appeals for each Appellant, it is not necessary to consider the grounds of appeal with respect to sentence. It should be observed, however, that the Crown conceded in this Court that a number of errors had been demonstrated with respect to sentence. 

203In addition, it should be noted that the offences for which the Appellants were sentenced carry a standard non-parole period. The sentences imposed upon them were passed at a time when the relevant law was that stated in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. Should either or both Appellants be convicted again and stand for sentence for an offence under s.33(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900, it will be necessary for a sentencing Judge to apply the principles expressed by the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154. 

204I mention these matters because, if either or both Appellants are to be sentenced in the future for these offences, the sentences imposed in the District Court on 1 October 2010 should not be taken as a useful guide for possible future sentences. In my view, the proper approach for a sentencing Judge, should the Appellants stand for sentence for these offences at a future time, is to put completely to one side the sentences imposed on 1 October 2010.

Orders

205I propose the following orders with respect to the Appellant Abbosh:

(a) appeal against convictions allowed;

(b) convictions and sentences on Counts 2 and 5 are quashed; 

(c) a new trial is ordered on Counts 2 and 5.

206I propose the following orders with respect to the Appellant Bene:

(a) appeal against convictions allowed;

(b) convictions and sentences on Counts 2 and 5 are quashed;

(c) a verdict of acquittal is entered on Count 5;

(d) a new trial is ordered on Count 2.

		08 March 2013",2011-12-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758371,R v CB; MP v R [2011] NSWCCA 264,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: On 3 June 2009 CB and MP (they have been anonymised to avoid any difficulties) were charged with conspiracy to manufacture a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug (methamphetamine) contrary to subsections 11.5(1) and 305.3(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth). MP was also charged with an offence of conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of a border controlled precursor (pseudoephedrine) contrary to subsections 11.5(1) and 307.11(1) of the Code.

2On 15 September 2009 CB was examined before the Australian Crime Commission (""ACC""). Although a transcript was taken of that examination and is in the possession of CB's representatives it was not placed before the District Court and was not provided to this Court. The Director of Public Prosecutions does not have a copy. His examination was not completed and was adjourned until 18 September 2009. However, in the meantime the trial judge's decision in OK v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 1038; 259 ALR 507 was handed down and as a consequence the examination was terminated.

3Both CB and MP have sought a permanent stay of the charges which have been brought against them. A judge of the District Court granted a stay in respect of CB but refused a stay to MP. Her Honour found that in respect of CB the proceedings in the Commission constituted ""a serious interference with the administration of justice."" Her Honour stated two reasons for this finding: 

""First the adversarial nature of the trial has been subverted"" 

4And:

""Second, although there is no proof that material discovered through the examination has been disseminated, the circumstances are such that both the accused and the informed public are likely to be concerned that material has been disseminated, undermining confidence in the independence and impartiality of the criminal justice process.""

5The trial judge acknowledged that the grant of a stay ""is a discretionary remedy"" but concluded that this was an ""exceptional or extreme case."" Her Honour's reasons for that conclusion were summarised and her Honour said:

""I take into account that a central purpose of the examination was to gather information in relation to the charges laid against the accused and his alleged co-conspirators but Mr Ryan, the solicitor for (CB), was assured that the accused would not be questioned about matters directly related to the trial.""

6Although no relevant order was made her Honour's conclusion amounted to a finding that the ACC had committed a contempt of court but her Honour was of the opinion that there was no utility in referring that matter to the Supreme Court and she declined to do so.

7The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals to this Court pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act in respect of the stay granted to CB. MP has also appealed arguing that her Honour erred by not also granting him a stay.

8The Director of Public Prosecutions advanced the following grounds of appeal:

Ground 1: Her Honour erred in finding that the application of the accused constituted an ""exceptional or extreme case"" such that his trial should be stayed permanently.

Ground 2: Her Honour erred in finding that there had been a serious interference with the administration of justice.

Ground 3: Her Honour erred in finding that the adversarial nature of the trial of the accused had been subverted.

Ground 4: Her Honour erred in finding that although, given the evidence of Federal Agent Mohammed Hussain, there was no proof that material discovered through the examination of the accused by the Australian Crime Commission has been disseminated, the circumstances of the examination were such that both the accused and the informed public were likely to be concerned that material has been disseminated, undermining confidence in the independence and impartiality of the criminal justice process, inter alia, by undermining confidence in the impartiality of prosecuting authorities.

Ground 5: Her Honour erred in finding that:
(a) the examination of the accused was initiated and driven by the Australian Federal Police; and
(b) the central purpose of the examination was to gather information in relation to the charges against the accused and his alleged co-conspirators.

Ground 6: Her Honour erred in finding that there was an alleged fraud on power committed by the Australian Crime Commission, through an undertaking given by Ms Joanna Austin, as to the subject matter of the examination and that this amounted to an aggravating circumstance to be taken into account in reaching the conclusion at paragraph [84](2).

Ground 7: Her Honour erred in finding that the circumstances of the examination of the accused amounted to a contempt of court.

Ground 8: Her Honour erred in the interpretation of Hammond v The Commonwealth (1982) 152 CLR 188 and its applicability to the respondent's claim for a permanent stay.

Ground 9: Her Honour erred in finding that the majority decision and its consideration of the provisions of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 in Australian Crime Commission v OK (2010) 185 FCR 258 should not be followed.

9MP advanced the following grounds of appeal:

Ground 1: Her Honour erred in law in failing to permanently stay the proceedings against the applicant having found ""...that a central purpose of the examination was to gather information in relation to the charges laid against the accused and his alleged co-conspirators, including the co-accused. "" [Paragraph 91 of the reasons for decision dated 30 June 2011 ""the decision""].

Ground 2: Her Honour erred in law in failing to permanently stay the proceedings against the applicant for reason that ""...it is not a contempt of court to use a coercive statutory power to obtain evidence that could be obtained through the normal court process, the compulsory examination of the accused in relation to the co-accused cannot, of itself constitute interference with the administration of justice because the accused could be required to give evidence in the trial of the co-accused. "" [Paragraph 89 of the decision]; when process is not available as a matter of law to coerce or compel a co-accused to give evidence against another co-accused in a joint trial.

Ground 3: Her Honour erred in law in holding, on the basis of Hak Song Ra v Australian Crime Commission [2004] FCA 416; (2004) 138 FCR 51, or otherwise, that the position of joint accused is the same as that of persons suspected, or persons who might be called as a witness, where there is no extant criminal process against the applicants [Paragraph 90 of the decision].

Ground 4:l Her Honour erred in law in failing to permanently stay the proceedings against the applicant having found ""...that there has been a serious interference with the administration of justice"" in respect of the joint trial in which the applicant was co-accused with the party subject to coercive interrogation about the charges laid against the co-conspirators including the applicant [Paragraph 98 of the decision].

Ground 5: Her Honour erred in law in failing to permanently stay the proceedings against the applicant for reasons that the adversarial nature of the joint trial of the applicant as co-accused had been subverted and that the applicant and the informed public are likely to be concerned that material has been disseminated, undermining confidence in the independence and impartiality of the criminal justice process in the same way that these reasons were applied to the accused [Paragraph 98 of the decision].

Ground 6: Her Honour erred in law in failing to permanently stay the proceedings against the applicant having found serious interference with the administration of justice, abuse of process and contempt of court in respect of the proceedings in which the applicant is co-accused with the party subject to the coercive examination when the central purpose of the examination was to gather information in relation to the charges laid against the accused including the applicant and there is a real risk of dissemination and or derivative use of that information for advantage by (or in) the prosecution of and without disclosure to the applicant.

Ground 7: Her Honour erred in law in failing to permanently stay the proceedings against the applicant (rather than just the accused), in light of the finding that there has been serious interference with the administration of justice and contempt of the same court exercising the same Commonwealth jurisdiction in respect of joint criminal proceedings, in breach of the applicant's right to a fair trial by jury within the meaning of s 80 of the Constitution

10I am of the opinion that the appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions must succeed but that of MP must fail.

The standing of the Australian Crime Commission

11It seems that the trial judge granted the ACC leave to intervene and become a party to the proceedings from the first day. However, the entitlement of the ACC to apply for that leave does not appear to have been considered.

12Subsequently on 28 March 2011, by which time no doubt the basis for the application for the respective stays had been made plain, counsel appeared for the ACC and was granted leave to appear with no objection from any party. The reason for the ACC to have engaged counsel to appear was no doubt because of the notice which had been given to it indicating that orders would be sought against the ACC alleging that it had, by conducting the examination, committed a contempt. The primary judge confirmed that no party had objected to the ACC appearing to protect its interests in respect of the alleged contempt. Thereafter counsel for the ACC tendered evidence and otherwise participated in the hearing. 

13Before this Court the ACC submitted that as it was a party to the proceedings below it is a ""party"" for the purpose of s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) and may appeal to this Court. This, of course, presupposes that there is a relevant interlocutory judgment or order (s 5F(3)) in respect of which the ACC may appeal.

14There can be no doubt that the DPP as the prosecutor of both CB and MP is entitled to appeal the order for a stay in respect of CB and defend the appeal by MP. The primary judge considered the allegation that the ACC was in contempt, albeit briefly, but decided to dismiss the application to have that matter referred to this Court. In that event there could not be any relevant interlocutory judgment or order against which the ACC may appeal.

15The motions which were filed do not include an application that the ACC be dealt with for contempt although it is apparent that both the parties and her Honour acted upon the basis that such an application had been made. That being the case the appeal by MP raised again the possibility of the ACC being referred for contempt. For that reason at least as a respondent it is properly a party to this appeal. This is sufficient to dispose of the issue concerning the standing of the ACC. However, I record below the submission made by the ACC.

16The ACC submitted there is no principle that only a party against whom a judgment or order is made may appeal from that judgment or order. A party may appeal against a judgment or order which, while not being a judgment or order made against him or her, affects the party's interests. The relevant principles were summarised by Handley JA (Giles JA agreeing) in Insurance Exchange of Australasia v Dooley (2000) 50 NSWLR 222 at 228, [24] - [26] as follows:

[24] A litigant who is a party to proceedings, and bound by a judgment which is adverse to his interests must, in principle, have the necessary standing to appeal. In Attorney General for Australia v The Queen [1957] AC 288 the Attorney General, as an intervener in the proceedings below, was permitted to appeal from the decision of the High Court.

[25] It is also well established that a defendant who is prejudiced by a judgment against another defendant may appeal and secure its reversal or variation see Hanson v Wearmouth Coal Co [1939] 3 All ER 47 CA, 55, Unsworth v Commissioner for Railways (1958) 101 CLR 73, 88, 94, 95 (where the appellant obtained an order increasing the amount of the judgment entered against another defendant), Castellan v Electric Power Transmission Pty Limited (1967) 69 SR (NSW) 159, 175, 186-7, 188, Oceanic Crest Shipping Company v Pilbara Harbour Services Pty Limited (1986) 160 CLR 626, 670-2 per Brennan J and 679-80 per Deane J, James Hardie & Co Pty Ltd v Seltsam Pty Ltd (1998) 196 CLR 53, 63 per Gaudron and Gummow JJ, Kelly v Newcastle Protective Coating Pty Ltd [1973] 2 NSWLR 45, 52-3, and Taren Point Bowling and Recreation Club v Shapter [1982] 1 NSWLR 219, 223-4.

[26] Similarly in Helicopter Sales (Australia) Pty Limited v Rotor-Work Pty Ltd (1974) 132 CLR 1 the High Court allowed an appeal by a third party against a judgment for the plaintiff.""

17The ACC submitted that even though the order of the primary judge of 30 June 2011 permanently staying the respondent's trial was not an order or judgment made against the ACC, it prejudiced the ACC in at least two ways.

18First, it was submitted that it was based on what, in substance, was a finding that the ACC had engaged in a contempt of court. This is so notwithstanding that the primary judge did not refer ""the contempt of Court to the Supreme Court for determination"" because she took the view that there was ""no utility"" in doing so. Accordingly, the ACC is prejudiced, in at least a reputational sense, by findings of the primary judge that it committed a contempt of court, even though her Honour refused relief in relation to that contempt.

19Second, the ACC was said to be prejudiced because, by reason of the decision of the primary judge not to follow the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Australian Crime Commission v OK [2010] FCAFC 61; [2010] 185 FCR 258, the ACC is faced with conflicting judicial decisions as to the construction of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) (ACC Act). The ACC has an overriding obligation to implement the ACC Act according to the law as declared by the judicial arm of government exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth under Chapter III of the Constitution: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Indooroopilly Children Services (Qld) Pty Limited [2007] 158 FCR 325 at [3]-[6] per Allsop J, at [41]-[48] per Edmonds J (Stone J agreeing with both at [1]).

20It was submitted that the position of regulators and their obligation to apply the law as declared by the judicial branch of government has led to the development of a jurisdiction to allow appeals where the order or judgment of the court below is not erroneous, but the reasoning on which it is based is, which jurisdiction is exercised by varying the orders of the court below to include an appropriate declaration: see Baxter Healthcare Pty Limited v Comptroller General of Customs (1997) 72 FCR 467 at 483 per Burchett J, 491 per Moore J and 499 per Merkel J; Secretary, Department of Social Security v Lowe (1999) 92 FCR 26 at 34, per Burchett, Kiefel and Hely JJ; Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board of Trustees v Kitching (2004) 139 FCR 272 (Kitching) at 274, [3] per RD Nicholson, Jacobson and Bennett JJ and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Telstra Corporation Ltd (2009) 176 FCR 203 at 209, 210 and at 217, 218, per Ryan, Jacobson and Foster JJ.

21The jurisdiction developed was explained by the Full Court in Kitching at 274, as follows:

[3] Although ordinarily a right of appeal lies only in respect of a Court's orders and not its reasons, there is an exception to this rule. As a Full Court said in Secretary Department of Social Security v Lowe (1999) 92 FCR 26 at [16], an order read in the light of the reasons justifying it may leave open to be implemented a conclusion which a Full Court holds to be erroneous. In such a case the Court has power on appeal to vary the order made below by the addition of an appropriate declaration, see Baxter Healthcare Pty Limited v Comptroller General of Customs (1997) 72 FCR 467 at 483.

22It was further submitted that the primary judge's finding that the ACC engaged in a contempt of court has been sought to be sustained in this Court. This leads to the application of the principle stated by Dixon CJ and Webb J in Commissioner of Police v Tanos (1958) 98 CLR 383 at 395 - 396:

""... it is a deep-rooted principle of the law that before anyone can be punished or prejudiced in his person or property by any judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding he must be afforded an adequate opportunity of being heard ... The general principle has been restated in this court .. It is hardly necessary to add that its application to proceedings in the established courts is a matter of course""

23Finally it was submitted that the principle stated by Dixon CJ and Webb J in Commissioner of Police v Tanos is engaged where the relevant prejudicial effect is a prejudicial effect on reputation: Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 577 - 578 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ and at 592 per Brennan J, Johns v Australian Securities Commission (1993) 178 CLR 408 at 437 per Dawson J, at 456 - 457 per Toohey J, at 470 - 471 per McHugh J.

24The argument developed by the ACC has force although it does not in terms address the question in this case where the right of appeal is both provided and confined by the Criminal Appeal Act. Because there is no interlocutory judgment or order affecting the ACC an appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Act may not be available. However, as I have indicated I do not believe that it is necessary to resolve the issue of whether they are entitled to appeal to this Court.

The evidence of Mr Ryan and Ms Austin

25Both CB and MP together with others were charged with the relevant offences in June 2009. Although the ACC had previously commenced inquiries CB was only summonsed to appear before an Examiner at a hearing which was fixed for 15 September 2009. The summons described his obligation to give evidence in the following terms:

""... to give evidence of federally relevant criminal activity involving the importation and manufacture of amphetamine type stimulants and the possession and supply of substances for that manufacture; and noting that:

i. persons involved in the investigation of you in relation to current charges on foot against you will not be permitted to attend; and
ii. a non publication order will prevent information being published to those persons and to the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions; 

...""

26CB attended and was questioned by counsel assisting the Commission. His examination was not completed on 15 September and was to be continued on 18 September. The delivery of the trial judgment in OK intervened and the examination was terminated.

27CB and his advisers have a copy of the transcript of the examination held on 15 September. The DPP does not have a copy of the transcript.

28Counsel for CB did not tender the transcript before the primary judge. Although counsel for MP sought a copy that request was not pursued. Accordingly, the evidence of the questions and answers during the examination was confined to evidence given by witnesses who gave evidence before the primary judge. This was comprised of both affidavit and viva voce evidence.

29Before the examination at the ACC there was a discussion between the solicitor for CB, Mr Ryan and counsel assisting the ACC, Ms Austin. Mr Ryan gave evidence before the primary judge by affidavit and was cross examined. In his affidavit he says that CB was served with his summons by Mohammad Hussain who he knew to be an Australian Federal Police Officer. Because of his concern that an AFP officer was connected with the ACC he rang Ms Austin. He said that he took the following steps:

""Accordingly, I telephoned the ACC to express my concerns and there spoke to Joanna Austin, Counsel assisting. The following conversation took place in words to the following effect:

Ryan: 'I am the solicitor acting on behalf of CB who has received a summons to appear at the ACC on 15 September 2009. I am concerned that Hussain is an AFP officer. Will he be in attendance at the hearing?'

Austin: 'I am unaware of any person serving the Summons being involved in the investigation of your client. I will make checks but I don't believe there is a concern here. In relation to Mr Hussain, he is unable to liaise with colleagues with the AFP and as he is an officer seconded to the ACC he has had and will have little involvement or contact with the AFP. In any even, CB will not be examined in relation to matters that are the subject of charges presently on foot.'

Prior to the commencement of the examination at the ACC on 15 September 2009 I received instructions from the accused to the effect that he had discovered a statement of Hussain in the brief of evidence which indicated that Hussain was directly involved in the investigation of the alleged conspiracy with which the accused stood charged. At the ACC before commencement of the examination I had a conversation with Joanna Austin, Counsel assisting in the presence of CB when the following conversation took place in words to the effect:

Ryan: 'I have been advised that Hussain has been involved in the investigation of the conspiracy charges against CB and my client has found a witness statement from him in the police brief.'

Austin: 'I will raise the matter with Mr Hannaford who is the examiner but his presence should not be of a concern as the charges against CB are not the purpose of the examination and in any event Hussain will not be able to liaise with colleagues from the AFP.'

Shortly thereafter I had a further conversation with Austin in the presence of Hussain when she said to me words to the effect:

Austin: 'I have told the examiner and we are satisfied that Hussain's presence will pose no problem to the examination. CB will be able to raise a general objection to all questions asked. We are aware that there are current charges against CB but he will not be asked questions that directly relate to his trial. There will be questions pertaining to his knowledge regarding the chemical compositions and methods of manufacture of illicit drugs. We have a chemist who will be present at the examination to assist in asking questions concerning drug manufacture.'

There was several breaks during the examination and I particularly recall one such break when Counsel assisting, in the presence of Hussain, said to me words to the following effect:

Austin: 'I believe CB is withholding information and he is doing himself a disservice.'

Hussain: 'The AFP have got a strong case against CB and I don't believe what he is saying.'

30Ms Austin gave viva voce evidence before the primary judge. She was asked in chief whether she recalled the conversation with Mr Ryan. She responded ""I recall the conversation, I do not recall the content of the conversation."" She said that she made no note of the conversation.

31Later she was asked whether at any stage she had indicated to anybody ""that there would be questions at the examination relating to CB's knowledge of chemical composition and manufacture of illicit drugs."" She responded by saying she believed this had occurred but could not remember to whom she had said it.

32She was subsequently asked whether the questions asked of CB ""touched on the charges against him?"" and she answered ""yes.""

33Ms Austin was cross-examined by counsel for CB. She again confirmed that she had no recollection of the content of conversations with Mr Ryan. However, later when pressed by counsel she said that she remembered in ""general terms, and general terms only, and I've not been drawn on exactly - I can't be drawn on what I exactly said, but during conversation with Mr Ryan, I believe, yes, that I said that questions would be posed of the witness in relation to the matters before the Court.""

34Ms Austin was asked about whether she had any inhibition in questioning CB about matters relating to the pending criminal charges. She said that because of the conditions on the summons excluding persons involved in the current charges from attending and with the knowledge that a non-publication order would be made she had no inhibition. This answer was as I understand the position consistent with the practice of the Commission in relation to examinations, at least before publication of the trial judgment in OK.

35Mr Ryan was also cross-examined before the primary judge. With respect to Mr Hussain he confirmed that there had been a discussion before the ACC hearing about his presence at the ACC hearing. He agreed that he was told that he had been authorised by the ACC to be present. He was then asked about his conversation with Ms Austin concerning the matters to be discussed during the hearing. The following exchange occurred:

""Q: That is really a rolled up version of the first matter I wanted to raise with you just on that paragraph. The second is the last sentence that you have written there that your recollection was that she said words to this effect, in relation to prospective matters at the examination. You've indicated that your recollection is that she said 'in any event' or words to this effect, 'in any event [CB] will not be examined in relation to matters that are the subject of charges presently on foot.' Now again I can't give you the exact terms of what was said but could I suggest to you that she said words to the effect that he would be examined on that material, that is I'm suggesting, the opposite of what you've said in that sentence?
A: I remember that attached to the summons was a document relating to chemical compositions and synthetic drugs, so I was concerned as to the topic of the examination and I understood from my discussion with Ms Austin and I had more than one discussion with her, that what was to be discussed at the ACC was at least primarily to do with that.

HER HONOUR

Q: With what?
A: With my client's understanding of synthetic drugs and chemical compositions. Now, I've got in my affidavit of Ms Austin saying that he will not be examined in relation to matters that are the subject of charges presently on foot. I've got a memory of Ms Austin saying that. When she said it it was either on the telephone or on the day - on the morning of the examination itself. My memory fails me to say exactly when, but prior to the examination starting it was - it was said to me that that - his current matter will not be traversed in that way. I had an understanding that that was to be the case.

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q: If I may I'll just come to the conversations that you've referred to in paragraph 7 onwards about the day of the actual hearing, if I may in a moment.
A: Yes.

Q: Do I follow that what you're saying in relation to the paragraph 6 conversation we're just looking at now, Ms Austin's words?
A: Yes.

Q: Or the words that you recall that are to that effect? Do I follow that you are not sure whether she said that on the phone at all that topic?
A: Yes, I'm not sure if she said that on the phone. I'm recollecting today that it was said before the actual examination at some stage. Whether it was on the phone or whether it was actually at the examination or on the day of the examination on 15 September or not I can't say for certain today.

Q: Perhaps I should move to that. Paragraph 7, I think, is the second convenient reference to that topic, that is the purpose or the scope of the examination and anything Ms Austin said about it. Do you see the reference she makes in your affidavit that again you've referred to her saying the charges against [CB] are not the purpose of the examination, or words to that effect? Again what I'd like to suggest to you is that at the hearing on 15 September 2009 whatever she said about that topic, whatever words were used, the meaning of the words was in fact the opposite of what you've attributed to her? By that I mean she said that the examination would involve examination in relation to the charge or charges that were against [CB] at that stage?
A: I understood it to be referred to me as not being part of her involvement or part of the examination that day. I remember specifically her expressing the main concern that [CB] had and I had was that there was an AFP officer present that day. That had been relayed to me that morning and confirmed by [CB] that that particular officer was actually involved in the investigation itself. I was anxious to get across to Ms Austin that particular concern that morning. I received - she - and as it's said in my affidavit I've related those concerns to her. On the summons I was - there was someone present in relation to the chemical compositions and the synthetic drugs aspect of it, so I remember that was at least to be the primary purpose. I understood that there were to be questions asked, but I also understood that in terms of his current charges he wouldn't be expected to raise his defence. Now, it wasn't said expressly, as I understand, in terms of his raising his defence by Ms Austin, but in a general sense I understood he would not be asked concerning the current charges and my memory is, the reason why I understand that today is because she said it to me.""

36And later:

""Q: That's right. That Ms Austin told you, Mr Ryan?
A: I believe that she said that it wouldn't touch on the current charges. I did go there with no expectation that that wouldn't happen, the advice I had from senior counsel at the time was what led me to believe that I had no other option other than what I would regard as a resigned approach. It was to be somewhat of an observer of the proceedings and do my best in the circumstances. That was - so what I'm saying is I believe that Ms Austin told me that they wouldn't touch on it. When they did touch on it it didn't necessarily surprise me.

Q: What I'm trying to get at I suppose Mr Ryan is this, do you allow for the fact that you may be wrong in your memory today about the suggestions I think we have three of them if I can refer you to paragraph 6, paragraph 7 and paragraph 8 where you suggested Ms Austin has said that there wouldn't be questions touching on--
A: I have a firm belief that I'm not wrong and yes that's as high as I can put it.

Q: Are you able to explain why you have that firm belief, on what basis, or?
A: Well I've never been to the ACC before so it was the first time that I dealt with that particular body and I believe that my memory is accurate of the conversations that I had with Ms Austin. True it is that I didn't make any actual notes or start to draft an affidavit until March the next year but there were discussions had regarding what had occurred with [CB] and others in my legal team which confirmed in my mind what had occurred at the proceedings. I mean I believe my memory is accurate. I remember thinking at the time that the examination commenced in questions that were asked pertaining to the charges themselves. I remember thinking at the time this is not going to plan and that was on my belief that I was told that those topics were not going to be covered. So I never received any written documents from the ACC as to what occurred. I was told in conferences what I could expect. When Ms Austin was speaking with me I did my best to listen very carefully.

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q: Can I just get this clear though, that if what you were telling me earlier was correct, that is that you're now unsure, do I follow that the reference that you make in paragraph 6 to her suggestions that there would be no examination in relation to matters that are subject of charges, that your memory is not as good as you believe it is?
A: Yes I, I, in terms of telephone conversation that's attributed, words to the effect in paragraph 6 I can see that I may be mistaken in relation to what Ms Austin, what I said Ms Austin said to me about current charges.

HER HONOUR

Q: But I'm just not clear. I thought that earlier you said that you can't be sure what was said to you on the phone and what you were uncertain about was when it was said there was no level of uncertainty about whether it was said. What is the position in that regard?
A: I know it was said but I don't know when it was said. So what I'm conceding is I suppose the same thing could be said in relation to paragraph 7, I'm just not sure when it occurred but I'm sure it occurred.

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q: But did you just tell us a moment ago that you went there do we follow, if there was no conversation with Ms Austin about the subject matter of the examination, the prospected examination on the phone, you went there with your advice from senior counsel expecting that there would be questions to that effect or could be perhaps is the proper way to describe it?
A: That's fair to say. I didn't - I didn't raise with counsel concerns that he'd be asked regarding - that I'd been told by Ms Austin that there'd be questions regarding current charges, so I think it's more likely that it occurred on the morning.

Q: What I suggest to you is that really the topic itself, that is you're suggesting your memory that she said there wouldn't be any topic relating to current charges?
A: Yes.

Q: And my suggestion to you that she said effectively the opposite. You're suggesting that you're certain of that in your mind now or what level of certainty could you put it at in a percentage?
A: Well I remember as I've said I'm certain because if you want to put a level on it, I'm certain because I remember thinking at the time they're touching upon the current charges that this is not what I anticipated would occur and that was at the result of what was said by Ms Austin to me prior. So I'm certain, I mean I can't put a level on it, I can say I'm certain.""

37It is apparent that Mr Ryan is unsure as to whether the issue of concern was discussed before the examination and on the telephone or at the ACC premises just before the hearing. Although in this portion of his evidence he expressed concern about the possibility of questions being asked relating to the charges his client was facing he crystallised those concerns in his later evidence making plain that the significant concern was that CB should not be asked questions which required him to disclose his defence to the charges. The following exchange occurred:

""Q: Secondly, you were concerned about the representations that had been made to you by counsel assisting the commission concerning the subject matter of the examination not relating to the criminal proceedings that were pending against your client?
A: No, when I expressed those concerns what was in my mind at the time primary was--

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I object to this your Honour, with greatest of respect to Mr Ryan.

HER HONOUR

Q: Yes, it's not what was in your mind, it's what you actually discussed, what you actually said.
A: What I said to the commission at the time was I was concerned about disclosing portions of the defence and the investigating authorities getting access to that, the investigating authorities in his current matter getting access to that portion of his evidence which disclosed, as I said, portions of his defence. That was my concern"" (emphasis added).

38This response to my mind is plausible. It is hard to imagine that if CB was to be examined about matters relating to illegal drugs, given that he had been charged with offences of that nature, his examination would not raise matters relevant to the charges. Whether he would be asked questions that would require him to disclose his defence was another matter. Without the transcript it is not possible to determine with any confidence what occurred at the examination. However, there is no evidence that he was asked questions or gave answers during the examination which related to matters concerning his defence to the charge.

The trial judge's finding regarding the evidence of Mr Ryan

39The trial judge concluded that there were inconsistencies between the evidence of Mr Ryan and Ms Austin which were difficult to reconcile. Her Honour resolved those difficulties after having regard to two matters. Firstly, her Honour accepted that attending the ACC as he did for the first time and the circumstances which became a ""most unpleasant episode in his professional life"" Mr Ryan's memory would be ""reasonably good.""

40Secondly, her Honour considered the demeanour of Ms Austin and expressed the following conclusion:

""Ms Austin gave evidence for the respondent. At times, her evidence was delivered in an overly confident fashion. On many occasions, questions concerning important matters were followed by long pauses. Counsel for the respondent cross-examined Mr Ryan to the effect that his evidence of conversations with Ms Austin was wrong in critical respects. However, when Ms Austin gave evidence about the same conversations, she initially disavowed a recollection of their terms. In my view, in so far as Ms Austin's evidence differed from that of Mr Ryan, it was unreliable and did not detract from the weight to be attached to Mr Ryan's evidence.""

41The critical finding in her Honour's reasons is that contrary to the assertion by Ms Austin that she had forewarned Mr Ryan that CB would be asked questions about the charges her Honour accepted ""Mr Ryan's evidence that Ms Austin did not do so."" Instead her Honour found that ""prior to the examination, Ms Austin reassured Mr Ryan that the accused would not be questioned about matters directly related to the trial.""

42There are difficulties with her Honour's finding. Firstly Mr Ryan's recollection of the sequence of events and when the relevant conversation occurred is uncertain. Secondly it is clear that he does not have a precise recollection of the conversation. His ultimate position was rather than express a concern about questions relating to the charges he ""was concerned about disclosing portions of the defence.""

43Having regard to Mr Ryan's lack of precision, his evidence as to the substance of the advice he received from senior counsel and his ultimate position that he was concerned to protect CB from having to disclose his defence the challenge to her Honour's conclusion has substance. I have difficulty in accepting that either party contemplated that there would be any useful discussion in the examination without there being some questions which at least in a general sense related to the charges. The advice which Mr Ryan received from senior counsel seems to have contemplated that this would occur. However, in the event I do not believe the resolution of this issue is necessary. What matters in so far as it can be ascertained are the questions which were actually asked during the examination and their consequence, if any, for the prospective trials.

The course of the examination

44I have previously indicated that although a transcript of the examination of CB was taken it was not tendered before the primary judge and this Court has not seen it. Knowledge of the questioning which occurred is confined to the secondary evidence of some of those present at the examination.

45Ms Austin confirmed that the examination was initiated by the AFP rather than the ACC.

46The situation is complicated by the presence of Mr Hussain at the examination. Mr Hussain, an AFP officer, had on occasions been part of the surveillance team that conducted surveillance as part of Operation ""X"". He has not conducted surveillance on CB. He has not otherwise been involved in the investigation of either MP or CB. However, because a joint trial is contemplated Mr Hussain has been included on a prospective witness list. Given his limited contribution whether he will be called to give evidence is uncertain. As I understand the position his evidence would be limited to the formalities necessary to support the tender of the surveillance material.

47The primary judge recorded the fact that Mr Hussain had known Mr Briggs, the AFP officer in charge of the investigation for 13 years and that they enjoyed a close professional relationship. This would no doubt be a common occurrence with members of the AFP who may from time to time work with the ACC.

48The primary judge found that it was Mr Briggs who ""initiated"" and drove the examination. He had prepared a ""significant events chronology"" a ""summary of investigation"" and a document containing ""suggested lines of questioning."" Mr Briggs apparently met with Mr Hussain and Ms Austin to brief them about the investigation. Mr Hussain served the summons on CB and was nominated as the ""ACC contact officer."" It also seems from an exchange which occurred between Mr Hussain and Mr Ryan at the ACC hearing rooms that Mr Hussain has considerable knowledge of the evidence which the prosecution propose to tender at any trial of MP and CB.

49The primary judge found, and it is essential to her reasoning that ""a central purpose"" of the examination was to gather information in relation to the charges. This finding is challenged in this Court.

50In his evidence before the primary judge Mr Ryan expressed his concerns that Mr Hussain had been present during the examination and appeared to be giving instructions to Ms Austin. However, his affidavit is heavily redacted and he does not give evidence as to the questions asked of or the answers given by CB. His evidence was, as I have indicated that he remembered thinking at the time ""that the examination commenced in questions that were asked pertaining to the charges themselves."" He said he remembered thinking that ""this is not going to plan."" He said that he remembered thinking at the time ""they're touching upon the current charges.""

51Mr Ryan did not raise any issue of concern with the Examiner. Although his evidence is clear that he recollects questions ""pertaining"" or ""touching upon the charges"" he does not give evidence that matters disclosing any portion of CB's defence were touched upon. That was the issue which he said was of concern to him.

52The evidence of Ms Austin was that the purpose of the examination was ""to understand methodologies used in the manufacture of amphetamine-type stimulants."" She agreed when cross-examined that CB was asked questions relating to the charges - responding ""Broadly, in matters that related to the charges.""

53The following exchange occurred:

""Q: I mean there would be no point to that because you had your own in-house forensic chemist who would be able to answer all those sorts of questions.
A: Yes, I'm not qualified, I don't have the expertise to - I have some understanding but I don't have the expertise to ask very complex questions in relation to science, chemistry and--

Q: But what I mean is why would you get in an alleged criminal to ask him how you manufacture amphetamines when you've got a forensic chemist who is part of your staff who you could readily ask such questions of?
A: Because - and I can only speak in general terms, but the general, sometimes people, particularly people who have a scientific background and have studied have looked at new - may have looked at new ways in which to manufacture these compounds that are eventually - that may be termed narcotics that our chemists are yet to understand.""

54Later she was asked:

Q: Because the purpose of the examination was to further the purposes of the investigation of these charges, wasn't it?
A: Not to my knowledge.

Q: What was the purpose of the examination?
A: Without saying what occurred during the examination, to understand methodologies used in the manufacture of amphetamine-type stimulants.

Q: But he was asked questions about these charges specifically--
A: Broadly, in matters that related to the charges, yes.

Q: The examination wasn't confined to objective matters of science and technology, as it were, in relation to the manufacture of the substances, was it?
A: Correct.""

55In her evidence Ms Austin said that she believed that having regard to the terms of the summons, she was entitled to ask questions relating to the pending criminal charges. No objection was taken to her questions and she was not stopped by the Examiner from asking any questions.

56She was asked about the role of Mr Hussain in the examination:

""Q: Mr Hussain's function was to make notes of the examination, wasn't it?
A: I do not say it's part of his function, but it is something that he did.

Q: He did. And he took those notes away at the end?
A: I do not know.

Q: And you don't know what the purpose of his taking notes was?
A: Well he was taking notes of what occurred during the examination.

57The primary judge made findings about the examination and the participation of various persons. Her Honour found that not many questions were asked of CB about the science of drug manufacture. However, her Honour found that CB ""was examined in detail about the charge pending against him."" Drawing upon the evidence of Mr Hussain her Honour found:

""He was asked about his discussions with others concerning the manufacture of stimulant drugs, his relationships with alleged co-conspirators, whether there were discussions with alleged co-conspirators in relation to the manufacture of drugs, overseas travel, whether he himself had manufactured drugs, whether he had been given precursor chemicals by a co-conspirator, and whether he had provided technical assistance to others in relation to the manufacture of drugs. There were 'a lot of questions' on these topics, Most of the day was occupied with questions on these or similar topics (Mr Hussain's evidence).""

The position of Mr Hussain

58The case made by CB before the primary judge was that the examination had as a central purpose the gathering of information in relation to the criminal proceedings for the purpose of furthering the prosecution. Central to his case was that information obtained in the examination was communicated to the prosecuting authorities. The submission focused on the role of Mr Hussain.

59Mr Hussain was present throughout the examination and took notes during it which he said, without contradiction, were taken back to his office at the AFP and placed in a locked filing cabinet.

60Mr Hussain gave evidence that he had communicated information to no one. Her Honour without any apparent evidentiary foundation was sceptical of his evidence saying that although Mr Hussain appeared to be a forthright witness ""it is always difficult to assess the credibility of an experienced police officer."" That comment was not appropriate. I do not understand her Honour to have rejected Mr Hussain's evidence.

61In any event the evidentiary position is plain. There was the evidence of Mr Hussain and nothing to contradict or even cast doubt upon it. 

The decision of the trial judge

62Having determined that she could not find that information gained during the examination had been disseminated her Honour identified the first question which she was required to answer as ""whether the compulsory interrogation of an accused under the ACC Act about pending charges constitutes an interference with the administration of justice."" It is not apparent that CB put his case in that manner.

63Her Honour records that CB's counsel did not put to either Mr Hussain or Ms Austin that the purpose of the examination was to assist in the investigation or prosecution of the accused. However, her Honour did not believe that in the circumstances this was necessary. Her Honour explained the position:

""The s 7C determination predated the charging of the applicants. It was always the applicants' case that the unspoken agenda of the examination was to further the prosecution and that Mr Hussain had actually disseminated information to the AFP in its capacity as investigator/prosecutor of the charges that had been laid. Consequently, there was no need to put to the witnesses that the purpose of the examination was to assist the investigation and prosecution.

The terms of the summons, the timing of the examination, the role of Mr Briggs, Mr Hussain and the AFP generally in relation to the examination, and the subject matter canvassed during the examination support a strong inference that, although there may have been other purposes as well, a central purpose of the examination conducted by the ACC was to gather information in relation to the subject matter of the criminal proceedings against the accused and his allege co-conspirators, presumably for the purpose of furthering the prosecution.

In these proceedings, the applicants did not argue that such a purpose was beyond the power of the ACC. Rather, they relied upon the purpose as material supporting their contention that information obtained through the examination was actually conveyed to the authorities prosecuting the trial.""

64Her Honour concluded that there had been a serious interference with the administration of justice. She found that the adversarial nature of the trial had been subverted. Although she could not find that any of the information gathered in the examination had been disseminated her Honour found that ""the accused and the public are likely to be concerned that material has been disseminated, undermining confidence in the independence and impartiality of the criminal justice process."" Her reasoning involves an express rejection of the decision of the Full Court in Australian Crime Commission v OK (above) in respect of which her Honour said of the decision of Emmett and Jacobson JJ that it was ""plainly wrong.""

Relevant Provisions of the ACC Act

65The functions of the ACC are set out in s 7A of the ACC Act, which provides: 

""The ACC has the following functions:

(a) to collect, correlate, analyse and disseminate criminal information and intelligence and to maintain a national database of that information and intelligence;
(b) to undertake, when authorised by the Board, intelligence operations;
(c) to investigate, when authorised by the Board, matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity;
(d) ...""

66Pursuant to section 7C(3) of the Act:

""The Board may determine, in writing, that an investigation into matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity is a special investigation. Before doing so, it must consider whether ordinary police methods of investigation into the matters are likely to be effective.""

67Sections 12(1) and 59(7) of the ACC Act provide for the dissemination by the CEO of information gathered in the course of an examination:

""12(1) Where the ACC, in carrying out an ACC operation/investigation, obtains evidence of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, being evidence that would be admissible in a prosecution for the offence, the CEO must assemble the evidence and give it to:

the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or the State, as the case requires; or

the relevant law enforcement agency;... ""

""59(7) The CEO may give to

any law enforcement agency or

any information that is in the ACC's possession and that is relevant to the activities of that agency or body if it appears to the CEO to be appropriate to do so; and to do so would not be contrary to a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that would otherwise apply."" (emphasis added)

68Section 24A refers to the purpose of an examination and states:

""An examiner may conduct an examination for the purposes of a special ACC operation/investigation ""

69Section 28 provides the power to summons witnesses and to take evidence.

70Subsections 25A(3) and (9) provide for the security of evidence given before an examiner. Section 25A provides:

""(3) An examination before an examiner must be held in private and the examiner may give directions as to the persons who may be present during the examination or a part of the examination.

...

(9) An examiner may direct that:

(a) any evidence given before the examiner; or

(b) the contents of any document, or a description of any thing, produced to the examiner; or

(c) any information that might enable a person who has given evidence before the examiner to be identified; or

(d) the fact that any person has given or may be about to give evidence at an examination;

must not be published, or must not be published except in such manner, and to such persons as the examiner specifies. The examiner must give such a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been, or may be, charged with an offence.

(10) Subject to subsection (11), the CEO may, in writing vary or revoke a direction under subsection (9)

(11) The CEO must not vary or revoke a direction if to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence (emphasis added)

71The requirement for an examiner to make a non-publication order under s 25A(9) to avoid prejudice to a person's fair trial clearly would include the circumstances of CB.

72Section 29A provides for the relevant notations relating to disclosure to be placed on the summons:

""(1) The examiner issuing a summons under section 28 or a notice under section 29 must or may as provided in subsection (2) include in it a notation to the effect that disclosure of information about the summons or notice or any official matter connected with it is prohibited except in the circumstances if any specified in the notation.

(2) A notation must not be included in the summons or notice except as follows:

(a) the examiner must include the notation if satisfied that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to prejudice:
(i) the safety or reputation of a person or
(ii) the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence, or
(iii) the effectiveness of an operation or investigation.

(b) the examiner may include the notation if satisfied that failure to do so might prejudice:
(i) the safety or reputation of a person or
(ii) the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence, or
(iii) the effectiveness of an operation or investigation.

(c) the examiner may include the notation if satisfied that failure to do so might otherwise be contrary to the public interest.""

73Section 30 provides that a person appearing as a witness must answer questions but provides protection with respect to their use:

""Failure to attend

(1) A person served, as prescribed, with a summons to appear as a witness at an examination before an examiner shall not:
(a) fail to attend as required by the summons; or
(b) fail to attend from day to day unless excused, or released from further attendance, by the examiner.

Failure to answer questions etc.

(2) A person appearing as a witness at an examination before an examiner shall not:
(a) when required pursuant to section 28 either to take an oath or make an affirmation-refuse or fail to comply with the requirement;
(b) refuse or fail to answer a question that he or she is required to answer by the examiner; or
(c) refuse or fail to produce a document or thing that he or she was required to produce by a summons under this Act served on him or her as prescribed.

(3) Where:
(a) a legal practitioner is required to answer a question or produce a document at an examination before an examiner; and
(b) the answer to the question would disclose, or the document contains, a privileged communication made by or to the legal practitioner in his or her capacity as a legal practitioner;

the legal practitioner is entitled to refuse to comply with the requirement unless the person to whom or by whom the communication was made agrees to the legal practitioner complying with the requirement but, where the legal practitioner refuses to comply with the requirement, he or she shall, if so required by the examiner, give the examiner the name and address of the person to whom or by whom the communication was made.

Use immunity available in some cases if selfincrimination claimed

(4) Subsection (5) limits the use that can be made of any answers given at an examination before an examiner, or documents or things produced at an examination before an examiner. That subsection only applies if:
(a) a person appearing as a witness at an examination before an examiner:
(i) answers a question that he or she is required to answer by the examiner; or
(ii) produces a document or thing that he or she was required to produce by a summons under this Act served on him or her as prescribed; and
(b) in the case of the production of a document that is, or forms part of, a record of an existing or past business-the document sets out details of earnings received by the person in respect of his or her employment and does not set out any other information; and
(c) before answering the question or producing the document or thing, the person claims that the answer, or the production of the document or thing, might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty.

(5) The answer, or the document or thing, is not admissible in evidence against the person in:
(a) a criminal proceeding; or
(b) a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty;
other than:
(c) confiscation proceedings; or
(d) a proceeding in respect of:
(i) in the case of an answer-the falsity of the answer; or
(ii) in the case of the production of a document-the falsity of any statement contained in the document.

Offence for contravention of subsection (1), (2) or (3)

(6) A person who contravenes subsection (1), (2) or (3) is guilty of an indictable offence that, subject to this section, is punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding 200 penalty units or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 5 years.

(7) Notwithstanding that an offence against subsection (1), (2) or (3) is an indictable offence, a court of summary jurisdiction may hear and determine proceedings in respect of such an offence if the court is satisfied that it is proper to do so and the defendant and the prosecutor consent.

(8) Where, in accordance with subsection (7), a court of summary jurisdiction convicts a person of an offence against subsection (1), (2) or (3), the penalty that the court may impose is a fine not exceeding 20 penalty units or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 1 year.

Legal professional privilege

(9) Subsection (3) does not affect the law relating to legal professional privilege.""

Section 30 abrogates the common law privilege against self-incrimination but provides use immunity. The consequence is that an examinee must answer incriminating questions that are asked during an ACC examination, whether or not the examinee faces criminal charges. In A v Boulton [2004] FCA 56; (2004) 204 ALR 598, Weinberg J agreed with the decision of Carr J in Mansfield v Australian Crime Commission [2003] FCA 1059; (2003) 132 FCR 251 that, when s 30(2) (b), (4) and (5) of the ACC Act are read in combination, the effect is that the privilege against self incrimination is abrogated by necessary implication. This approach was followed in Hak Song Ra v Australian Crime Commission [2004] FCA 416; (2004) 138 FCR 51, Loprete v Australian Crime Commission [2004] FCA 1476, X v Australian Crime Commission [2004] FCA 1475; (2004) 139 FCR 413 and CC v Australian Crime Commission [2005] FCA 754. In Stoddart v Boulton & Anor [2010] FCAFC 89 at [140] Logan J considered that the outcome in Boulton was ""an unremarkable conclusion"".

Relevant authorities

74The starting point for a discussion of the applicable law is the decision of the High Court in Hammond v The Commonwealth [1982] HCA 42; 152 CLR 188. Hammond had been charged with conspiracy in breach of a Commonwealth law arising from his involvement in the meat export industry. After he was charged he was called to give evidence before a Royal Commission which was inquiring into whether malpractices had occurred in the handling of meat. It was clear that the questions he was to be asked at the Commission related to the alleged conspiracy upon which he had been committed for trial. The Royal Commission hearings were to occur in camera.

75Hammond successfully moved in the High Court for an injunction to restrain the Commission from examining him. His primary submission was to the effect that there was ""a real risk, as opposed to a remote possibility, that justice would be interfered with.""

76In his reasons for judgment Gibbs CJ emphasised that the application had of necessity been dealt with urgently, a matter which was later commented on by Dawson J in Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21; 166 CLR 486 at 508. The Chief Justice accepted that the hearing would take place in private and the answers which Hammond gave could not be used at his trial. However, the record of the argument indicates that although the proceedings were to be held in private the Royal Commission had decided to permit the transcript to be made available to the Crown. Derivative use of Hammond's evidence was accordingly a possibility if not a reality.

77In the circumstances the Chief Justice concluded that ""the fact that the plaintiff has been examined, in detail, as to the circumstances of the alleged offence, is very likely to prejudice him in his defence"" (at 196). This finding was critical to the court's reasoning.

78In his reasons for judgment Brennan J emphasised that ""it is a principle deep-rooted in our law and history that the Crown may not subject an accused person to compulsory process to obtain his answers upon the issue of his guilt or innocence of an offence with which he has been charged.""

79Deane J said (at p 206):

""It is fundamental to the administration of criminal justice that a person who is the subject of pending criminal proceedings in a court of law should not be subjected to having his part in the matters involved in those criminal proceedings made the subject of a parallel inquisitorial inquiry by an administrative tribunal with powers to compel the giving of evidence and the production of documents which largely correspond (and, to some extent, exceed) the powers of the criminal court. Such an extracurial inquisitorial investigation of the involvement of a person who has been committed for trial in the matters which form the basis of the criminal proceedings against him constitutes, in my view, an improper interference with the due administration of justice in the proceedings against him in the criminal court and contempt of court. Where a court is exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth pursuant to s 71 of the Constitution, such interference involves a derogation of the constitutional guarantees that flow from the vesting of the judicial power of the Commonwealth in courts of law. ""

80When considering the relevance of the decision for present purposes it is important to firstly appreciate that Hammond was concerned with questioning of a person using the powers of a Royal Commission. Subsequent cases have considered similar issues but in the context of a particular statute authorising a particular inquiry. Secondly, and for present purposes of greater significance Hammond concerned an application to restrain the process of the inquiry. It was not concerned with and did not consider whether the prospective trial of Hammond could, or if the Commission had proceeded, would be stayed.

81Similar issues were considered in Hamilton v Oades & Anor which was concerned with the examination of a company director under s 541(3) of the Companies (New South Wales) Code. That section empowered the Supreme Court to order that a director of a company be examined in matters relating to the affairs of the company. Subsection (12) provided that a person may not refuse to answer a question on the ground that the answer might tend to incriminate him but, provided objection was taken the answer was not admissible against the person in criminal proceedings.

82The High court reversed the decision of the NSW Court of Appeal and held that the provision of the Companies Code, which provided for the court to give directions with respect to the examination, did not empower the court to relieve a person from an obligation to answer questions on the ground that they may incriminate him. However, questions which required the company director to disclose his or her defence to a charge could be rejected.

83Mason CJ said at 498:

""The court retains its power to give directions and to restrain questions in cases where the examination is being conducted for an improper purpose or constitutes an abuse of process: s.541(5). Thus if a liquidator were to conduct an examination directed to compel the examinee to disclose defences or to give pre-trial discovery, or to establish guilt, this examination may be restrained as an abuse of process: Hugh J. Roberts, at p 541; Huston v. Costigan (1982) 45 ALR 559, at p 563; Re Gordon. But this is not the present case. ""

84With respect to the ""right to silence"" and the ""right"" not to disclose a defence Mason CJ said:

""There are two other matters to be mentioned. The Court of Appeal referred to the respondent's right not to disclose his defences to the pending charges. Except in the sense that a witness enjoys what is known as the right to silence, the respondent has no relevant right, either at common law or by virtue of statute. The privilege against self- incrimination would not ordinarily protect a person against disclosure of his defence to a criminal charge. The so-called right not to disclose a defence is the result merely of the absence in ordinary circumstances of any statutory requirement that defences be revealed. In some instances there is such a specific requirement, for example, in relation to alibi defences. And there is implicit in the general words of s.541 such a general requirement. The possibility of disclosure of a defence is, accordingly, not a matter in respect of which a witness needs to be protected, except perhaps in the most exceptional circumstances.""

85The reasons for judgment of Toohey J are also instructive in the present context. I have included below his Honour's discussion of the issue in which he draws upon the judgment of Barwick CJ in Mortimer v Brown [1970] HCA 4; 112 CLR 493: 

""A useful starting point in the consideration of the relevant law, given the existence of s.541(12), is the decision of this Court in Mortimer v. Brown. As already noted, the decision concerned a public examination under s.250 of The Companies Acts, 1961 to 1964 (Q.). Section 250(3) empowered the Court to ""put or allow to be put such questions to the person examined as the Court thinks fit"". There was no provision comparable to s.541(12) of the Code. In the view of this Court, an examinee could not decline to answer a question on the ground that the answer might tend to incriminate him. 


The main judgment was given by Walsh J., with whom Barwick C.J., Windeyer and Owen JJ. agreed. But a passage from the judgment of Barwick C.J., at p 495, is particularly apposite here:

'As appears from the reasons of my brothers the language of the statute makes the answering of every question imperative. The Parliament has made it abundantly clear that the so-called right to be silent which the common law sought to protect was not to be available to the examinee: and, as both my brother Kitto and my brother Walsh observe, the very purpose of the inquiry makes such a course inevitable if that purpose is not frustrated and the inquiry rendered nugatory. The common law cannot maintain a right in the citizen to refuse to make incriminating answers in the face of a statute which by its expression clearly intends, as does the present, that all questions allowed to be put shall be answered.

...

In my opinion, it being the question and not the answer with which (the judge) is primarily concerned, the mere circumstances that a question appropriate to the nature and the stage of the particular inquiry might or certainly would incriminate the examinee could rarely, if ever, be itself a reason for disallowance of the question. But, of course, the question may be so peripheral, or seek merely confirmation of facts of which proof is already firmly in the hands of the liquidator or that some other circumstance exists that it would be oppressive or unjust to place the examinee in the position of being bound by his answer to incriminate himself, or even placed in jeopardy of doing so.""

I respectfully agree with those observations. A protection against self-incrimination in the terms enunciated by the Court of Appeal gives no effective operation to s.541(12). And that is so notwithstanding the qualification expressed in the words ""concern those facts which constitute the ingredients of the offences ..."". The areas of inquiry specified by the appellant liquidator may well concern those very facts. The power vested in the Court by s.541(5) to give directions as to the matters to be inquired into may be used to ensure that the matters to be inquired into are relevant to the object of the examination. And, as Barwick C.J. pointed out in Mortimer v. Brown, a question may be so peripheral that it would be oppressive or unjust to require an answer. It is not hard to think of other examples of oppression or injustice. Clearly, a question designed to elicit a direct admission of guilt would fall into this category. See also Huston v. Costigan (1982) 45 ALR 559, at p 563. But it is not enough that the answer to a question may tend to incriminate the person examined. It is precisely this sort of answer that s.541(12) allows so that the affairs of the company may be relevantly investigated.""

86Similar issues were considered by the High Court in Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers Federation [1982] HCA 31; 152 CLR 25. By majority (Murphy J dissented) the court held that in the absence of a contrary law the Crown may appoint a Commission of Inquiry into whether an individual has committed an offence. However, if not authorised by a particular statute an inquiry which involves a tendency to interfere with the administration of justice may be in contempt of court ( p 54).

87The issue was again considered in Sorby v The Commonwealth [1983] HCA 10; 152 CLR 281 in which the High Court distinguished the decision in Hammond. Gibbs CJ said at (at 298):

""Similarly, it is no necessary impairment of federal judicial power that a person who may subsequently come to be tried has been compulsorily interrogated before the trial. Hammond v. The Commonwealth [1982] HCA 42; (1983) 152 CLR 188 is distinguishable. That was a case in which the plaintiff, who was called to give evidence before a Royal Commission, was awaiting trial for a criminal offence, and there was a real possibility that if he was required to answer incriminating questions the administration of justice would be interfered with. Under s. 6A, as now in force, a person who is the subject of a pending charge before a court is not denied the privilege of refusing to answer before a Commission questions that might incriminate him of the crime with which he is charged, and neither plaintiff in the present case has been charged. In Kempley v. The King (1944) ALR, at p 252 Latham C.J. said that there was no substance in the argument that it was beyond the legislative power of the Commonwealth to alter the common law as to incriminating questions. I am in agreement with that statement. There is in my opinion no doubt that s. 6A was validly enacted. (at p299) 

88Accordingly, the position is generally that an executive inquiry with compulsory powers will not constitute an interference with the administration of justice and be liable to be restrained as a contempt of court where no charges have yet been laid. Clough v Leahy (1904) 2 CLR 139 at 161. The Parliament may authorise an inquiry which requires a person to answer questions relating to an offence and even disclose elements of their defence to a charge.

89However, an executive inquiry with powers of compulsion directed towards the establishment of guilt of an accused who has been charged with the relevant offence raises different considerations. In McGuinness v AG of Victoria [1940] HCA 6; 63 CLR 73 it was determined that such an inquiry has a tendency to interfere with the administration of justice because its purpose is to make the finding which the court is charged with making (see also Victoria v BLF at 54).

90In the present case the examination took place after charges had been laid. However, there was no evidence and no finding by the trial judge to the effect that the ACC's examination was directed towards establishing the guilt of CB. Her Honour's findings were that a central purpose of the examination was to gather information into the subject of the criminal proceedings which her Honour said was ""presumably for the purpose of furthering the prosecution."" But there was no suggestion that the ACC would proceed to make findings with respect to matters concering CB's prospective guilt.

91The most recent consideration of the issue and in the context of the ACC is the decision of the Full Federal Court in Australian Crime Commission v OK (above). Again it is important to be mindful of the fact that the court was considering an application to restrain the conduct of the ACC not the stay of a criminal prosecution. The majority Emmett and Jacobson JJ concluded that the Act permits an examination to continue on a subject matter directly relating to a pending criminal charge so long as the protective prohibitions contemplated by s 25A(3) and (9) have been put in place. Their Honours said:

""[105] To succeed in obtaining an injunction on the ground that further examination of a person charged with an offence would constitute contempt of court, it is necessary to establish that there is a 'real risk', as opposed to 'a remote possibility', that justice would be interfered with, if examination of the person continued with questions about the alleged offence. That is to say, before the Court should intervene, the tendency of the proposed examination to interfere with the course of justice must be a 'practical reality': a theoretical tendency' is not enough (see Hammond's Case 152 CLR at 196).

[106] In Hammond's Case the High Court considered that, once it was accepted that Mr Hammond would be bound to answer questions designed to establish that he was guilty of the offence with which he was charged, there was a real risk that the administration of justice would be interfered with. While the examination would take place in private, and the answers may not be used in the criminal trial, the High Court considered that the fact that Mr Hammond had been examined, in detail, as to the circumstances of the alleged offence, was likely to prejudice him in his defence. The High Court considered that, if during the course of an inquiry into allegations that a person had been guilty of criminal conduct, a criminal prosecution were commenced against that person based on those allegations, the continuance of the inquiry would, generally speaking, amount to a contempt of court. In those circumstances, the proper course would be to adjourn the inquiry until the disposal of the criminal proceedings (see Hammond's Case at 198-199). 

[107] A significant difference between the circumstances of Hammond's Case and the circumstances of the present case is the regime that is now provided for in s 25A of the Commission Act. Under the Commission Act generally, and s 25A in particular, the risk of prejudice to a fair trial is to be managed by confining the persons to whom answers given by a witness can be disclosed, not by confining the questions that might be put to the witness. The Commission Act provides its own statutory safeguards to avoid risk to the fair trial of such a charge. On its true construction, the Commission Act permits an examination to continue on a subject matter directly related to a pending charge so long as the protective prohibitions contemplated by s 25A(3) and 25A(9) have been put in place. Such principle as might relevantly be drawn from Hammond's Case is displaced by the express provisions of the Commission Act. 

[108] The duty and power imposed by s 12(1) on the CEO and the Commission must be read as being subject to the protective prohibition in s 25A(9). Further, the authority given to the CEO under s 59(7) to give information is qualified by reference to action contrary to a law of the Commonwealth. Clearly enough, where a direction under s 25A(9) is in force, giving information contrary to that direction would be giving information contrary to a law of the Commonwealth that would otherwise apply. A direction under s 25A(9) would also operate in relation to the other powers and authorisations dealt with in s 59. Thus, s 25A, and provisions such as ss 12 and 59, dealing with the assembling and giving of evidence and the dissemination or furnishing of information, are capable of working harmoniously so as to ensure that investigation into serious organised crime and the dissemination of intelligence gathered by the Commission proceed in a timely manner, without prejudicing the fair trial of an accused person. 

[109] The objects of the Commission Act could be seriously impaired if its investigations had to stop for an indeterminate period because charges had been laid. The public interest requires the investigation of a federally relevant criminal activity to continue. The right to a fair trial will not be compromised merely by the asking of questions of an accused person in circumstances where appropriate confidentiality is ensured. The public interest in the administration of justice, in particular to the right to a fair trial, is preserved by the statutory safeguards referred to in [43] above. In this way the legislation achieves a balance between the public interest in the investigation of federally related criminal activity and the public interest in the right of an accused person to a fair trial. Compromise, if any, would occur by reason of the deployment or dissemination of information obtained in a way that poses a real risk to a fair trial. A non-publication direction made under s 25A of the Commission Act remains operative unless and until it is varied or revoked. Such a direction binds the Board, the Commission and the CEO when disseminating, under s 12 or s 59, any information gathered at an examination conducted subject to such a direction. 

[110] The coercive powers conferred on examiners do not come to an end on the laying of criminal charges. The provisions of s 25A clearly contemplate examinations continuing in the face of pending charges. The provisions confer on an examiner, and on the CEO, powers to ensure that there is no real risk to a fair trial. That is to say, the terms of the provisions expressly contemplate that the examiner must give a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been charged with an offence. Further, the CEO must not vary or revoke a direction once made, if the CEO forms the view that the revocation or variation might prejudice the fair trial of a person who has or may be charged with an offence.

[111] Although s 12 is not qualified in the same way as s 59(7), imposing, as it does, a mandatory obligation on the CEO to assemble and give evidence to persons and agencies, including prosecuting authorities, it is capable of working harmoniously with s 25A. A direction given under s 25A(9) is effective, and overrides the statutory obligation imposed by s 12 or s 59 on the Commission, the CEO or the Board to assemble and give evidence or disseminate and furnish information or reports. In other words, while the CEO, the Board and the Commission are at all times required to perform their respective statutory obligations to assemble and give evidence and to disseminate or furnish information, that requirement must be understood as being subject to the provisions that they do so in a manner that is not inconsistent with a direction under s 25A(9). For example, the CEO, the Commission and the Board would be able to disseminate information gathered at an examination to relevant agencies if they were satisfied, on the basis of appropriate evidence, that appropriate safeguards were in place, to ensure that the investigating and prosecuting teams in the relevant agencies dealing with pending charges could not be given access to that information. The dissemination obligations arising under the Commission Act can be complied with without risk to a fair trial. 

[112] Section 51, dealing with secrecy, does not cut across that analysis. Section 51 imposes an obligation of secrecy quite separate and apart from any obligation arising from a direction given under s 25A(9). In so far as there is an exception to the obligation imposed by s 51, to the extent that a person may, for the purposes of a relevant act, divulge or communicate information, that is merely an exception to the obligation imposed by s 51. It is not an exception to the obligation arising from a direction given under s 25A(9). 

[113] The application of the safeguards of s 25A(9) in the circumstances of the present case means that there is no real risk to the fair trial of the Witness. There is no reason to suspect that the CEO or any member of the Commission or the Board would act contrary to such a direction. There is no practical reality that the course of justice and a fair trial for the Witness would be interfered with by reason only of the witness being required to answer questions, so long as an appropriate direction is in force under s 25A(9). Whether a contempt of a criminal court might occur is a matter for that court. In the light of the analysis set out above, there is no real risk that the continuing questioning of the Witness would constitute a contempt. In those circumstances, the primary judge erred in concluding that there was a real risk that compelling the Witness to answer questions directly relating to the subject matter of the Charge against him under the State Act would result in a prejudice to his fair trial or interfere with the course of justice or constitute a contempt.""

92Similar reasoning to that of Emmett and Jacobson JJ is found in the judgment of Jessup J in ABC v Sage [2009] FCA 170;175 FCR 319 at 331 [29]-[31]:

""I accept the submissions made on behalf of the respondent with respect to this point. The provisions of the ACC Act referred to are manifestly calculated to reduce to the minimum the prospect that evidence given in an examination will find its way into the hands of authorities or persons other than those to whom, in accordance with directions given by an examiner, it is limited. On the facts of the present case, I consider that the directions given by the respondent, and the administrative steps taken by the Commission, are such as would eliminate any real, as distinct from theoretical, risk of an interference with the administration of justice, should the applicant answer the question put to him as required. I am particularly influenced by the direction given under s 25A(9) of the ACC Act. Save to refer to subs (12) of s 25A, counsel for the respondent was unable to suggest any means by which that direction would not, as a practical matter, produce its intended effect, namely, of protecting the fair trial of the applicant from being prejudiced by the leakage of details of the applicant's evidence given in the examination. With respect to subs (12), I accept the respondent's submissions that this court ought not lightly anticipate that the court to which evidence might be available under that subsection would allow that evidence to be further disseminated in a way that might prejudice the fair trial of the applicant. 

The facts of the present case are quite different from those which led to the judgment of the High Court in Hammond v The Commonwealth. In that case, police officers involved in the investigation upon which the forthcoming prosecution was based were permitted to be present during the administrative examination (see 152 CLR at 194). Here, by contrast, not only are those police officers not present (and not permitted to be present), but the respondent has taken the steps contemplated by the ACC Act to make it as certain as may be that those involved in the prosecution of the applicant will not come to learn of the substance of his evidence in the examination. 

I take the view, therefore, that the continuation of the examination of the applicant by the respondent, including the respondent's requirement that the applicant answer the question to which he objected, would not present a real risk of an interference with the administration of justice and would not, therefore, be in contempt of court. That conclusion makes it unnecessary for me to consider the respondent's related points, namely, whether, as a matter of balance, the public interest in the continuation of the Commission's work in the special investigation outweighs the public interest in avoiding risks of interference with the administration of justice, and whether, as a matter of construction, the provisions of the ACC Act to which I have referred evince a legislative intention to tolerate the existence of risks to the administration of justice, either absolutely or in circumstances where directions have been given.""

93Spender J dissented in OK. His Honour said:

""[9] In my judgment, the High Court held (a reference to Hammond) that it was the questioning and the compulsion to answer about the charge that was very likely to prejudice him in his defence (per Gibbs CJ), and would constitute an interference with the due administration of criminal justice (per Deane J), and that the continuance of the inquiry would amount to a contempt of court. A parallel inquisitorial enquiry by the executive, when the person summoned is compelled to be sworn as a witness, and is subject to questioning about a pending criminal charge, constitutes in itself injustice and prejudice to the person summoned who has been charged with that criminal offence. An accused person is entitled to reserve his or her defence until that person is on trial.""

94And later:

""[12] In my opinion, the appeal from the judgment and orders of Justice Mansfield should be dismissed. I agree with the reasons that Mansfield J gave for his conclusions, except that, in my respectful opinion, it is irrelevant whether, notwithstanding confidentiality directions, there would still be a risk of disclosure to the investigation and/or prosecution authorities of the questions asked and the answers given by the summoned person. Mansfield J seems to suggest that there was such a risk, whereas the majority conclude that there was no such risk of disclosure to those authorities.""

95The primary judge in the present case was of the view that the approach of the majority in OK failed to give adequate recognition to three matters:

""(a) first, the respondent's ""right to silence"" and his ""right to reserve one's defence until trial"" which was undermined by the examination;

(b) second, that the examination subverted the adversarial nature of a criminal trial, with its obligations of proof on the prosecution and the rights and privileges it accords to the accused; and,

(c) third, a concern on the part of the accused and the informed public that information may have been disseminated ""undermining confidence in the impartiality of the criminal justice process"" and the ""prosecuting authorities"" (at [84]).""

96It is important to appreciate as the ACC submitted that the so called ""right to silence"" expresses not a single right, but is a shorthand description of an amalgam of immunities the most prominent of which, for present purposes, are the immunity of an accused from being required to answer questions or provide information which is incriminating, from being compelled to give evidence at their own trial and (to some extent) from having adverse comment made on his or her failure to give evidence or provide information.

97In some respects, the ACC Act abrogates a number of immunities associated with the shorthand description of ""right to silence."" It obliges persons summonsed to appear at an examination to answer questions (see section 30(2)) and abrogates the privilege against self-incrimination (section 30(4)). However, by reason of the retention of ""use immunity"" in section 30(5) of the ACC Act in relation to answers given at an inquiry over an objection based on self-incrimination and the confidentiality provisions in sections 25A(9) and 29A of the ACC Act designed to protect the fairness of trials of persons who have been or may be charged with an offence, it is clear that the ACC Act operates to protect the fairness and integrity of extant trials by preserving them from the effect of its qualification of the ""right to silence"".

98In NSW Food Authority v Nutricia Australia Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCCA 252; 72 NSWLR 456 (""Nutricia"") Spigelman CJ identified the ""accusatory system"" (which is synonymous with what the trial judge referred to as the ""adversarial nature"" of criminal trials) as a ""fundamental element of the traditional method of determining criminal guilt"" (at 490, [155]). In Environment Protection Authority v Caltex Refining Co Pty Limited [1993] HCA 74;178 CLR 447 (EPA v Caltex) at 503 Mason CJ and Toohey J identified two aspects of the ""accusatory system"" of criminal justice: first, that the onus of proof beyond a reasonable doubt rests on the Crown and, secondly, that ""an accused person cannot be required to testify to the commission of an offence charged.""

99In Nutricia Spigelman CJ concluded that a power of a prosecutor to require an accused the subject of extant charges to answer questions to ""provide information for the purposes of those charges"" was an abrogation of the accusatory system (at 491, [159], emphasis added). In contrast, in EPA v Caltex Mason CJ and Toohey J considered that a statutory power to require an accused to produce documents did not compromise the accusatory system. Similarly, in Nutricia Spigelman CJ concluded that an exercise of a statutory power which required an accused the subject of extant charges to provide information which could be derivatively (but not directly) used against the accused did not necessarily impinge the accusatory system (at 492, [164] - 493, [172]).

100With respect to the ACC Act where an accused the subject of an extant charge is summonsed to appear at an examination under s 28 of the ACC Act but is protected against direct use of any answers given over an objection based on the privilege against self-incrimination by reason of section 30(4) and protected from derivative use by reason of confidentiality directions given pursuant to section 25A(9) and section 29 of the ACC Act, there is no possible compromise of the accusatory system of criminal justice. The onus of proof still lies on the prosecution. The accused cannot be made to testify in or in connection with the trial to the commission of the offence charged. The accused's rights and privileges at the trial are preserved.

101To my mind the primary judge's statement (at [84(1)]) that ""[a]n accused person should not be tried twice; first by secret coercive examination and then in open court where the accused enjoys rights and protections"" cannot be accepted. An executive inquiry or investigation which does not and cannot lead to any findings of guilt, any conviction or any punishment is not, in any sense of the term, subjecting the accused to a ""trial"": Victoria v BLF at 52 - 53, 152 - 153.

102With respect to the issue of public confidence the trial judge found that the evidence provides no basis to conclude that statutory directions protecting the confidentiality of the contents of an examination conducted under the ACC Act and preventing its disclosure to prosecuting authorities have not been observed. An apprehension of impartiality on the part of prosecutors can provide a basis to exclude those prosecutors from participation in a trial: R v MG [2007] NSWCCA 57; 69 NSWLR 20 at 41, [65] - 48, [100]. However, I am not aware of any authority to support the proposition that such a concern would support a conclusion that a contempt of court had occurred, or that a permanent stay of the proposed trial was appropriate.

103The primary judge concluded that ""reposing the product of a collateral executive examination of an accused person upon matters of which he or she is accused in the discretion of a prosecuting or investigating officer fatally weakens the operation of criminal courts in accordance with the rule of law"" (at [84(2)]). I do not share her Honour's view. The purpose of the confidentiality obligations in s 25A(9) and s 25A of the ACC Act is to prevent the information obtained during the examination from being used by prosecuting or investigating authorities in the trial of a person who has or may be charged with an offence. Furthermore, where a failure to make such an order might prejudice the fair trial of such a person, there is no discretion as to whether such confidentiality obligations are to be imposed. Section 25A(9)(c) imposes that obligation. 

104The ACC submitted that in this respect her Honour's approach to the concept of the rule of law was misplaced. With respect to her Honour this submission should be accepted. As Dawson J pointed out in Hamilton v Oades (at 509) concepts such as the due process of law or the rule of law derive their ""meaning only from the law, whether common law or statute law, as it exists, from time to time"". The ACC Act forms part of the ""rule of law"" as much as any other element of the common law or statute law.

105At [102] of OK Emmett and Jacobson JJ referred to the principle expressed by the High Court in Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; 194 CLR 355 at [69]-[71] concerning the need to construe a statute harmoniously; where conflict appears, adjusting the meaning of the competing provisions to best give effect to the purpose and language of the provisions, while maintaining the unity of the statute as a whole and, where necessary, identifying the leading provisions and subordinate provisions in the statute.

106Applying these principles to the interaction of the confidentiality provisions in sections 25A(9) and 29A of the ACC Act and the obligations and powers of disclosure of the CEO and the Board of the ACC in sections 12(1) and 59(7) of the ACC Act, Emmett and Jacobson JJ in Australian Crime Commission v OK at 277, [108] - 278, [111] reasoned as provided in their judgment at [108], [109] and [111] which I have included above.

107The primary judge expressed doubt as to this reasoning (at [78]) and concluded that it ""may well be wrong"" (at [82]) The primary judge did not develop her reasons for that conclusion. In this regard, the primary judge appeared to prefer the reasoning of the primary judge, Mansfield J in OK v Australian Crime Commission (at [69]).

108I do not share the primary judge's doubts. The reasoning of Emmett and Jacobson JJ in Australian Crime Commission v OK is an appropriate application of the direction in Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority to construe statutory provisions harmoniously, giving prominence to the leading provision and subservience to the subordinate provision while maintaining the unity of the statutory scheme as a whole. Neither the primary judge nor Mansfield J in OK v Australian Crime Commission attempted the task mandated by Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority.

109The identification of sections 25A(9) or 29A(2) (and a direction made pursuant to it) as the leading provision to which the duties and rights of disclosure in sections 12(1) and 59(7) of the ACC Act are subservient is indicated by:

(a) first, the fact that section 25A(9) of the ACC Act is a special provision and sections 12(1) and 59(7) are general provisions;

(b) second, the fact that sections 25A(9) or 29A(2) of the ACC Act are concerned to protect a fundamental common law right, being the right to a fair trial of a criminal charge: Nutricia at 486, [129] - 487, [136];

(c) third, the fact that the CEO of the ACC has a specific power in section 25(10) to vary or revoke a direction made under sub-section (9), but which power is ousted when to vary or revoke the direction would prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence.

110Accordingly, in my opinion the conclusion of Emmett and Jacobson JJ in Australian Crime Commission v OK to the effect that a confidentiality direction made sections 25A(9) and 29A of the ACC Act overrode the obligations and powers of disclosure of the CEO and the Board of the ACC in section 12(1) and 59(7) of the ACC Act is correct. In the result, those directions having been made in relation to the examination of CB, he was effectively immunised from any direct or derivative use of the contents of his examination in his pending criminal trial.

111Provided the knowledge of the proceedings in the Commission are adequately protected an accused person's entitlement to a fair trial in accordance with the adversarial process will be ensured. The situation is no different whether at the time of the Commission hearing a charge has not been laid or the criminal process has commenced. The right to a fair trial will only be compromised if information relevant to a person's defence in any form, including any derivative information, is available to the prosecution.

112The primary judge determined that she was not bound by the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court having formed the view that it was plainly wrong. In so doing her Honour referred to the decision of the High Court in Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; 230 CLR 89. Her Honour provides no specific reference to any statement in that decision to support this position. Her Honour also referred to, but provided no analysis of, a speech by Rares J, ""The Role of the Intermediate appellate Court after Farah Constructions.""

113Farah Constructions concerned the authoritative reach of decisions of intermediate appellate courts as between those courts. Her Honour was not sitting as a member of such a court but was sitting as a trial judge in the NSW District Court exercising Federal jurisdiction. It seems to me that there would be profound difficulties in the proper functioning of the Australian judicial system if a District Court judge exercising Federal jurisdiction was free to decide that a decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court on the same issue is wrong, much less plainly wrong.

114Of course, a judge of the District Court is bound by a decision of a single judge of the Supreme Court or a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal or Court of Appeal on a point of law, given that the ""administration of justice within the hierarchy of courts is an ordered discipline"": Fleming v White [1981] 2 NSWLR 719 at 725-726.

115However, the present position on that issue appears to be that in the joint judgment of the High Court in Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd [1993] HCA 15; 177 CLR 485 when Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said:

""uniformity of decision in the interpretation of uniform national legislation ... is a sufficiently important consideration to require that an intermediate appellate court - and all the more so a single judge - should not depart from an interpretation placed on such legislation by another Australian intermediate appellate court unless convinced that the interpretation is plainly wrong."" (p 492)

See also Farah Constructions Pty Limited v Say-Dee Pty Limited at 151-152 [135].

116Although the decision in Farah Constructions has generated some controversy the approach taken by the High Court to the task of an intermediate appellate court closely follows the approach which intermediate appellate courts must take to their own decisions. Similarly a trial judge may depart from the decision of another trial judge of the same court if satisfied that the decision is plainly wrong but must follow a decision of the intermediate appellate court to which its decision may be appealed. If as the High Court says there is a common law of Australia it would seem logical and to my mind irresistible that a trial judge of any court determining an issue under a statute of the Commonwealth should be bound to follow a decision of an intermediate appellate, state or Federal which has considered the same issue.

117However, the resolution of this case does not depend upon whether her Honour was bound by OK. To my mind a finding that the decision of the majority in OK was plainly wrong was not open. I believe it was correct. The primary judge's reliance on Hammond does not sufficiently recognise the significance of the protections provided by the ACC Act which were not available to Hammond and which are central to the reasoning of the majority in OK.

The question of a stay

118As I have previously indicated it is important to appreciate that the debate in the previous decisions where the relationship between a criminal prosecution and an administrative inquiry have been considered, including in OK, was whether the court should restrain the relevant inquiry. The cases have not been concerned with the issue determined by the trial judge and agitated in this Court as to whether the trial of an accused person who has been examined should be permanently stayed. To determine that question it is necessary to consider the principles most recently discussed by the High Court in Jago v The District Court of NSW [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23 and see also The Queen v Edwards [2009] HCA 20; 255 ALR 399; Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20; 267 ALR 1 (Buddin J provided a comprehensive discussion of the principles in R v Smith (No 1) [2011] NSWSC 725). They do not seem to have been raised with her Honour.

119The principles which a court must apply when considering an application for a permanent stay of a criminal trial derive from the ""inherent power of courts to prevent abuses of their process"" (Mason CJ, Jago at 25). Any process which will result in an unfair trial may be a relevant abuse. However ""to justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings, there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial"" of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences"" (Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48; 147 CLR 75 at 111).

120The members of the court in Jago emphasised, in the words of Gaudron J, ""the limited scope of the power to grant a permanent stay"" (which) ""necessarily directs an inquiry whether there are other means by which the defect attending the proceedings can be eliminated or remedied. The purpose of the power ""directs attention to the legal propriety of the process or proceedings as distinct from any broad consideration of the general merits of the case."" (p 77) Gaudron J recognised that the decision as to whether or not to grant a permanent stay must be made recognising that a trial judge has a duty to ensure a fair trial and to that end ""has a number of discretionary powers which may be exercised in the course of a trial"" ""the existence and availability of those powers, when considered in light of the necessarily limited scope of the power to grant a permanent stay, serve to indicate that a court should have regard to the existence of all various powers and should only grant a permanent stay if satisfied that no other means is available to remedy that feature which, if unremedied, would render the proceedings so seriously defective, whether by reason of unfairness, injustice or otherwise, as to demand the grant of a permanent stay"" (p 77-78).

121The primary judge emphasised, with reference to Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77; 177 CLR 378 ""that the power to grant a stay is not confined to cases where it has been demonstrated that any trial will necessarily be unfair."" In Walton Mason CJ Deane and Dawson JJ with reference to Jago at pp519-520 said that ""whether criminal proceedings should be permanently stayed on abuse of process grounds falls to be determined by a weighing process involving a subjective balancing of a variety of factors and considerations. Among those factors and considerations are the requirements of fairness to the accused, the legitimate public interest in the disposition of charges of serious offences and in conviction of those guilty of crime, and the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice"" (p 395-396).

122The primary judge recognised that there was no Australian precedent for the grant of a stay where the ""integrity of the criminal justice process"" has been undermined but there is no evidence of specific disadvantage to the accused."" However, her Honour referred to two English cases R v Latif [1996] 1 WLR 104 and R v Grant [2005] 3 WLR 437 which she believed to be of significance.

123In Latif Lord Steyn, who delivered a speech agreed in by the other members of the House of Lords, recognised that apart from the circumstance where a fair trial was not possible a court could stay proceedings where ""there has been an abuse of process, which amounts to an affront to the public conscience and requires the criminal proceedings to be stayed"" (p 112).

124Grant involved a prosecution when the police had intercepted communications between an accused and his solicitor which were the subject of legal professional privilege.

125As I have previously indicated the primary judge determined that in the circumstances of the present case there had been ""a serious interference with the administration of justice."" Her Honour recognised that a stay is a discretionary remedy and identified as a matter justifying a stay that ""a central purpose of the examination was to gather information in relation to the charges laid against the accused and his co-conspirators but Mr Ryan, the solicitor for the accused, was assured that the accused would not be questioned about matters directly related to the trial.""

126Beyond recognising ""that there has been a serious interference with the administration of justice"" reflected in the examination of the appellant ""to gather information in relation to the charges"" the primary judge did not approach the matter as the High Court in Jago would seem to me to require. The evidence, or rather the lack of it, did not enable her Honour to conclude that any questions had been asked or answered which required CB to disclose aspects of his defence to the charge. Her Honour did not identify whether there was any difficulty in the appellant receiving a fair trial and if there was, whether it could be remedied by orders made by the court either before or during the trial. An argument that prejudice could be assumed when it was not otherwise demonstrated by the evidence was rejected by the High Court in Jago (at 33; 72).

127I have related the evidence of the witnesses as to the course of the examination. However, as I have indicated a transcript of the proceedings was not tendered to the primary judge, who in any event did not seem to be much interested in receiving it. Despite the issue being raised by the court during argument, the transcript was not tendered to this Court.

128Although I accept that questions were asked of the appellant during his examination relating to matters relevant to the charges, accepting as I do that the majority decision in OK should be followed, provided the information obtained was effectively protected as the Commission acknowledged it should be, the mere fact that an examination has occurred could not justify a permanent stay. Even if, and the evidence does not establish this fact, it was the case that questions were asked which required the appellant to disclose his defence, this would not of itself have the consequence that the appellant would be denied ""a fair trial."" Only if it can be shown that either the relevant information has been, or there was a real risk that it would be communicated to the prosecution, could it be concluded that the exceptional step of granting a permanent stay should be taken.

129That of course raises the issue of Mr Hussain who was present during the examination and took notes. He gave evidence that he has secured his notes and has not communicated their content to any other person. There is nothing to contradict his evidence and he was not challenged in relation to it. He could of course breach his obligation to maintain the secrecy of the examination room but there is nothing to suggest he has done so or would do so in the future.

130Mr Hussain has had an involvement in the surveillance of other possible co-offenders and has for that reason been included on a prospective witness list for the trial. As I understand the position his evidence would be confined to ""formal"" matters proving the record of the surveillance. The concern expressed by the appellant is that his involvement in the prosecution, even to this limited extent, raises the possibility that he may knowingly, although more likely, unwittingly provide the prosecution with the benefit of knowledge he has gained during the examination.

131It seems to me there are at least two answers to this submission. Firstly, Mr Hussain is not an investigator who is involved in the prosecution of the charges. His role is peripheral and there would appear to be no professional reason for him to breach his obligation to maintain the secrecy of the inquiry. Secondly, and perhaps of greater significance, without a transcript of the examination I could not conclude that anything was forthcoming during the examination which would be of assistance to the prosecution in any event. I accept that questions were asked about the circumstances of the alleged offences. However, it is reasonable to presume without contrary evidence that a great deal is presently known by the prosecutors. Without the transcript a judgment that because of questions that were asked or more particularly the answers that were given during the examination a conclusion that the appellant could not receive a fair trial is not possible.

132I should indicate that I have not overlooked the role of Ms Austin in assisting the ACC and the primary judge's findings and criticism of her conduct. Having regard to the evidence to which I have earlier referred there are some uncertainties with respect to the content of the exchanges which occurred between Ms Austin and Mr Ryan. 

133The propriety of the conduct of an officer of the ACC is an important matter. Her Honour found, in effect, that an undertaking given on behalf of the ACC was breached. Even accepting her Honour's findings the evidence does not justify a permanent stay of the prosecution of either of the accused. Without more and, in particular evidence, that the administration of justice would be interfered with denying either accused a fair trial, there can be no justification in staying the prosecution.

134It follows that the appeal by the Crown must succeed.

135With respect to MP, he of course was not examined before the ACC. Subject to what was described as ""one narrow possible exception"" (CCA, T53, 27 July 2011), Mr Walker SC accepted that MP could not succeed if the Court allowed the DPP's appeal in the case of CB. Mr Walker SC developed a submission by reference to s 17 Evidence Act 1995 concerning compellability and associated defendants. The fact that an associated defendant of MP was examined before the ACC in the circumstances disclosed in this judgment does not demonstrate a proper foundation for the exceptional remedy of a permanent stay of criminal proceedings. In truth, MP's claim for a permanent stay derives from CB's position. For reasons contained in this judgment, the Crown must succeed in CB's case. MP's appeal should be dismissed.

136I would make the following orders:

1. The appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions is upheld. 
2. The order granting a permanent stay to CB is quashed and the matter is remitted to the District Court for trial.
3. The appeal by MP is dismissed.

137BUDDIN J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

138JOHNSON J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

2758372,Sheen v R [2011] NSWCCA 259,"Judgment 

1JOHNSON J : The Appellant, Michael Richard William Sheen, seeks an extension of time to appeal against conviction and sentence following a trial which took place in the Sydney District Court in 2009. 

The Charges, Verdicts and Sentences 

2The Appellant stood trial before Freeman DCJ and a jury between 4 and 12 May 2009. The jury returned the following verdicts: 
 





Charge

Verdict



Count 1 - On 30 July 2008 at Kirrawee, the Appellant did assault David Potts (contrary to s.61 Crimes Act 1900)

Not guilty


Count 2 - On 19 August 2008 at Menai, the Appellant broke and entered the dwelling house of David Potts and committed a serious indictable offence therein, by stealing a certain amount of money and other personal items, the property of David Potts, in circumstances of aggravation, namely being armed with an offensive weapon, a knife (contrary to s.112(2) Crimes Act 1900)

Not guilty, but guilty of break, enter and steal (contrary to s.112(1) Crimes Act 1900)


Count 3 - On 20 August 2008 at Miranda, the Appellant assaulted David Potts (contrary to s.61 Crimes Act 1900)

Not guilty


Count 4 - On 29 August 2008 at Menai, the Appellant broke and entered the dwelling house of David Potts and committed a serious indictable offence therein, by wounding David Potts with intent to do grievous bodily harm in circumstances of special aggravation, namely at the time of the commission of the offence he wounded David Potts (contrary to s.112(3) Crimes Act 1900)

Guilty
 
3For the offence of break, enter and steal found proved as an alternative to Count 2, the Appellant was sentenced on 3 July 2009 to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years to commence on 1 September 2008 and to expire on 31 August 2011, with a balance of term of one year to expire on 31 August 2012. 

4On the fourth count, the Appellant was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of seven years to commence on 1 September 2010 and to expire on 31 August 2017, with a balance of term of three years to expire on 31 August 2020. 

5The total effective sentence comprised a non-parole period of nine years with a balance of term of three years. 

Extension of Time 

6A Notice of Appeal and a Notice of Application for Extension of Time were filed on 4 February 2011, together with an affidavit of the Appellant's solicitor, Philip Edward Green, sworn 2 February 2011. The Crown did not oppose an extension of time. In light of the matters contained in the affidavit of Mr Green, time should be extended to permit the Appellant to proceed with the appeal. 
 
Grounds of Appeal 

7The Appellant relies upon the following grounds of appeal against conviction: 

(a) Ground 1 - the trial miscarried. 

(b) Ground 2 - the trial Judge erred in his directions to the jury in: 

(i) failing to give a ""Murray"" type direction, 

(ii) respect to the drawing of inferences, 

(iii) giving misleading directions to the jury regarding self-defence, 

(iv) failing to summarise the evidence relevant to his directions on self-defence. 

(c) Ground 3 - the trial Judge erred in directing the jury on an alternative count. 

(d) Ground 4 - the verdicts were inconsistent and the verdicts of conviction were unreasonable. 

8The Appellant seeks leave to appeal with respect to sentence upon the following grounds: 

(a) Ground 1 - the total sentence and individual sentences were unduly harsh and severe. 

(b) Ground 2 - the sentencing Judge erred by taking into account as an aggravating factor the prior criminal record of the Appellant. 

(c) Ground 3 - the sentencing Judge erred in sentencing on the basis of possibility. 

(d) Ground 4 - the sentencing Judge erred in sentencing on the basis that it was a mid-range offence. 

(e) Ground 5 - the sentencing Judge erred in failing to take into account the principle of totality. 

A Short Factual Overview 

9At the time of relevant events in July-August 2008, the Appellant was aged 41 years, and the complainant, David Potts, was 48-49 years' old. 

10In summary, the Crown case in relation to the four charges was that Mr Potts was in a relationship with a woman called Anita McCarthy. Ms McCarthy had a friend, Karen Crothers, whom she had known for many years. Ms Crothers' partner was the Appellant. 

11Mr Potts said that he had first met the Appellant about three years earlier when Ms Crothers first took up with him. The two men would see each other socially, but because of the Appellant's erratic behaviour, the relationship started to deteriorate. 

Count 1 

12In relation to Count 1, Mr Potts gave evidence that on 30 July 2008, the Appellant assaulted him by punching him in the face with a closed fist. This occurred as Mr Potts and Ms McCarthy were leaving Ms Crothers ' place. Neither Ms McCarthy nor Ms Crothers saw the assault, but Mr Potts complained about it to Ms McCarthy immediately afterwards. 

13The Appellant (who gave evidence at the trial) admitted that he was present on this occasion, but denied the assault. 

14The Appellant was acquitted on this count. 

Count 2 

15In relation to Count 2, Mr Potts gave evidence that he arrived home from work on 19 August 2008 at about 1.00 pm. He was having a shower when he heard a noise downstairs. He emerged from the shower and looked downstairs, and saw the Appellant in his premises going through his things. Mr Potts said the Appellant was aggressive and said ""I want to borrow some things"" . According to Mr Potts, the Appellant was holding a knife with a greenish handle and a sheath. Mr Potts alleged that the Appellant took some DVDs, a scuba knife, an MP3 player and some cash. Mr Potts alleged that the Appellant had entered through the garage, as the front door was locked. Mr Potts said that the garage door had been tampered with. 

16The Appellant denied this incident completely. 

17The Appellant was acquitted of the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal charged in the second count, but was convicted of break, enter and steal simpliciter. 

Count 3 

18In relation to Count 3, Mr Potts alleged that on 20 August 2008, he was walking through Westfield Miranda Fair, when he saw the Appellant. He said that the Appellant produced the same knife as he had the day before and, with a stabbing motion towards Mr Potts' eyes, the Appellant said: ""You're effing lucky I didn't cut your eye out yesterday"" . Mr Potts said the knife came close to his eye and he felt very shocked and scared. 

19The Appellant denied this incident completely. 

20The Appellant was acquitted on this count. 

Count 4 

21In relation to Count 4, Mr Potts alleged that, on 29 August 2008, he had been at a hotel with his employer and had consumed about eight schooners of full-strength beer. Mr Potts arrived home at about 5.30 pm and about 10 minutes later, he heard a bang on the security door. 

22Mr Potts opened the door and saw the Appellant. The Appellant asked him if he could come inside and Mr Potts said ""No"" . The Appellant asked him to go outside and Mr Potts said he would go and get the key. He said he had no intention of opening the door and he grabbed the telephone to ring the police. Before he had even dialled the number, Mr Potts heard a smash in the garage. 

23Mr Potts said that after the incident on 19 August 2008 (Count 2), and in case the Appellant turned up again, he had braced the garage door by wedging some of his bricklaying tools behind the frame so the door could not be pulled out. After the Appellant had broken in on 19 August 2008, Mr Potts had checked the garage door and saw that it had been tampered with. 

24Within seconds of hearing the smash in the garage, Mr Potts said he was attacked by the Appellant in the stairwell of the house. The Appellant came for him and was hitting him to the face with his fist. Mr Potts said that the Appellant had the same knife he had had with him on two previous occasions. 

25Mr Potts and the Appellant started wrestling and fell down the stairway. The Appellant grabbed a vase off the cabinet and smashed it over Mr Potts' head. The Appellant then used pieces of the broken vase to cut Mr Potts' throat and face. Mr Potts said he was fighting for his life on the ground with the Appellant on top of him. The Appellant was cutting Mr Potts' face and throat, saying ""I'm going to kill, I'm going to kill you"" . 

26While they were rolling on the floor, and while the Appellant was on top of him, Mr Potts said that he was stabbed in his kidney region. The Appellant kept calling him a dog and saying he was going to kill him. 

27While the two men were on the ground, a car was heard pulling up outside. Initially, Mr Potts thought it was Ms McCarthy coming home. However, it turned out to be the next-door neighbour. According to Mr Potts, at the sound of the car outside, the Appellant stopped and said ""Oh fuck, it's Anita well she can clean you up now"" . He took Mr Potts' wallet and his mobile phone and walked out through the garage door, which was open and broken. Mr Potts said he tried to make a call, but the house telephone was broken and he had no energy left, so he just lay on the floor and waited. When Ms McCarthy arrived home, she called the ambulance. The police attended. 

28There was medical evidence concerning the serious and extensive injuries suffered by Mr Potts, including significant injuries to his face, neck and back. 

29The Appellant admitted that he entered Mr Potts' house on 29 August 2008, but denied that he had broken into the premises. He said that Mr Potts attacked him and that he acted in self-defence thereafter. 

30The Appellant was convicted on the fourth count. 
 
Appeal Against Conviction 

31Conviction Ground 1 is a bare assertion that the trial miscarried. This is a conclusion and not a separate ground of appeal. It may be taken as the Appellant's ultimate contention arising from the suggested errors contained in the following conviction grounds. 

32Conviction Grounds 2(i)-(iv) and 3 contend that the trial Judge erred in various respects in his directions to the jury. Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules applies to each of these grounds. It is for the Appellant to demonstrate that the grounds are arguable and that a miscarriage of justice has resulted so that this Court should grant leave under Rule 4 to permit these grounds to go forward: R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536; Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at 319 [72]; R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20; 62 NSWLR 346 at 352-353 [20]-[24]. 

Conviction Ground 2(i) - Failure to Give a ""Murray"" Type Direction 

Submissions of the Parties 

33Mr Ramage QC, for the Appellant, submitted that the trial Judge erred in failing to give the jury a direction in accordance with R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 with respect to the evidence of Mr Potts. Although the trial Judge spent a considerable time summarising counsel's arguments about the evidence of Mr Potts and the Appellant, Mr Ramage QC submitted that at no stage did his Honour give the jury a warning either using the word ""warning"" or counselling caution. 

34It was submitted that such a direction should always be given in cases where there is a single vital witness and a perceptible risk of miscarriage of justice if the jury is not warned of the need to scrutinise the evidence of a complainant with care before arriving at a conclusion of guilt: Robinson v The Queen [1999] HCA 42; 197 CLR 162 at 168-171 [21]-[26]. 

35Whilst acknowledging that leave under Rule 4 is required to rely upon this ground, Mr Ramage QC submitted that a miscarriage of justice had resulted so that leave ought be granted. 

36The Crown submitted that leave under Rule 4 should be refused. It was submitted that as the jury had acquitted the Appellant of Counts 1 and 3 and had returned an alternative verdict of guilty of break, enter and steal with respect to Count 2, it was clear that the jury did consider the evidence of Mr Potts with care, even though a direction in the form suggested by this ground had not been given. The Crown submitted that there was no particular form of words prescribed for giving a ""Murray"" direction, nor is there any obligation to use the word ""scrutinise"" : Kaifoto aka Teaupa v R [2006] NSWCCA 186 at [72]. 

37The Crown submitted that the summing up made clear to the jury the significance of the evidence of Mr Potts with respect to each of the counts and that, in relation to Count 4, there was a considerable amount of evidence in addition to that of Mr Potts, so that a ""Murray"" direction was not required in that respect. 

Decision 

38In approaching this ground, it is necessary to keep in mind the fact that the jury acquitted the Appellant on Counts 1 and 3 and returned an alternative verdict of guilty with respect to the second count. It is immediately apparent that the jury was alive to the need to consider carefully the evidence of Mr Potts with respect to each count. 

39Trial defence counsel did not seek a ""Murray"" direction. In my view, the summing up conveyed sufficiently to the jury the need for care in examining the evidence of Mr Potts, with a particular eye upon the onus and standard of proof which lay upon the Crown. It is clear that the jury understood this aspect of their task. 

40I do not think that anything said in R v Murray or Robinson v The Queen requires that such a direction be given in every case as contended by senior counsel for the Appellant. The decision of this Court in Kaifoto aka Teaupa v R makes clear that no particular form of words is required. The Court will look at the substance of what was conveyed to the jury by the summing up and, in this case, what may be discerned from the various verdicts returned by the jury. 

41The trial Judge gave the jury appropriate directions concerning the process of assessment of the honesty and reliability of witnesses, including Mr Potts, with associated directions concerning the reliance in the main upon the evidence of Mr Potts. 

42With respect to Count 4, there was a considerable volume of evidence in addition to that of Mr Potts. The Appellant acknowledged that he had entered the house of Mr Potts and that there had been a physical confrontation between the two men in which the Appellant had inflicted injuries to Mr Potts. The only real issue with respect to the fourth count was the issue of self-defence, which the jury determined adversely to the Appellant. The evidence of injuries to Mr Potts and the relative lack of injury to the Appellant was pertinent, as was the immediate complaint by Mr Potts to Ms McCarthy, Ms Taylor and Senior Constable Wilkinson. 

43The fact that no application was made at the trial for a direction of this type supports the view that the directions given were sufficient in the context of the trial, a view supported by the verdicts returned by the jury which themselves reflected careful evaluation by the jury of the evidence of Mr Potts. 

44I would refuse the Appellant leave under Rule 4 to rely upon Ground 2(i), but would, in any event, reject this ground of appeal. 
Conviction Ground 2(ii) - Directions Concerning Drawing of Inferences 

Submissions of the Parties 

45The Appellant seeks leave under Rule 4 to contend that an inadequate direction was given to the jury concerning the drawing of inferences. This ground relates to the fourth count where an element required proof that the Appellant wounded Mr Potts with intent to do grievous bodily harm. 

46Mr Ramage QC submitted that the trial Judge had failed to explain to the jury the process of drawing inferences, including the danger of drawing false conclusions, and had invited the jury to consider the process in terms of drawing a ""reasonable inference"" . He submitted that the trial Judge had failed to make it clear that in drawing an inference as to the intent of the Appellant, it had to be the actual intent of the Appellant with this being the only inference that could be drawn. He submitted as well that the trial Judge had failed to connect, or sufficiently connect, his directions to the evidence from which the jury were being invited to draw an inference and, in particular, the medical evidence. 

47The Crown submitted that the directions concerning the drawing of inferences in this case were sufficient. Given that the Appellant had admitted that he stabbed Mr Potts, asserting that such a stabbing was done in self-defence, the Crown submitted that the directions in relation to inferences required no further elaboration. 

Decision

48The directions concerning the drawing of inferences in this case fell within a narrow compass. The issue for the jury with respect to the fourth count related to the inference or inferences to be drawn concerning the intention of the Appellant from the evidence relating to the fourth count including the range and nature of injuries sustained by Mr Potts. 

49There was no issue in the trial that the Appellant had inflicted very significant injuries to Mr Potts. The issue with respect to the fourth count was one of self-defence. 

50The jury had before them photographic evidence of Mr Potts' injuries, together with evidence from Mr Oke, an ambulance officer, and Dr Morgan, the medical practitioner who treated Mr Potts upon his admission to hospital. Mr Potts sustained very severe facial lacerations and lacerations to the small of his back, with the loss of a considerable amount of blood. The Appellant admitted that he had wounded Mr Potts with a shard of broken vase. 

51It was necessary for the Crown to prove that the Appellant wounded Mr Potts with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. His Honour gave the jury appropriate directions concerning the meaning of grievous bodily harm. 

52I detect no error or deficiency in the directions given by the trial Judge concerning the drawing of inferences. Nor did defence trial counsel who sought no further direction in this respect. 

53I would refuse leave under Rule 4 for the Appellant to rely upon Ground 2(ii) but would, in any event, reject this ground of appeal. 

Grounds 2(iii) and (iv) - Directions to the Jury Concerning Self-Defence 

54It is appropriate to consider Grounds 2(iii) and (iv) together, as they each involve complaints concerning the approach of the trial Judge to the issue of self-defence. 

Submissions of the Parties 

55Mr Ramage QC submitted that, although the directions given to the jury concerning self-defence were correct in principle, further elaboration should have been given in the context of the trial. He submitted that the trial Judge gave misleading directions by leaving to the jury the scenario that the Appellant had stabbed Mr Potts with a shard of broken vase, and not a knife. 

56With respect to Ground 2(iv), Mr Ramage QC submitted that it was incumbent on the trial Judge to give directions by reference to relevant evidence concerning self-defence and that his Honour had failed to do so adequately in this case. 

57The Crown submitted that the directions given to the jury concerning self-defence were appropriate in the circumstances of the case. Although Mr Potts had given evidence that the Appellant possessed a knife prior to the physical altercation which was the subject of the fourth count, Mr Potts had not asserted directly that the knife had been used by the Appellant to stab him. Further, the Appellant gave evidence denying he had a knife, but admitting that he had stabbed Mr Potts with a shard of broken vase. The Crown submitted that there was no deficiency in the summing up with respect to this issue. 

Decision 

58No complaint is made under these grounds of appeal concerning the directions of law given to the jury concerning self-defence in this case. Rather, the complaint concerns the factual content of the directions given to the jury by the trial Judge. 

59It is not the case that Mr Potts asserted definitively that the Appellant had stabbed him with a knife. It was the evidence of Mr Potts that he was struck over the head by the Appellant with a vase which broke, and that thereafter he was cut to the face by the Appellant and stabbed in the back. The medical evidence demonstrated that Mr Potts had sustained very severe facial lacerations and lacerations to the small of his back. Mr Potts expressed an assumption or belief that he had been stabbed in the back with the knife. However, he did not claim to have seen the knife used in this way and acknowledged that he may have been wrong. 

60The Appellant admitted that he had stabbed Mr Potts with a shard of broken vase, but claimed to have done so in self-defence. 

61It is erroneous to contend that the Crown was, in some way, confined to a case that the Appellant had used a knife to stab Mr Potts. This was not the evidence of Mr Potts and the Appellant himself admitted the use of a shard in wounding Mr Potts. 

62I am entirely unpersuaded that there is any merit in Grounds 2(iii) and (iv) concerning the directions regarding self-defence and the summary of evidence bearing upon self-defence in this case. This view is fortified by the absence of any application by defence trial counsel for any further direction on this aspect. 

63In my view, these grounds are without merit and I would refuse the Appellant leave under Rule 4 to rely upon Grounds 2(iii) and (iv), which I would, in any event, reject. 

Ground 3 - Directions to the Jury Concerning an Alternative Verdict on the Second Count 

Submissions of the Parties 

64Mr Ramage QC submitted that the trial Judge had erred in leaving to the jury an alternative verdict on the second count of guilty of break, enter and steal simpliciter. He submitted that the trial had been conducted upon the basis that the incident on 19 August 2008, which was the subject of the second count, had been committed whilst the Appellant was armed with an offensive weapon, being the green cylindrical knife as asserted by Mr Potts in his evidence. 

65It was submitted that neither the Crown nor the defence at trial had adverted to the prospect of such an alternative verdict, and that the trial Judge did not raise the matter with counsel before informing the jury of this available alternative verdict in the course of the summing up. He submitted that this course was contrary to law and gave rise to a miscarriage of justice in the circumstances of the case. 

66The Crown submitted that there was an obligation on the trial Judge to leave an alternative verdict where it arose in the circumstances of the trial, and that it was not to the point that the Crown had not opened, nor relied upon such an alternative verdict: R v King [2004] NSWCCA 20; 59 NSWLR 515 at 516 [5], 525 [55]. 

67The Crown emphasised that defence trial counsel had not objected when the trial Judge introduced the possibility of an alternative verdict during the course of summing up. Further, the Crown observed that counsel did not object or make any submission opposing the alternative verdict direction when the issue was raised again in response to a jury note indicating that verdicts had been reached (SU36-37). Given that no complaint had been made at the trial concerning any suggested unfairness to the Appellant in this respect, the Crown submitted that no miscarriage of justice had resulted. 

Decision 

68The second count in the indictment charged the Appellant with an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal contrary to s.112(2) Crimes Act 1900 , an offence punishable by imprisonment for 20 years, with a standard non-parole period of five years. The circumstance of aggravation charged in the second count was that the Appellant was armed with an offensive weapon: s.105A(1) Crimes Act 1900 . 

69During the course of the summing up, the trial Judge instructed the jury in the following terms concerning a possible alternative verdict on the second count (SU13-14): 

""Now it is theoretically possible that you might find, I am not suggesting this is what you should or would find but I am obliged to describe to you the full range of legal options open to you, and that is it is entirely possible that you might find that you are persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the accused broke into, entered the house of and stole property from Mr Potts. But if for some reason you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was armed with the green cylindrical knife, the offensive weapon, at that stage then you would find him not guilty of this charge but you would need to tell me then that you find him guilty of the charge of breaking, entering and stealing. Because there is a breaking, entering and stealing and then there is the aggravating element of being armed with the offensive weapon. So that charge is, if you like, subdivisible."" 

70This direction left open to the jury the prospect of returning a verdict on the second count of not guilty of the charge under s.112(2) Crimes Act 1900 , but guilty of break, enter and steal under s.112(1) Crimes Act 1900 , an offence punishable by imprisonment for 14 years. 

71The legislature envisaged that such a scenario may present itself by enacting s.115A(1) Crimes Act 1900 , which is in the following terms: 

""115A Alternative verdicts 

(1) Aggravated offence reduced to basic offence 

If on the trial of a person for an offence under section 106 (2), 107 (2), 109 (2), 111 (2), 112 (2) or 113 (2) the jury is not satisfied that the accused is guilty of the offence charged, but is satisfied on the evidence that the accused is guilty of an offence under section 106 (1), 107 (1), 109 (1), 111 (1), 112 (1) or 113 (1) as appropriate, it may find the accused not guilty of the offence charged but guilty of the latter offence, and the accused is liable to punishment accordingly...."" 

72Section 115A(1) reflects the common law position which permits an alternative verdict to be returned for a lesser included offence not charged in the indictment: R v Cameron [1983] 2 NSWLR 66 at 67-70; R v Winner (1989) 39 A Crim R 180 at 181. 

73Accordingly, the course taken by the trial Judge was open as a matter of law. The complaint here is that, in the circumstances of the case, the trial Judge erred in leaving the alternative verdict to the jury in the summing up when there had been no earlier reference to that possibility by the Crown or the trial Judge. In effect, the Appellant submits that unfairness resulted to him in these circumstances and that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. 

74The circumstances in which a possible alternative verdict has, or has not, been left the jury in a criminal trial have given rise to grounds of appeal to this Court. The more common scenario is a complaint that an alternative verdict was not left to the jury, whether or not defence counsel sought such a direction at trial. An example of this type is an appeal upon the basis that the trial Judge ought to have left an alternative verdict of manslaughter in a murder trial: Carney v R; Cambey v R [2011] NSWCCA 223 (where the relevant High Court authorities are considered). 

75It is accepted that a trial Judge may fall into error where a lesser included offence is not left to the jury as an alternative verdict: R v King (armed robbery/robbery); Mifsud v R [2009] NSWCCA 313 (robbery in company/larceny). 

76As Buddin J observed in R v Jones and Ors (No. 9) [2007] NSWSC 1160 at [16], the trend of authority (including R v King ) makes it plain that, if an alternative verdict is open upon the evidence, a trial Judge is bound to leave it for the jury's consideration regardless of the attitude of the accused. 

77In the context of the present case, and using the reasoning in Mifsud v R at [43]-[50], the questions that arise in a case such as this may be framed in any of the following ways: 

(a) whether an alternative verdict of break, enter and steal would, on the evidence in this case, represent a viable outcome; 

(b) whether a conviction for break, enter and steal would produce a ""rational result"" ; 

(c) whether, in circumstances where the principal offence under s.112(2) is undoubtedly grave, the alternative of break, enter and steal is ""comparatively trifling and remote"" . 

78It has been said that a trial Judge should leave a lesser included offence as an alternative provided it is in the interests of justice and in the interests of the accused to do so: R v King at 516-517 [5], [12]-[13], 534-535 [110]-[115]. It is in the public interest that alternative verdicts which are open on the evidence should be considered so that a correct outcome is achieved: R v King at 532 [99]. 

79Although an argument may be advanced that the accused may obtain an advantage where the lesser offence is not left to the jury, it has been observed that such an argument is unsound: R v King at 535 [112]. 

80In the circumstances of this case, it was open to the trial Judge as a matter of law to leave the alternative verdict on the second count to the jury. Indeed, the authorities support an argument that the trial Judge was bound as a matter of law to do so. It appears that this was his Honour's view as he told the jury that he was ""obliged to describe to you the full range of legal options open to you"" (see [69] above). 

81That leaves a further question concerning the manner and timing of the alternative verdict being raised. The Crown did not open to the jury upon this aspect. Nor was mention made during the trial by the trial Judge, the Crown Prosecutor or defence counsel concerning the possibility of an alternative verdict on the second count. The topic was not referred to in closing addresses. The trial Judge did not raise the issue with counsel in the absence of the jury. Rather, the topic was mentioned for the first time in the extract from the summing up set out at [69] above. 

82This Court has emphasised the strong desirability of the prospect of an alternative verdict being raised at an early time in the trial. To raise the question for the first time at the conclusion of the Crown case may, in many cases, produce an injustice to the accused. It has been said to be unwise for a trial Judge to introduce these matters on his own initiative: R v Cameron at 71. In R v Pureau (1990) 19 NSWLR 372 at 376, Hunt J observed that normally the prospect of an alternative verdict should be raised by the Judge with counsel before the closing addresses to enable counsel to consider what, if anything, they wish to say on the issue. Hunt J said that it was difficult to imagine circumstances which would justify such an issue being raised for the first time during the summing up, when neither counsel had had at least the opportunity of addressing upon it if they so wished. 

83A test of practical unfairness should be applied in circumstances such as this: R v Lykouras [2005] NSWCCA 8 at [22]-[24]; Chand v R [2011] NSWCCA 53 at [60]-[67]. This approach is consistent with that taken by this Court where complaint is made that unfairness has resulted for an accused, with a consequential miscarriage of justice, where a trial Judge directs a jury during summing up on a factual scenario not advanced by the Crown during the trial: Robinson v R [2006] NSWCCA 192; 162 A Crim R 88 at 127-129 [138]-[149]. 

84The question for this Court to consider is whether there has been an unfairness to the Appellant giving rise to a miscarriage of justice by reason of the conduct of the trial, requiring the intervention of this Court: Robinson v R at 129 [149]; Smale v R [2007] NSWCCA 328 at [97]. 

85In the context of a ground of appeal complaining of an alternative verdict being left to the jury by a trial Judge, it has been considered significant that no objection had been taken by trial defence counsel to the alternative count being left to the jury, with the absence of objection supporting the view that there was no prejudice as a result of the alternative count being left: Chand v R at [58]-[62]. 

86Where there is contemporaneous objection to the course taken by the trial Judge, there is practical recognition, in the atmosphere of the trial, that the accused has been prejudiced and that unfairness has resulted from the trial Judge's directions: Robinson v R at 130-131 [156]. Complaint may be made that the trial would have been conducted differently or that submissions would have been made to the jury if it had been known that the trial Judge intended to raise the particular issue in the summing up. In some cases, defence counsel may contend that the jury should be discharged. Contemporaneous complaints and applications of this type were made in Robinson v R . 

87It has been said that it would be a rare case, where elements of unfairness were absent, that this Court would find that it was unfair or oppressive for the Crown to rely upon an alternative count simply because it might deprive the accused of a chance of an acquittal on the principal charge: Chand v R at [61]. 

88In R v Pureau , Hunt J observed at 377D-E that it may be difficult for an accused person to complain of a miscarriage of justice as a result of the late raising of an alternative verdict of attempt where the accused's case was a complete denial, so that there would be nothing which counsel could usefully have said in his closing address which would have assisted him on the alternative verdict. As Howie J (Mason P and James J agreeing) said in Smale v R at [97], ""if by putting an argument or a case to the jury that was not put by the Crown some real unfairness had arisen to the accused, it is difficult to imagine that defence counsel would not object"" . A failure to raise objection at the close of the trial Judge's summing up is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of its fairness and adequacy: Tekely v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [89], [130]-[132]. 

89Considerations of this type are pertinent both on the question whether leave should be granted under Rule 4 to press this ground and, if leave was granted, whether the ground is made good: Chand v R at [67]. 

90As a matter of proper trial practice, it was undesirable that the prospect of an alternative verdict was raised by the trial Judge for the first time during the course of the summing up. The observations made in R v Cameron and R v Pureau emphasise the strong desirability of this step being flagged prior to closing addresses, if not earlier. 

91However, the question remains whether there has been any procedural or substantive unfairness to the Appellant: R v Sieders [2008] NSWCCA 187; 72 NSWLR 417 at 450-454 [197]-[205]; Qoro v R [2008] NSWCCA 220 at [47]-[56]. Has the Appellant demonstrated that a miscarriage of justice has occurred so that the conviction for an offence under s.112(1) Crimes Act 1900 should be quashed? 

92When the issue was raised by the trial Judge, neither the Crown Prosecutor nor (more particularly) defence counsel raised any concern or objection to that course. There was no submission made that the late raising of this prospect had taken counsel by surprise or that any aspect of the trial, including closing addresses, may have been handled differently if counsel had been told that this was to occur. 

93The observations of Hunt J in R v Pureau (at [88] above) are pertinent in this respect. If the complaint is, as in Chand v R , that the Appellant was somehow entitled to run an ""all or nothing"" defence on the second count, then that approach is not supported by authority. It is difficult to see how unfairness resulted to the Appellant where an alternative and lesser included count was left to the jury. Senior counsel for the Appellant before this Court has not articulated any practical unfairness which is said to have resulted from this course. 

94In all the circumstances, without seeking to endorse the approach of the trial Judge in this case, I am not persuaded that there was a practical injustice to the Appellant resulting from the course taken by his Honour. 

95I am not satisfied that a miscarriage of justice has occurred in this case. I would decline the Appellant leave under Rule 4 to rely upon this ground, but, even if leave was granted, I would reject the ground of appeal. 

Conviction Ground 4 - The Verdicts Were Inconsistent and the Verdicts of Guilty Were Unreasonable 

96Although there are two elements to this ground of appeal, they were argued together and there are overlapping features so that it is appropriate to determine the contentions as a single ground. 

Submissions of the Parties 

97Mr Ramage QC submitted that the verdicts of the jury were inconsistent and that the convictions on the alternative charge under Count 2 and on Count 4 were unreasonable and cannot be supported, having regard to the whole of the evidence and all of the relevant facts and circumstances of the case, including the acquittals on Counts 1, 2 (the aggravated offence) and 3. 

98Senior counsel submitted that the Crown case on each count depended on the truthfulness, reliability and accuracy of the complainant, Mr Potts. It was submitted that the only reasonable (or the principal) explanation for the acquittals and partial acquittal, must have been doubt about the veracity of Mr Potts and rejection of his evidence. Mr Ramage QC submitted that the suggested inconsistent verdicts lacked any rational explanation other than doubt about the credibility of Mr Potts. 

99In relation to Count 1, Mr Ramage QC submitted that the jury must have doubted the credibility of the evidence of Mr Potts that he had been punched in the face by the Appellant with a closed fist. 

100With respect to the acquittal on the aggravated break, enter and steal charge in Count 2, Mr Ramage QC submitted that the jury must have rejected the evidence of Mr Potts that he had been menaced with a knife. He submitted that the jury may well have been led, as a result of the alternative verdict direction, into making an inconsistent and illogical decision, which rejected an integral part of the evidence of Mr Potts, but apparently accepted the balance. He submitted that the asserted presence of a knife could not be simply ignored as it was fundamental to the reason for Mr Potts surrendering his property to the Appellant. 

101Concerning Count 3, Mr Ramage QC submitted that the acquittal must have involved the total rejection of the evidence of Mr Potts that a threatening act with a knife had occurred at the Westfield Miranda Fair on 20 August 2008. He submitted that the rejection of the evidence of Mr Potts on this count should have logically affected the jury's acceptance of any of the evidence of Mr Potts with respect to the other incidents. It was submitted that rejection of this incident should have been reflected in doubt about the entire incident the previous day (Count 2). 

102With respect to Count 4, Mr Ramage QC submitted that the veracity of the evidence of Mr Potts was of fundamental importance, in particular with respect to the circumstances in which the fight started between the two men. He submitted that the acquittal of the Appellant on the second and third counts, where Mr Potts alleged that the green knife had been brandished, had a flow-on effect to the fourth count, where Mr Potts alleged that the knife was again used by the Appellant. 

103Mr Ramage QC submitted that it was likely that the jury rejected the evidence of Mr Potts concerning the knife, but convicted on the basis that the Appellant had used excessive force with a shard. He submitted that such an approach ""smacks of compromise"" and effectively denied what had been an integral part of the Crown case which could not logically be separated out from the balance of the evidence of Mr Potts. 

104The Crown submitted that there was evidence which corroborated the evidence of Mr Potts with respect to the offences for which the Appellant was convicted and that this served to explain the verdicts returned by the jury. 

105With respect to the first count, the Crown noted that the prosecution case depended upon the evidence of Mr Potts that he had been punched by the Appellant, with the only additional evidence being the complaint made by Mr Potts to Ms McCarthy. 

106In relation to the third count, there was no evidence independent of Mr Potts, not even evidence of complaint. 

107With respect to the conviction for the offence which was an alternative to Count 2, the Crown submitted there was evidence which corroborated the account of Mr Potts concerning the elements of the offence of breaking, entering and stealing. There was evidence that the garage door (the point of entry of the Appellant) was broken and that Mr Potts had thereafter braced the door with a tool. Ms McCarthy gave evidence of early complaints by Mr Potts that the Appellant had come to the house to rob him. After the incident, Ms McCarthy observed that Mr Potts wanted her to lock all the windows and to make sure that doors were locked securely because he was worried that the Appellant was going to come back. However, Mr Potts had not referred to a knife in his complaint to Ms McCarthy. The Crown submitted that this may well explain the jury's verdict on this count. 

108With respect to the fourth count, the Crown submitted that the only real issue was whether the Appellant had acted in self-defence and that the jury clearly found that he had not, or alternatively, the jury found that what he did was excessive in the circumstances. In response to the Appellant's submissions concerning the knife, the Crown submitted that there was no issue on this count that the Appellant had wounded Mr Potts. Any argument based upon the presence of the knife was not critical to this count, where there was a substantial body of physical, medical and forensic evidence in addition to that of Mr Potts. 

109The Crown submitted that there was no relevant inconsistency between the verdicts and that the Appellant has not demonstrated that the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable. 

Decision 

110As this ground of appeal against conviction does not involve a question of law alone, the Appellant requires leave to appeal against conviction: s.5(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 ; Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12]. Having regard to the arguments advanced, I would grant leave to the Appellant to rely upon this ground of appeal with respect to conviction. 

111The task of this Court when considering a ground such as this was summarised in Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126 at [31]-[36]: 

""31 In determining a ground of appeal which asserts, for the purpose of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, this Court is required to apply the test set down in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, and restated in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. The Court is to make an independent assessment of the evidence, both to its sufficiency and quality. This involves a question of fact. The Court is to determine whether the evidence is such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty. The central question is whether this Court is satisfied that the Appellant is guilty of the offence charged in the first count: Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 85 ALJR 571 at 575 [11]-[14], 576-577 [20]-[22]. 

32 In exercising that function, the evidence ought not be considered piecemeal: The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 637-638 [46]-[48]; The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 236 CLR 397 at 435 [128]. This Court is required to consider the totality of evidence before the jury. This involves an assessment of direct evidence of witnesses, and inferences to be drawn from a combination of events: Rasic v R at [29]. 

33 In some cases, the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal has not seen or heard the witnesses at trial may have a bearing on the outcome of an appeal on an unreasonable verdict ground. In M v The Queen , Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson Toohey JJ said at 494-495: 

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above.' 

34 The M v The Queen formulation of the task of this Court has been emphasised by the High Court in later cases: The Queen v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; 85 ALJR 8 at 14 [33]; SKA v The Queen at 575 [13]. 

35 Where an unreasonable verdict ground is said to be supported by a claim of inconsistent jury verdicts, the focus of the enquiry is upon any explanation for an acquittal, not for a conviction: R v TK at 321 [128]. 

36 The Appellant bears the burden of establishing inconsistency of verdicts. This Court has said that it is only where inconsistency rises to the point that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside: Dungay v R; R v Dungay [2010] NSWCCA 82 at [22]; Still v R [2010] NSWCCA 131 at [57]-[61]."" 

112The following statement of this Court in Still v R [2010] NSWCCA 131 at [60] should also be kept in mind in considering a ground which asserts inconsistent verdicts: 

""An appellate court should be cautious before concluding that a jury (as a whole) has acted contrary to its clearly explained duty. There may be many reasons why a jury does not convict on a particular count and an appellate court must allow for the advantage of the jury when considering questions arising under s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912: R v TK [2009] NSWCCA 151; 74 NSWLR 299 at 301-302 [6], 331 [194]. Where there is evidence to support the verdict, there is a need for great caution in presuming that a jury has acted inappropriately in reaching a conclusion of guilt in some circumstances, and a contrary conclusion in others: Jovanovksi v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) at [23]."" 

113The trial Judge directed the jury concerning the need for separate verdicts in the following passage which was not challenged in this Court (SU32-33): 

""Now there are four counts, that means you have to decide them individually and you have to deliver a separate verdict in respect of each of them. Theoretically at least that means that you may decide the answer is different in respect of one or more of them. However, you should bear this in mind. That if when you have considered some charge and the reason you are not persuaded beyond reasonable doubt, if that is the situation in which you find yourself, is because you have some reasonable doubt about the evidence of Mr Potts then you have to bear that fact in mind when you come to consider the other charges on which you are required to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by his evidence. In other words, if there are different results to the different charges they have to be logically defensible. You have to have some logical reason for having arrived at a different conclusion in respect of one or more to what you decide in relation to the others. I am not saying you will, I am simply reminding you that you do have to deliver separate results and those results must be unanimous."" 

114This direction invited the jury, correctly, to consider their verdict on each count and to take into account any conclusion reached by them with respect of the evidence of Mr Potts in considering the subsequent count. Thus the jury were invited to consider the evidence (including that of Mr Potts) in a way that could give rise to different results on different charges, but with those differences needing to be ""logically defensible"" . 

115The acquittal of the Appellant on the first and third counts is to be explained by the limited evidence adduced by the Crown on those counts. On the first count, there was the evidence of Mr Potts together with evidence of complaint that there had been a relatively minor assault in the form of a push. The Appellant give evidence denying that such an incident occurred. 

116With respect to the third count, the only evidence was that of Mr Potts describing the incident said to have occurred in a shopping centre. There was no evidence of complaint. The Appellant gave evidence denying that this incident occurred. 

117In my view, the acquittal of the Appellant on these counts reflects the jury applying the demanding criminal standard of proof to the limited evidence before them on those charges. 

118The acquittal of the Appellant for the offence charged in the second count is to be explained by the jury having a reasonable doubt that the Appellant possessed a knife at the time of that offence. In assessing the evidence of Mr Potts and in accordance with the directions of the trial Judge, the jury may have considered this feature of the evidence of Mr Potts which was common to the second and third counts. However, there was additional evidence which supported the account of Mr Potts that the premises were broken and entered by the Appellant on 19 August 2008 and that property of Mr Potts was stolen by the Appellant on that occasion. The verdict of guilty on the s.112(1) statutory alternative is understandable when viewed in this light. 

119The fourth count was the most serious charge before the jury. It is fair to say that the great bulk of the trial was taken up by evidence which bore upon this charge. There was a substantial body of evidence in addition to that of Mr Potts which implicated the Appellant in this crime. 

120The Appellant's argument concerning inconsistency on the fourth count depends upon an acceptance that the suggested possession of a knife was fundamental to this charge, and that the verdicts on other counts where a knife was said to have been possessed, meant that acquittal of the Appellant on this count was effectively inevitable. I do not accept his analysis. 

121With respect to the fourth count, the Appellant admitted that he had entered the premises and that an altercation occurred leading to the Appellant inflicting wounds upon Mr Potts. Although Mr Potts asserted that the Appellant was armed with the green knife inside the house, Mr Potts did not assert that the various serious and undisputed injuries which he sustained were caused by the use of the knife. The closest the evidence came to this was what Mr Potts described as an assumption (which he acknowledged may have been wrong) that the knife had been used to stab him in the back. There were undisputed injuries to Mr Potts' back, the depth of which tended to support they were caused by some type of stabbing. In my view, the knife was not a fundamental feature of the fourth count. 

122Mr Ramage QC submitted that the evidence of Mr Potts concerning the commencement of the altercation ought to have been rejected by the jury, and that this ought to have led to the acquittal of the Appellant on this count. I do not agree. There was a substantial body of further evidence which incriminated the Appellant on this count. 

123With respect to the submission under this ground of appeal based upon the claim of inconsistent verdicts, I express the conclusion that, applying the relevant principles referred to above (at [111]-[112]), there was no relevant inconsistency so that the convictions on the alternative offence under the second count and on the fourth count ought be set aside. Rather, the verdicts suggest that the jury approached their task in a principled way, returning separate verdicts on each of the counts which make sense and are rational in the context of the trial. 

124With respect to the balance of the submissions advanced asserting that the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable, it is necessary to approach the matter in accordance with the principles set out above (at [111]). 

125I have referred earlier to evidence which bears upon the verdict of guilty on the alternative charge under the second count, namely breaking, entering and stealing committed on 19 August 2008. It is important to bear in mind that aspects of the evidence of Mr Potts on this count were corroborated by physical evidence of breaking and entering through the garage. Further, Ms McCarthy gave evidence that Mr Potts complained that such an incident had occurred and, importantly, that he thereafter wished her to lock all the windows and to make sure all the doors were locked securely because of his worry that the Appellant would come back. The complaint made by Mr Potts to Ms McCarthy did not include any reference to a knife. This may serve to explain the acquittal on the charge of aggravated break, enter and steal. However, the jury had before them the evidence of Mr Potts as to what had occurred, accompanied by evidence that the garage had been broken and entered and evidence of a contemporaneous concern by Mr Potts expressed to Ms McCarthy that there would be repetition of such conduct by the Appellant. 

126The jury had the advantage of seeing the witnesses giving evidence, including Mr Potts and the Appellant. Counsel for the Appellant at trial put to Mr Potts that he had supplied the drug, ice, to the Appellant and that this aspect of their association shed light upon the events raised in the trial. Mr Potts strongly denied such allegations. There was evidence from a police officer in the trial that there was no evidence or police intelligence to support the suggestion that Mr Potts was a drug supplier. 

127A reading of the transcript suggests that Mr Potts gave his evidence in a forceful fashion, strongly defending himself against allegations of this type. The transcript also revealed that aspects of the evidence of the Appellant under cross-examination were troubling, and that the jury would have been unlikely to find the Appellant's evidence persuasive. An example of this is the evidence of the Appellant (concerning the fourth count) that he fell over the coffee table in the lounge room in a manner that would have objects spreadeagled on the table. Yet the crime scene photographs depicted a number of items still sitting on the table. Of course, as the jury was directed, it was for the Crown to prove the guilt of the Appellant, even if the jury did not accept the Appellant's evidence. However, an examination of the transcript suggests that there were significant credibility issues impacting upon the Appellant's account. It is necessary to keep in mind the restricted ability of this Court in exercising its present appellate function, as opposed to the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the witnesses giving evidence in areas where strong challenges to credibility were being made with respect to both Mr Potts and the Appellant. 

128As mentioned above, the fourth count involves a substantial body of evidence extending beyond that given by Mr Potts and the Appellant. Having considered that evidence, I record the following matters. 

129There was evidence before the jury that the Appellant had reported at a police station on the evening of 29 August 2008 shortly before he attended the home of Mr Potts. Sergeant Papworth gave evidence that the Appellant was aggressive and antagonistic towards him at that time, which was only 10 minutes before the events which occurred at Mr Potts' Menai home. 

130The Appellant said that he went to Mr Potts' home to obtain the drug ice. Mr Potts denied this. What is clear, however, is that it was the Appellant who attended the home of Mr Potts in an aggressive frame of mind. There was some discussion between Mr Potts and the Appellant at the front door, but it is common ground that Mr Potts did not let the Appellant in through that door. The Appellant entered via the garage door, with physical evidence observed by the police supporting a conclusion that the Appellant had forced the garage door open by manipulating the tool which had held it in place following the earlier break, enter and steal on 19 August 2008. There is a strong body of evidence that the Appellant broke and entered the premises on the occasion of the fourth count. 

131There is a dispute in the evidence as to what was said between the two men before the physical altercation commenced. Mr Potts maintained that the Appellant possessed the green knife. The Appellant denied this. What is clear, however, is that the Appellant had broken and entered the premises of Mr Potts in an aggressive state. It was the Appellant who sought to confront Mr Potts in his home. The conclusion ought be reached that he initiated the physical contact with Mr Potts which thereafter involved the infliction of very serious injuries by the Appellant to Mr Potts. 

132I accept the account of Mr Potts that the two men wrestled on the stairs and rolled downstairs into the living room. Thereafter, the Appellant picked up a vase and smashed it over Mr Potts' head. The Appellant then picked up a shard and slashed at the face of Mr Potts, causing a serious wound to the eyelid and an injury to the throat. This is sufficient to constitute the offence charged in the fourth count. Although the strong likelihood is that the Appellant inflicted wounds to Mr Potts' back using a shard, there is a reasonable possibility that these injuries were sustained by Mr Potts rolling on broken vase pieces. Accordingly, I am not satisfied to the criminal standard that the Appellant stabbed Mr Potts in the back. However, as I have said, this does not assist the Appellant on this count. 

133That multiple cutting and stabbing injuries of this type were inflicted upon Mr Potts is not in doubt. The evidence of Mr Oke, the ambulance officer, and Dr Morgan demonstrates the range and severity of injuries inflicted upon Mr Potts. The inflicting of these injuries caused significant blood loss from Mr Potts, with areas of the house and his body and clothing being heavily blood stained. 

134This may be contrasted with the comparative lack of injury to the Appellant. He had a minor injury to the hand. 

135I am satisfied that the sound of a neighbour arriving home led the Appellant to desist from his attack on Mr Potts and to flee the house. At that time, it ought to have been apparent (even allowing for the darkness of an early winter evening) that Mr Potts had been severely injured. The Appellant departed the premises. He travelled to his mother's home and then to a club where he spent an extended period of time drinking and playing pool. He did not appear to be impeded by any injuries. 

136Although the process of fact finding in a case such as this, where self-defence is raised, is not to be confined to a bare comparison of the injuries sustained by the two protagonists, that feature nevertheless remains a most important part of the fact-finding function. The range and seriousness of injuries inflicted by the Appellant upon Mr Potts sheds very considerable light upon the identity of the aggressor and the question whether the Appellant was acting in self-defence. 

137Of course, it remains for the Crown to negative self-defence once it is raised. However, having examined the evidence adduced at the trial, I am well satisfied that the Crown discharged that onus. 

138Having undertaken the task required, I express the conclusion that it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty of the alternative offence under the second count. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant is guilty of that offence. 

139In my view, it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty of the offence charged in the fourth count. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty of that offence. 

140Having regard to these conclusions, I reject the fourth ground of appeal against conviction. 

141The appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 

Appeal Against Sentence 

142Before turning to the grounds of appeal concerning sentence, I observe that the Appellant was sentenced, and the appeal was argued, before the decision of the High Court of Australia on 5 October 2011 in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154, where the High Court altered significantly the law relevant to sentencing for standard non-parole period offences. The offence contained in the fourth count is a standard non-parole period offence. The alternative offence under s.112(1) Crimes Act 1900 with respect to the second count is not a standard non-parole period offence. 

143Having regard to the decision in Muldrock v The Queen , I will put to one side, for the moment, consideration of Sentence Grounds 1, 4 and 5. Initial consideration will be given to Sentence Grounds 2 and 3, which make specific complaints concerning the remarks on sentence. 
 
Sentence Ground 2 - Suggested Error in Taking into Account as an Aggravating Factor the Prior Criminal Record of the Appellant 

144The Appellant had a significant criminal history extending back over many years. The convictions included break, enter and steal (in 1986), assault occasioning actual bodily harm and contravening an apprehended violence order (in 1999), assault with intent to rob in company with wounding (in 2002), possession of a prohibited drug, receiving and possession of a shortened firearm (in 2006). The Appellant had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment in 2002 and 2006. 

145The Appellant was subject to conditional liberty (a bond) at the time of the offence under the second count, and also at the time of the offence in the fourth count on 29 August 2008 (conditional bail) having been charged with destroying or damaging property, common assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. It was in connection with these charges that the Appellant was reporting pursuant to his bail conditions shortly before the commission of the offence in the fourth count. 

146Mr Ramage QC submits that the sentencing Judge erred by taking into account the Appellant's criminal history in making an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence in the fourth count, contrary to the principles in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566. 

147I do not accept this submission. His Honour adverted to the Appellant's criminal history in the following way in the remarks on sentence (ROS4-5): 

""The factors of a subjective nature which need to be considered consist of both positives and negatives. Clearly there is the aggravating factor present that the prisoner had a previous record. He has a reasonably extensive record marked by a sentence of four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years imposed for robbery in company and he, also, was on conditional liberty at the time at least of the final offence. He was on bail having been involved in some criminal activity on what appears from the record to have been the previous day of 28 August 2008. I know nothing of those offences, except that he was charged on 28 August, admitted to bail, committed the specially aggravated breaking and entering on 29 August, was ultimately sentenced to terms of imprisonment commencing from 1 September 2008 of four months for malicious damage, six months for assault and seven months for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, all of them being concurrent. 

As at the time of committing the first breaking entering and stealing he was also on conditional liberty, being subject to a bond to be of good behaviour for three years which had been imposed as from December 2006."" 

148As the opening words in this passage make clear, his Honour was having regard to these matters as part of an assessment of the Appellant's subjective circumstances, with the Appellant's criminal history, and the fact that the offences were committed whilst he was subject to conditional liberty, being aggravating factors on sentence. This proposition is consistent with s.21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and is not in conflict with the decision of this Court in R v McNaughton. His Honour did not have regard to these matters in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences. 

149I reject this ground of appeal. 

Sentence Ground 3 - The Sentencing Judge Erred in Sentencing on the Basis of Possibility 

150This ground of appeal arises from the following findings made by the sentencing Judge with respect to the fourth count (ROS4): 

""The facts of course are that the prisoner did attend Mr Potts' home on 29 August, that he did force entry and that he did wound Mr Potts. The jury were perfectly justified in concluding that in doing so and the extent to which he did was indicative of an intention to do serious physical harm and I find that is what he did. He did so by smashing a ceramic vase over Mr Potts' head and by slashing him around the face and very possibly by stabbing him in the back with shards of that broken vase."" 

151Mr Ramage QC submitted that the sentencing Judge erred in that the verdict of the jury did not dictate that they had made any finding regarding the stabbing in the back. He submitted that whether the Appellant had deliberately stabbed Mr Potts with either a knife or a shard was an important matter for the sentencing Judge to determine beyond reasonable doubt. He submitted that a finding expressed in terms of something being ""very possible"" was not an appropriate basis to make such a finding. 

152The Crown submitted that the evidence indicated that the Appellant had stabbed Mr Potts in the back with the shard and that there were injuries to Mr Potts' back consistent with such a stabbing. Although an issue had arisen at the trial as to whether a knife or a shard had been used to stab Mr Potts, the Crown submitted that there was no dispute that the Appellant had wounded Mr Potts. Although the use of the words ""very possibly"" may, in the Crown submission, be unfortunate, it did not denote error. 

153The evidence indicated that Mr Potts had sustained injuries to the back. However, the most significant injuries, for the purpose of the fourth count, were those to the face and neck of Mr Potts. There was a suggestion at the trial that the injuries to Mr Potts' back might have resulted from him rolling on shattered vase pieces on the ground, although the evidence pointed strongly to these back injuries being stab wounds. However, as mentioned earlier (at [132]), I am not satisfied to the criminal standard that the Appellant stabbed Mr Potts in the back. Nor was the sentencing Judge, which explains the language used by his Honour in this respect. 

154In my view, the sentencing Judge proceeded to sentence the Appellant on the fourth count for the injuries sustained through the smashing of the vase over Mr Potts' head and the slashing around his face. His Honour did not sentence him upon the basis that he had stabbed Mr Potts in the back. 

155In my view, this ground of appeal has not been made good. 
 
Sentence Grounds 1, 4 and 5 - Challenges to the Individual Sentences and the Total Effective Sentence 

156Mr Ramage QC submitted that the total sentence and the individual sentences were unduly harsh and severe (Sentence Ground 1). I take this to be an assertion that the sentences were manifestly excessive. 

The s.112(1) Offence Alternative to the Second Count 

157Reliance was placed by the Appellant on sentencing statistics and the theoretical possibility that the offence under s.112(1) Crimes Act 1900 might have been dealt with summarily in the Local Court with a lower jurisdictional limit. 

158However, in the course of argument, Mr Ramage QC acknowledged that the theoretical prospect of summary disposal in the Local Court was of no assistance to him given that the offence actually charged in the second count was not capable of summary disposal: Dunn v R [2010] NSWCCA 128 at [23]-[25]. 

159The Crown submitted that the sentence on this count was within the range available in the exercise of sentencing discretion. 

160The maximum penalty for this offence was imprisonment for 14 years. The Appellant was sentenced to a total term of four years' imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years and a balance of term of one year. 

161In my view, this was a serious offence of breaking, entering and stealing. The Applicant had a significant criminal history for offences of dishonesty and violence. The offence was committed whilst the Appellant was subject to conditional liberty. He was convicted at trial and thus there was no discount for a plea of guilty let alone any allowance for contrition and remorse. 

162To establish a ground claiming manifest excess, it is necessary for the Appellant to demonstrate that the sentence under challenge is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [27]. Absent error, the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge merely because (if it be the case) the Court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing Judge exercised his discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15]. Nor is appellate intervention on the ground of manifest excess justified simply because (if it be the case) the result arrived at in the District Court is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases. Intervention is warranted only where error is established in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538 [58]. 

163Having applied these principles, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed for the offence under s.112(1) Crimes Act 1900 is manifestly excessive. The sentence was substantial but lay within the range for the proper exercise of sentencing discretion in the circumstances of the case. 

The Fourth Count 

164I turn to the sentence imposed on the fourth count. The maximum penalty for that crime is imprisonment for 25 years with a standard non-parole period of seven years. The Appellant was sentenced to a total term of 10 years' imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of seven years and a balance of term of three years. 

165The sentencing Judge passed sentence for this offence applying the principles in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. His Honour said (ROS6): 

""I am unable to find that there is any reason to depart from the standard non-parole period in respect of the most serious of the offences."" 

166Applying the principles in R v Way , his Honour held that the standard non-parole period had direct application to the Appellant who had been convicted of the offence after trial. That approach to sentence is no longer correct given the decision in Muldrock v The Queen at 1162 [25]. 

167In my view, the appropriate course is to resentence the Appellant on the fourth count and then to consider issues of concurrency, accumulation and totality as between the two sentences. In these circumstances, I do not see any useful purpose in considering the specific complaints raised by Sentence Grounds 1, 4 and 5 concerning the sentence passed in the District Court on the fourth count. 

168I am satisfied that the Court should move to resentence the Appellant on the fourth count in accordance with s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 . 

169It remains necessary, of course, to have regard to the objective gravity of the offence contained in the fourth count, together with all relevant subjective factors and other sentencing principles which bear upon the imposition of sentence in this case: Muldrock v The Queen at 1162 [26]. The maximum penalty and standard non-parole period are ""legislative guideposts"" to be borne in mind when considering the appropriate penalty, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of the Appellant: Muldrock v The Queen at 1162-1163 [27]-[31]. 

170This was an objectively grave crime. The Appellant broke into the residence of Mr Potts whilst in an aggressive state and physically confronted him, leading to a sustained attack by him upon Mr Potts. This included the smashing of a vase over the head of Mr Potts and the use of a shard from that broken vase to wound Mr Potts to the face and neck in a serious fashion. 
171The gravity of the injuries sustained by Mr Potts would have been apparent to the Appellant, who departed the premises without any attempt to assist Mr Potts or to ensure that assistance was to be provided to him. The evidence of Mr Oke, the ambulance officer, describes the bloody scene which presented itself to him upon arrival at the house, and the extent of the injuries suffered by Mr Potts, including blood loss, and the potentially fatal consequences if those injuries had remained untreated. 

172Sentencing of the Appellant for this offence should be approached upon the basis that the Appellant attacked Mr Potts and there was a struggle between the two men. In the course of the struggle with the unarmed Mr Potts, the Appellant smashed a vase over the head of Mr Potts, with the Appellant then using a shard to slash the face and neck of Mr Potts. Although self-defence was raised so that it was appropriate for the trial Judge to give the jury directions on self-defence, the jury was satisfied (as am I) that the Crown negatived self-defence. This was a sustained and gratuitous attack upon Mr Potts by an aggressive Appellant wielding a shard as a weapon. Accordingly, this is an objectively grave crime. 

173To the extent that an opinion concerning the objective seriousness of the Appellant's crime should be expressed to allow the standard non-parole period to have some practical utility as a ""legislative guidepost"" , I consider that this offence lay within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 

174The Appellant's subjective circumstances did not assist him. His criminal history, and the fact that the offence was committed whilst subject to conditional liberty, are matters which operate strongly against him on sentence. The very fact that the Appellant had only shortly before the commission of the offence on 29 August 2008, reported to police as a condition of his bail, serves to illustrate somewhat starkly the gross nature of the breach of conditional liberty involved in the commission of the offence. 

175The evidence revealed that the Appellant has a history of drug use and was using the drug, ice, at about the time of the commission of the offence. His prospects of rehabilitation must be somewhat guarded having regard to his criminal history and the commission of offences of this type, in the context of drug use, by a man then in his early 40s. 

176Having regard to objective and subjective factors, the need for personal deterrence and for the sentence to reflect general deterrence, the appropriate sentence for this offence involves a head sentence of seven years. I see no reason for varying the statutory ratio under s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . There are no factors which could constitute special circumstances which have not already been taken into account in the determination of sentence. Accordingly, I propose a head sentence of seven years for this offence with a non-parole period of five years and three months. 

177I turn to the issues of concurrency, accumulation and totality. There were two separate crimes committed on separate days. It is appropriate that there be a measure of accumulation, although in all the circumstances of the case where there was a course of conduct between the two men, a substantial measure of concurrency is also appropriate. I consider that the measure of accumulation adopted by the sentencing Judge was excessive in all the circumstances of the case. I would accumulate the sentence for the fourth count by one year. 

178The total effective sentence will compromise a non-parole period of six years and three months with a balance of term of one year and nine months. Although the non-parole period will constitute about 78% of the total effective term, I do not consider that any lesser non-parole period is appropriate in the circumstances of this case. The proposed non-parole period represents the minimum period which the Appellant ought spend in custody, having regard to all the elements of punishment, including the objective gravity of the offences, the Appellant's subjective circumstances, rehabilitation and specific and general deterrence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 717 [59]. 

179I propose the following orders: 

(a) appeal against conviction dismissed; 

(b) grant leave to appeal against sentence and allow the sentence appeal in part; 

(c) confirm the sentence imposed for the offence of break, enter and steal on 19 August 2008, being a sentence of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years to commence on 1 September 2008 and to expire on 31 August 2011, with a balance of term of one year to expire on 30 August 2012; 

(d) quash the sentence imposed on the fourth count, the offence of specially aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence on 29 August 2008 and, in its place, sentence the Appellant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of five years and three months commencing on 1 September 2009 and expiring on 30 November 2014 with a balance of term of one year and nine months commencing on 1 December 2014 and expiring on 31 August 2016; 

(e) the earliest date upon which the Appellant will be eligible for release on parole is 30 November 2014. 

180HALL J : I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Johnson J. 

181PRICE J : I agree with Johnson J.

2758377,R v Allen CHING [2011] NSWDC 232,"Sentence

Ex Tempore Remarks on Sentence 

1HIS HONOUR: In this matter Allen Ching appears for sentence. The relevant court file number is 2010/325620. Mr Lloyd QC appears for the offender.

2The offender appears for sentence on five counts and it is appropriate that I read those out with the appropriate maximum penalties.

3The first is that of supply prohibited drug, to wit, 40.8 grams of heroin contrary to s 25 and s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, sometimes referred to as a deemed supply situation. The maximum penalty for that offence is fifteen years imprisonment or 2000 penalty units. The second count, subject to the same provisions, is one of supply prohibited drug, again deemed supply, one of 21 grams of heroin. 

4For the relevant counts on the supply of 40.8 grams of heroin a Form 1 Certificate is appropriate. I have signed that and left it with the court papers. The offender and the officer-in-charge asked me to take into account on Count 1 a Form 1 offence, namely, that at Croydon Park on 30 September 2010 the offender also supplied a prohibited drug, again deemed supply, 9.86 grams of cocaine.

5To the extent that that is a separate drug - and a substantial quantity of a separate drug - I think there is some degree of generosity to the offender in the approach that has been adopted by the DPP, obviously after negotiations with the very competent legal personnel who represent Mr Ching.

6There is a second bracket of offences - the subject of charges which I have loosely referred to as ""firearms charges"" including Count 3 - possess a prohibited firearm. 

7These are all possess prohibited firearm offences brought contrary to subsection 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 for which a fourteen year maximum term of imprisonment is established. Also, significantly, a standard non-parole period has been established by the New South Wales Parliament of three years imprisonment.

8The particulars of the first count involve a Phoenix Arms self-loading pistol, a Franchi pump action shotgun and a Bentley shortened pump action shotgun. Shortened shotguns are a matter where the courts have made comments in other environments, about the reprehensible nature of those guns, in particular the fact that they can be concealed. Balanced against that, in relation to this matter, is that this particular Bentley shortened pump action shotgun was not in working order. 

9What has complicated the sentencing exercise somewhat is that there is also a s 166 Certificate which sets out some ten matters, which I have loosely grouped in accordance with the classifications of drug matters, namely, possess methylamphetamine, possess heroin, possess cocaine, possess cannabis and possess testosterone enanthate, sometimes referred to as steroids.

10In relation to the second bracket of offences, there are a further five matters to be the subject of a sentence under s 166, namely, possess ammunition without holding a licence and three counts of not keeping a firearm safely, then goods in personal custody, which is a different kind of matter.

11The factual matters on which the Crown relies are set out in the memorandum of agreed facts which became exhibit S4. Those provide that the offender and his premises were the subject of a search warrant at Croydon Park on 29 September 2010. Obviously the police had received some material. What is significant and has been relied on by Mr Lloyd QC, was the fact that during the execution of the warrant, the offender not only answered the door and facilitated the police entry but, following a caution, he referred the police to a small amount of cannabis in the garage area where there were found to be a number of illegal drugs in a safe.

12The cocaine was found there along with the methylamphetamine. There were relatively small amounts - or certainly the methylamphetamine was. There was a foil package with Ice and cocaine in another plastic bag. There was white powder in another box or on a poker table in the garage, the sequence numbers of all the charges and in relation to both the counts and the s 166 Certificates are fully set out in the Statement of Facts. 

13I simply indicate these matters for the benefit of those present and also to show some background to this sentence.

14The vegetable matter also found in the garage on an ashtray was again a very minor nature: 1.5 grams of cannabis leaf and eight phials of the steroids in a fridge in a separate area. 

15There was one minor factual issue arising out of the facts which concerns the scales. There were scales found both in the garage and in a bedside set of drawers on the right hand side of the bed where there was also a storage area. Put on behalf of the Crown was that was indicia of a course of conduct. There is no evidence to that effect. It would be a matter of inference as put to the contrary by Mr Lloyd QC that there was nothing else found in the premises consistent with drug dealing and extensive drug involvement. In particular, there was no money. There were no numbers of mobile phones. There were no plastic bags. There were no resealable bags. There was not the same kind of material that one has become depressingly familiar with over the last ten years, being the indicia of detailed involvement in drug supply. 

16Against that factual background Mr Lloyd QC submits that I should infer in favour of the accused on the balance of probabilities that the scales were there for him to check his own supplies or supplies that had been made to him. As I say there is no evidence to the contrary.

17In terms of other factual material before me on these proceedings, the offender has also had tendered on his behalf a very detailed report from Duffy Robilliard, psychologists. It needs to be seen against the history set out in his prior convictions. The concern that I have in that regard is that in 2008 he was dealt with for goods suspected of being stolen, the proceeds of crime. There were cumulative sentences of community service imposed on that. 

18There was a supply of cannabis charge for which he received a seven months suspended sentence, that was for a greater than indictable less than commercial quantity, and a possess prohibited weapon charge, for which he received a fine of seven hundred dollars. I am informed without opposition that that case involved a taser. That needs to be born in mind with reference to some of the other matters which are before me on the s 166 Certificate and the guns themselves. I note that the Court of Criminal Appeal in Ayshow v R [2011] NSWCCA 240 has said, for example, that possession of a taser-like stun device is not a minor example of an offence. This time there is no taser.

19On that view, that offence, at that time in conjunction with the other matters indicates that the offender in my view was dealt with leniently and does not seem to have learnt any lessons as a result of that approach.

20Mr Lloyd QC submits that the sentence itself shows that there was a factual matrix of a minor nature. I do not regard the possession of a taser in any circumstances as a minor matter and, indeed, that is what the Court of Criminal Appeal says. The fact remains that he has a prior conviction for possession of an item of this nature. That only becomes relevant in this situation because of the question of rehabilitation, which has been a strong point of the submissions made by Mr Lloyd QC.

21The offender was not called. I am informed without opposition that no Qutami point was taken - see R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; (2001) 127 A Crim R 369 where the Court of Criminal Appeal said that, even where there is no such point taken, the sentencing judge need still be careful in accepting the hearsay material and particularly exculpatory material advanced by the offender himself without cross-examination.

22I think Mr Lloyd QC, is correct in the circumstances, particularly given the Crown's approach, that there is simply no other evidence before me at the moment. Mr Lloyd QC, relies on that to point to the fact that the material from Duffy Robilliard is consistent with someone who is an addict or someone who is not involved in supply on any wider level. He submits that the offender is someone who is not involved in the criminal milieu other than his involvement with the person who asked him to store the particular weapons and that he did store on his premises. 

23The pre-sentence report makes clear the offender's family situation, both in New Zealand and in Australia, which does give me some concern. 

24The offender is a man of some twenty-five years of age who had a hard working family, who worked in a seven day a week service store in New Zealand. There is some suggestion that the family was involved to an extent in gambling and that they moved to Australia to rid themselves of that association. Be it a matter of reality or not, that was the offender's perception. He was also in a situation in his schooling environment in Christchurch where he mixed, on his own comments, ""with the wrong kind of people"". Unfortunately, when he came to Australia he seemed to again mix with the same, wrong kind of people - although presumably not of the same identity - and he has got himself into this situation.

25The difficulty is in looking to anything in the offender's past which could give me some foundation for confidence in his rehabilitation. What he does have, however, is a set of references from people who are in the back of the Court, including his current partner or fiancée, who is a medical practitioner. She has stood by him throughout this as has her family and associated people within that family structure and environment. They have a religious persuasion which he has adopted - indeed, he has been baptised into the church. One of the members of the extended family is a deacon in the particular church and he has provided a reference. 

26All the character references refer to the offender's behaviour and change, not only at or about the same time of his apprehension but also while he has been incarcerated. As I say I would normally have considerable scepticism about that, even with the benefit of the Chaplin's report from the prison. As Mr Lloyd QC has pointed out - that is all there is.

27Also included in the pre-sentence report are remarks about the offender's behaviour and various aspects of his drug usage. Again those are matters of unsworn evidence but I will take those into account.

28What is important as well to note is that there is a psychologist's diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. That is a diagnosis which is consistent with the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatrists' Association, which is currently available to indicate trauma based on traumatic events, leading to long term problems. It is not for me to again say any kind of diagnosis by a psychologist in that respect because that is what is before me. Nevertheless, I would need from a legal point of view to be satisfied about the psychologist's qualifications to make such a diagnosis. What I have been referred to are two incidents in the past, namely, the situation where the offender was shot and then subsequently was involved not as a participant but apparently as an observer in a robbery. Both those events have had some impact on him as well it might be considered that they might.

29Mr Lloyd QC has relied on the totality of that evidence to submit that the offender here is a person for whom the principles of specific deterrence should not be the subject of the same kind of application as with other offenders. I may not be doing justice to the submissions of Mr Lloyd QC in their entirety in that aspect but I think that is the effect of them.

30The Crown by contrast has submitted that I would take into account principles of general deterrence as being specifically mandated as an obligation on a sentencing judge in the circumstances of offences of the nature of firearms. I have some particular concerns about that.

31This issue is not without difficulty in terms of some of the sentencing principles because, firstly, it is agreed that the offender had pleaded at the earliest possible opportunity. In those circumstances he should receive the full discount as a combined assessment of his preparedness to facilitate the course of justice. Secondly as a recognition, to some extent, of his remorse, which is consistent with what is contained in the pre-sentence report. Thirdly, is an indication of his intention to put these matters well and truly behind him.

32I have during the course of submissions indicated that it is clear that the offender has not provided any assistance to any of the authorities. That is confirmed by Mr Lloyd QC. The offender cannot be the subject of any additional penalty for that failure to provide assistance under the law as it currently stands. Its only relevance is as to his preparedness to abandon people who have led him to this situation. Often the best way of showing that that association has been severed once and for all is by assistance. Nevertheless, that has not happened. But I cannot take that into account against him.

33The pre-sentence report makes it clear that he, Mr Ching, was ""careful not to implicate others"". That is not necessarily to his credit given the value of the drugs involved and the kinds of weapons involved. I think on the factual basis that there is before me all I can do is to say that it is consistent with, on the balance of probabilities, the offender's case that none of these drugs were actively used by him for any actual supply as opposed to deem supply. 

34There is no evidence that the weapons were used by him by virtue of any involvement in any kind of criminal milieu. That of itself makes the case very different from some of the factual material before me and some of the other comparable sentencing authorities. As I say I have some particular concerns about that but on the legal tests which I am required to apply and given the position of the Crown in that regard, I think that that finding is the only one I can make.

35It does seem to me appropriate that there be a finding of special circumstances based on the fact that this offender is aged twenty-five. He is still a relatively young man. He does have some prospects of rehabilitation based on the fact that the extended family, members of which are present here today in court, and his own family have provided a structure.

36His own family have been the family in which he was raised. The current family, of which his partner and fiancee is a member, were part of his life at the time of these offences and his involvement in these criminal activities. He said, and I have reviewed the pre-sentence report on that, that he was desperate to keep his drug usage and associated behaviour from his fiancee, as well he might have. Nevertheless to the extent that he has made a clean breast of it - if he has - then there are some prospects of rehabilitation. I have read the associated reference which has been provided from the real estate company offering him employment on his release from prison. That will be some years off.

37Also relevant to a finding of special circumstances is that this is his first time in custody. He has been there for fifteen months and I think it is relevant as put by his counsel that there has been absolutely no breach of any kind of the Correctional Services disciplinary regime. I previously indicated my awareness that, having visited all the gaols to which he has been sent and been involved in, it is very much to his credit that he has not been involved in any kind of criminal activity nor behavioural problems.

38It does seem appropriate to me that he would benefit from some longer period of time on probation, in particular, to comply with drug testing throughout that period of time. I am sure that if his fiancee - with her own exposure to the medical world - remains with him, she will help to ensure that simply does not happen, otherwise he will be straight back inside.

39My reservations on that subject of rehabilitation are that I see nothing in the offender's past which would give me confidence that he might avoid situations of temptation in the future.

40When I come to make the assessment of the criminality involved, I think Mr Lloyd QC is correct in saying that the firearms offences are the more serious of the two classifications of offences. 

41These items were in a storage compartment. They were hidden. There is no evidence that he was going to use them nor indeed that they were there for other than the storage purposes he has submitted as part of his evidence.

42Nevertheless, the three items the subject of the s 7(1) matters on the indictment involve separate weapons in separate circumstances. It is proper and, as I understand it, consistent with the authorities, that those separate weapons be the subject of a separate degree of partial accumulation in relation to the sentence.

43The two supply charges or deem supply charges relate to the same commodity, one of 40.8 grams of heroin and the other one of 21 grams of heroin. Put on the offender's behalf is that they were of a purity level which was quite small, being 12% in relation to the 40 grams and 18% in relation to the 21 grams. Nevertheless, that represents a sizeable amount of pure drug which would be capable of being cut and placed on the streets with considerable profit value. 

44There is some generosity to the offender in the fact that the matter on the Form 1 was placed as it was but I take that into account in the sentence to be imposed on the matter the subject of count 1. The cocaine, which is the subject of the Form 1 count, was also found in the same area. 

45I think Mr Lloyd QC is correct when he said that the placement of the other items and the amounts involved which are the subject of the s 166 charge are consistent with his explanation. Indeed, I would imagine that is the case because that is precisely why the Crown or whoever it was has placed those matters on a s 166 Certificate. They are certainly consistent with his own use. It must be said however that methylamphetamine is a particularly pernicious drug. It needs to be reinforced to the offender by the imposition of a greater sentence in relation to it, compared to the other relatively small amounts.

46I also take the same view about the testosterone being the subject of a separate and additional penalty, albeit of a minor nature. That is a separate kind of drug and is normally used by people in a different kind of milieu from that in which the offender has operated.

47In terms of my assessment of criminality there is nothing to establish that he had used those large amounts or intended to use them. They are separate amounts and in my view the appropriate finding of criminality, bearing in mind the Form 1 matter, is that it is above low range but not just below mid range as the Crown has submitted. In my view it is right in the middle between low range and mid range. I say that by reference to the amounts involved, the purity involved in terms of the drugs, the kinds of weapons involved and their placement in terms of the firearms offences.

48As I understand it I am required to make that finding in these circumstances notwithstanding the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. Sentencing judges at my level of the judiciary are required to take into account, as I do, the standard non parole period as being a full guidepost of the legislature's attitude to the seriousness of these particular matters. That, in addition to the maximum penalty, is one other factor which I need to take into account as I do in this particular instance. For that purpose I take into account those matters and relevant decisions in Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357; [2005] HCA 25 and Muldrock v R. 

49I then come to this issue of the degree of accumulation and concurrence which is necessary. The relevant principles in that regard were stated by Justice Howie in the decision of Cahyadi v R [2007] NSW CCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 as follows:

""In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.""


Concurrence

50It does seem to me that bearing mind the matters that I had outlined, there should be a total concurrence of the sentence in relation to count 2 compared to count 1. Count 1 has the Form 1 matter to be taken into account. There should be a partial accumulation of the order of six months between the sentences on the firearms matters. There should also be a partial accumulation between the firearms matters and the drug matters bearing in mind that there is a degree of difference in the criminality involved and the kind of offences that they are.

51I would also indicate that I will impose separate sentences on the 166 matters of the orders that I have referred to earlier. I will go off to consider those and the commencement date for the relevant sentence and each of them. In that regard the offender has been in gaol since 30 September 2010 and it is agreed and it is appropriate that his sentence should commence from that date.


Comparable Authorities

52I will add to those comments that I made earlier the relevant comparable authorities which are set out in the Public Defenders' website which would include decisions relevantly from the period after 2000, although there are substantial differences in the facts and the relevant personal circumstances of the offender.

53The other authorities that I should include in those reasons relate to the issue about the accumulation or partial accumulation of these particular sentences. What I need to do in accordance with the decision of Rickaby v R [2007] NSW CCA 288 [17]-[20], is to look at the features common to the offences and of each offence alone and to see whether they were committed in the one course of conduct. That follows from the decision of R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 180 A Crim R 66, namely, that simply because there are common features does not mean that it is the one course of conduct, nor indeed that there is commonality simply by virtue of the same kind of matters being involved. 

54Here, as I have said, there are different kinds of criminality involved in the respective firearms and drug offences and within each of the categories. While there is commonality in the drug matters, in large measure being the same kind of commodity and the same relative purity levels, there are differences in the weapons involved.

55I am also required to give great weight to questions of totality - given the offender's age and the other personal matters that I have set out - to ensure that the overall sentencing does not exceed the total criminality. It must be sufficient to reflect the total criminality involved as was said in R v Cicekdag [2004] NSWCCA 357; (2004) 150 A Crim R 299.

56Mr Ching, if you could just stand up I will impose that sentence now. The overall effect of the sentence will be a non parole period, that means the time actually in gaol, do you understand that?

57OFFENDER: Yes.

58HIS HONOUR: Will be one of four years, commencing on 30 September 2010 and expiring on 29 September 2014. Do you understand that?

59OFFENDER: Yes.

60HIS HONOUR: Secondly, that there will be a head sentence of six years commencing on 30 September 2010 and expiring on 29 September 2016. Do you understand that? Effectively, that means you will be on parole for two years and the recommendations for parole, given that it is a period longer than three years, would be for you to be of good behaviour and to participate in such drug testing as may be required. That is a recommendation that will ultimately be for the Parole Board.

61The actual sentences, and I will give counsel a copy of these now so that you can follow that. I will just simply note this; the other two pages are the relevant ones. I note that these sentences are intended to reflect my findings of special circumstances on the overall sentence such that the non-parole period will be two-thirds of the head sentence. 

62I also note that the statutory ratio has been varied on the individual counts. Counts 1, 4, 5 and 6 such that it is significantly less than two-thirds, that is intended to reflect the number of charges, issues of accumulation and to achieve the statutory ratio of two-thirds on the overall sentence.

63In terms of count 1 there is a non parole period of two years and six months, commencing on 30 September 2010 and 29 March 2013, a head sentence of five years commencing on 30 September 2010 and 29 September 2015.

64On count 2 a fixed term of one year and six months imprisonment to commence on 30 September 2010 and 29 March 2012, wholly concurrent with count 1.

65On count 3, taken into account on the Form 1 as part of the sentence imposed on count 1.

66On count 4, the commencement date will be six months from the commencement date of counts 1 and 2 being a non parole period of two years, commencing on 30 March 2011 expiring on 29 March 2013; a head sentence of four years and ten months commencing on 30 March 2011 and expiring on 29 January 2016.

67On count 5, the commencement date four months from the commencement date of count 4. A non parole period of two years, 30 July 2011 and expiring on 29 July 2013. A head sentence of four years and ten months commencing on 30 July 2011 and 29 May 2016.

68On count 6 the commencement date four months from the commencement date of count 5, a non parole period of two years, 30 November 2011 and 29 November 2013 with a head sentence of four years and ten months commencing on 30 November 2011 and expiring on 29 September 2016.

69All the sentences in relation to counts 7 through to count 16 are subject to a fixed term of one month with the dates as specified in the Schedule given to the parties.

70In accordance with the Crown submission I will dismiss the two back-up charges, being the possess prohibited drug, heroin, and possess prohibited drug, cocaine, being numbers 1650/20/6 and 1650/20/17.

2758386,Dionys v R [2011] NSWCCA 272,"Judgment 
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL : I agree with Hoeben J. 
2ADAMS J: 
Introduction 
I agree with the judgment of Hoeben J and with his Honour's proposed orders. I wish to add a comment about an important aspect of this appeal. In respect of the possession charge, the applicant asked for 179 charges to be taken into account on a Form 1. The way in which this is to be done was explained in A ttorney General's application under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146; 137 A Crim R 180. The fundamental point which is presently significant is the difference between sentencing for an offence with which the offender is charged before the court and offences noted on the Form !. This may be simply expressed: in no sense at all is the offender sentenced for the Form 1 offences. 

3That this is so appears unambiguously from the passages in the judgment of Spigelman CJ 9with whom Wood CJ at CL, Grove, Sully and James JJ agreed) which are set out below. They deal with what his Honour described as ""a divergence of approaches"" within the Court. He referred (at [26]) to what he described as the ""top down"" approach, by which (subject to s33(3) of the Act) ""the sentence should not be less than it would have been if the Form 1 offences had been included on the indictment"", observing, however, that this had been rejected by this Court in R v Kay [2002] NSWCCA 286. His Honour then went on - 

[27] A different formulation is found in R v Bavadra (2000) 115 A Crim R 152 where Wood CJ at CL, with whom Beazley JA and Greg James J agreed, said at [31]: 
""... the sentencing judge is placed in a position where it is possible to sentence the offender for the totality of his or her outstanding criminality"". 

[28] Subsequent cases have also referred to ""total criminality"" or ""overall criminality""... 

29 I do not understand Wood CJ at CL's reference in Bavadra to the ""totality of criminality"" to suggest that a sentencing judge should determine sentences for all the offences before the judge, whether on the indictment or on the Form 1. I understand his Honour to have intended no more than the proposition ...that a sentencing judge ""should give due recognition to the gravity of those offences"". If, contrary to my understanding, the reference in Bavadra was intended to suggest that a sentencing judge was imposing punishment for the Form 1 offences, I would respectfully disagree that this is permissible under the statute. The focus, as I will show below, must be on ""the principal offence"" alone. 

4The Chief Justice discussed several formulations of the applicable principle, and then moved to a resolution of the issues, commencing with a reference to the terms of the statutory power, pointing out - 

[35] ...The statutory scheme, like its common law predecessor, emphasises that the court is concerned and concerned only with imposing a sentence for ""the principal offence""... 

5After mentioning the statutory provisions dealing with the effect of taking an offence into account and the approach for which the Attorney General contended, his Honour said - 

[39] The sentencing court is sentencing only for the ""principal offence"". It is no part of the task of the sentencing court to determine appropriate sentences for offences listed on a Form 1 or to determine the overall sentence that would be appropriate for all the offences and then apply a ""discount"" for the use of the procedure. This is not sentencing for the principal offence. [Emphasis in original.] 

[40] In my opinion, it is pertinent to identify the elements to be considered in determining the sentence for the primary offence upon which the commission of other offences, for which no conviction is being recorded, may impinge. The case law has identified a number of distinct and sometimes overlapping purposes to be served by sentencing. In my opinion, not all these purposes are relevant to the process of taking other offences into account, when sentencing for a particular offence, i.e. the primary offence. 

[42] The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. [This last sentence appears in 56 NSWLR as a correction for the original in the electronic and 137 A Crim R which is in the obviously mistaken form: 'The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences which there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed'.] These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another. 

[43] I did not intend these observations to be exhaustive of the elements upon which the fact of other offences may impinge. However, no additional elements for which that could be so have been identified in submissions to this Court. The important point is that the focus throughout must be on sentencing for the primary offence. 

[44] The manner and degree to which the Form 1 offences can impinge upon elements relevant to sentencing for the principal offence will depend on a range of other factors pertinent to those elements and the weight to be given to them in the overall sentencing task. For that reason it will rarely be appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the effect on the sentence of taking into account Form 1 offences... 

[45] The suggestion in the Attorney's proposed guideline that the increase in penalty should normally be specified may have been appropriate if the Attorney's basic approach were to be adopted, i.e. that in some senses sentences were being imposed for the Form 1 offences. Once that approach is rejected, specification of quantum is inappropriate. [Emphasis in original.] 

6Under the heading The use of the procedure the Chief Justice referred to the considerations that should influence the determination by the Director of Public Prosecutions to place certain charges on the indictment and others on the Form 1 and then to the exercise of the relevant discretion by the sentencing judge, explaining the latter as follows - 

[67] By reason of the express statutory power, a sentencing judge must assess whether it is appropriate to proceed to sentence on a basis where no separate penalty is to be imposed for admitted offences. There will be cases in which, for example, the administration of justice could be brought into disrepute by the court proceeding to sentence a person guilty of a course of criminal conduct on a manifestly inadequate, unduly narrow or artificial basis. I do not intend the previous sentence to constitute a comprehensive statement of the circumstances in which the broad discretion vested in the sentencing judge by s33(1)(b) can be exercised. Nevertheless, the role of the Court must be constrained, to ensure that the independence of the judicial office in an adversary system is protected... 

[68] Striking the appropriate balance between overloading an indictment and ensuring that the indictment - leading to conviction and to sentence for, and only for, matters on the indictment - adequately reflects the totality of the admitted criminality, is primarily a matter for the Crown. The decision of the Crown in this regard will, no doubt, be guided by the determination in this case that, when matters are 'taken into account' on a Form 1, the sentencing judge does not, in any sense, impose sentences for those offences. 

7The notion conveyed by the expression in [42] concerning the right of the community ""to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed"" is not, with great respect altogether clear. I understand it as a reference to the need to see the particular offence charged within a context of other criminality so that the particular offence is not treated as an isolated criminal act but, where appropriate, should be seen (and punished) as part of larger scale criminality. Be this as it may, there is no justification, in my respectful view, for qualifying the essential fundamental principle articulated by the Chief Justice, that the offender is being punished only for the crime charged in the indictment. 

8Counsel for the Crown in this appeal relied on R v Grube [2005] NSWCCA 140, as I understand it, in support of the contention that it was appropriate to accumulate the sentence on the possession charge with that imposed for the sale charge even though the weapons in both charges were the same, because of the large number of weapons which were the subject of the Form 1 offences. 

9In Grube the appellant submitted that, where an offence, considered by itself could attract a sentence in a posited range, Form 1 offences might justify a sentence at the top of that range but no further. Hall J (Grove and Howie JJ agreeing) in the course of rejecting this submission, said - 

[36] Many of the 42 offences on the Form 1 involved invasions of residential premises and property stolen was of considerable value. When the court is required to take into account a multiplicity of serious offences, as in this case, it is required to allow for the total criminality revealed by the whole course of the offender's conduct as appropriately reflected in the sentence. If there was, as argued in the present application, a requirement to apply a proportionality or relativity concept, then in some circumstances, including those that arise in the present matter, there would be a risk of the imposition of a penalty that did not adequately reflect the total criminality. The seriousness of such an outcome is apparent for it would potentially, if not actually, tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute in certain cases by mandating a process or approach that produced a manifestly inadequate sentence determined on an unduly narrow or artificial basis. 

37 The number and magnitude of the offences in the Form 1 in the present matter, in my opinion, justified the sentence imposed ... which increased the sentence that was appropriate for the principal offence to reflect the total criminality that took place over a considerable period of time arising from so many offences committed over a widespread geographical area in Sydney and beyond. [The judge] was required to have regard to the elements of personal deterrence and retribution in relation to the Form 1 offences and I believe he did so without any double counting as asserted by the applicant. [Emphasis added.] 

10If the italicised phrase is taken to suggest that, in punishing for the substantive charges, the court can punish additionally for the Form 1 charges, in my respectful opinion it is inconsistent with the principle for which AG's Reference No 1 of 2002 stands. The ""total criminality revealed by the offender's conduct"" of course includes all the offences including those on the Form 1. It was necessary, as Hall J explained, for the primary judge to have regard to the ""elements of personal deterrence and retribution in relation to the Form 1 offences "". In my respectful opinion, it is simply not open to punish for the criminality involved in the Form 1 offences, nor to increase the sentence otherwise necessary in respect of the substantive offence to deter the offender from committing offences such as the substantive offence nor to exact retribution for the Form 1 offences. The Form 1 offences inform both the objective nature of the criminality involved in the substantive offence and the subjective features such as remorse and the prospects for rehabilitation and may therefore justify or even require a heavier penalty than would have been imposed had that offence stood alone. But, with respect, that sentence cannot in any sense exact retribution, that is to say, punish, for the Form 1 offences 

11Subject to these comments, I respectfully agree with Hoeben J's approach to the mode by which the Form 1 offences should be taken into account in the present case. 

12HOEBEN J : 
Offences and sentence 
On 16 June 2010 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court at Wollongong to the following counts: 

Count 1 - On or between 18 June and 5 August 2009 at Wollongong in the State of New South Wales did contravene s51 of the Firearms Act on five separate occasions, namely on 18 June sold two C96 Mauser pistols to a police undercover operative; on 21 June sold a C96 Mauser pistol to a police undercover operative; on 25 June sold a C96 Mauser pistol to a police undercover operative; and on 5 August sold a Bren machine gun to a police undercover operative; the said purchasers being unauthorised to possess the said firearms by licence or permit (s51B(1) of the Firearms Act 1996); and 

Count 2 - On or between 18 June and 5 August 2009 at Wollongong in the State of New South Wales possessed five firearms, one of which was a prohibited firearm, the firearms not being registered and he not being authorised by licence or permit to possess the firearms (s51D(2) of the Firearms Act 1996). 

13The maximum sentence for each offence was imprisonment for 20 years. Each offence had a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

14The applicant was sentenced in the District Court of New South Wales at Wollongong by Delaney DCJ on 2 December 2010 as follows: 

Count 1 - A term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months commencing 26 August 2009 and expiring 25 February 2015 with a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months expiring 25 August 2018. 

Count 2 - A term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months commencing 26 August 2012 and expiring 25 February 2020 with a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months expiring 25 August 2024. 

15The total sentence was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months. When sentencing, his Honour took into account in respect of count 2, 179 matters on a Form 1. Of those 179 matters, 89 related to the possession of unregistered firearms. The other offences on the Form 1 concerned matters associated with the possession of such weapons. 

Factual background 

16The applicant came under notice of the police when Strike Force Bowl was set up in May 2009 to investigate the illegal supply of firearms in the Wollongong area. During May, June and July of 2009 the applicant was identified as a ""prominent figure"" in the mid level supply of firearms. During the period 16-17 June 2009 police undercover operatives had telephone calls with co-offenders Kafizas and Zarakas and purchased firearms from them. 

17On 18 June 2009 an undercover operative attended a restaurant known as ""Pacinos Restaurant"" at Corrimal pursuant to an arrangement made by Kafizas. Kafizas and Zarakas were inside. The undercover operative spoke to them and then left and a short time later returned and saw Zarakas had a Hahn Light cooler bag at his feet. Zarakas picked up the bag and unzipped it and inside were two C96 Mauser pistols and a clear resealable bag containing 59 rounds of ammunition. The undercover operative handed over $8,500 in pre-recorded money to Zarakas, picked up the cooler bag, left the restaurant and took it to his car. He then went back into the kitchen area of the restaurant and spoke to Kafizas and handed him $300. 

18On 21 June 2009 police legally monitored a telephone conversation between Zarakas and the applicant. During this conversation the applicant said ""You remember the last set of mags I gave you, do you think they want another set of the same?"" Zarakas said ""Yeah"". The applicant said ""I'm getting another set the same"". Zarakas said ""Yeah, no worries right now these automotive products from overseas, they're actually going ahead with anything that comes forward because they're all going away in a month, so anything that comes forward"". This conversation was in reference to the two C96 Mauser pistols that the applicant supplied to Zarakas which he further on-sold on 18 June for $8,500. They made arrangements to meet a local cafe to discuss the supply further. After meeting with the applicant, Zarakas contacted Kafizas and they discussed supplying the 7.63 Mauser pistol that the applicant had on offer. In a telephone call on the morning of 22 June 2009 Zarakas said to the applicant ""Can you put petrol in a car for me?"" The applicant replied ""Yeah it's already there, it's been filled up"". 

19Pursuant to arrangements made with Kafizas, on 25 June 2009 the undercover operative drove to the Oxford Tavern, parked his car and walked to the Grinding On Demand Cafe where he met Kafizas and Zarakas. They walked back to the undercover officer's vehicle and Zarakas opened the rear passenger door, placed a plastic bag inside and opened it to show the undercover officer a 7.63 Mauser pistol and a yellow box containing 50 cartridges for it. The undercover officer gave Zarakas $4,250 and the latter placed the money in his pocket and left. Kafizas then approached the undercover officer and was handed $600. 

20In a call during the evening of 2 August 2009 the applicant and Zarakas agreed to meet in Cringila. At 9.38pm a call was recorded between Zarakas and Kafizas about a meeting. In a call the next day with his mother, Zarakas referred in code to a firearm stored in his room and believed to have been provided to him by the applicant the previous evening. 

21On 5 August the undercover officer attended Pacinos Restaurant, Corrimal pursuant to an arrangement made with Kafizas and met him in the car-park area. Kafizas told him that ""it"" was ""in a blanket"" and that he would put it in the car. Kafizas went to the rear of the restaurant and collected a Bren light machine gun that was wrapped in a yellow, orange coloured blanket contained in a long black bag. He placed the Bren in the rear passenger seat of the undercover officer's car and gave the officer a box of ammunition for the Bren. The undercover officer gave Kafizas $17,000. A short time later Zarakas arrived and met Kafizas and the undercover officer and took the yellow, orange coloured blanket that was wrapped around the Bren and returned to his BMW with it. After that Zarakas drove from the restaurant to the French Quarter Cafe in Mount Ousley where he met the applicant (as observed by police). 

22At 7.25pm on 5 August 2009 on Springhill Road, Port Kembla police stopped the applicant. He had $11,000 of the $17,000 paid over by the undercover operative to Kafizas for the Bren and ammunition two hours earlier. 

23On 6 August 2009 the applicant attended Wollongong Police Station and declared that the money had been given to him following the sale of a car. This was clearly untrue. 

24On 26 August 2009 the applicant took part in a recorded interview with police. During the interview ""he made reference to a storage facility that he had in the Padstow area. (The applicant) informed investigators that contained within this storage facility was further ammunition that he was not licensed to possess"". 

25The police obtained a search warrant for the Renta Space Storage container at 57 Davies Road, Padstow and on execution of the warrant collected a large arsenal of firearms, firearm parts, ammunition and police issue ballistic vests. The lessee of the container was the applicant. Police itemised these firearms and noted that there were 89 unregistered firearms, numerous of them being prohibited and high powered and some having their serial numbers defaced. Police believe that the applicant was using this arsenal of firearms for the purpose of supply. Items such as firearms and ammunition located within the container were identical to those supplied to the undercover officer on 18 June and 25 June 2009. 

26In relation to some of the items on the Form 1, his Honour said: 

""Some of the items that were the subject of these additional charges should be mentioned. Number 14, possess unregistered pistol, Astra 900 semi-automatic pistol. Number 15, possess unauthorised pistol, Astra 900 semi-automatic pistol. Number 16, possess unregistered firearm, Bentley 12 gauge shotgun. Number 20, possess unregistered pistol, Beretta semi-automatic 8000 Cougar pistol. Number 24, Mustang semi-automatic pistol. Number 26, possess firearm with defaced ID. Number 29, BSA a semi-automatic rifle. Number 35, Carl Gustav, M96 bolt action rifle. 41, Charter Arms AR7 semi-automatic rifle. 46, Remington No 4 pocket revolver. 56, possess unregistered pistol, PO8-L semi-automatic pistol. 59, Ruger MK2 semi-automatic pistol. There were in addition a number of shotguns and semi-automatic rifles. At number 80, an M1 Carbine semi-automatic rifle. These were just some of the items that were catalogued as a part of the items on the Form 1 schedule."" (ROS 9.5) 

Remarks on sentence 

27The applicant did not give oral evidence on sentence. Two affidavits sworn by him were read without objection and he was not required for cross-examination. A report by Mr Watson-Munro, forensic psychologist dated 22 November 2010, a character reference and a copy of the applicant's Justice Health file were tendered. 

28At the outset it should be noted that the sentence hearing proceeded on a false basis. Counsel for the applicant advised his Honour that the weapons, the subject of count 2, were not the weapons which were the subject of count 1. He told his Honour that the weapons in count 2 were weapons which had been randomly nominated from those discovered at the storage container. This was an error in that the same five weapons were the subject of both the supply count (count 1) and the possess count (count 2). The true situation was never communicated to his Honour. 

29His Honour recorded the applicant's subjective case as follows. He was born in Greece in 1951. He immigrated to Australia when he was aged seven. After leaving school, he worked for a number of employers mainly in the sales area. Up until 1990 he was working in the real estate industry. 

30In the early 1990's he became involved in importing kit homes from South East Asia into Australia. This involved him spending considerable amounts of time in Indonesia. The applicant was married in 1975, but the marriage broke up in 1990. 

31The applicant was involved in two motor vehicle accidents, when aged 13 and when aged 38. He was injured in both these accidents and the psychologist's report stated that he was suffering from PTSD as a result. His Honour was prepared to accept that before the events for which the applicant was arrested, he had both physical and psychological problems arising from those car accidents. However, his Honour was unable to find any connection between those conditions and the offences. 

32His Honour noted that the applicant had suffered from diabetes for 10 years and that in May 2009 he was diagnosed with severe diabetic retinopathy. This had caused a reduction in his vision. A persistent problem which had become worse was his diabetic macula oedema. 

33His Honour summarised the applicant's eye problems as follows: 

""Mr Downie said that the offender has decreased vision in both eyes due to this severe diabetic retinopathy mainly as a result of severe diabetic maculopathy. He said that the severity was such that visual prognosis was guarded and that the incarceration, he having been in custody since 26 August 2009, had led to sub-optimal follow up and treatment of this condition which contributed to his deterioration."" (ROS 14.8) 

34His Honour found that the plea of guilty had been entered at an early point in time so that the appellant was entitled to a discount of 25 percent. 

35His Honour rejected the applicant's assertions to the Probation and Parole Service and in his affidavits, that he was merely a collector and did not expect the weapons to be used when he sold them. His Honour said: 

""In my opinion what he did was to sell to whoever had the money to buy irrespective of the direction in which those guns were being sent. He did not know who it was going to go to, he did not know who was going to receive them. All he knew was what money he was going to receive from the sale. 

In my opinion taking into account the number of firearms involved, the type of firearms involved, the amount that was paid for these firearms, the fact that they were in working order, the fact that there was ammunition available for them, the fact that they were readily available at almost a moment's notice at the request of the undercover operator indicates that these offences of both selling and possessing were at a very high level of objective seriousness."" (ROS 12.5) 

36His Honour assessed the supply count at slightly above the middle range of objective seriousness so that having regard to the maximum sentence and before allowing any discount, the start point for that sentence would be 12 years imprisonment. In relation to the possession count, with the 179 matters on the Form 1, his Honour assessed that offence at ""well above mid-range of objective seriousness"" and set the starting point for the sentence before discount at 16 years. 

37In relation to relevant considerations when passing sentence, his Honour said: 

""I now turn to the way in which the courts approach the sentencing exercise after the degree of objective seriousness is determined. 

Firstly because this is a sentence after a plea of guilty, technically the standard non-parole period does not apply. Where those offences, which have a standard non-parole period, are contained in the Form 1 schedule, the standard non-parole period is not to be considered. The court is to give reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period either by increasing the sentence beyond the standard non-parole period or giving a lesser sentence. In determining those issues the court is to take into account a wide range of matters having first determined what term of imprisonment is appropriate having regard to the offence and looking at the maximum penalty and keeping the standard non-parole period as a guideline or reference point. The court now looks at the subjective case of the offender to determine whether or not the standard non-parole period should be imposed."" (ROS 13.6) 

38In relation to those subjective features, his Honour said: 

""On the question of rehabilitation it was submitted that there were strong prospects of rehabilitation and that the offender was unlikely to offend and that he had strong family support. I find that it is unlikely that he will offend again after the sentence that is going to be imposed upon him. I also note that he has strong family support. So far as his age is concerned this is not a matter of relevance in the sentencing process, however I note that the problems that he has with his eye sight may require additional assistance during the course of time that he is in custody. It was submitted that special circumstances should be found and for reasons which I will articulate shortly, I propose to do so."" (ROS 15.7) 

His Honour found that the applicant had expressed some measure of remorse and contrition. 

39In relation to the application of the standard non-parole period, his Honour said: 

""I consider that there are reasons to depart from the standard non-parole period in each case. Those reasons are one, that this is a plea and not a sentence after trial. Secondly, that the sentences are very significant. I have taken into account the age and medical condition of the offender and as a result I propose to vary the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period pursuant to s44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to take into account a finding of special circumstances in respect of each case."" (ROS 17.3) 

40His Honour took into account the principle of totality and that the sentences were to be partially accumulated. His Honour noted that specific and general deterrence were relevant, but general deterrence most of all. 

Appeal 

41The applicant relied upon the following grounds of appeal. 

(1) The learned sentencing judge erred in sentencing the applicant with respect to Count 2 (i.e. the possession charge) in that: 
(a) His Honour sentenced the applicant on the incorrect facts. 
(b) The sentence imposed for Count 2 ought to have been made wholly concurrent with the sentence imposed for Count 1. 

(2) (This ground of appeal was not pursued.) 

(3) The learned sentencing judge erred in sentencing the applicant in that the individual sentences imposed for Counts 1 and 2 respectively were otherwise manifestly excessive. 

(4) His Honour erred in his approach to sentencing pursuant to the standard non-parole period legislation. His Honour erred by engaging in a two step process (ROS 13.8). His Honour further erred by considering whether or not the standard non-parole period should be imposed. (ROS 14.1) 

Ground of Appeal 1 

42The Crown accepted that there had been a significant factual error and that as a result, Ground of Appeal 1(a) had been made out. I should stress, however, that it was not due to any fault on the part of his Honour that this error occurred. It follows that the applicant will have to be re-sentenced in relation to count 2. 

43The issue raised in Ground of Appeal 1(b) really relates to the re-sentencing process and is best dealt with there. 

Ground of Appeal 3 

44The applicant submitted that his Honour did not have due regard to the positive aspects of his subjective case, i.e. his limited criminal history, his early plea, his good work history, his health issues and that he was unlikely to re-offend. The applicant also submitted that the sentences imposed were significantly higher than sentences reflected in the available sentencing statistics. 

45As senior counsel for the applicant appreciated, the sentencing statistics in relation to sections 51B and 51D of the Firearms Act 1996 were of very limited value in that there was only a small number of cases which had been decided. 

46On that issue, the observations of the Court in Yammine v R [2010] NSWCCA 123 are pertinent. That was an appeal against a sentence imposed for an offence under s51D(2). There the Court said: 

""49 Reference was made to sentences in other cases decided under s 51D(2). Five such cases were cited. One was a crown appeal and I shall not refer to it again. The others are R v Middlebrook [2004] NSWCCA 49, R v Gardiner [2006] NSWCCA 190, R v Brown [2006] NSWCCA 249 and R v Mack. The head sentences after appeal were respectively 2 years, 5 years, 8 years and 6 years. 

50 The submission was that only Brown has produced a longer head sentence than the present case, yet the facts of that case were far worse than those of the present case. The applicant was the warehouser of a large number of prohibited weapons which he was buying and selling to criminals. He was using profits to repay drug debts. He had a very serious criminal history. 

51 The Court has pointed on a number of occasions to the difficulty of demonstrating error by reference to the facts and sentences in unrelated cases. In R v George (2004) 149 A Crim R 38 at [48] this Court, constituted by Wood CJ at CL, Adams and Kirby JJ said - 

""We are unable to gain any meaningful assistance from a reference to these cases. It is unnecessary to restate that the practice, which appears to have developed in recent times, of approaching sentence appeals by a search for, and comparison with, sentences passed in other cases, is neither helpful nor justified by authority: see R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368; R v Salameh (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, Hunt CJ at CL, McInerney and Blanch JJ, No 60728 of 1993, 9 June 1994) and R v Trevenna [2004] NSWCCA 43 at [98]-[101] per Barr J. At the most, other cases can do no more than become part of a range for sentencing ..."" 

52 It appears that so few cases have been decided under s 51D(2) that no range of sentencing discretion is discernible. In my opinion error is not demonstrated by reference to those cases."" 

47While the sentences passed by his Honour were heavy, the objective seriousness of these offences was great. Not only was there a possession and sale of the five weapons identified in the charges, one of which was a light machine gun, but 89 other weapons, some of them semi-automatic, were included in the Form 1 schedule. The seriousness of such offences was described by Spigelman CJ in R v Brown [2006] NSWCCA 249 at [21]-[24] as follows: 

""21 When s51D was introduced by the Firearms Amendment (Public Safety) Act 2002, the Minister said: 

""Firearm related crime is a major concern for both police and the community."" 

22 The offence, in a series of offences relating to firearms in the Firearms Act 1996, is directed to persons who are engaged in the warehousing of firearms for sale. A person so engaged plays a critical role in the perpetration by other criminals of the worst crimes of violence in this community. The maximum sentence reflects the important role that such conduct plays in the injuries inflicted upon members of the community by deadly weapons. 

23 On the facts of the present case the Applicant clearly intended to sell the firearms to criminals for profit. He had in his possession, for that purpose, an automatic self-loading rifle, which he called a ""machine gun"" and which was clearly capable of inflicting serious injury and also some compact ""keyring"" firearms, which were particularly dangerous by reason of their capacity for concealment. 

24 This was a serious example of the offence under s51D."" 

48His Honour expressed similar concerns as to the seriousness of these offences. By reference to the sheer volume of weapons involved, the objective seriousness of the offences being considered by his Honour was much greater than that which was being considered in Brown . A particularly serious feature of these offences was that the applicant's motivation was monetary gain. Even allowing for the applicant's subjective features as his Honour did, the objective seriousness of these offences, general deterrence and denunciation required condign punishment. 

49This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

Ground of Appeal 4 

50His Honour sentenced the applicant before the recent decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39, (2011) 85 ALJR 1170 in which the High Court held that R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 had been wrongly decided. When attempting to apply the law as it had been stated in Way , his Honour said that the standard non-parole period remained as a guide even though the applicant had pleaded guilty and made a finding as to the objective seriousness of the offences by reference to the ""mid range of seriousness for offences of this kind"". 

51Given the applicant's success in relation to Ground of Appeal 1(a) and the need to re-sentence, the present application is not a suitable vehicle for a close examination of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock. 

52What is clear from Muldrock is that a sentencing court is not to engage in a two-step process. His Honour clearly did that on this occasion. His Honour looked at the objective seriousness of the offences and made an assessment of that basis alone and then took into account the applicant's subjective features. In Muldrock the court reiterated the point made by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 537 that all the relevant factors must be identified, both subjective and objective, and then the sentence is set. 

53It follows that this ground of appeal has been made out and the applicant has to be re-sentenced in respect of counts 1 and 2. 

Re-sentencing of applicant 

54The applicant submitted that because the weapons in count 1 were the same as those in count 2, there was a clear correlation between the two offences. Possession of the weapons was a necessary precondition to the supply of those weapons. The period of time in the indictment over which the offences had occurred was also identical. In those circumstances, the applicant submitted the sentence imposed for count 2 should be wholly concurrent with that imposed for count 1. 

55The applicant did not submit that the overlap between the two counts was such that he was being charged twice for the same offence so that the principle of double jeopardy applied. He accepted that the elements to be established in each count were different. Rather, he submitted that the overlap between the counts was such that by accumulating the sentences he was in fact being doubly punished. 

56In that regard he relied upon Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57, (1998) 194 CLR 610 where McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said: 

""40 To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common. No doubt that general principle must yield to any contrary legislative intention, but the punishment to be exacted should reflect what an offender has done; it should not be affected by the way in which the boundaries of particular offences are drawn. Often those boundaries will be drawn in a way that means that offences overlap. To punish an offender twice if conduct falls in that area of overlap would be to punish offenders according to the accidents of legislative history, rather than according to their just deserts."" 

57The applicant submitted that there was nothing in Attorney General's Application under section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 (the guideline judgment) to the contrary. In that regard the applicant relied upon what Spigelman CJ said at [29]: 

""29 I do not understand Wood CJ at CL's reference in R v Bavadra to ""totality of criminality"" to suggest that a sentencing judge should determine sentences for all the offences before the judge, whether on the indictment or on the Form 1. I understand his Honour to have intended no more than the proposition for which Simpson J referred to R v Bavadra as authority in R v Harris (2001) 125 A Crim R 27 at 31 [23] that a sentencing judge ""... should give due recognition to the gravity of those offences."" If, contrary to my understanding, the reference in R v Bavadra was intended to suggest that a sentencing judge was imposing punishment for the Form 1 offences, I would respectfully disagree that this is permissible under the statute. The focus, as I will show below, must be on ""the principal offence"" alone."" 

58The applicant submitted that even if the common elements in the two counts were not as great as he submitted, the effect of the Form 1 matters should not be such as to so substantially increase the sentence for the principal offence so that it was out of all proportion to that offence. He submitted that not only was the sentence for count 2 significantly larger than that for count 1, when the criminality was no greater, but the severity was increased by the 3 year accumulation. He submitted that this was contrary to the guideline judgment, which stated authoritatively: 
A sentencing court is sentencing only for the ""principal offence"" [39]; 
The important point is that the focus throughout must be on the sentence for the primary offence [43]; 
A sentencing judge is not imposing punishment for Form 1 offences [29]. 

59In re-sentencing the Court was asked to have regard to entries in the Justice Health records relating to the applicant since his imprisonment, which indicated some further deterioration in his eyesight. This was a matter which his Honour took into account when imposing the sentence. What is recorded in the Justice Health notes goes no further than that which was predicted by the applicant's treating specialist and was before his Honour. Accordingly, this is not a matter which should affect the re-sentencing exercise. 

60Apart from the effect of the decision in Muldrock , the need to re-sentence has been brought about by serious mismanagement by the Crown in the formulation of count 2. It would have been an easy matter to choose from the 89 other weapons found in the storage container a selection to provide the basis for count 2. For reasons which remain unexplained, that was not done and the Court is faced with the difficulties set out above. 

61An examination of the elements and facts of the two counts to which the applicant pleaded, shows that the area of commonality relied upon is not as great as was submitted. Undoubtedly the same weapons were involved and that is an important factual consideration when sentencing for the offences. The offences themselves, however, were quite different in nature. Count 1 deals with the sale of weapons on at least three occasions. Count 2 is directed to the warehousing of firearms for sale. While an element of possession and control is essential for a sale to take place, the offences themselves are qualitatively and in fact, different. 

62This is to be contrasted with the factual situation confronting the High Court in Pearce where the actions giving rise to the infliction of grievous bodily harm in each count were exactly the same so as to bring about a situation where the offender was being punished twice for the same conduct. That is not the case here. 

63Moreover, the submissions by the applicant fail to have sufficient regard to the seriousness of the offences on the Form 1, in particular, that 89 weapons were involved including a large number of semi-automatic weapons and some automatic weapons. It is notorious that the possession of firearms for sale plays an important role in the perpetration by other criminals of the most serious crimes of violence in the community. 

64The observations of Spigelman CJ in the guideline case go further than was set out in the applicant's submissions. The following extracts indicate his Honour's view as to the extent to which Form 1 matters can affect the length of a sentence: 

""18 A number of propositions with respect to the process of taking into account matters on a Form 1 are well established and are uncontroversial. First, the entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence (or to alter the nature of the sentence) than would have been imposed if the primary offence had stood alone. Secondly, it is wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small. Sometimes it will be substantial. (See e.g. The Queen v White (1981) 28 SASR 9 at 13; Murrell v The Queen [1985] FCA 14; (1985) 4 FCR 168 at 179 per Blackburn J; R v Vougdis (1989) 41 A Crim R 125 at 128-129; R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371-372.) 

... 

42 The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another. 

43 I did not intend these observations to be exhaustive of the elements upon which the fact of other offences may impinge. However, no additional elements for which that could be so have been identified in submissions to this Court. The important point is that the focus throughout must be on sentencing for the primary offence."" 

65What is clear from the above paragraphs is that while the Court is sentencing only for the principal offence and not for the Form 1 offences, the entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence and that the additional component may not be small. While not excluding other considerations, the Chief Justice referred specifically to greater weight being given to personal deterrence and to ""the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed."" 

66The common factor in those elements which the Chief Justice emphasised, is that the principal offence was not an isolated instance but was part of a course of offending conduct. On the facts of this case, that course of offending conduct was substantial and serious thereby justifying a significantly longer sentence for the primary offence. 

67The indictment for count 2 charges possession of the firearms during the period 18 June and 5 August 2009, i.e. on the occasions that they were delivered to the purchaser. It is not part of the agreed facts that these weapons had previously been stored by the applicant. Nevertheless, the Form 1 offences showed the true scale of the applicant's business demonstrating that he was undertaking a large-scale operation of illegal dealing with weapons of which their possession in considerable quantities was an essential element. Without punishing for the Form 1 offences as such, the punishment for the primary offence must necessarily be substantial giving appropriate regard to the Form 1 offences. 

68In respect of count 1, the objective seriousness having regard to the type and number of weapons sold was substantial. The type and number of weapons sold is indicative of their being part of a substantial business of trading weapons without regard to the character of the purchaser and the inevitable consequence that some at least would end up in the hands of criminals. But for the true identity of the purchaser and the intervention of the police, the trade in weapons would have continued. Accordingly, count 1 required a heavy penalty even after giving full allowance for the applicant's subjective circumstances. Bearing in mind the maximum term of imprisonment and the standard non-parole period, I do not see how any sentence less than that which was imposed by his Honour could be justified. 

69It follows that I would impose the same sentences which his Honour did in respect of counts 1 and 2. The real issue for this Court in re-sentencing and the matter which was agitated in argument before the Court is to what extent, if at all, there should be an accumulation of the sentences for counts 1 and 2. 

70I do not accept the applicant's submission that the sentences for count 1 and count 2 should be wholly concurrent. I am of the opinion that there should be some accumulation to allow for the differences in the nature of the offences. Both offences were serious examples of offences of that kind. That having been said, the important factual consideration that the same weapons were involved in count 1 as were involved in count 2 cannot be ignored. It would not be principled when re-sentencing the applicant to make no allowance for that consideration and to pass the same sentence without adjustment, as if that factual background did not exist. 

71Having regard to the principle of totality, but also to the factual overlap created by the same weapons forming part of counts 1 and 2, I would re-sentence the applicant so that count 2 is accumulated on count 1 by one year. The total sentence would be imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months. 

72The orders which I propose are as follows: 

1. In respect of count 1, leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed. 

2. In respect of count 2, leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed. 

3. The sentence imposed by his Honour on 2 December 2010 in respect of count 2 is quashed and the applicant is sentenced as follows: 

In respect of count 2, the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months commencing 26 August 2010 and expiring 25 February 2018 with a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months expiring 25 August 2022.

		19 March 2012",2011-12-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758387,Hoon Tiong SEAH v R [2011] NSWCCA 269,"Judgment 

1McClellan CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J. 

2Hidden J: The applicant, Hoon Tiong Seah, pleaded guilty in the District Court to importing a marketable quantity of heroin, an offence under s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years, to date from 25 July 2009, the day of the offence and of his arrest. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 

Facts 

3The facts can be summarised briefly. The applicant and another offender, Boon Leng Kuek, travelled to Australia from Malaysia, arriving on 25 July 2009. Each of them was found by customs officers to be carrying a quantity of heroin secreted in his shoes. The applicant brought in 571 grams of a substance which contained 423.6 grams of pure heroin. Mr Kuek was carrying a somewhat larger quantity. 

4Strictly speaking, the two men were not co-offenders in the same criminal enterprise. They knew each other and travelled to Australia together, but each was charged with the amount of heroin he imported. 

5After initially denying any knowledge of the drugs, both of them claimed to have been given the shoes by a contact in Kuala Lumpur. They booked their flights and paid for them with money supplied by that person. Each of them expected to receive between $10,000 and $20,000 when they returned to Malaysia. The street value of the drug brought in by the applicant was estimated to be between $494,200 and $847,200. The street value of the drug brought in by Mr Kuek was somewhat higher. 

6The sentencing judge dealt with them as couriers, noting that they were not part of a distribution network for drugs in Australia and were not to gain any benefit other than the amount they were promised upon their return to Malaysia. His Honour treated them as equally culpable and sentenced Mr Kuek to the same sentence as the applicant. There was no complaint in this court that there should have been differentiation of sentence between the two men, and it is not necessary to refer to the other evidence bearing upon the sentence of Mr Kuek. 

Subjective case 

7The applicant is Singaporean. He was 37 years old at the time of the offence. He had been dealt with in Singapore for offences described as robbery, being a member of an unlawful society, rioting, and the intentional omission to give information of an offence by a person bound to inform. Investigating police were unable to obtain further information from the Singaporean authorities about that criminal history. The applicant gave evidence that the robbery was committed when he was 19 years old and led to his being placed on probation. In his remarks the sentencing judge referred only to the robbery, noting that the precise nature of that conviction was unclear but that it bore no resemblance to the seriousness of the present offence. He had regard to it only insofar as it deprived the applicant of a finding that he was a person of prior good character. 

8His background was sketched in a psychological report which was in evidence. He was unmarried. His upbringing in Singapore was generally unremarkable. However, when he was 14 years old his father was killed in a work accident, and he left school and went to work. He worked consistently until the year before the offence, when he lost his job because of the impact of the global financial crisis upon his employer. He had a girlfriend who ran a clothing store, and she also was forced to close her business. He had borrowed money for his house and his car and was struggling to repay it. 

9It was because of this financial difficulty that he became involved in the offence. He told the psychologist, and affirmed in evidence in the sentence proceedings, that he had borrowed some money from a ""loan shark"", who was applying pressure to him to repay it and threatening to damage his property if he did not do so. He had a history of the abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs beginning in his mid-teens, but during this period that abuse increased. The man who had engaged him to bring the heroin into Australia had been his supplier of drugs on occasions. During this same period his girlfriend terminated their relationship. The psychologist reported that he appeared to have been suffering from symptoms of reactive depression at the time of the offence. 

The application 

10There are four grounds of the application. They relate to the weight his Honour gave to the quantity of drug involved, to evidence of the applicant's remorse and his co-operation with the authorities, and in the assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation. 

Quantity of drug 

11Neither the Crown prosecutor in this court nor counsel for the applicant, Mr Paish, had appeared in the District Court. Mr Paish submitted that the sentencing judge had given undue weight to the quantity of the drug involved at the expense of other considerations. In the sentence proceedings, towards the end of submissions, His Honour referred to this court's guideline judgment relating to drug importation in R v Wong and Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420, 45 NSWLR 340. Addressing the prosecutor, he observed that that case had ""some application."" There was then the following exchange: 

""HIS HONOUR: And the range is now fairly confined, if you look at the quantities they were above the quantities that applied in a number of other cases, but there are other considerations. 

[PROSECUTOR]: That was going to be my point. 

HIS HONOUR: They can't expect to be given the bottom of the range, they won't be given the top of the range. It's kind of a middle-range, really, so-to give you an idea"". 

12Mr Paish noted that in Wong and Leung the range of sentence in the guideline for the quantity of drug in the present case was six to nine years imprisonment. He noted that the sentence of eight years imposed upon the applicant is roughly in the middle of that range, consistent with the approach His Honour foreshadowed in the exchange with the prosecutor. Such an approach, he submitted, would demonstrate error. 

13It is unnecessary to recount the subsequent history of the Wong and Leung guidelines. It was sketched by Simpson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Buddin J agreed, in R v Cheung and Choi [2010] NSWCCA 244, 203 A Crim R 398, at [78]-[90]. Wong and Leung was the subject of a successful appeal to the High Court: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64, 207 CLR 584, in which members of the court were critical of the selection of the weight of the drug as the chief factor in fixing the appropriate sentence. Nevertheless, the guidelines continued to be seen as ""a useful guide"" in subsequent decisions of this court. However, after a review of the reasoning in the judgments in the High Court, Simpson J concluded that that approach could no longer be sustained. 

14Her Honour put it this way at [90]: 

""In the light of the criticisms made by the High Court, I am unable to see how the selected sentences can stand as 'a useful guide'. With respect to those who have thought otherwise, I have come to the view that the proposition that the Wong guideline sentences continue to operate as 'a useful guide' cannot withstand scrutiny"". 

15Mr Paish argued that His Honour placed undue emphasis on the quantity of the drug, and failed to give adequate weight to the matters favourable to the applicant in accordance with the criteria laid down in s 16A (2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (C'th). It should be noted, however, that in his remarks on sentence His Honour made no reference to the Wong and Leung guidelines. This court has observed more than once that a sentencing judge's reasons are not to be gleaned from exchanges with the parties' representatives in submissions, but from the remarks on sentence. 

16In any event, it is not clear from the exchange between His Honour and the prosecutor which I have quoted what weight he contemplated giving to the quantity of the drug. He referred to there being ""other considerations"", a proposition to which the prosecutor assented. The prosecutor had put her submissions on sentence in writing. In those submissions she did not rely upon the guidelines, noting the High Court's criticism of them. What she did submit, correctly, was that the weight of the drug remains a relevant and significant matter in determining the seriousness of the offence. 

17The quantity of the drug was one of the factors to be weighed in the balance in arriving at an appropriate sentence. Whether in that balancing exercise His Honour gave appropriate weight to the factors favourable to the appellant is a matter which arises when considering the other grounds of the application. However, I am not persuaded that His Honour placed an emphasis on the quantity of the drug which it did not deserve. This ground is not made out. 

Remorse 

18This ground complains that his Honour failed to deal with evidence of the applicant's remorse. 

19His Honour accepted that both the applicant and Mr Kuek had pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. He noted that the pleas saved police resources and court time. He also saw the pleas as facilitating the course of justice and found that, even though they were entered in the face of an overwhelming prosecution case, they were entitled to ""a significant discount"" from the sentence which might otherwise have been imposed. 

20The psychologist observed in her report that the applicant ""acknowledged the inappropriateness of his criminal conduct, appearing remorseful, and he was able to see the impact that his offending had upon the Australian community."" The applicant's evidence-in-chief concluded as follows: 

"" Q. How do you feel about becoming involved in this offence? 
A. I feel remorse, shouldn't be doing that. 

Q. In what way? 
A. Because I have been bringing harm to people in Australia."" 

21This evidence was not challenged in cross-examination. However, in his remarks his Honour made no reference to it or to the passage in the psychologist's report. Indeed, he said nothing about remorse at all. Mr Paish submitted that it was a matter which his Honour should have dealt with in his remarks and, indeed, that his Honour should have accepted the unchallenged evidence of remorse and given it appropriate weight in determining the sentence. 

22However, this court does not have the advantage of having seen the applicant give evidence. It may be that his Honour was not impressed by the applicant's expression of remorse, which could have appeared as formulaic and insincere. In this regard, it is notable that no submission about remorse was made to his Honour by the applicant's solicitor, or by the prosecutor in her written submissions or in oral argument. 

23I have given this ground of the application serious consideration. Remorse is usually a significant factor on sentence although, obviously, the weight to be given to it will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case. It is given statutory recognition (expressed as contrition) in s 16A(2)(m) of the Crimes Act . It would have been preferable for his Honour to have said something about it. However, if there had been evidence of the applicant's remorse worthy of evaluation, it is unlikely that a judge as experienced in this area of the law as his Honour would have overlooked it. I am fortified in that view by the fact that both the applicant's solicitor and the prosecutor were silent about the matter. 

24I am also persuaded by the submission of the Crown prosecutor in this court that the evidence of remorse was ""extremely limited"", and that such remorse as there was was sufficiently recognised by the discount of sentence which his Honour allowed for the applicant's plea of guilty, notwithstanding the strength of the prosecution case. There is, of course, significant overlap between remorse and the facilitation of the course of justice by a plea of guilty. This ground is not made out. 

Co-operation with authorities 

25While the applicant gave a false account to customs officers, he admitted the offence to officers of the Australian Federal Police. To that extent his Honour found that he had co-operated with the authorities, while noting that ""that co-operation was in the face of him being caught, in effect, red-handed ... ."" Co-operation with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence in question or of other offences is a matter required to be taken into account by s 16A(2)(h) of the Crimes Act . 

26A little earlier in his remarks, his Honour dealt with the question whether either the applicant or Mr Kuek was entitled to ""any discount for assistance to authorities."" By this he was clearly referring to the provision of information other than their own involvement in the offence. He concluded that neither of them was. He noted that Mr Kuek had provided some information about a person overseas said to be a senior person in the drug syndicate, but that information proved to be ""of no practical significance."" As for the applicant, he found that he had provided ""no relevant assistance."" 

27Mr Paish submitted that his Honour erred in giving no weight to the applicant's co-operation with the authorities by making admissions about his own involvement, which he described as ""an independent mitigating feature."" He noted that the applicant admitted to police not only his actions in bringing in the drug but also that he knew what he was doing, thereby admitting the fault element that needed to be proved to establish the offence. 

28I can see no error in his Honour's approach to this issue. As I have said, his Honour recognised that the applicant had co-operated with the authorities to the extent of admitting his offence, but noted that he did so after it had been detected and at a time when the evidence against him was compelling. As the Crown prosecutor in this court pointed out, without his admission the fault element could readily have been inferred from the circumstances. 

29In my view, his Honour gave the applicant's co-operation with the police such recognition as it deserved. This ground is not made out. 

Rehabilitation 

30Finally, Mr Paish submitted that his Honour failed appropriately to assess the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation. 

31What his Honour said was this: 

""It is likely that when he returns to Singapore he will not engage in this sort of behaviour again. His arrest here would remove his utility as a courier of drugs in any case. That is not the same as saying that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. This offence was engaged in to make money. If he was short of money in the future, for example, if unable to obtain employment, I am far from satisfied that he would not again engage in some form of criminal activity to make money. However, that will not be in Australia, and it is perhaps of little relevance to the sentence that I will pass here."" 

32The applicant's solicitor did address his Honour about this issue, submitting that the offence arose out of the circumstances in which the applicant found himself at the time and that he would be unlikely to commit further offences. Mr Paish drew our attention to material in the psychological report, in addition to that to which I have already referred, from which it appears that he enjoyed the support of his family, both emotionally and financially, that his outlook had improved while he had been in custody and that he had insight into his history of substance abuse. He endorsed these matters in his evidence, affirming his intention to refrain from using illegal drugs on his release. None of this was challenged by the prosecutor in cross-examination of the applicant or in submissions to his Honour. 

33Notwithstanding that material, his Honour's assessment of the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation was guarded. However, here also, this court cannot know how the applicant presented when he gave his evidence about his outlook for the future. As the Crown prosecutor in this court pointed out, his Honour's finding on this issue was neutral. He did not find the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation to be poor. Rather, he thought it unlikely that he would re-offend upon his return to Singapore but saw a risk that he might do so if he again found himself in financial difficulty. It cannot be said that that finding was not open to his Honour. 

34I might add that his Honour does not appear to have seen that risk as a significant matter bearing upon sentence. In an observation which, with respect, I would not endorse, he appears to have treated it as of little moment because any re-offending by the applicant would occur in his native country and would not affect the Australian population. However that may be, I am not persuaded that this ground is made out. 

Orders 

35Accordingly, none of the challenges to the sentencing process has been made good. If any of the grounds had been established, Mr Paish argued that a more lenient sentence was warranted. He referred to the examination of sentencing patterns for offences of this kind by McClellan CJ at CL in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, 205 A Crim R 1, particularly at [220] - [223]. However, it is not necessary to evaluate this argument because it is not a ground of the application that the sentence is, in any event, manifestly excessive. 

36I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 

37Johnson J: I agree with Hidden J.

1MEAGHER JA : I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben J and with his Honour's reasons. 

2HOEBEN J : 
Offences and sentence 
On 9 November 2010 the applicant was arraigned on an indictment containing three counts as follows: 

Count 1: On or about 10 August 2008 at Toronto in the State of New South Wales being in a building, namely the Toronto RSL Club at 41 The Boulevard, did therein steal a sum of money and break out of the building. 

In the alternative: 

Count 2: On or about 10 August 2008 at Toronto knowing that Merrissa Sills committed the serious indictable offence of being in a building, namely the Toronto RSL Club at 41 The Boulevard, did therein steal a sum of money and break out of the building, did receive, harbour, maintain and assist Merrissa Sills contrary to section 112(1)(b)/350 Crimes Act 1900. 

Count 3: On 10 August 2008 at Toronto and other places did receive proceeds of crime, being a sum of money in circumstances where he knew that the sum of money was the proceeds of crime, contrary to section 193B(2) Crimes Act 1900. 

3The applicant entered a plea of not guilty to count 1, but guilty to counts 2 and 3. The pleas of guilty were accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment. The maximum penalty provided for count 2 was imprisonment for 5 years and that for count 3 was imprisonment for 15 years. 

4On 17 June 2011 Coolahan DCJ sentenced the applicant as follows: 

Count 2: A fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months to commence 11 November 2010 and expire on 10 November 2011. 

Count 3: Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 months to commence on 11 February 2011 and expire on 10 May 2012 with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months to expire on 11 November 2013. 

5The effective overall sentence was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months. The applicant received a discount of 15 percent for his pleas of guilty. 

6Merrissa Sills was the applicant's sister. She was sentenced by his Honour Coolahan DCJ on 14 May 2010 following a plea of guilty to an indictment containing one count that she on 10 August 2008 entered the Toronto RSL and broke out having stolen a sum of money, contrary to s112(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900. She was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months. She received a 30 percent discount for her plea of guilty and for assistance. 

7The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentences imposed by his Honour. The grounds of appeal are: 

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in failing to rule on objections made by the defence in respect of the content of the facts document which adverted to more serious offending than that upon which the Crown was entitled to rely having accepted a plea to the applicant being an accessory after the fact. 

Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in sentencing the applicant upon an assessment of his culpability which disclosed a more serious offence than that charged. 

Factual background 

8The following is a summary of the facts as set out by his Honour. It is this summary of facts which was the basis for the first ground of appeal. 

9At approximately 3am on Sunday, 10 August 2008 an amount of $134,868.25 was stolen from a locked and secured combination safe within the Toronto RSL Club by a former employee of that club and the younger sister of the applicant, Merrissa Sills. 

10During the course of that morning at approximately 3am and at 3.49am a motion sensor alarm was activated causing the club manager and her husband, together with a security officer, to attend the RSL Club in response to those alarms. At the first attendance, there were no visible signs of entry and no intruders were sighted. On the second occasion of the activation of the alarm, the same persons attended the Club. On that occasion it was established that an unlawful entry had taken place and that money had been stolen from the safe. 

11During the course of police investigations, an extensive review of CCTV footage from surveillance cameras took place. By this means it was established that Merrissa Sills had carried out the theft of the money, having secreted herself within the club premises before the club was closed for the night. Ms Sills' employment with the club as a shift manager/supervisor had been terminated some 10 months before the offence. 

12The CCTV footage revealed the following: 

1. The entry of Merrissa Sills and the applicant to the club on 9 August 2008 between 8pm and 9pm. The applicant was shown to be trying to open a locked door which led to the club cellar. During the period of Ms Sills' employment with the club, it was the usual club practice to leave that door unlocked. Since the termination of her employment, security arrangements had been tightened and that door thereafter remained locked. 

2. Both the applicant and Ms Sills were seen to walk past a ""No Entry"" sign into the downstairs area of the club, after that area of the club had ceased trading for the night. Neither the applicant nor Ms Sills had a legitimate reason for being in that part of the club. 

3. Ms Sills was seen to open a door to a storage area, place her backpack in it and then climb in herself, closing the door behind her. She then sent a SMS message to a friend which simply said ""In"". At that time, the applicant was in the company of that friend in the club. The applicant was observed to leave the club shortly after midnight. At about 2am the staff left the club, after securing the premises and setting the alarm system. 

4. Between 1.50am and 3.30am Ms Sills sent SMS messages to the applicant and he sent SMS messages to her. Significantly, at 3.25am (after the occasion of the first activation of the alarm, but before the second) Ms Sills sent an SMS message to the applicant saying ""Have they gone?"" The applicant responded at 3.27am with two SMS messages. 

5. At 2.36am the applicant was observed approaching the lower entry door to the club and looking through the glass doors into the club. 

6. Between 3.03am and when she left the club, Ms Sills is shown removing money from the combination safe and concealing herself when the club manager, her husband and the security officer attended the club after the first occasion when the alarm was activated. 

7. At 3.40am while still in the room where the safe was located, Ms Sills called the applicant and they talked for 1 minute and 39 seconds. On leaving the club, Ms Sills ran to where she and the applicant had parked a car. The applicant was waiting for her. He then drove her to his residence at Bateau Bay. 

13The applicant was a former police officer. After leaving the club, he advised his sister to turn off her mobile telephone in order to avoid the possibility of police tracking her movements through the mobile telephone tower system. On arrival at the applicant's home, he advised his sister to remove the clothing she was wearing and he would get rid of it, together with the clothing which he wore. They opened the bag of money and the applicant gave a sum of money to his sister retaining the balance for himself. [This was an area of significant dispute between the Crown and the applicant in the sentence proceedings and evidence was called to resolve it.] 

14After the CCTV footage was examined by the police, Ms Sills was identified as the offender and her premises at Carey Bay were searched on the afternoon of 10 August 2008. A balaclava and other items, similar to that worn by her at the time of the offence, were seized. Her mobile telephone was seized. She was placed under arrest and subsequently charged. 

15Ms Sills informed the police that it was her idea to commit the offence. She had spoken with the offender about the offence. They both had gambling problems, hers with poker machines, his with horse racing. She said that it was agreed between them that the robbery would be carried out on 9 August 2008. 

16Shortly after 5am on 10 August 2008 uniform police patrolling the Long Jetty area chanced upon the applicant as he drove his vehicle from Lions Park Road into the Entrance Road. The applicant was stopped and subjected to a random breath test. He informed the officers he was heading home. The random breath test was negative. 

17At about 9.30am on Sunday, 10 August 2008 the applicant went to the premises of his former wife at Springfield, some 13 kilometres from Bateau Bay. He asked if he could store some ski equipment there. With his former wife's consent, the applicant placed an article in a filing cabinet in the garage. He locked the cabinet and retained the key. 

18Late in the evening of Sunday, 10 August 2008 the applicant's premises at Bateau Bay were searched. The applicant was at home with his flatmates. He declined to speak to police about his sister's involvement in the offence. Among other things, the police seized the offender's mobile telephone and from his wallet they took possession of a Toronto RSL Club ""sign in"" docket dated 9 August 2008 in the name of M Jiney of 10 Anderson Street, Rathmines. This was a non-existent address. A Citibank card in the name of Merrissa Sills was also found in the applicant's wallet. 

19On Monday, 11 August 2008 the applicant's former wife went to the filing cabinet and noticed that the key was missing. Using a screwdriver, she opened the top drawer to such an extent that she saw an orange plastic bag in the drawer. With the screwdriver, she ripped open a portion of the bag and inside she observed what she described as ""meshy"" material and thought it was ski gloves. 

20On Tuesday, 12 August 2008 the applicant returned to his former wife's premises. He had the following conversation with her: 

""I'm going to be completely honest with you. Merrissa is in gaol. She broke into the RSL Club. It was revenge for what they did to her. She hid inside until it closed. I knew she was going to do it but I couldn't talk her out of it."" 

21The applicant's former wife told him that she had broken into the filing cabinet and requested that he remove the article from it. In due course he did so and returned to his former wife carrying a backpack. He said to her ""Do you want some?"" She said ""What?"" He did not reply and left shortly afterwards. 

22The applicant was arrested on 9 December 2009. He was conveyed to The Entrance Police Station and declined to be interviewed. When charged he informed the police that he took no part in the offence. 

23None of the money stolen from the club has been recovered. The club was only partially insured for the loss. 

24The applicant was a chronic gambler. His sister gave him money over the years to support his habit. Several of his past relationships broke down primarily because of his gambling habit. At one stage he told his sister that the money he received from the robbery was buried. He said it was in her best interests that she did not know where the money was. On several occasions he told his sister that the money was gone. 

25The applicant was declared bankrupt on 17 September 2007 with debts totalling $68,100. At the time of the offences the applicant had not been discharged from that bankruptcy. 

26Following his plea of guilty on 9 November 2010 the applicant voluntarily entered into custody on 11 November 2010 and has remained in custody in relation to these matters since that time. 

Remarks on sentence 

27Having set out the facts, the first issue dealt with by his Honour was the disputed question of how much of the proceeds of the offence were received by the applicant. The applicant maintained that it was about $3,800 whereas his sister said that he took all of the proceeds, except for $20,000 which he left with her. 

28His Honour summarised the position of the Crown on this issue as follows: 

""The Crown case really is in the alternative. As I understand it, the Crown urges me to find beyond reasonable doubt that the amount which is the subject of Count 3 is an amount which was only $20,000 less than the amount stolen. In order for me to be so satisfied I would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Merrissa Sills was both an honest and accurate witness. 

The alternate proposition put by the Crown and the one which, as I understand it, is the main contention of the Crown is that whilst I may not be able to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the primary contention, I would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender obtained significantly more from the proceeds of the offence than $3,800 although the exact amount could never be determined."" (ROS 11.6) 

29The principal evidence in support of the Crown position came from the applicant's sister, Merrissa Sills. The applicant gave evidence that he received $3,800 only. 

30His Honour was not satisfied that Merrissa Sills was an honest and accurate witness. He noted that she was an admitted liar. She had told untruths to her psychiatrist and to others. She had given varying accounts initially as to how the offence came about and his Honour found it difficult to know what to make of her evidence. 

31His Honour had similar reservations about the evidence of the applicant. His Honour said: 

""The reality is that I am also unable to accept the evidence of the offender. It was in many respects unsatisfactory, particularly in his answers in cross-examination. I do not intend to go through them all in detail but they were, to say the least, unconvincing. His explanation for taking the bag to his ex-wife's premises within hours of the offence simply did not ring true. His evidence of his movements after dropping off the offender did not ring true. The fact that he would be satisfied with something like $3,800 as the proceeds of the offence when he was clearly actively involved in it himself, as evidenced from the surveillance video and the SMS messages, also does not ring true. 

The reality is I do not believe him and I am left in the situation where I have no doubt that he received significantly more than $3,800 but I have no idea as to the exact amount."" (ROS 12.4) 

32His Honour then considered the applicant's subjective case in greater detail. His Honour had before him a pre-sentence report by Sarah Gilmour. This set out that the applicant was aged 40 at the time of sentencing. He and his sister had grown up in a very dysfunctional family which had had a profound effect on both of them. He had joined the police service in 1990 and was placed on sick leave in 2007 after a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. He was medically discharged from the service in 2010. 

33Ms Gilmour noted a history of heavy alcohol consumption commencing in approximately 1994. She was told that it was a common occurrence for him to attend the hotel after work with colleagues to debrief the day's events. The applicant said that his alcohol use increased and he would binge drink large amounts. In more recent times it seems that his alcohol use decreased. 

34Ms Gilmour referred to the applicant's gambling problem but noted that he had ceased all gambling approximately 2 - 3 months before entering custody. In her summary, Ms Gilmour said: 

""Mr Sills has the support of his ex-wife and close friend who are willing to assist with his integration into the community with his ex-wife adding that he requires intensive gambling intervention. Whilst Mr Sills claims that his gambling addiction is not problematic, it would appear that he would benefit from an assessment to gauge what intervention is required."" 

35In the applicant's case, a report dated 1 February 2011 by Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, was tendered. Dr Westmore diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression in partial remission, alcohol abuse and pathological gambling. He said that the applicant did not have any anti-social personality disorder. 

36In his opinion, Dr Westmore said: 

""His account of the matters now before the Court has been contained in the body of this report. He indicated he became aware of his sister's intentions about six months before the incident but he did not take her statement seriously when she indicated she had been thinking of robbing the RSL Club. He reports even on the night of the incident he had not been aware that he and his sister and a group of friends would be meeting at the RSL Club where the robbery occurred. He talked about trying to dissuade his sister from committing the criminal act but he later acknowledged that he accepted some money from her, doing so in part because of his chronic gambling problems and in the belief that he thought the money he had taken would not be noticed. He said he was aware that his sister would be arrested the following day, and that in fact occurred. 

In custody he is obviously a high-risk prisoner because of his previous occupation as a police officer. He has already been exposed to verbal threats and he is a maximum protection prisoner. He is in a single cell with no yard. He is receiving no visits and he is a non-association prisoner. 

If I accept his history as being a reliable account of what occurred and when I consider his longitudinal life history, I think this man's risk of re-offending is non-existent. He demonstrated severely impaired judgment at the time he agreed to accept stolen money from his sister. His chronic depression and problems associated with alcohol abuse and pathological gambling would have been factors which influenced his poor judgment. He was also under financial stress, having gone on sick leave, which resulted in a significant reduction in his income. 

The other area of impaired judgment was something that he himself recognised when he learned that his sister had taken money from the Club, but he failed to take her directly to a police station. This behaviour is likely to have been influenced to some degree by the fact that it was his sister who was involved and, although they had not been close over the years, he had some protective feelings towards her. 

This man requires long-term psychiatric support and long-term treatment with antidepressants. He will need to go to a community-based alcohol rehabilitation service on his return to the community and he should attend Gamblers Anonymous for an extended period of time as well. It is likely he will be left with long term psychiatric problems, however, as a result of his service as a police officer."" 

37His Honour noted that Dr Westmore's opinion was dependent upon the honesty of the applicant. In that regard, his Honour did not accept the applicant when he said that he played almost no role in the commission of the offence. His Honour said that the objective evidence did not support that. His Honour also had some doubt about the causal connection between the various conditions from which the applicant was suffering and the commission of the offences. His Honour reached that conclusion because he believed that the applicant had minimised his role in the overall offence. Otherwise, his Honour was prepared to accept the opinion of Dr Westmore. 

38When considering aggravating and mitigating factors under s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 his Honour found no aggravating factors except that a degree of planning was involved in count 1. By way of mitigation, his Honour noted that the applicant had no record of prior convictions. Although his Honour had some doubts about the applicant's veracity, he accepted Dr Westmore's opinion that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend. He also accepted that the applicant had reasonable prospects for rehabilitation. 

39His Honour found remorse to be a difficult issue because he was not satisfied that the applicant had been completely frank in relation to his role in the offences and as a result, was not satisfied that the applicant was fully remorseful for what happened. Nevertheless, his Honour was prepared to find that the applicant had a degree of remorse. 

40His Honour found special circumstances on the basis that it was the applicant's first time in custody, he would need extended supervised rehabilitation upon his release, there was a degree of accumulation in the sentences and he would be serving his sentence under conditions of greater hardship than that experienced by other prisoners. His Honour had regard to the applicant's evidence that he spent his time in a single cell with only limited access to daylight. 

41In his concluding remarks, his Honour said the following: 

""No strict question of parity arises because this offender faces entirely different charges to his sister. On the other hand, I am satisfied that they were both in this together and I think that from a practical point of view an issue of parity probably does arise. So far as their involvement is concerned, in my view it was similar, albeit that his sister was the one who actually performed the robbery."" (ROS 18.1) 

APPEAL 
Ground of Appeal 1 

42In relation to this ground of appeal, it should be noted that when the Crown sought to tender a ""Statement of Agreed Facts"" on the sentence proceedings, objection was taken on the basis that the document had not been agreed and purported to disclose criminality attaching to the applicant's involvement in the primary offence of stealing and breaking out of the RSL. 

43When that objection was taken, his Honour said: 

""This statement of facts goes a lot further than an accessory after the fact and what I would like, Mr Crown, is a statement - I don't mind if it's given orally. I'll note it down - about what facts the Crown relies upon and what facts the Crown says the offender should be sentenced upon for being an accessory after the fact."" (24.3.11, p3, line 48) 

After a short adjournment, the Crown orally set out the following as the facts it relied upon in relation to count 2. 

""CROWN: First, we say he's an accessory because of the maths, your Honour, firstly picking the co-accused or co-offender up and taking her from the scene. Secondly, warning her in terms of switching off her mobile phone so as to reduce the possibility of her phone being connected to the offence. Thirdly, disposing of items that she wore while committing the offence, and fourthly, taking the sum of money, whatever it was, after she, we say, obtained the sum of money, taking the balance of it and secreting it."" (24.3.11, p4, line 36) 

44Later that same day, the defence again raised the issue of the Statement of Facts being wider than was necessary and including matters for which the applicant was not being sentenced. Counsel for the offender, however, did not seek a ruling from his Honour but left the topic on the basis that discussions could take place between him and the Crown and something could be reduced to writing. Despite a further adjournment of four weeks, the matter was not raised again, nor was any order or direction sought from his Honour. 

45The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in failing to rule on the objection taken by defence counsel. Inferentially, the ground of appeal suggests that not only should his Honour have ruled on the objection but his Honour should have rejected those parts of the Agreed Statement of Facts which dealt with matters leading up to and associated with the actual commission of the primary offence. 

46In support of the submission, the applicant relied upon the following statements of principle: R v Uzabeaga [2000] NSWCCA 381, (Bell J with whom Dowd and Simpson JJ agreed): 

""34 A sentencing judge is not bound to accept and act upon the parties' agreement as to the factual basis upon which a prisoner is to be sentenced. In Chow v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 593 at 606 Kirby P (as he then was) observed: 

""The foregoing rules do not oblige a sentencing judge passively, and unquestioningly, to accept facts as the basis for sentencing which are presented by the prosecution and/or the accused. The judge's sentencing discretion is to be exercised in the public interest. Even where the prosecution and the accused are agreed, they cannot fetter the judge's performance of the judicial function by their plea bargaining: See Malvaso v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 223; R v Altham (NSW CCA, 18 June, 1992, unreported) per Hunt CJ at CL. A statement of agreed facts may appear to the sentencing judge to be inadequate for sentencing purposes. The judge may feel the need for further material, for example, by way of pre-sentence report to assist in the performance of the sentencing function. The parties cannot forbid the judge to seek such assistance. They have their respective functions to perform. But they cannot invade the judicial function any more than the judge may invade their functions."" 

35 This is not to say that a sentencing judge is free to make findings of fact inconsistent with the statement of agreed facts without warning of his intention so to do. In Chow in a passage preceding that which I have extracted above His Honour observed: 

""Indeed, circumstances may exist where a failure on the part of a judge to disclose matters of concern, or a course of conduct contemplated, will themselves amount to a departure from the rules of procedural fairness: cf Galea v Galea (1990) 19 NSWLR 263 at 279; Anderson v Judges of the District Court of New South Wales (1992) 27 NSWLR 701."""" 

47In Regina v H [2005] NSWCCA 282 the Court, Studdert, Bell and Latham JJ said: 

"" 58 In a case in which agreement has been reached on the factual basis on which an offender is to plead guilty following a ""plea bargain"" (as appears to have happened in this case), the wisdom of tendering the entire Crown brief in addition to the agreed statement may be doubted. It runs the risk that the sentencer will take into account facts that would aggravate the offence contrary to the principles in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383; see too R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; 134 A Crim R 174 at 180. In this case the statements of the complainants contained descriptions of conduct for which this applicant was not criminally responsible. Some of this material found its way into the Judge's reasons and it formed the basis of findings that were adverse to the applicant. 

59 As the Crown submits, the Judge was not bound by the parties agreement as to the factual basis on which the applicant was to be sentenced: Chow v DPP (NSW) (1992) 28 NSWLR 593 per Kirby P at 606. Where material in addition to an agreed statement is in evidence at a sentence hearing it is open to the judge to make a finding of facts upon it, notwithstanding that these may not accord with the agreed facts. However, the requirements of procedural fairness commend that when a judge intends to go outside the agreed statement of facts by recourse to other material in evidence and to sentence an offender on a basis that differs in substance to the agreed facts, he or she should inform the parties of that intention in order to give them an opportunity to deal with it: R v Uzabeaga [2000] NSWCCA 381 at 458-459, [34] - [38]."" 

48The Crown submitted that his Honour was not asked at any time to make any rulings with respect to the contents of the Statement of Facts. It submitted that in those circumstances, it was not now open to the applicant to argue that his Honour failed to do something which he was not asked to do. It submitted that the objections by the defence to the Statement of Facts were never articulated. In those circumstances, the Crown submitted that it was not for his Honour to remind the parties of this issue. 

49In that regard the Crown relies upon the remarks of Simpson J (with whom Whealy JA and Hislop J agreed) in Madden v R [2011] NSWCCA 254 with respect to a ground of appeal which argued that the sentencing judge ""failed to make inquiries about subsequent offences"": 

""28 ... The applicant was, at sentencing, represented by a solicitor who, from the transcript, appears to have been experienced. Either he, or the Crown, could have made available to the sentencing judge the relevant material concerning the subsequent offences. 

29 The nature of the ground ignores the fact that, even in sentencing proceedings, the courts of NSW operate on an adversarial system. The roles of counsel and the judge are clearly defined and trespassing by one upon the role of the other is not to be encouraged, certainly not by this Court. It is not the role of a judge to seek out evidentiary material, nor to determine the scope of the evidence put before him or her. Although, when this was raised with counsel on the application, it was said (I have no doubt correctly) that it does happen, in sentencing, that judges sometimes identify additional material that would assist them in the sentencing process, a judge must be very circumspect in intruding into the role of counsel."" 

50As was stated by the Court in Regina v H, it was unwise for the Crown to tender a Statement of Facts, which included material relating to the commission of the primary offence. Because of the risk that he might take into account facts that would aggravate the offence, contrary to the principles in R v De Simoni, it would have been prudent for his Honour to have required the Crown to amend the Statement of Facts so that the aforementioned risk would not arise. The fact that his Honour did not do that or take some similar course of action did not constitute error on his part. A reading of the transcript makes it clear that his Honour was not in terms asked to do anything by the parties. For the reasons set out by Simpson J in Madden , error on the part of his Honour has not been established and this ground of appeal should be dismissed. 

Ground of Appeal 2 

51The applicant submitted that the principle in De Simoni had been breached in a number of respects by his Honour. The first instance of such a breach was said to have occurred when his Honour rejected the applicant's evidence in respect of count 3 on the basis that: 

""The fact that he would be satisfied with something like $3,800 as the proceeds of the offence when he was clearly actively involved in it himself, as evidenced from the surveillance footage and the SMS messages, also does not ring true"". 

52The applicant also relied upon the concluding remarks of his Honour where he said: 

""No strict parity arises because this offender faces entirely different charges to his sister. On the other hand, I am satisfied they were both in this together and I think from a practical point of view an issue of parity probably does arise. So far as their involvement is concerned, in my view it was similar, albeit that his sister was the one who actually performed the robbery."" 

53The applicant submitted that his Honour's recital in his review of the facts that ""it was agreed between them that the robbery would be carried out on 9 August 2008"" makes it clear that when his Honour was referring to the involvement of the applicant in the offences he had in mind an involvement in the primary offence, rather than the two offences for which the applicant was being sentenced. 

54When considering this ground of appeal it is useful to have in mind exactly what was said in De Simoni. The principles were stated by Gibbs CJ (with whom Mason and Murphy JJ agreed) at 389: 

""The general principle that the sentence imposed on an offender should take account of all the circumstances of the offence is subject to a more fundamental and important principle, that no-one should be punished for an offence of which he has not been convicted ... The combined effect of the two principles, so far as is relevant for present purposes, is that a judge, in imposing sentence is entitled to consider all the conduct of the accused, including that which would aggravate the offence, but cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence."" 

55It is clear from that statement of principle that the first example of breach relied upon by the applicant has not been made out. The comments upon which the applicant relied were made in the context of reasons why his Honour did not accept the applicant's evidence in respect of count 3. 

56His Honour's reasons for rejecting the evidence of the applicant were based on demeanour, his unsatisfactory and unconvincing answers in cross-examination, his explanation for taking the bag to his ex-wife's premises and his evidence of his movements after dropping off the offender. None of these matters relate to the primary offence. 

57His Honour's reference to the surveillance video and the SMS messages as a further reason for rejecting the evidence of the applicant was open to him. His Honour was using this material to assess the veracity and reliability of the applicant. He was not using the material as a circumstance of aggravation to be taken into account when sentencing the applicant. 

58His Honour's approach in this regard was fully consistent with the guidance provided by the plurality in R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [24]: 

""24 Courts of Criminal Appeal in Australia have considered the subject of fact finding for sentencing many times in the last thirty years. Not all the questions that have been examined in those decisions must be considered now. For present purposes, it is enough to say that we reject the contention that a judge who is not satisfied of some matter urged in a plea on behalf of the offender must, nevertheless, sentence the offender on a basis that accepts the accuracy of that contention unless the prosecution proves the contrary beyond reasonable doubt. The incongruities that would result if this submission were accepted are well illustrated by the present case. The respondent swore that he was a courier but the judge disbelieved him. To require the judge to sentence a respondent on the basis that he was a courier is incongruous."" 

59When the second example relied upon by the applicant is placed in context, it is clear that his Honour well understood the difference between the offences for which the applicant was being sentenced and the offence for which his sister was sentenced. His Honour's reference to the applicant and his sister being ""both in this together"" need not and is not to be read as incorporating into his Honour's reasoning process the SMS messages and the surveillance video. The applicant was clearly aware of the commission of the offence (otherwise he would not have been there to drive his sister away). He drove her away, warned her as to precautions to be taken, disposed of clothing and took a substantial amount of money. All these actions amount to him ""being in this together"" with his sister insofar as the offences generally are concerned. 

60The use of the word ""parity"" for the second time in the quotation recited at [52] herein which is relied upon by the applicant, is clearly not to be understood in its legal sense. In its context it is a reference to proportionality generally, with particular reference to the criminality of the applicant and his sister as it arose in relation to the specific offences of which they were convicted. 

61While the reference to the applicant and his sister agreeing that the robbery should take place on 9 August 2008 should have been qualified by his Honour, that of itself does not amount to an error requiring the intervention of this Court. On the contrary, it has long been accepted that it is open to the sentencing judge to refer to the entirety of what has occurred in relation to the commission of an offence as setting the context for the consideration of the culpability of the offender in doing that which supported the charge against him or her ( Regina v Laurentiu (1992) 63 A Crim R 402 per Wood J at 415-416). 

62A similar observation was made by Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Gleeson CJ and Blanch J agreed) in Regina v David Alan Lawless (CCA, unreported, 24 June 1994) where his Honour said: 

""Nor are those facts upon which the judge relied denied relevance by the sentencing principle laid down in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. A sentencing judge may take into account all of the conduct of the prisoner, including that which would aggravate the offence, but may not take into account as matters of aggravation facts established in evidence which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence or which would have rendered the prisoner liable to a more serious penalty than that which is prescribed for the offence of which he has been found guilty."" 

63It follows that the second ground of appeal has not been made out. 

64Even if this ground of appeal had been made out, I would not have intervened to reduce the sentence imposed by his Honour. In the circumstances of this case, the sentence was modest. Given the obvious planning involved and the significant sum of money taken (of which none has been recovered), I am of the opinion that no lesser sentence than that passed by his Honour is warranted in law (s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912). 

65The orders which I would make are that leave to appeal is granted but that the appeal is dismissed. 

66ROTHMAN J : I agree with Hoeben J and the orders he proposes.

2758395,Kirkbride v R; Knight v R & McIlrey v R [2011] NSWCCA 268,"Judgment 

1McClellan CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J. 

2Hidden J: Ryan Kirkbride pleaded guilty in the District Court to two charges of supplying a prohibited drug in a commercial quantity, and asked the sentencing judge to take into account some further offences on a Form 1. Shannon Knight and Wade McIlrey pleaded guilty to knowingly taking part in the second offence of supplying a prohibited drug committed by Kirkbride. All three were dealt with by the same judge and sentenced on the same day, 21 June 2010. All three seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon them. 

3A fourth offender, Dean Eedens also pleaded guilty to being knowingly concerned in Kirkbride's second offence, and asked the sentencing judge to take into account a further offence on a Form 1. He was dealt with at the same time as the other three offenders. He has not sought leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him but, as the basis for the three applications before this Court is the relativity between the sentences of the various offenders, it is necessary to set out the sentence imposed upon him and refer to the material in his case. 

4The first count against Kirkbride was the supply of a commercial quantity of the drug commonly known as ecstasy. The second count was the supply of a commercial quantity of a similar drug, known as 1-benylpiperazine. Each is an offence under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, as is the offence of knowingly taking part in such an offence, and each offence carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

5The sentences imposed on the four offenders were as follows: 

KIRKBRIDE: on the first count, imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, 7 months and 6 days, commencing on 4 March 2009; 

on the second count (taking into account the matters on the Form 1), imprisonment for 9 years, with a non-parole period of 5 years, 4 months and 24 days, commencing on 4 September 2009. 

The aggregate sentence is imprisonment for 9 1/2 years, with an effective non-parole period of 5 years, 10 months and 24 days, commencing on 4 March 2009. That was the day of Kirkbride's arrest following the offence the subject of the second count, and he had been in custody since. 

KNIGHT: imprisonment for 4 1/2 years with a non-parole period of 2 years, 8 months and 11 days, commencing on 21 June 2010. That was the day sentence was passed, Knight having been on bail since his arrest. 

McILREY: imprisonment for 4 1/2 years with a non-parole period of 2 years, 8 months and 12 days, commencing on 2 March 2010. His sentence was backdated to take account of a period spent in custody before he was released on bail. 

EEDENS: taking into account the matter on the Form 1, imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year, 9 months and 18 days, commencing on 7 February 2010. His sentence also was backdated to take account of a period he had been in custody before he was released on bail. 

Facts 

6As a result of a controlled operation by police, Ryan Kirkbride met with an undercover operative on three occasions in February 2009. On each occasion Kirkbride supplied the undercover officer with tablets containing ecstasy, for which the officer paid cash. In all, some 172 grams of tablets were supplied, with an average purity of 22%. The total amount paid by the undercover officer was $7,750. This constituted the first count against Kirkbride, supplying a commercial quantity of the drug. 

7Early in March 2009, Kirkbride agreed to supply the undercover officer with 2,000 ecstasy tablets for $21,000. He arranged for the tablets to be obtained by Wade McIlery, who required payment before supplying the drugs. 

8In the afternoon of 4 March 2009, Shannon Knight communicated with Dean Eedens by coded text messages concerning the supply of the drugs. The effect of Eedens' response was that the venture might not be profitable if the drugs were of poor quality. McIlrey told Kirkbride that he could supply the drugs, but could do nothing about it if their quality was poor. 

9In the early evening of 4 March, Kirkbride met the undercover operative in the car park of a hotel at Greystanes. They discussed the delivery of the drugs and payment for them. The undercover officer was not prepared to pay the money before the drugs were handed over. Kirkbride said that he would try to arrange for the drugs be supplied at the time of payment, and they agreed to meet later that night. 

10Later, after 7pm, Kirkbride met Knight and McIlrey at the hotel in Greystanes. Knight left with McIlrey in McIlrey's car. Shortly thereafter, again through coded text messages, Eedens conveyed to Knight that the quality of the drugs was ""okay."" 

11At 9:30pm, Eedens left his home and drove to Penrith. On the way, he stopped at a house, where he picked up a box containing 2000 tablets. He drove to the car park of a McDonald's restaurant at Penrith, where Kirkbride had arranged to meet the undercover officer. Kirkbride, McIlrey and Knight arrived in McIlrey's car. Knight got out of McIlrey's car and into Eedens' car, where he looked at the tablets. Kirkbride got into the undercover officer's car, and told him that someone had the 2000 tablets nearby, that his supplier would take the payment from the undercover officer and return with the drugs. Police then approached and arrested all four offenders. 

12The tablets weighed a little under 500 grams, and contained 1-benylpiperazine of a purity of 16.5%. That drug has similar effects to ecstasy. It was these events that led to the second count against Kirkbride, supplying a commercial quantity of the drug, and the count of being knowingly concerned in that supply against Knight, McIlrey and Eedens. 

13Police searched Kirkbride's house and found $1500 in cash, 26 tablets and some powder containing methylamphetamine, and a small quantity of powdered cocaine. This gave rise to charges of dealing with the suspected proceeds of crime, (deemed) supply of the methylamphetamine and possession of the cocaine, which were dealt with on the Form 1. The offence on the Form 1 in Eedens' case was his possession of a small quantity of an anabolic steroid, which was found in his car at the time of his arrest. 

The application 

14The only ground of each of the applications relates to the relativity between the sentence passed upon the applicant and that passed upon one or more of the co-offenders. In each case it is complained that a comparison between the sentences in question leave the applicant with a justifiable sense of grievance. 

15Given the limited scope of the applications, particularly as they were refined in oral argument, it is not necessary to examine the defendants' subjective cases. All of them were young men with no criminal history, or none of any significance. Their backgrounds had been marked by difficulties of one kind or another, which elicited sympathy for them. All of them had had a pattern of drug abuse commencing in their teenage years. Each had pleaded guilty in the Local Court and, broadly speaking, their prospects of rehabilitation were favourable. 

16None of the applicants relied upon his subjective case as a basis for challenging the relativity of his sentence to that of other offenders. In written submissions on behalf of Kirkbride and McIlrey reference was made to authorities dealing with the relevance to sentence of the fact that an offence was committed in the course of an undercover operation, but this issue was not pursued at the hearing. The argument focused upon the role of each of the offenders in the offence in which they were all involved, that is, the supply of 1-benylpiperazine on 4 March 2009. 

17Kirkbride, of course, faced two charges. As to the first charge, the sentencing judge noted that he became involved in the supply of drugs to the undercover operative in February 2009, and that the deals were not ""small street level deals"" but involved a considerable quantity of drugs and substantial sums of money. However, her Honour considered that there was not ""anything particularly sophisticated"" about the planning of the offences. As to the offence of 4 March 2009, she was unsure whether Kirkbride knew that he was dealing with 1-benylpiperazine instead of ecstasy, but considered that of no moment because he was supplying a significant quantity of an illegal drug for the purpose of financial gain. 

18Her Honour accepted that Kirkbride became engaged in his illegal activity to reduce his drug debt and to fund his habit, but did not see that as a mitigating factor. She noted, however, that there was no evidence to suggest that he had ""surrounded himself by the trappings of wealth."" She described his role as the ""principal of this enterprise."" She found the first count against him to be below the mid-range of objective gravity, but the second count to be within the mid-range. 

19Her Honour found the determination of the role of Shannon Knight to be ""a difficult task."" After examining the course of events initiated by Kirkbride's request to McIlrey to assist him in sourcing 2,000 ecstasy tablets, including Knight's contact with Eedens, she concluded that Knight was ""a facilitator in the supply of a significant quantity of prohibited drugs."" She added that he was ""obviously aware that he was facilitating the supply of 2,000 tablets to someone who was going to supply that bulk quantity,"" but that he had ""no way of knowing who the ultimate users would be."" 

20Her Honour observed that drug trafficking ""is often undertaken using facilitators so that the buyers and sellers can distance themselves in an attempt to avoid detection and being brought to justice."" She described it as ""a role which will still attract significant culpability and require a deterrent sentence."" She noted, however, that there was no evidence to suggest that Knight became involved for financial gain or even to receive drugs in return for his assistance. She found that there was ""simply no explanation"" why he chose to become involved in the enterprise to the extent that he did. 

21Her Honour found that McIlrey's involvement was to provide Kirkbride with the 2000 tablets, which he believed to be ecstasy tablets. She noted that it was he who was insistent upon receiving payment before the drugs were supplied, and who expressed concern about the quality of them. She concluded that he was ""actively involved in the organisation of the supply of this significant quantity of illicit substances..."" She added that not only did he source the drugs ""but he drove others around and thereby contributed to the deal that was taking place."" She found that, like Knight, he ""facilitated the transaction taking place"", being ""well aware of what he was involving himself in, that is, the dissemination of a significant quantity of illicit drugs to another person for distribution to the community at large."" She noted that he did not expect payment for his role as driver. Rather, he expected to receive some ecstasy tablets, although there had been no agreement to that effect. 

22Her Honour found the involvement of Knight and McIlrey to be greater than that of Eedens. She found, nevertheless, that their offence fell below the mid-range of objective gravity. 

23Her Honour referred to Eedens' involvement, commencing with his communications with Knight and concluding with his collecting the drugs and delivering them to the car park where the transaction was to take place. She described his role as ""no more than that of a courier"" and saw his criminality as ""at the lowest level"" of all those involved. He also expected to be rewarded by receiving some drugs for his own use. 

24In her remarks her Honour noted that the four offenders had not been charged ""as part of a joint criminal enterprise"", and that the role of each of them was to be ""considered in isolation albeit that they are all part of one transaction which occurred on 4 March 2009."" This, of course, is not to suggest that there should not be appropriate proportionality or relativity between the sentences passed on all four of them in relation to that transaction: Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60, 77 NSWLR 540, per Campbell JA at [200] - [203] and Howie J at [245] - [246]. Plainly enough, this is what her Honour sought to do by her careful analysis of the roles of each of the offenders in the transaction. 

Kirkbride 

25The ground of Kirkbride's application is that the difference between the sentence passed upon him for the second count and that passed upon Knight and McIlrey is such as to leave him with a justifiable sense of grievance. 

26For count two, Kirkbride was sentenced to imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period, in round figures, of 5 years and 5 months. For knowingly taking part in the same offence, Knight and McIlrey were both sentenced to imprisonment for 4 1/2 years with a non-parole period, again in round figures, of 2 years and 9 months. Counsel for Kirkbride, Mr Doyle, submitted that such a marked difference in sentence was unjustified. 

27It is true, as Mr Doyle pointed out, that the fact that Kirkbride was charged with supplying the drug, while Knight and McIlrey were charged with knowingly taking part in that supply, is irrelevant for present purposes. The two offences carry the same maximum sentence, and an assessment of the objective gravity of either offence turns on the conduct of the offender in the case at hand. In support of the application, Mr Doyle argued that both Knight and McIlrey played an active role in the offence, such that their involvement was as culpable as that of Kirkbride. In relation to McIlrey, in particular, he noted his direction that he receive payment before the drug was handed over, and it was on that basis that Kirkbride arranged the meeting with the undercover officer. To that extent, Mr Doyle argued, McIlrey was ""dictating the terms of the engagement."" 

28Mr Doyle submitted that it was not open to her Honour to assess the objective gravity of Kirkbride's offence at the mid-range, and the gravity of the offence of Knight and McIlrey below that mid-range. I put to one side the question whether, in the light of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39, assessments in those terms were called for. The fact remains her Honour saw Kirkbride's involvement in the offence as more serious than that of the other two applicants. 

29For the reasons identified by her Honour, Kirkbride's role was more serious, and significantly so. As her Honour observed, his offence was part of a course of conduct, through his connection with the undercover officer, involving the supply of considerable quantities of drugs for substantial sums of money. That course of conduct is apparent from the first count against him, as well as the offences on the Form 1. He was fairly described as the principal of the enterprise. 

30It is in this sense that a comment her Honour made about parity between Kirkbride and his co-offenders, which was the subject of critical analysis in Mr Doyle's written submissions, must be understood. What her Honour said, referring to Kirkbride, was as follows: 

""His role can be distinguished from his co-offenders, he was involved to a far greater degree both before and during the offence committed on 4 March 2009. The issue of parity between him and his co-offenders does not arise."" 

I understand her Honour to have been saying no more than that Kirkbride's role required a heavier sentence than his co-offenders. I do not understand her to have been abandoning any attempt to achieve proportionality in the sentences she passed on each of the offenders. 

31That said, if for the purpose of sentence the transaction of 4 March 2009 stood alone, it might seem difficult to justify the imposition upon Kirkbride of a sentence double that imposed upon Knight and McIlrey. However, it did not stand alone. It was in sentencing for the second count that her Honour took into account the matters on the Form 1, although she found that they were ""not so serious as to call for significant increase in the sentence ... ."" More importantly, the sentence on the second count was almost wholly concurrent with the sentence on the first count. No doubt with an eye to totality, it was accumulated only to the extent of 6 months. To compare the sentence on the second count with the sentence passed upon Knight and McIlrey without regard to its place in the structure of Kirkbride's sentences would be artificial. 

32In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that the difference between the sentence passed upon Kirkbride and that upon Knight and McIlrey leaves him with a justifiable sense of grievance. The ground of his application is not made out. 

Knight and McIlrey 

33The ground of the application by each of Knight and McIlrey is that a comparison of the sentence passed upon the applicant with that passed upon Eedens leaves him with a justifiable sense of grievance. 

34Counsel for Knight was Ms Francis. McIlrey was represented by Mr Johnston of counsel, who had not prepared the written submissions. He adopted the submissions of Ms Francis. It will be remembered that the sentence of both Knight and McIlrey was imprisonment for 4 1/2 years with a non-parole period (rounded off) of 2 years and 9 months. Eedens was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period, also rounded off, of 1 year and 10 months. 

35The submission of Ms Francis, adopted by Mr Johnston on behalf of McIlrey, was that the role of Knight could not be distinguished from that of Eedens. She noted that it was Eedens whom Knight contacted to obtain the drugs, that there were text messages between them in the afternoon and the evening of the day in question, and that Eedens reported that drugs of adequate quality were available. She described Knight as the middleman between the purchaser's contact, McIlrey, and the ultimate supplier's contact, Eedens. Put another way, Eedens was the ""link in the chain to the ultimate supplier"" and Knight was the ""link in the chain to the ultimate purchaser."" 

36Ms Francis argued that the participation of Knight and Eedens in the offence was comparable. Mr Johnston made the same submission in respect of McIlrey. 

37I can see the force of that approach, but it was open to her Honour to make the distinction she did. As the Crown prosecutor pointed out, Eedens had no dealings with Kirkbride or McIlrey. It was McIlrey who was given the task by Kirkbride of sourcing the drugs and, as has been noted, he took the initiative of requiring payment before they were supplied. Knight took up the quest for the drugs through contact with Eedens, enquiring about their quality. Both McIlrey and Knight, her Honour found, knew that they were involved in the supply of a significant quantity of drugs which, they understood, would be distributed within the community. 

38Her Honour did not make a finding that Eedens had that knowledge. He told a psychologist, who prepared a report for the sentence proceedings, that when he was asked if he could access drugs, he said that he could but did not ask ""what it was for."" He gave evidence, not challenged in cross-examination, that he told the truth when interviewed by the psychologist. Clearly, it was he who was the conduit to the supplier of the drugs, whoever that might have been. Nevertheless, her Honour's finding that his role was that of a courier, and was less culpable than that of McIlrey and Knight, was open on the facts. I might add that the offence on the Form 1 in his case was of minimal significance. 

39Refreshingly, this was a case in which all four offenders were dealt with by the same judge in the same proceedings. Her Honour was well placed to assess the relative criminality of the offenders and to mark relevant distinctions between them by the sentences imposed: Dwayhi and Bechara v R [2011] NSWCCA 67, 205 A Crim R 274, per Johnson J at [32] - [47]. The ground of the application by each of Knight and McIlrey is not made out. 

Orders 

40In each application, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 

41Johnson J: I agree with Hidden J.

		23 December 2011",2011-12-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758407,R v FERNANDO [2011] NSWSC 1556,"Judgment  Introduction  1On 5 August 2011 Shamin Fernando (the accused) was originally arraigned upon a charge that on the 22 nd of August 2010 at Glebe she murdered Vincent Fernando (the deceased).  To that charge she has pleaded not guilty on the ground of mental illness  2On 24 October 2011 the Accused made an election pursuant to s32(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 for the charge against her to be tried by a Judge alone.  Pursuant to that section the accused indicated that before her election she had sought and obtained advice.  The Director of Public Prosecutions consented to the accused's election.  3Accordingly, the trial of the accused proceeded before me on that basis on 7 December 2011.  Background to the fatal incident  4On 7 December 2011 the Crown tendered three volumes of material which were admitted into evidence and marked respectively Exhibit A1, A2 and A3.  Exhibit A3 contained, amongst other documents, statements of the Captain of the Sydney Pistol Club, the transcript of an electronically recorded interview conducted with the accused on Sunday 22 August 2010, the autopsy report dated 9 March 2011 and other statements and materials arising from police investigations in relation to the fatal incident.  5Exhibit A2 and A3 contained clinical notes and medical reports concerning the accused's medical treatment and hospitalisation including over a period of several years before the incident.  6The hearing proceeded upon the basis that those who had provided evidentiary statements were not required to be called by the Crown or cross-examined.  In other words there was no dispute as to the essential underlying facts concerning events leading up to the death of the deceased.  7The accused is the daughter of the deceased.  8In June 2010 she made inquiries about joining the Sydney Pistol Club.  She first attended the Club on or about 27 June 2010 and there underwent a safety course.  She failed the initial course.  Subsequently, the accused re-attended and passed the safety course.  On 4 July 2010 she was approved as a probationary member at the Club.  She completed course forms in which she crossed ""no"" when declaring if she had "" any mental illness or other disorders that may prevent you from using a firearm safely"".  9The accused subsequently attended the Woollahra Club on 10 July 2010 where she filled out a form.  She again crossed the answer ""no"" to the mental health question.  Subsequently, under supervision, she shot targets with a rifle.  10On 22 August 2010 the accused attended the Sydney Pistol Club stating that she wished to shoot in the match of the day.  The Club had procedures for securing club pistols.  Club members under those procedures were required to sign guns out on a guns log.  The accused was given a Club owners .22 calibre Ruger semi-automatic pistol.  She used it at the shooting range and later she put it in her handbag and left the Club with the gun in her possession.  11Later that afternoon an officer at the Club, who had initial possession of the guns used there noticed that the Ruger pistol was missing.  He did not have the accused's phone number and could not make telephone contact.  He contacted a person at the Club who tried to contact the accused but it appeared that contact was attempted on what was a wrong number.  12Members of the Club made contact with police at 3.12pm.  At 3.14pm the accused rang police.  She confessed to having shot the deceased.  Police attended, secured the crime scene and took the accused to Balmain police station.  Initially she refused to be interviewed on advice.  However, subsequently, she did participate in an interview.  13In the interview (the ERISP) the accused was asked:  Q114...In as much detail as you can, can you tell me what happened at the unit this afternoon.  A.  At about quarter to 2.00 or so I rang the old man, asked him if he could come round and load some software onto my computer and he said, Yes, what time?  And I said, About 3.00.  And he came round around 3.00 and sat down at the computer.  And I went into my bedroom and pulled out the gun and opened the bedroom door, shot him a couple of times and he got up and kind of yelled in pain, and sort of tried to go into the kitchen, and then I shot him a couple of other times, and then he fell on the floor.  And I wasn't sure if he was dead or not, but he was kind of making these sounds, so I thought be wasn't dead, so I went back to the bedroom and loaded up a couple more rounds and came back out and shot him again three times when he was laying between the kitchen and the, the main part of the house, the lounge room or whatever.  And then he stopped moving.  Well I'd thought he'd stopped moving.  Then I sat down for a little while and I was wondering if the neighbours would come or, or whatever, but nothing really happened.  So then I went, got the phone and called Triple 0, told them that I needed the police and that I'd told them my name, my address and, and then she asked me all these questions, and she said to stay on the phone...""  14The ERISP also records the following questions to and answers by the accused.  Q123  OK. So that's when you spoke to him on his mobile.  A.  Spoke to him directly on the mobile, yeah, at 19 minutes past 2.00.  Q.124  And why did you ask him to come round?  What was the purpose of him coming around?  When you made the phone call what were you thinking?  A.  I wanted to shoot him.  Q.125  So when you made the phone call you wanted to shoot him?  A. Yes  Q.126 So why did you ask him to come around and load software on your computer?  A. If I asked him to come round so I could shoot him I don't think he'd come.  Q. 127  Fair enough.  So when you spoke to him at 2.19..  A. Yeah.  Q128.  ... what did you say to him?  Do you remember?  A.  Yeah, I said, He he said Yeah, I just got your message.  Q.129 Yeah  A. We've been in the garden.  When do you want me to come round?  And I said, At, I looked at my watch and it was 2.19, so I said about 3.00 o'clock.  And he said Yep, OK, I'll I'll come round then.  Q.130 So what time did he arrive at your unit, do you remember?  A. I think a little after 3.00.  Q.131 A little after 3.00  A. Yeah.  Q.132 And --  A. About two minutes after 3.00.  Q.133 Just, what did he do, what happened when he arrived at the unit?  A.  I opened --  Q. 134  Did you say anything to him?  A.  Yeah, I opened the door and said to come in and I said I needed to edit an interview tonight and if I could do it here it would make work tomorrow much more smooth.  And I've got the disc here, the computer was on and he went to sit down, and it's one of those ergonomic chairs, and showed him how to sit down.  And then he said, Well what you have to do first is to, he said, You go into accessories and then the menu for some sort of setting.  And he said, What you do is you, you put this down and you click system restore, that way if anything happens you won't lose anything.  And I just got annoyed with him them [sic] and said, I'm just going to the loo.  And went back into the bedroom and then got the gun.  Q. 135 Where was the gun in the bedroom?  A. It was on my bed under the quilt.  Q. 136 Under the quilt?  A.  Yeah.  Q.137 And your bed, what sort of bed have you got?  A. It is double innerspring mattress queen size, yeah.  Q. 138 When did you put the gun under the quilt?  A. At about, at about quarter to 3.00.  Q. 139 OK.  And why did you put it under the quilt?  A. So he wouldn't see it.  Q. 140 OK So you removed the gun from under the quilt.  A. Yeah, before I shot him.  15On the evidence tendered in the Crown case there is no dispute but that the following matters were established by the evidence:-  (i) The deceased Vincent Fernando died at Unit 12, 2 Victoria Street, Glebe on 22 August 2010;  (ii) Vincent Fernando's death was caused by gunshot wounds to his head.  (iii) That the accused inflicted the injuries to Vincent Fernando which caused his death  16Subject to what follows about the accused's mental condition, I formally record that I find that each of the elements of the offence of murder which the Crown is obliged to prove beyond reasonable doubt have been made out.  17The sole issue requiring the court's determination turns upon an assessment of the accused's mental condition.  In R v Jennings [2005] NSWSC 789 Kirby J addressed the defence of mental illness in the following terms at [25]-[28]:-  "" The law, as you would expect, is fundamentally concerned with holding people accountable, that is, responsible, for their actions. It is recognised, however, that a person may not be responsible for what they do by reason of mental illness. However, there are degrees of mental illness. A person may be totally impaired at the time they commit a breach of the law, or their impairment may be less than total, although still substantial.  The defence of mental illness arises where the accused satisfies the Court, as a matter of probability, that, at the time of committing the act, he comes within what is known as the M'Naghten rule ((1833) 10 Cl and Fin 200 [8ER 718]). The M'Naghten rule has two limbs. The accused must demonstrate either that he was labouring under such a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, that he did not know the nature and quality of his act or, alternatively, if he did know, then he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. The first limb, in lay terms, requires that the accused did not know what he was doing, whereas the second deals with his appreciation of the morality of what he was doing, that is, whether it was right or wrong.  Here, Mr Jennings told the police that he knew that when he wielded the knife he was attempting to stab the victim. And, of course, he did stab the victim. The issue, therefore, is whether, as a matter of probability, he did not appreciate that what he was doing was morally wrong, and that because of mental illness which deprived him of the ability to reason and form judgments. Where the defence is made out, the appropriate verdict is ""not guilty by reason of mental illness"" (s38 Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990) (""the Act""). The person, however, is not then released. In accordance with s39 of the Act, a person, the subject of such a verdict, is detained ""in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law"". A person subject to an order made under s39 becomes a forensic patient under the jurisdiction and supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, which makes recommendations to the Minister (Mental Health Act 1990, s81).  Where, as here, the issue of M'Naghten mental illness is raised, whether by the Crown or the accused, or, indeed, by the Judge, the onus rests upon the accused to prove that defence on the balance of probabilities (R v Ayoub (1984) 2 NSWLR 511 at 515)...""  18In considering the second limb of the M'Naghten test, it is convenient to set out what was said by Dixon J (as his honour then was) in R v Porter (1936) 55 CLR 182 at (189-190):-  ""The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by ""wrong""? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people.""  The psychiatric evidence  (a) The reports  19Dr Bruce Westmore, on behalf of the accused, and Dr Olav Nielssen, for the Crown, both specialists psychiatrists, were requested to examine and prepare psychiatric opinions in respect of the accused.  Dr Westmore's report of 18 April 2011 was tendered and became Exhibit 1.  The report of Dr Nielssen dated 30 August 2011 was tendered and became Exhibit B in the proceedings.  20Neither Dr Westmore nor Dr Nielssen were required to give oral evidence. Accordingly, the Crown and the accused relied upon Exhibit 1 and Exhibit B as comprehensively dealing with all relevant issues associated with the accused's psychiatric condition.  21I will return below to an analysis of those opinions.  Before doing so, I set out relevant details concerning the accused.  (b) The accused  22The accused was aged 43 years at the date of the fatal incident on 22 August 2010 (date of birth 16 July 1967).  She is accordingly presently 44 years of age.  23According to the material in Exhibits A1, 2 and 3 and the history contained in the medical reports, the accused was born in Colombo, Sri Lanka and came to Australia with her family at the age 4.  She was raised in Sydney.  She was educated to year 12 although because she missed one subject she did not get her HSC certificate on the conclusion of year 12.  She was given a Certificate of Attainment.  24The accused attended TAFE in 1989 and repeated her HSC.  According to the history she provided to Dr Westmore she was above average in most of the subjects.  25She was initially employed in advertising agencies and then worked for a record company and at times in a bar and as a waitress.  She undertook market research work and she told Dr Westmore that she at one stage worked as a primary school teacher.  She was experienced in data entry.  She later obtained a part time job with a community radio station.  She held such a position as at the date of the fatal shooting.  26According to the history provided by the accused to Dr Nielssen she completed two years of a Bachelor of the Sydney Arts course at university before completing a Bachelor of Communications at the University of Technology, Sydney.  It appears that her first employment occurred in the year 1998.  27Exhibit A2 contains clinical notes and reports of the accused's treating psychiatrist, Dr Deborah Rozea and those of Dr Keith-Y Chee, consultant psychiatrist.  28Dr Chee in his report of 6 December 2001 written to Dr Rozea recorded a history of the accused having suffered from a paranoid psychosis since 1988.  In that report Dr Chee observed:-  ""Her predominant delusion is that of a global conspiracy against her, engineered by her father and a former teacher.  She believes that she is under surveillance, that her personal details are being broadcast and that information is being withheld from her."": Exhibit A2 at 362  29It was also stated in the report that the accused was a suitable candidate for the Clozapine Program (Clozapine is an anti-psychotic medication).  30A number of reports written by Dr Rozea in the period from 29 June 2007 to 20 August 2008 were in evidence.  Dr Rozea treated the accused from 2000.  She recorded that the accused presented with unstable schizophrenia and a major depressive disorder.  In a report written on 21 March 2008 Dr Rozea reported that the accused had responded well to Clozapine and had been stable for some years.  Dr Rozea however noted that when there was an attempt to reduce the dosage and cease the medication, the accused became quite unwell.  She recorded that the accused had been compliant with Dr Chee's advice and her recommendation to re-start her Clozapine medication and she had become stable again at the time of that report  31The clinical notes in relation to medical examinations indicated the accused was under regular review and the medication prescribed for her condition was varied from time to time.  The last record of an attendance for medical review before the fatal incident on 22 August 2010 was on 13 August 2010.  The note for that attendance records, amongst other matters:-  "" ...  no evidence of psychosis.  Calm, coherent, logical...""  Psychiatric medical opinion  32Dr Westmore is a highly experienced forensic psychiatrist.  He examined the accused on 9 April 2011 at which time the accused was detained in a correctional centre.  Dr Westmore had available to him relevant clinical notes and records of the treating psychiatrics as well as some notes which the accused herself had made.  Dr Westmore set out the history as provided by the accused to him including in particular a history of her prior hospitalisation in 2001 at Rozelle Hospital, Wesley Hospital and her admission to St John of God Hospital in December 2001.  Each of these hospital admissions related treatment for psychiatric symptoms.  Dr Westmore questioned the accused as to what had happened up to the fatal incident.  The accused replied:-  "" ... For a long time I struggled with the paranoid belief that I was in a pseudo reality style TV show and that it was being produced by my father and also there were a lot of sinister aspects to that.""  33The accused continued by stating:-  ""the biggest one was that I had several serious terminal illnesses and if I couldn't extradite myself from the show I was going to die.  Just before the incident I became quite convinced that death was imminent.  I thought I had AIDS, thyroid cancer, Alzheimer's and really bad diabetes that would require my legs to be amputated.""  34The accused continued:-  ""The only way I could get out of the show and save my life was to kill him.""  35In answer to a question from Dr Westmore as to how long she had had such thoughts, the accused replied:-  "" I started believing I was in the TV show from February 1998 but the thought that it was a real emergency and I had to kill him started in about June 2010.""  36Dr Westmore's report included an account of the accused's drug and alcohol history.  This included the accused's account of having started smoking cannabis at the age of 16 and occasionally other drugs.  Cannabis was said to be the principal drug of use and that she smoked the drug daily between the ages of 20 and 22.  She said that she then suffered a psychotic episode and stopped using the drug.  37The history contained an account of her having again started smoking cannabis in about 1995 and was smoking that drug heavily until 2000.  She said to Dr Westmore that she stopped again after she was admitted to the Rozelle Hospital.  38The accused acknowledged to Dr Westmore in relation to her actions (at p.6):-  ""...the basic, most fundamental thing is that it is wrong to take a life legally but at the time I thought I was acting in self defence the similar way to people in violent domestic situations or where someone is in the situation where you have to defend yourself, like in a war.  I thought that was the only way out, to be free and given the circumstances I would be vindicated but I'm not a violent person, I haven't been involved in violence before.""  39Dr Westmore reached a provisional diagnosis that the accused suffered from a psychotic illness, namely a chronic paranoid schizophrenic illness.  He noted that the accused had had a long history of suffering psychiatric symptoms at least at the time she first consulted a psychiatrist in 1988.  He considered that the accused would have available to her a defence of mental illness:-  ""... she was suffering from a disease of mind, specifically a psychotic illness, most likely a paranoid schizophrenic illness, at the time she killed her father.  She was acting on delusional beliefs in relation to her father when she killed him.  The disease of the mind would have totally deprived her of the capacity to know that she ought not to do the act"".  40Dr Westmore stated that the accused would require indefinite psychiatric support and supervision.  41Dr Nielssen is also a highly experienced forensic psychiatrist.  He saw the accused whilst in custody on 11 August 2011.  He identified in his report the detailed material that had been supplied to him for the purposes of assessing the accused.  He set out in his report a detailed history which, in general terms, was consistent with the history recorded by Dr Westmore.  The history which he obtained from the accused included periods of heavy cannabis use in particular from the period after she had left home up to the year 2000.  42One noteworthy matter in the accused's history and arising from Dr Nielssen's report is the possible role that cannabis may play in relation to schizophrenia, which, on the probabilities, contributed to the accused's illness.  In that respect Dr Nielssen noted:-  ""The diagnosis of cannabis abuse disorder is made on the basis of the history of past regular use of cannabis and the probable role of cannabis use in triggering her schizophrenic illness.""  43He noted references in Dr Rozea's notes to delusional material.  He also noted that the accused's responses in the ERISP were coherent and detailed.  He considered that the overall history obtained by Dr Westmore was largely consistent with the history that he had obtained from the accused.  Dr Nielssen diagnosed:-  (i) Chronic schizophrenia, (then) currently in partial remission.  (ii) Cannabis abuse disorder, also in remission.  44Dr Nielssen expressed his opinion as follows:- (at pp 7-8)  "" The diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia is made on the basis of the history of symptoms of the disorder provided by Ms Fernando, the detailed corroborative information in the medical reports and in Ms Ferando's mother's statement, and aspects of her presentation during the recent interview when she was quite blunted and incongruous in her emotional responses, had concrete and inflexible thinking consistent with the intellectual impairment associated with chronic mental illness and seemed ambivalent in her description of her delusional beliefs and unable to recognise some of her symptoms.]  45Dr Nielssen further concluded that at the time of the offence the accused was affected by an acute exacerbation of her chronic mental illness.  He stated that he believed that the accused had the defence of mental illness open to her.  He said in this respect:- (at p8)  ""... At the time of the offence she was affected by an acute exacerbation of chronic schizophrenia, which is a disease of the brain which produces a pattern of abnormality of mind that is recognised in law to be a disease of the mind.  Her mental illness gave rise to a defect of reason in the form of an elaborate and bizarre delusional belief regarding her father and what she believed to be his role in tormenting her.""  46Whilst Dr Nielssen noted that the accused was clearly aware of the physical nature of her act in her deliberate plan to obtain access to a firearm and lure her father to her home to shoot him, he nonetheless stated:-  "" ...  However, I believe she was deprived of the ability to recognise that her actions were morally wrong, as she seemed to be unconcerned about the effect of her actions as she described them to the police and believed that she would be pardoned for killing her father after exposing his role in her persecution.""  47He noted that the exacerbation of her mental illness deprived her of the ability to recognise that her beliefs were delusional.  Accordingly, he said, they deprived her of the ability to reason with sense and composure about the nature of her symptoms or consider the alternative courses of action available to her.  48Dr Nielssen concluded by stating that the accused "" ... will require long term supervision from a forensic mental health service and indefinite treatment with an adequate dose of anti-psychotic medication "" (at p9).  49The Crown prepared a comprehensive summary of the accused's psychiatric history based on clinical notes and reports copies of which are contained in Exhibits A1, A2 and A3.  The summary is contained within those Exhibits and covers the period 1998 to 17 August 2010.  50The summary indicates that a initial diagnosis of schizophrenia appears to have been made in 1998 when the accused attended on a Dr Jennings and her first hospital admission for psychiatric symptoms was to Rozelle Hospital on 30 December 2000.  She commenced psychotherapy with Dr Deborah Rozea on 7 June 2001.  Particular entries evidence reported delusions affecting the accused including delusions involving her father, as long ago as 6 December 2001.  Similar delusions were noted on 28 April 2004 and 26 May 2004 and 19 December 2007.  Submissions  51The learned Crown Prosecutor, by way of final submission, affirmed, on the basis of all the material in evidence that the appropriate verdict is one of not guilty by reason of mental illness.  52As to the verdict and order, in the event of a finding that the defence of mental illness is made, the Crown took no issue with the suggested terms of the verdict and order as formulated in paragraph 9 of Mr Stratton's written submissions.  53Subsequent to the hearing on 7 December 2011 I received communications on behalf of the Crown and the accused as to the appropriate placement of the accused in a forensic hospital.  I refer to the email received from Mr Stratton 13 December 2011 which has been marked as MFI 1 and a letter from Dr Gordon Elliott Staff Specialist Psychiatrist, Justice Health dated 13 December 2011 which has been tendered and marked Exhibit ""2"".  54In Exhibit 2, Dr Elliott stated that in the event that the defence of mental illness is accepted the most appropriate placement for the accused is the Forensic Hospital at Long Bay.  He stated that she needs long term psychiatric care and has more acute considerations regarding her care and treatment that can only be addressed in the hospital setting.  55Dr Elliott stated that if the accused is found not guilty under s39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 he anticipates that she will be given a prompt hearing by the Mental Health Tribunal under s44 of that Act.  56On behalf of the accused, Mr Stratton SC, who appeared for the accused, confirmed in his written submissions that the only issue in the case was whether or not the accused has, on the balance of probabilities, established the defence of mental illness.  In that respect, the relevant test of mental illness was addressed in the written submissions.  Particular references were made to the conclusions expressed by Doctors Westmore and Neilssen in the submissions.  57Mr Stratton submitted that the appropriate order was for an order pursuant to s39(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Procedures) Act.  58Mr Stratton also submitted that the court would find that the defence of mental illness had been made out and that the court would return a verdict that the accused was not guilty of the charge of murder by reason of mental illness.  59He submitted that an order ought to be made that the accused be detained at Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre or such other place as determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until the accused is released by due process of law.  Determination  60Subject to the issue of mental illness I have earlier indicated that the elements of the charge of murder have been established by the evidence in the Crown case.  On the question of the accused's mental condition at the time of the fatal incident the evidence, in my opinion, it is clearly established that the accused does have available to her the defence of mental illness.  I accordingly determine that by reason of such mental illness the accused is not guilty of the charge of murder.  Orders  61In accordance with s38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 I find the accused is not guilty of murder by reason of mental illness.  62I order that the accused, Sharmin Fernando, be detained pursuant to s39(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, in an appropriate correctional centre or such facility as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine until released by due process of law. .  I note Dr Gordon Elliott in his report of 13 December 2011 has suggested that if the accused's plea of not guilty by reason of mental illness is accepted by the court that the most appropriate placement for her is in the Forensic Hospital at Long Bay.  63The court recommends that the Mental Health Review Tribunal give consideration to transferring Ms Fernando to a secure forensic hospital as soon as possible.  64The Registrar is to notify the Minister for Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the terms of the orders made by the Court.  I direct that the reports of Dr Nielssen and Dr Westmore be drawn to the attention of Justice Health.  **********

2758414,R v COUSENS [2011] NSWSC 1375,"Judgment 

1RS HULME J: On 22 June 2011 William David Cousens was convicted by a jury of the murder of Phillip Brennan between 28 May and 19 June 1990. 

2Mr Cousens now stands to be sentenced. I instruct myself that any conclusions at which I arrive in the process must be consistent with the verdict of the jury, that insofar as I make other findings adverse to the prisoner, I must be satisfied of them beyond reasonable doubt, but that I am only required to be satisfied of matters in mitigation on the balance of probabilities. 

3Mr Brennan was last seen by the Prisoner's wife at about 5.30 to 6.00 pm in the afternoon of Monday 28 May 1990 at the Pleasure Lea Caravan Park, Batemans Bay. His body was discovered on 19 June 1990 in bushland some 14 kilometres to the north. Post-mortem examination showed that he had suffered from the discharge of at least, and I think probably, three shotgun cartridges. One caused an entry and exit wound in the abdomen. Another shot entered the chest, probably causing some injury to the heart. A third was to the back of the skull. The track leading from that wound led to an exit wound near the top of the head on the right. A shotgun unitising wad was located in the skull. The post-mortem examination showed the inhaling of some shotgun pellets. This and the fact that the head wound have been almost instantly fatal leads to the conclusion that the chest wound was the earlier of these two. The pathologist, Dr Duflou also thought it likely that the abdominal injury was sustained prior to the chest injury but said he could not be certain. Dr Duflou was hampered in his post-mortem by decomposition of the body and interference with it by animals. 

4For a number of years Mr Cousens and his wife had lived at Orbost in Victoria. The marriage had its strains, one of which was that Mrs Cousens had had an affair. In 1983 the couple and their three children Shane, Stacey and Jennifer moved to Batemans Bay where they took up residence at the caravan park. 

5In about February 1990 Mr Cousens himself had an affair with one Karen Montgomery, then Karen Cochrane. He informed his wife. Her reaction was to ask him to move out and he did, firstly living with Ms Montgomery and then taking his own flat. 

6In about March 1990 the deceased also commenced to live in the Caravan Park. Thereafter he and the Prisoner became friends. They both shared an interest in golf and played golf together. Mrs Cousens' evidence to this effect would suggest that it must have been some time after February that the Prisoner told her about his affair. 

7About 6 weeks after the Prisoner and his wife separated, Mrs Cousens and the deceased commenced an affair. Mr Cousens who, from time to time, visited his wife's caravan, inter alia, to see one of his children who was still living there, became aware of the affair. He expressed to his wife regret that relations between her and the deceased had advanced so far but she told her husband that it was none of his business. 

8On a number of occasions between March and as late as 28 May 1990, Mr Cousens indicated to his wife a desire to reconcile. On one occasion at his request she visited him at his place of work where he asked something to the effect, ""Why can't we get back together?"" Mrs Cousens probably said something to the effect that she did not intend to get back with him and Mr Cousens remarked that he did not have anything to live for. 

9Mrs Cousens responded to the effect, ""Perhaps as a family we may be able to have a meal together"". Next day a bunch of flowers arrived at her office accompanied by a note, ""Thanks for the hope"". These were sent by Mr Cousens. 

10On 28 May, Mr Cousens went to Mrs Cousens' office and again that day asked if they could get back together, saying, ""Phil won't stand in the way if we get back together"". Later that day, Mr Cousens asked her for the keys to her car in order to obtain possession of a chamois which was in the boot. The deceased's golf clubs were also there, although there was no evidence in the case to indicate that the sighting of these by Mr Cousens had any impact upon him. At around 4pm, Mrs Cousens left work, drove to the deceased's caravan where he regained possession of his golf clubs. She then went to her caravan and back to the deceased's for a cup of tea, remaining there for half to three quarters of an hour. She left, having invited the deceased for tea, but he did not provide any definitive response. When tea was ready Mrs Cousens sent her daughter Jennifer to the deceased's caravan to inform him of the fact but he was not there. His vehicle and caravan were locked, a light in or outside the caravan was on and when on 3 May 1990 police attended they found within the caravan, inter alia, the deceased's wallet containing $1,250 and on the table a half-full can of beer. 

11Notwithstanding the relationship between Mrs Cousens and the deceased, Mr Cousens and the deceased seemed to have remained on friendly terms. As late as 27 May 1990, Mr Cousens picked the deceased up from the Caravan Park and the two played golf together. That night there was a presentation of some prizes at the Catalina Golf Club and Mr and Mrs Cousens, the deceased and Ms Montgomery were seated together. There is evidence which suggests that there was an element of strain or embarrassment on the occasion but it is clear that it was not acrimonious. 

12Evidence in the trial indicated that Mr Cousens had attended the premises of Ms Montgomery on the afternoon of 28 May, leaving at a time variously said to be between 5.45pm and 6.30pm. He was seen at the Catalina Golf Club at a time variously estimated to be between 7pm and sometime after 7.30pm. A Mr McCarthy, who lived in another unit in the same block as that occupied by Mr Cousens, gave evidence suggesting that Mr Cousens had attended his own unit at about 6.45pm. A major issue in the case which the jury's verdict means they resolved adversely to Mr Cousens was whether Mr Cousens had time to be involved in the deceased's disappearance or death during that evening. 

13The only direct evidence of any antipathy Mr Cousens felt towards the deceased was provided by Mrs Cousens who said that some time after the deceased's disappearance, Mr Cousens called one night at a flat to which she had moved. In her bedroom he saw a photo of the deceased beside Mrs Cousens' bed, dropped the frame containing the photo on the floor, broke the glass with his foot, tore the photo up and said:- 

That's what I think of Phil, I didn't kill him but I wish I had. 

14Mr Cousens who gave evidence, denied any feelings of antipathy towards the deceased, saying in effect that if he was not to be reconciled with his wife, it was good she was with a good bloke, one who would do the right thing by her. In light of the jury's verdict, it is impossible to accept this evidence. I also accept the evidence referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. 

15Mention should be made of the fact that for some time prior to the deceased's death, Mr Cousens had owned a point 22 rifle and a semi-automatic shotgun capable of firing cartridges of a calibre consistent with the pellets and wadding found in the deceased's body. The shotgun had for a time been out of the Prisoner's possession, he having given it to a Mr Merchi with a view to superficial damage to its appearance being repaired. Although he had had the weapon for far more than sufficient time, Mr Merchi had not effected the repair and Mr Cousens had on a number of occasions requested its return. Mr Cousens, in fact, regained possession of the shotgun on the day before the deceased disappeared. When the police took possession of the shotgun on 6 June, they observed that it had recently been oiled but found nothing to otherwise suggest it had been recently used. Mr Cousens provided an account of the recent oiling which I found quite unpersuasive but, it is fair to say, which was not one on which he was substantially challenged. It struck me in the highest degree unlikely that the weapon needed oiling with the urgency which Mr Cousens said he afforded it. I do not find the evidence of rust on a wire brush which Mr Cousens possessed apparently for the purposes of cleaning the weapon argues compellingly against my scepticism. 

16The Crown case was entirely circumstantial. There was other evidence but what I have said amounts to a sufficient summary of the evidence for sentencing purposes. 

17The maximum penalty provided by s19A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. Pursuant to s 54A of that Act, a standard non-parole period of 20 years has been prescribed for an offence ""in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" unless the court determines there are reasons for setting a longer or shorter period. However that legislation applies only in respect of offences committed on or after 1 February 2003 and has no present relevance. 

18One matter to which reference should be made is the fact that, although all of the evidence adduced in the trial in June of this year was apparently available to the authorities in or soon after 1990, Mr Cousens was not charged until 5 February 2010, since which time he has been in custody. In 1992 the DPP advised that there was insufficient evidence to charge him. In October 1998 the Coroner in an inquest into Mr Brennan's death returned an open finding and in October 2008 proceedings in the Crime Commission resulted in some further statements by two of the witnesses. Either then or in recent years, some further evidence which the relevant witness did not recount in the trial and which the Crown Prosecutor conceded had elements of doubtful credibility became available. This inspired a further review within the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and this led to the decision to charge. Because of the reliance placed on the factors mentioned in this paragraph, it should be noted that Mr Cousens was interviewed by police on 6 and 16 June 1990. He denied involvement in Mr Brennan's disappearance. 

19It is also to be noted that the police have at all times known of Mr Cousens' whereabouts. He remained in Bateman's Bay until his arrest in 2003 on another charge. 

20Mr Cousens did not give evidence on sentence and no other evidence was called or tendered on his behalf. Mr Cousens was born in July 1950 and has a short but not insignificant criminal record. 

(i) In 1985 he was convicted, in Victoria, of aggravated burglary and released on a 5 years good behaviour bond. 

(ii) In 1992 he was convicted of assault and given a recognisance under s 556A. 

(iii) In 1996 he was convicted of driving with a mid-range PCA. 

(iv) In 1997 he was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, malicious damage and assault. The most severe of the sentences then imposed was 100 hours community service. 

(v) In 2003 he was convicted of inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. The sentence imposed was of 4 years including a non-parole period of 3 years, both such periods commencing on 14 April 2003. 

21The Crown tendered a statement from the victim of the first of these offences that said that Mr Cousens, wearing a stocking over his face, had broken into her home, grabbed her by the throat, after she had fallen, straddled her and held a knife to her throat. He spoke, she recognised him as a neighbour, used his name and he fled. Counsel for Mr Cousens correctly submitted that though this was the victim's statement, one could not be sure how much of it she had adhered to at trial. That is undoubtedly correct but the account does suggest that one should give full weight to the fact that the sentence imposed was of a very lengthy bond, and this for what was apparently Mr Cousens' first offence. 

22The penalties imposed for all other offences except the last were such as to indicate they were not very serious, although one cannot ignore the frequency of violence and the disregard of the rights of others. On the other hand, none of Mr Cousens' earlier offences come close to Mr Brennan's murder in violence and one must recognise also the nature of his motivation. Following the conclusion of the non-parole portion of the last sentence, the Prisoner, presumably a British citizen, was in October 2007 deported to England where he remained until extradited following his being charged with the murder of Mr Brennan. One might infer that when admitted to parole he will again be deported though this conclusion has no bearing on the sentence I should impose. 

23There was no evidence of any motive in Mr Cousens to kill Mr Brennan other than that of jealously or to increase the chances of Mrs Cousens agreeing to a reconciliation. The circumstances which were established are certainly calculated to lead to one or both of these motives and in the result I am satisfied to the requisite standard that it was one or both of these that inspired the killing. The circumstances referred to above also persuade me to the relevant standard that Mr Cousens must have induced Mr Brennan to leave his caravan at short notice and go with him to wherever he was shot and that Mr Cousens' intention was to kill Mr Brennan. For how long Mr Cousens held that intention it is impossible to determine, although it is equally impossible to do otherwise than conclude that the murder was premeditated. I do not feel able to conclude that all of Mr Cousens' efforts to repossess his shotgun were in order to use it against Mr Brennan. 

24The Crown described the murder as an ""execution style killing"". The description is appropriate, whether or not one accepts what I am about to say. Although Dr Duflou felt unable on the basis of his expertise to be positive as to the order of the shots, when regard is had also to the other evidence in the case, I am satisfied that the shot to the head was the last administered. Included in the evidence to which I have had regard in reaching this conclusion is the circumstance of Mr Brennan going with Mr Cousens, the direction of the shot to the head and what I see as the inherent unlikelihood of Mr Cousens having shot the deceased in that fashion, then shooting him in the front of the body. 

25The Crown drew my attention to the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and also to what was said in that regard by the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476 but it is not necessary that I set out those matters here. 

26There is a deal of authority in favour of the view that when persons are charged long after their offending, they should be sentenced in accordance with the sentencing practice current either at the time of their offending or when they could have, in the ordinary course, been expected to be tried - see eg R v MJR (2002) NSWLR 368; 130 A Crim R 481; AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51; 169 A Crim R 32 at [39]; PWB v R [2011] NSWCCA 84 at [55]. It is not necessary for present purposes to consider whether one of these possible times should be preferred to the other. Of course the application of the principle depends on it being possible to come to a conclusion as to sentencing practice at that time. In this case records are such that such a conclusion can be reached. 

27One further issue that arises is as to the extent to which the delay in sentencing is to be taken into account. There is no doubt that commonly extended delay between offending and trial has been regarded as a mitigating factor, at least when the offender has not been responsible for the delay, say by absconding - R v Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517; R v Wood [2008] NSWSC 1273. 

28Counsel for Mr Cousens sought to rely on delay in mitigation here, drawing attention to the fact that the evidence before the jury in Mr Cousens' trial was all known to the authorities in 1990 or thereabouts and it was their decision not to charge him. She submitted that had he then been charged and convicted, any term of imprisonment would, at least probably, by now have expired and he is young enough to have emerged from prison with opportunity and energy to do something with the rest of his life. Commencing a sentence now will almost certainly result in Mr Cousens being over 70 years when he emerges from prison - an age likely to be accompanied or soon followed by significant decline in his faculties. He has, she in effect submitted, ""already been punished to the extent of having this matter hanging over his head for the whole of a 20 year period"" - words taken from the remarks on sentence of Barr J in R v Wood [2008] NSWSC 1273. 

29I have no difficulty in accepting as general propositions, the matters referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. However, there are some further matters to take into account. The delay in prosecution has enabled Mr Cousens to be at liberty between the ages of 40 and 59 when he has had, one may infer, full enjoyment of his health and faculties. No doubt no one would relish the prospect of spending 15 years or so in prison but, faced with it and given a choice as to when, it is not obvious that everyone would choose between the ages of 40 and 60 rather than some later time. Nor has Mr Cousens chosen to put before me any evidence suggestive of him having suffered any significant detrimental impact in consequence of having the matter hanging over his head, and this even though he is the person best situated to know. 

30A question also arises whether the delay can be said to be the responsibility of the authorities and not of Mr Cousens. When questioned, he denied his guilt, a matter that would no doubt have been taken into account by anyone who was considering whether Mr Cousens should be charged. Of course he was entitled to remain silent and, if he chose to speak, it was within his power to say whatever he liked. However, having chosen to lie - as is the clear implication of the jury's verdict - it does not seem to me that he can say he has no responsibility for the delay that followed in the prosecution. In this connection I note that Barr J in R v Wood took the view that Wood could not call in aid as mitigating his sentence the first year or so of the delay that occurred in his case since it resulted from his own false assertion that the victim in that case had committed suicide. 

31In the result, while I do propose to mitigate the sentence to some degree for the delay that has occurred, that mitigation will be modest. 

32I am disposed also to give limited weight to Mr Cousens' criminal record. It does display a tendency to resort to violence and disregard the rights of others when it suits him but the offences on that record are radically different from that with which I am dealing both in Mr Cousens' actions and apparent motivation. That motivation and Mr Cousens' age when released from prison leads to the conclusion that he is unlikely to re-offend in the same way. Otherwise there is no evidence before me that enables me to come to any view as to Mr Cousens' prospects of rehabilitation. Consistently with his plea of not guilty, he has not expressed any remorse. 

33As indicated above, Mr Cousens is entitled to be sentenced in accordance with the sentencing standards operating at and about the time of his offence. A convenient indication of these is provided in the Judicial Commission publication ""Sentenced Homicides in New South Wales 1990 - 1993"", supplemented by a later work, ""Sentenced Homicides in New South Wales 1994 - 2001"". 

34In the former work it is recorded that, ""In summary, the typical sentence for murder under s 19A might be described as a minimum term of 12 years and an additional term of six years, making a total sentence of 18 years"" and that there was no clear difference in the distribution of sentences for guilty and non-guilty pleas. Of those sentenced under s 19A, more than one-third pleaded guilty. 

35In the later study, it was recorded that the median sentence for those who pleaded guilty was 18 years including a non-parole period of 12 years and for those who pleaded not guilty, the median sentence was 18 years including a non-parole period of 14 years. Given that any prosecution of Mr Cousens commenced in 1990 would almost certainly have led to his being sentenced appreciably before the end of 1993, it is to the earlier of the Judicial Commission monographs to which I will have regard. 

36Of course in the period covered by that survey there was a considerable range of sentences and the median while useful as a guide, otherwise says little about the sentence that should be imposed on Mr Cousens. His premeditation, his intent to kill and the callousness demonstrated in his execution of the deceased all tend to aggravate his criminality. He is, as I have indicated, entitled to some moderation of his sentence on account of delay. I note also that he is to be sentenced in accordance with the form of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as it existed prior to 2002. 

37Weighing up all of the matters to which I must have regard the appropriate sentence is as follows. 

38I sentence the Prisoner, Mr Cousens, to imprisonment for a period of 18 years, including a non-parole period of 14 years, both such periods to commence on 5 February 2010.

2758415,Liberty Mutual Insurance Company t/as Liberty International Underwriters v Valerio Enrico Zanotto [2011] NSWDC 202,"Judgment


	
	Valerio Zanotto (the insured), a councillor with Wollongong City Council, was insured by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (the insurer) under a ""Directors (Councillors) and Officers Insurance Policy"" (the policy) in relation to ""a loss resulting from a wrongful act"" (Exhibit A tab 1). The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) investigated allegations of dishonest conduct by the insured and others. The insured claimed under the policy for his costs of appearing before ICAC. The insurer advanced $87,863.54 in relation to the costs (the advance).
	
	
	ICAC delivered its ""Report on an Investigation into Corruption Allegations affecting Wollongong City Council Part Three"" (the Report) in which it found that the insured had acted dishonestly and illegally (Exhibit A, tab 4). ICAC proposed that consideration be given to obtaining the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) with respect to the prosecution of the insured. The DPP determined that the insured should not be prosecuted (Exhibit 2).
	
	
	Pursuant to exclusion clause 2.1 of the policy (extracted at par 15), the insurer claims reimbursement of the advance on the basis that ICAC found dishonesty or illegality on the part of the insured. The insured accepts that, if clause 2.1 applies to ICAC findings, he must repay the advance . He contends that clause 2.1 does not apply because an ICAC finding of dishonesty or illegality is not a determination ""by a final...adjudication"" within ""claim proceedings"" that invokes clause 2.1 of the policy. Inter alia, the insured relies on ICAC's statements that his conduct ""could"" constitute or involve a criminal or disciplinary offence and the absence of a finding that his conduct ""did"" constitute a criminal or disciplinary offence.
	
	
	In determining whether the insurer can recover the advance under clause 2.1 of the policy, it is necessary to consider the powers and functions of ICAC, the nature of the ICAC findings, and the language of clause 2.1 in the context of the policy as a whole, with regard to the objects of the policy, and affording it a businesslike interpretation: McCann v Switzerland Insurance Australia Ltd (2000) 203 CLR 579.
	


The ICAC Act


	
	One of the principal objects of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (the Act) is to constitute ICAC ""to investigate, expose and prevent corruption involving or affecting public authorities and public officials,"" including councillors: ss 2A and 3 (which, inter alia, defines ""public official""). ICAC is ""primarily an investigative body whose investigations are intended to facilitate the actions of others in combating corrupt conduct"": Balog v Independent Commission Against Corruption [1990] HCA 28 at [17].
	
	
	The expression ""corrupt conduct"" defines the scope of ICAC's investigatory jurisdiction. Section 8 broadly identifies the nature of the ""corrupt conduct"" with which ICAC is concerned. ""Corrupt conduct"" includes ""any conduct of a public official that constitutes or involves the dishonest or partial exercise of any of his or her official functions"" (s 8(1)(b)) and any conduct ""that involves the misuse of information or material that he or she has acquired in the course of his or her official functions"" (s 8 (1) (d)).
	
	
	Section 9 imposes a limitation on the nature of ""corrupt conduct"". Conduct will not amount to ""corrupt conduct"" unless (relevantly) it "" could constitute or involve"" a criminal offence, a disciplinary offence or reasonable grounds for dismissal: s 9(1). (Emphasis added.) Section 9(1) must be read subject to s 13(3A), which provides that ICAC may find that a person has engaged or is engaging in corrupt conduct only if satisfied that a person "" has engaged in or is engaging in conduct that constitutes or involves "" a criminal (or disciplinary) offence (emphasis added). Subsection 3A was inserted for the purpose of requiring ICAC to be satisfied that a person had engaged in, or was engaging in, conduct that constitutes involved a criminal offence before making a finding of ""corrupt conduct"" in relation to conduct referred to in s 9(1); to address the concern that ""it would be inappropriate to base (a finding of corrupt conduct) on the mere possibility of the existence of such conduct or of the commission of a criminal offence"": New South Wales, Parliamentary Debates , Legislative Assembly, 23 February 2005, 14133 (Frank Sartor).
	
	
	The principal functions of ICAC are set out in s 13 of the Act. They include the investigation of alleged corrupt conduct and the communication of the results of investigations to appropriate authorities: s 13(1)(a) and (c). Section 13 further provides:
	


""(2) The Commission is to conduct its investigations with a view to determining:

(a) whether any corrupt conduct, or any other conduct referred to in subsection (1) (a), has occurred, is occurring or is about to occur, and

(b)...

(3) The principal functions of the Commission also include:

(a) the power to make findings and form opinions, on the basis of the results of its investigations, in respect of any conduct, circumstances or events with which its investigations are concerned, whether or not the findings or opinions relate to corrupt conduct, and

(b) the power to formulate recommendations for the taking of action that the Commission considers should be taken in relation to its findings or opinions or the results of its investigations.

...

(5) The following are examples of the findings and opinions permissible under subsection (3) but do not limit the Commission's power to make findings and form opinions:

(a) findings that particular persons have engaged, are engaged or are about to engage in corrupt conduct,

(b) opinions as to:

(i) whether the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions should be sought in relation to the commencement of proceedings against particular persons for criminal offences against laws of the State, or

(ii) whether considerations should or should not be given to taking of other action against particular persons,

(c) findings of fact.""


	
	Part 8 of the Act addresses the preparation of reports to Parliament. Where ICAC has conducted a public inquiry, it is required to prepare a report and furnish it to Parliament as soon as possible after the investigation: s 74(3) of the Act.
	
	
	In Balog , the High Court considered the now repealed s 74(5) and concluded that ICAC had ""no power to make findings as to the liability of an individual to conviction ..."" (at [19]). As a consequence of the decision, the Act was amended to insert s 74A and s 74B. The purpose was to make it plain that ICAC could report a finding that a person had engaged in corrupt conduct, but could not report that a person had committed a criminal offence: Explanatory Note, Independent Commission Against Corruption (Amendment) Bill 1990 (NSW) 1; New South Wales, Parliamentary Debates , Legislative Assembly, 21 November 1990, 10200 (Mr Dowd). In relation to persons against whom substantial allegations have been made, s 74A states:
	


""(2) The report must include, in respect of each ""affected"" person, a statement as to whether or not in all the circumstances the Commission is of the opinion that consideration should be given to the following:

(a) obtaining the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions with respect to the prosecution of the person for a specified criminal offence,...""

Section 74B limits the content of reports to Parliament. It provides:

""(1) The Commission is not authorised to include in a report under section 74 a statement as to:

(a) a finding or opinion that a specified person is guilty of or has committed, is committing or is about to commit a criminal offence or disciplinary offence (whether or not a specified criminal offence or disciplinary offence), or

(b) a recommendation that a specified person be, or an opinion that a specified person should be, prosecuted for a criminal offence or disciplinary offence (whether or not a specified criminal offence or disciplinary offence).

(2) A finding or opinion that a person has engaged, is engaging or is about to engage:

(a) in corrupt conduct (whether or not specified corrupt conduct), or

(b) in specified conduct (being conduct that constitutes or involves or could constitute or involve corrupt conduct),

is not a finding or opinion that the person is guilty of or has committed, is committing or is about to commit a criminal offence or disciplinary offence.

...""


	
	The practical effect of these provisions is that ICAC is an investigator that reports and makes recommendations to Parliament. ICAC may opine that a matter should be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for the purpose of obtaining the Director's advice about prosecution, or that disciplinary action should be considered. Parliament decides whether such recommendations will be pursued. Inter alia, ICAC may investigate allegations of dishonest conduct by councillors. In any report, ICAC is entitled to make findings of fact. If it is comfortably satisfied that a councillor's dishonest conduct constitutes or involves a criminal or disciplinary offence, ICAC may find that the councillor has engaged in ""corrupt conduct"". In accordance with ss 9(1) and 13(3A), it is implicit in any such finding that ICAC is comfortably satisfied that the councillor has engaged in or is engaging in conduct that constitutes or involves a criminal (or disciplinary) offence.
	
	
	ICAC cannot find that a councillor ""is guilty"" of or ""has committed"" a criminal or disciplinary offence. There are at least four reasons that it would be inappropriate for ICAC to make a finding in relation to criminality or disciplinary breach:
	


(1) ICAC is an investigating body, not a prosecuting or disciplinary authority. It is not the role of an investigator to make such a finding.

(2) ICAC has very broad powers in relation to the gathering of material (including an array of compulsory powers) and the material gathered by ICAC may be largely inadmissible in a court of law or disciplinary tribunal. (3) The criminal standard of proof does not apply to ICAC findings.

(4) Any finding of criminality by ICAC could tend to interfere with the due administration of justice in the event of a subsequent trial: Balog at [19].

The ICAC Report


	
	In the Report, ICAC found as facts, that while a councillor, the insured had engaged in certain deliberate conduct, knowing that he should not do so:
	


""The Commission finds that Mr Zanotto engaged in corrupt conduct on the basis that:

(i) his conduct set out in finding of fact 1(a) is conduct of a public official that:

* constitutes or involves the dishonest exercise of official functions within the meaning of section 8 (1) (b) of the ICAC Act; and

* could constitute or involve a disciplinary offence, within the meaning of section 9 (1) (b) of the ICAC Act.

(ii) his conduct set out in finding of fact 1(b) is conduct of a public official that:

involves the misuse of information or material acquired in the course of his official functions, within the meaning of section 8 (1) (d) of the ICAC Act; and

could constitute or involve a disciplinary offence within the meaning of section 9 (1) (b) of the ICAC Act.

(iii) his conduct set out in finding of fact 2 is conduct of a public official that:

constitutes involves the dishonest exercise of official functions within the meaning of section 8 (1) (b) of the ICAC Act; and involves the misuse of information acquired in the course of his official functions, within the meaning of section 8 (1) (d) of the ICAC Act; and

could constitute or involve, within the meaning of section 9(1)(a) of the ICAC Act, the common law offence of misconduct in public office; and could constitute or involve a disciplinary offence, within the meaning of section 9 (1) (b) of the ICAC Act."" (at pp 94-95)


	
	It should be inferred that, insofar as ICAC recorded a finding that the insured's conduct ""could"" constitute or involve a criminal or disciplinary offence, ICAC was comfortably satisfied that the s 13(3A) requirement had been met, ie that the insured had engaged in conduct that constituted or involved a criminal (or disciplinary) offence.
	


The Policy


	
	The policy provides:
	


""1. Insuring Agreement: In respect of any loss resulting from a wrongful act which a director(s)/ officer(s) becomes legally obliged to pay on account of any claim first made against him during the policy period and reported to Liberty during the policy period or discovery period, Liberty shall pay:

1.1 on behalf of the director(s)/ officer(s), the loss to which the director(s)/ officer(s) are not indemnified by the insured organisation; and

...

2. Exclusions: Liberty shall not be liable under this policy to make any payment for loss in connection with any claim:

2.1 arising out of, based upon or attributable to the fraud, dishonesty, or illegal acts of the director(s)/ officer(s) determined by a final judgment or adjudication, within the claim proceedings or otherwise, and which was material to the outcome of the judgment or adjudication -- the exclusion in this paragraph 2.1 applies to paragraph 1.1 only; or

...

10.Defence:... Any amount paid by Liberty prior to final determination of the loss shall be considered to be an advance only, any such amount which is subsequently determined as not being covered by this policy, shall be promptly repaid by the insured ...

29 Definitions: In this policy:

""claim"" means: (1) any written claim or allegation against or in respect of a director(s)/ officer(s) which may result in a loss; or (2) any official investigation, examination, administrative or regulatory proceeding regarding any specified wrongful act of an insured.

...

29.3.""defence costs"" means that part of the loss consisting of reasonable and necessary costs, charges and expenses... incurred in investigating, defending, appealing or monitoring legal actions, claims, or proceedings with respect to a loss or possible loss.

...

29.14.""loss"" means ... including, but not limited to, damages, judgments, settlements, costs and defence costs but excluding fines, penalties, amounts uninsurable by law, and regular or overtime wages, salaries or fees of the directors, officers or employees of the insured organisation incurred in assessing, investigating, dealing with or assisting others to deal with the claim ...

...

29.24 ""wrongful act"" means any actual, alleged, attempted or allegedly attempted error, misstatement, false or malicious intent, misleading statement, material omissions, act, omission, neglect, breach of trust, fraud, or breach of duty, by any director(s)/ officer(s) ...""

Does Clause 2.1 of the Policy Apply?


	
	The insured accepts that he was entitled to an advance for his defence costs of the proceedings before ICAC.
	
	
	The entitlement arose because the ""defence costs"" were incurred in defending a ""claim"" falling within part (2), ie an ""official investigation ... regarding (a) specified wrongful act of (the) insured,"" being an allegation of ""corrupt conduct"". The insured cannot both accept that he was entitled to an advance and argue that defence costs are payable only in respect of a "" claim"" that falls within part (1) of the definition of ""claim"", i.e. only where the relevant proceedings may result in damages or a similar outcome. Such an argument would mean that no one was entitled under the policy to recover their costs of defending allegations before ICAC. The insured must accept that defence costs are payable where the ""claim"" proceedings fall within part (2) of the definition of ""claim"", ie including where the nature of the ""claim"" is an official investigation.
	
	
	The insured contends that the ICAC findings contained in the Report are not a ""determination"" ""by a ""final judgement or adjudication in the claim proceedings or otherwise,"" such as would invoke clause 2.1 of the policy, because ICAC made no finding of guilt (merely stating that the conduct of the insured ""could"" constitute a criminal or disciplinary offence) and the ICAC findings lack ""the quality of a final judgment"".
	
	
	The expression ""determined by final judgment or adjudication"" must mean ""determined by final judgment or adjudication in the claim proceedings or otherwise of the relevant issue "" (emphasis added). In proceedings before ICAC, the relevant issue for determination is whether alleged ""corrupt conduct"" has occurred, is occurring or is about to occur: s 13(2) of the Act. In the Report, ICAC found that the insured ""engaged in corrupt conduct,"" that being a final adjudication of the relevant issue before ICAC. The final adjudication of ""corrupt conduct"" was based on findings of dishonesty in relation to the insured's conduct in the exercise of his official duties.
	
	
	Clause 2.1 of the policy uses the expression is ""determined by final judgment or adjudication, in the claim proceedings or otherwise "" (emphasis added). Where there has been a public inquiry into alleged ""corrupt conduct"", ICAC is required to furnish a report to Parliament: s 74, which contains appropriate recommendations, including recommendations in relation to persons against whom substantial allegations have been made: s74A(2) and (3). ICAC has other functions, including the assembly of evidence and the furnishing of reports to public authorities under s 14 of the Act, but the furnishing of a report to Parliament marks the finalisation of its core function. When it furnished the Report, ICAC finalised its core function in relation to allegations of corrupt conduct by the insured. In that way, the matter was ""finally adjudicated.""
	
	
	The insured submits that findings that his conduct ""could"" have constituted or involved criminal or disciplinary offences cannot amount to a ""determination"" because such statements merely record a possibility. There are three answers to this submission. First, the Act prevents ICAC from recording that a person did commit a criminal or disciplinary offence. Second, a recorded finding that a person ""could"" have committed a criminal or disciplinary offence necessarily implies that ICAC is comfortably satisfied that the conduct did constitute or involve a criminal or disciplinary offence: s 13 (3A) of the Act. Finally, issues of criminality and disciplinary breach are only incidental to ICAC's determination or adjudication of the issue with which it is concerned, ie whether there was ""corrupt conduct.""
	
	
	The exclusion of liability is consistent with the objects of the policy and affords it a businesslike operation. It could not have been intended that the policy would protect persons who suffered loss (including defence costs) as a result of established dishonesty.
	
	
	As ICAC has reported findings of corrupt conduct based on dishonesty, clause 2.1 of the policy applies and liability is excluded. Judgment for the plaintiff.

		16 May 2016",2011-12-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758416,R v Simon Charles Patrick FINNIGAN [2011] NSWDC 226,"Judgment


	
	The offender, Simon Charles Patrick Finnigan, has pleaded guilty to nine offences under s 1041G of the Corporations Act, that is dishonest conduct in relation to financial services and financial products. Each of these offences carries a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	What he was involved in is what is called a Ponzi scheme. These schemes or this scheme has been around for a long time. My investigations indicate that an Italian man, (by the name of Carlo Ponzi), who went to America in the early 1900's by the name of Carlo Ponzi was the first person to come to fame for inventing this type of scheme. Mr Ponzi told his investors they could get a forty per cent return in ninety days. The gullibility of people in the 1900's was just as great as it is today and more than a million dollars was given to him in one three hour period.
	
	
	The essence of the scheme is that an investor, so called, is persuaded to put a lot of money up with the confident trickster on the promise that this will be invested and there will be a higher return. That person is then paid this higher return or monthly basis or a weekly or fortnightly, depending on whatever the contract arrangement is. He is then used as a recruiting agent for further people to come along and put investments in. Because, naturally, the first person getting this substantial return is enthusiastic when others come to ask him what it is like, and he says, ""it is fabulous, I am getting this return every month, you really want to get onto this"". And investor by investor comes along and puts the money in. But the money is not invested in anything. The money is used to meet subsequent investors to pay the interest owing to the previous investor or investors and it is used to provide a wonderful lifestyle for the person who has thought up this great scheme. Eventually everything comes to an end when no further investors can be obtained, no more money can be produced, no repayment of capital can be had and everything collapses.
	
	
	The most spectacular recent example of it, again occurring in the United States, concerned a man called Bernard Madoff who managed to persuade investors that they should invest with him, what effectively became a loss of sixty-nine billion dollars. He was sentenced by the United States District Court of New York on June 29 2009 and given 150 years in gaol. Under the American Court system the principle of totality does not seem to count. It is not clear to me what happens at the end of 150 years. I do not know whether they dig his body up and throw the remains outside the gaol or what exactly they do. But apparently he can go to parole in 2135 or something, by which stage he would be over 200. So it was a much bigger scheme than this one. This scheme with Mr Finnigan I am told involved some 1.96 million.
	
	
	Essentially exactly the same things happened; it is just the scale of it was different. I have read the decision of the US District Court, it is reported and I read the statements made by the victims to the Judge. It was as if I were reading the same statements that were made in this case by the people who were defrauded in this case, exactly the same sorts of things were said.
	
	
	This sort of crime is a crime against people. It is not a crime against institutions. It is not a crime against the taxation system, nor is it a crime against any large institution or bank or government. It is a very cruel one because it attacks individuals.
	
	
	Mr Finnigan came to this Court having pleaded guilty, but having pleaded guilty only recently. He in fact contested the matter right up to the committal stage and required some of the investors to come along to the committal and be cross-examined. He must get some discount on sentence for his plea of guilty, but clearly he is not going to get anything like the maximum discount.
	
	
	The facts of the case are contained in a statement of facts. He is a man who was born on 6 March 1962 and is presently forty-nine years of age. It would appear that he commenced to operate this Ponzi scheme in 2001, but the particular offences with which I have to deal occur between 15 October 2003 and 31 March 2007. He was a director of a large numbers of companies. The details of those companies are contained in the statement of facts. I do not need to go through and mention each one of them. It is sufficient to say that either they are under external administration or they have been deregistered. At no time, despite his representations to the contrary, did he hold an Australian Financial Services licence, nor did any of the companies of which he was a director hold such a licence.
	
	
	It would appear that he and another man who is not associated with this scheme used to hold seminars and talk to people about what they could do with their investments, and people would go along and listen to what was happening and then want to talk to him. A document called an Investment Security Document was drafted. I have seen that document. It is a sham document made to look as if it is a genuine document drawn up by lawyers. It is a sham document in the sense that there is nothing in the document that would protect anybody relying on it who invested money in accordance with it. It is a sham because it says that during currency of the agreement each party must cooperate and use that party's best endeavours to ensure the business of both parties is successfully conducted. He, of course, took no steps whatsoever at any time to ensure that the business was successfully conducted, because in truth there was no business.
	
	
	The first person he defrauded was Mrs Matt. She met him in 2003 and he made representations to her which were false, but because of the way in which he spoke she did not check on them, apparently. He said that he had a really big company with offices all over Australia and he was a financial adviser and he made people money. Well, he did not have a really big company, he had a number of shelf companies that had nothing in them of any substance. He did not have offices all over Australia and if he was a financial advisor he was operating illegally because he had no licence to advise anybody on financial matters.
	
	
	He then said, and this is the most false representation, ""I invest money for people with absolutely no risk attached and I give them a big return"". In fact as events showed he invested nothing. He did give them a return, initially he gave her fifteen per cent a month. He said that he gave personal guarantees and he did but they were sham guarantees because they were secured on nothing. He then said, ""I've so many companies, I've so much money I am happy to do that and there's no risk involved, I'm happy to put that in writing if you are interested"". Well all of that was completely false because what he intended to do was to get the money and use it and there was a hundred per cent risk that it would be lost unless he could get lots of other people to come along and keep propping the business up.
	
	
	He then befriended Mrs Matt and he made false representations to her about doing lectures, having lawyers on his board, nobody had ever lost money, and a really good representation:
	


""I have a very rich auntie in England who is worth hundreds of millions. I am going to be the only person inheriting her money, so all my investments are covered at this time. I'd rather lose my own life than lose anybody else's money.""


	
	Now looking at it in the cold light of day years afterwards, it would be easy to say, ""well, why would anyone believe such fantastic representations. Why would anyone take seriously such claims not backed up by anything, not substantiated by anything?"" If somebody says ""I can give a guarantee"", why would you not get a lawyer to go and produce a document and make sure it is secured on real estate. But that is all very well looking at it in hindsight. The fact is at the time it looked very good, and he did not do as Mr Ponzi did and promise forty per cent returns, he promised fifteen and that is a very handsome return, it can be achieved sometimes by some companies. So he was not offering something that was out of all proportion.
	
	
	The other claims he made were false but he was a very plausible fellow and she believed it. He then persuaded her to invest with him $200,000, claiming to her that she was getting a very poor return on her superannuation fund and three properties she currently had and she accepted his representations and made available this sum of money. There was a document signed which said, ""Utilised for investment purposes with a projected rate of return of at least fifteen per cent per annum. Simon Finnigan personally guarantees investment"", that was written in the document. She drew the cheque and she kept getting the interest payments until November 2005 when they ceased. They were paid into a particular bank account of Financial Partners Pty Limited, one of his companies. The only other sum of money deposited to that account was the sum of $50,000 deposited on 8 July 2004.
	
	
	Of the funds that were deposited he spent $149,000 of this $200,000 paying back other investors, or not paying them back, paying them interest amounts, $21,000 to employees, $2,000 on his Visa account, $10,000 for cash withdrawals. He paid a group of real estate agents $21,000 and a bit more and he paid Haines Norton who provided accounting services nearly $14,000. None of the money was invested and the return that Mrs Matt got was basically a false return, not from investment but from other monies that other people deposited with him.
	
	
	He went so far as to become a business partner of Mrs Matt. Premises were rented and he commenced to manage her cash flow and her bills. By March or April 2006 she stopped getting interest payments and he made some false claims to her about what he had done with her money and then in 2007 he just said it is not there.
	
	
	The second defrauded person, Mrs Russell was a lady who operated a catering business. She was referred to him by Mrs Matt. She rang him to discuss her financial circumstances. At that stage she was the sole carer for her husband who was a stroke victim. She went and filled in a form called a ""Client Profile Form"". He made claims about his expertise in property management and shares and said he would take care of all of her financial deeds. He said that Financial Partners were involved in all sorts of projects, some of which were on a video shown to her, and he said: ""Financial Partners are involved in water, steel, air-conditioning for buildings"", he sais he was promoting a professional singer, he was very experienced at managing projects and one of the investments he could offer was to take out a short term loan as investments. ""There are all these people out there who are desperate to borrow money and they do not care how much they pay."" All of these claims were completely false. He was involved in no such businesses at all.
	
	
	Over a couple of months he made further representations. He claimed he was previously based in Perth and made a lot of money there. He was a multi millionaire, he was independently wealthy, he has got family money from his mother who lives in England, he keeps all his assets in trusts so he is a man of straw. ""If anything goes wrong nobody can touch my money."" That last statement may be the only true statement he ever made, that he is a man of straw and if anything goes wrong nobody can touch his money. Since all this scheme came to an end he has become a bankrupt. Nobody can get anything.
	
	
	He claimed to be on the board of twenty major companies. All this was false. He claimed to guarantee everything. Well he did but the guarantees were worth nothing. He claimed that most venture capitals only had a fifty per cent success rate. He had got an eight-five to ninety per cent success rate. All the projects he was involved in were doing fantastically well, ""this is the best year I have ever had, I can guarantee you a return of fifteen per cent."" When asked how he could guarantee that he said, ""It's not risky I do 'puts' on the markets"". All of this was of course completely false.
	
	
	Again between July and October 2004 she kept receiving interest payments because Mrs Matt had provided the money to enable him to make the interest payments to Mrs Russell. In October 2004 he persuaded her to mortgage her assets, take out a loan of $500,000 and put even more money with him, and she did this. From this money ASIC investigations show he made payments to other investors of 355, 350, paid employees 7,700, paid his own Visa account 19,500, paid a firm of solicitors nearly 18,000, paid some real estate agent nearly 12,000, paid another real estate agent 3,000 and paid MM Cosmetics 2,500. Now MM Cosmetics was a consultancy operated by Mrs Matt and no doubt that payment was made for two reasons, one, because she was there and her suspicions had to be allayed, if she had any, also he had an interest in that particular business.
	
	
	Mrs Russell was one of the people who was cross-examined during the committal proceedings and she made it plain that she would not have invested any money had she known he was going to use her money to pay his personal and business expenses. Over a period of time, particularly between February and March 2006, she became aware that the interest payments were being delayed by weeks or months, she could not contact him easily, she wanted the return of her investment, she threatened to complain to ASIC. He then claimed he could refund the money in instalments. "" I have got all sorts of things on the boil"", all this was completely false. Nothing more was paid to her and she lost her entire investment.
	
	
	The third person was Mrs McConkey and again she was recruited through Mrs Matt. Again he made a whole series of false representations to her about his skill in investment and running businesses and the return he could make of fifteen per cent. He claimed to out perform competitors and return more than fifteen per cent so he was able to pay her fifteen per cent and keep the cream.
	
	
	He talked about the biotech project which was a complete fake and told her it had huge potential. At this stage, when she inquired of Mrs Matt she was told she was quite happy with what she was getting. That indeed of course is an essential component of these schemes, some of the investors have to be kept happy so that others will come along and put their money in.
	
	
	In July 2006 Mrs McConkey got the balance of an inheritance and contacted him to discuss investments. He made false representations about Biotech Solutions, closing the share offer on the gold washing component of the technology. He said:
	


""I underwrite the shares, how safe is that, there's no risk the shares are pre-float. Biotech Solutions will be publicly listed by the end of 2006, I'm confident, so confident that the company will list on the stock exchange, if we're not listed I'll personally buy back your shares out of my own pocket. The investment will underwrite your house. You'll be able to make a house next to you you'll be so rich. I personally will make billions, this is the project I've been after all my life"".


	
	Relying on these representations Mrs McConkey telegraphically transferred $230,000 to the Venture Capital Management account and all she got in return for it was a receipt referring to the purchase of 11,500 ordinary shares in Biotech Solutions at twenty dollars a share.
	
	
	Of the money that she invested 33,500 went to pay other investors, 24,153 to pay employees, 5,000 to pay his own Visa account, 190,777 to pay Mrs Orszaczky who is the next person mentioned, 10,500 to Longueville Media and 5,000 to a business called Tough As Nails.
	
	
	Michelle Orszaczky sold her house in 2006 in July to Christopher Bear, she got the funds on 4 July 2006. The offender purchased four bank cheques for the City of Canada Bay Council, Sydney Water, Paul Madigan Associates and Mrs Orszaczky, who the bank cheque was for, $190,607.29. Mr Bear invested 200,000 with Financial Partners and a further 38,000 in early 2004. In time he ceased receiving his monthly investments and he, before he sold the house, said, ""I want to withdraw my $200,000 investment, I am buying a house"" and he wanted cheques for the settlement including a cheque from Mrs Orszaczky and also to pay the rates, solicitors and council rates. Contrary to his representations the offender did not invest Mrs McConkey's funds in Biotech Solutions, but used the money in the way that I have indicated.
	
	
	A Mr Per Hassel is the next person defrauded. He met the offender in about November 2004 having been recommended to him by Manuela Matt. Mr Hassel was the partner of Mrs McConkey. He told the offender he would like to get a better rate of return on his AMP superannuation fund. He was told Financial Partners superannuation scheme gets a fifteen per cent annual return on initial and subsequent investment, inclusive of all fees. Again when you look at it today, these years later, that is obviously absurd. But that is not the way it appeared at the time. He made representations basically that he could do better than AMP, he was a much better investment adviser and he handed over an investment memorandum and a testimonial on video by a woman who said, amongst other things, ""Simon has helped me significantly with my financial affairs"". Ultimately he paid over $122,339.31 to Financial Partners and once again $49,000 or thereabouts was used to pay other investors and the other payments were made for employees, his own Visa account and payments to solicitors, accountants and other persons. He did not invest the superannuation funds anywhere.
	
	
	Mr Hassel put another 9,000 over to Financial Partners in June 2005 and another 3,000 on 30 June 2005 and on 30 November 2005 a further $4,900. On 31 January 2007 he gave the offender $10,000, again intended for this superannuation account. None of it has been repaid.
	
	
	The next victim was a Philip Perez, counts 5 and 6. He operated a business known as Savoir Faire which provided staff to perform steward and waiter duties at corporate functions. He was referred by Mrs Russell and at this stage Mrs Russell was being paid her interest payments. At the time he was going through a divorce settlement and when he met the offender at the Elizabeth Street offices of Financial Partners the offender represented himself to be a financial advisor offering different types of investments and saying the minimum entry price is normally $200,000 to $250,000. ""I don't usually accept investments smaller than that, I deal with high rollers"". This was the same sort of representation that Mr Bernie Madoff made in New York, only Mr Madoff's representations were more in the order of the minimum investment was five million and he was reluctant to take it.
	
	
	He then made further representations to Mr Perez about offices in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, and lots of exciting schemes and investments, three female singers who would become successful. He claimed to do a lot of research, he was going to put to market a revolutionary neon light. He had a water scheme, its purpose was to cool water towers and purify gold, it was being put together by a Western Australian scientist. Singapore had already signed contracts, the rest of the world will follow suit. Then he made representations about short term investments with very handsome returns but certainly of the order of fifteen per cent. He talked about people desperate for money who are prepared to pay a premium to get their hands on cash and the return that could be made from that. When asked what would happen if any of these people defaulted, he said, ""You know it's never happened, if we did we'd go after their assets, anyway it's underwritten by us and guaranteed so you have nothing to worry about"". He then showed a video on a laptop computer of a testimonial from a woman who said, ""Thanks to Simon and Financial Partners I'm a happy retiree"". Mr Perez then completed a questionnaire about his income and assets which he returned to the offender and ultimately Mr Perez liquidated some of his investments and gave the offender $100,000 for twelve months with interest payable monthly. Of that 100,000, 60,000 was given on 2 June and there were two further payments to make up the 100,000. Of the $60,000 that was paid, 2,000 was paid to other investors, 1,600 to employees, 6,000 to his Visa account, 11,000 to real estate agents, 16,769 to Albert Road Pty Limited and Allen Brown and Co 3,825. Allen Brown and Co were solicitors. The money was not used as promised and was not invested.
	
	
	He persuaded Mr Perez to go and sign a mortgage loan application and invest more money and ultimately $400,000 further was invested. Of the monies invested $188,799 odd was used to pay investors, nearly 89,000 and then all the other payments to employees, Visa accounts, his own company, cash withdrawals and to other creditors. None of the money was invested, all of the money has been lost.
	
	
	Ms. Dee Bone made an investment. Again the same types of false representations were made. Claims were made about his having seven to eight million dollars of his own money invested in property by his solicitor. Mr and Mrs Bone invested $200,000 by borrowing against the equity in their home. Again most of that money was used to pay other investors, 135,557, with all the other payments being made to pay himself and various creditors. no investments were made. Some returns were made to Mrs Bone and to her husband, but substantially all their money was lost.
	
	
	Count 8 concerns a Signa Furber. She came to the offender through Manuela Matt because she was in the same sort of business as Mrs Matt. The same types of representations were made. Claims were made that Manuela Matt was getting rich as a result of what he was doing for her and ultimately she provided $200,000 which was supposed to be invested for twelve months with an interest of $2,500 payable monthly. Of this 106,500 was paid to other investors and all the rest of it was used to pay himself and his creditors. She also demanded she get her money back, but in fact she did not.
	
	
	The final count concerns two people, Jacqueline Schell and Brendan Mullard who were partners in a holiday property business. They were searching for a business partner because they were involved in what was called anti-counterfeiting technology. The offender claimed to be a venture capitalist in a niche market with projects of up to around five million dollars. He made representations about Biotech, the value of which technology he said was one hundred million dollars. He claimed to run a clinic and two other companies, he had got shares, options and ""puts"" on the market. They, Mr Mullard and Ms Schell, were going to start a new business venture relating to DNA applications and they met the offender and discussed their technology and their interest. He said he would restructure their finances. He would mortgage the properties, he would invest the funds across a range of projects. The returns would always cover monthly repayments. ""For friends like you I personally guarantee your funds. If anything ever goes wrong you have my word. I will repay every cent of your investment so there's no risk"". He claimed to be:
	


""A member of the Millennium Club in Sydney, all corporate highflyers are members. We meet monthly to lobby government. My political contacts will help you to get the DNA technology passed in Australia"".


	
	He claimed to have started up Abbey National which is a home loan company, ""a huge success, one of the best things I've done, I sold it for a hundred or two hundred million"". Anyhow they put in $255,468.69 of the$250,000 in of which 192,592 was paid to investors and the rest was paid to himself and other creditors. Again despite his protestations of friendship and his investment expertise, none of this was invested. The money was lost.
	
	
	There are victim impact statements that I have considered. They are all very sad documents. As well as that one of the victims read out a statement in Court. All of them are very sad documents. All of them are statements from people who have lost everything as a result of these false claims and the operation of this scheme. All of them believed this man, all of them regarded him in some way as a friend whom they could trust, and because they felt they could trust him they gave him money on his say so as to what he would do with it.
	
	
	He is a person who has no previous criminal convictions and must be regarded as someone who before coming to this Court was a man of good character. A number of people made testimonials on his behalf, including a man called Steve Johnson. The Crown sought to cross-examine Mr Johnson. I have had regard to that evidence in cross-examination. Mr Johnson strikes me as someone on whom no reliance should be placed whatsoever. He is someone who was associated with him in a business sense, he employs the offender at the moment and I do not believe what Mr Johnson says about him. As to the other people I am sure they probably mean well but I do not take much comfort from what they say about him.
	
	
	There is a Probation and Parole report which recounts his life. It is the only thing that has been put before me about his life because he himself has not sought to give any evidence. If what is said in this report is true, and it all depends on him, he came to this country from the United Kingdom when he was about six years old. He settled in Western Australia. He worked in Western Australia and eventually came to live in Sydney. When he was nineteen he bought and managed a fish and chip shop. He came to Sydney in 1996, he lived in leased accommodation in inner city locations. There are various other claims he made about his employment and the like, which may be true, I do not know. The report refers to Mr Johnson, although not by name, as someone who employed Mr Finnigan despite losing $10,000 as an investor. I do not think that the Probation and Parole Service officer has the same opinion of Mr Johnson as I have. The offender has no diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder or of any treatment with mental health professionals.
	
	
	He told the Probation Officer he took full responsibility for his offending behaviour but claimed he did not intend investors should lose their money. In my mind that is a deliberate lie and I am surprised the Probation Officer should accept him as in any way being genuine. He claimed to the Probation Officer that he developed insomnia as a result of worrying about the effects of the matter on himself and others. He expressed remorse for the offending behaviour but attempted to justify his behaviour by indicating that he had understood as the investments were debenture style this allowed him a legal right to use the invested money for ventures. Again these are completely false representations made to a Probation Officer. So not only did he make false representations to investors, he continued with false representations when he spoke to a Probation Officer. He apparently took her in and she thought that he was unlikely to benefit from supervision or intervention due to his assessed low risk of re-offending.
	
	
	I do not accept that opinion of him at all. I think it is based on false representations by him to her and I do not consider that there is a low risk re-offending at all. In fact I would have thought if anything there is a high risk of re-offending. I think that because he has done nothing whatever to express any remorse or any contrition. He has done nothing whatever to try and repay any of the monies and when the matter came to Court he sought to challenge four of the investors, not before me but before a Magistrate.
	
	
	The plain fact of the matter is that this scheme, just as with Mr Madoff's much bigger scheme, is a big sham. At no stage did he invest in anything, and at no stage did he intend to invest in anything. His only intention was to deceive people into giving him money by making false representations of wealth and success. It is easy, as I have said, nowadays, these years afterwards, to look back and say how would anyone be taken in by this. The plain fact is that people like the current offender have great skill, charm and ability to persuade, and people who are normally businesslike, calm and considered in their approach are taken in. Any of the current investors who feel bad about it should realise, and they can if they want to, look up what Mr Madoff did in New York and realise the sorts of people who were taken in by Mr Madoff. People who had put in millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, believing they were going to get a magnificent return and these were people of considerable wealth and ability.
	
	
	Ponzi schemes must be actively discouraged by the courts and those who engage in them can expect to receive harsh sentences. This man must be sentenced for what he did. He was not a trustee for anybody, he did not breach trust in the normal sense. He betrayed friendship, he made false claims, he caused financial ruin and enormous hardship. His victims are human beings and in many ways false representations like this to ordinary citizens are far worse than false representations of this type made to large companies that also happens from time to time. I am aware myself of two individuals who managed to persuade very large companies to make over very large cheques to them on false representations, I am talking of tens of millions of dollars. So these sorts of people can operate anywhere and at any level.
	
	
	He has to be dealt with for what he did and not for what anybody else did. But an element of the sentence has to be the protection of the community. On occasions that requires a longer sentence than would be imposed otherwise. I think it is called for in this case because I see not the slightest evidence that he has any appreciation of the damage and destruction he has caused or any concern about what has happened to anybody.
	
	
	There of course must always be some hope of rehabilitation. But as I have said before, I do not accept the report of the Probation and Parole Office because I think it is based on their acceptance of false representations made by him. Ultimately I have come to a conclusion that I should impose on him a sentence that may be seen to be one of the toughest sentences ever imposed and that is a sentence of ten years imprisonment with a six year non-parole period. I am imposing that because general deterrence requires that people be discouraged actively from engaging in these schemes. Individual deterrence requires that he be prevented from engaging in these schemes for a considerable period. The protection of the community requires that he not be able to do it for a considerable period. The possibility of rehabilitation must always be there but I think it is very low down on the list. Anybody who engages in conduct of this type has a lot of work to do to rehabilitate himself and rehabilitation in my opinion only comes if he does something effective to repay the people whose money he took and misused.
	
	
	The principle of totality requires that I must look at sentences that are imposed and ensure that in an overall sense no sentence is too large. It requires that I must combine some of the sentences to ensure that that occurs, otherwise I would be putting him there for too long. In America that principle does not apply and you can put people away for as long as you like. But we do not impose in this country 100 year sentences or 150 year sentences. It is absurd.
	
	
	He has to be given the opportunity of rehabilitation. As a white collar offender the very distinct probability is that at an early time he will be transferred to a minimum security institution and indeed I am going to recommend that that be done and to be classified as soon as possible with a view to being moved to a such an institution. Ultimately depending on how he behaves himself he can be given weekend leave and even leave during the week to work. That depends on him, I have no say in classifications and I am certainly not recommending that anything be done other than that he be classified as soon as possible. I direct that these sentencing remarks be sent to the Director of Classifications of the Department of Corrective Services so that that department can move to deal with his classification as soon as possible.
	
	
	The individual sentences that I impose are as follows. Count 1, I have decided I should impose a maximum sentence for the offence committed against Mrs Matt of five years, but reduce it by ten per cent to four years and six months because of his plea of guilty. I impose the harsher sentence for that one only because he used her as an unwilling or an unwitting accomplice. He used her to recruit others. She did not know anything about what he was up to, and I think that should be recognised. For the other sentences in the main they will be three years and seven months or thereabouts. For counts 7, 8 and 9 they will be a straight four years. As will be seen that is done to ensure that in an overall sense a greater sentence is not imposed than it should be imposed. So count 1 will go from 16 December 2011 to 15 June 2016. Count 2 will go from 16 December 2012 to 21 July 2016. Count 3 will go from 16 December 2013 to 21 July 2017. Count 4 will go from 16 December 2014 to 21 July 2018. Count 5 will go from 16 December 2015 to 21 July 2019. Count 6 will go from 16 December 2016 to 21 July 2020. Count 7, 8 and 9 will all go from 16 December 2017 to 15 December 2021, they will be concurrent with each other. There will be a non-parole period of six years, that will go from 16 December 2011 to 15 December 2017. He will be eligible for parole on that day.

		15 March 2016",2011-12-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758419,R v Abdulhamid SHAHROUK [2011] NSWDC 228,"sentence

1I am sentencing a young man with a negligible criminal record for some serious criminal behaviour. He burned a shop down and kidnapped a passer-by. He had earlier telephoned the restaurant with a bomb threat. The young man's name is Abdulhamid Shahrouk and he is aged 23. 

2Abdulhamid Shahrouk was charged with two offences that I am sentencing him for. When I sentence him for one of the offences he has asked me to take into account a third offence. 

3The first offence I am sentencing him for is called destroy property in company by fire. I will refer to it as arson or aggravated arson. It is aggravated because Mr Shahrouk was not alone when he committed the crime. That crime is an offence against s 195(1A)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 11 years imprisonment to the crime. 

4The other offence that I am sentencing him for is called detaining a person in company with intention to obtain an advantage. That is a legal way of referring to kidnapping. That is a crime against s 86(2)(a) of the Crimes Act. It carries a maximum of 20 years imprisonment.

5When I am sentencing Mr Shahrouk for the aggravated arson I have been asked to take into account an offence of giving false information that a person or property was in danger. I will take that into account and I sign and date a document which contains that additional charge, produced under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That document is part of exhibit A.

6It is important when a judge is sentencing a person for the judge to set out briefly what happened so that an assessment can be made of how serious an example of the crime the particular offence was, or offences were. In this case the owner of an Indian restaurant business in Redfern was alleged by the prosecution to want the business burned down for his own reasons. He made contact one way or another with Abdulhamid Shahrouk, and agreed for him, with some assistance, to burn the restaurant down.

7The arson itself occurred on 5 July 2010. A couple of weeks before then Mr Shahrouk telephoned the restaurant. It was about 6.00pm on a Friday night, 25 June 2010. He left a bomb threat. The restaurant was evacuated along with two adjacent businesses for about threequarters of an hour. That is obviously a crime - making a bomb threat - and it is the one that I take into account when I am sentencing Mr Shahrouk for the aggravated arson. 

8As I said, the arson came about on Monday 5 July 2010. The restaurant was closed on Mondays. It happened at about 11.40pm. Mr Shahrouk and a co-offender got into the restaurant and were in the process of pouring around flammable material and stacking furniture. 

9As it happened, a man who lived above the restaurant noticed something strange and went inside and asked who was there. At that point the kidnapping occurred. When the man went in he found the two men, including Mr Shahrouk, and he was told aggressively to sit on a chair. Sensibly he complied, because he was threatened by the presence of both men. He handed over his mobile phone. The men took the SIM card so that he could not telephone anyone and he was threatened not to move. The men continued pouring flammable liquid around and when they were distracted the man escaped and asked someone to call the police.

10The two men, including Mr Shahrouk, nevertheless proceeded with their plan. The result of their crime was experienced first hand by another passerby who was very fortunate to have escaped with his life. He had just walked past the restaurant when he heard an explosion. He saw debris flying out behind him and saw fire starting to spread through the restaurant. I have seen photographs which are part of exhibit A and one reason I say that he was lucky to escape with his life is that a large part of the front glass window was blown out of the restaurant over the footpath on to the road. 

11The size of the fire inside the restaurant grew and intensified. There were three people living upstairs. They had to escape by getting on to the awning. As it happened, two men were driving by with a ladder. They helped these people down. The police and the fire brigade turned up and the fire was brought under control. Nevertheless the restaurant itself and two buildings beside it were severely damaged. The damage estimate was $400,000. The contents of the restaurant were totally destroyed and their value was some $100,000.

12It was not until 9 October 2010 that Mr Shahrouk was arrested and charged. He pleaded guilty at what the prosecution agrees was the earliest available opportunity. That is significant because it means that his sentence will be discounted by 25 per cent for that reason alone. 

13As I said in my opening remarks, Mr Shahrouk has a criminal record but it is negligible. He has two minor traffic offences and they make no impact whatsoever on the sentence which I will impose. In effect I sentence him as if he had no record at all.

14A pre-sentence report was prepared by an officer from the Bankstown District Office of the Probation and Parole Service. It describes Mr Shahrouk as a ""23 year old man of Lebanese background who is currently residing with his mother and 4 siblings in a rental property."" It also recorded Mr Shahrouk telling the Probation and Parole officer about a strict upbringing with frequent arguments between his parents, who were in financial difficulty.

15It recorded that Mr Shahrouk was ""a committed member"" of sporting teams and had volunteered to train junior club teams when needed. The information was verified satisfactorily so far as the Probation and Parole officer was concerned. 

16Mr Shahrouk had obtained his higher school certificate and has been self-employed as a concreter. 

17The report noted that Mr Shahrouk ""acknowledged he had participated in criminal and anti-social behaviour, however during interview he remained focused on the way he had been 'treated' during the course of the investigation and appeared to view himself as an additional victim."" 

18The summary reported that Mr Shahrouk 

""presented as having experienced deteriorating familial stability over the past three years due to the breakdown of his parents' marriage, and medical expenses associated with treatment for his mother and two youngest siblings. These events reportedly have resulted in substantial financial difficulties for the offender and increased domestic responsibilities. Mr Shahrouk described his employment income as inconsistent and stated he had participated in the offences for financial gain. The offender acknowledged the criminality of his actions during the interview and the serious nature of the offences.""

19Mr Shahrouk has provided a statement to the police in which he acknowledges the conversation he had with the person who arranged the burning down of the restaurant. I have also taken into account confidential exhibit B. 

20Mr Shahrouk has spent no time in custody and has been on bail since his arrest. 

21Mr D Drewett of counsel, who appeared for Mr Shahrouk in the sentence proceedings, called his client to give evidence. Mr Shahrouk confirmed living at home with his mother, 2 brothers and 2 sisters. The sisters are aged 12 and 14 and each of them has serious disabilities. One has cerebral palsy and the other cerebral ataxia. Not only this, his mother has a cancer condition and help is needed in supporting the 2 girls in the family. As Mr Shahrouk said, care is needed 24 hours a day. 

22His employment as a contractor varies and he may net $700 a week when he is working, but that can be inconsistent. His mother has already had some surgery for her cancer and is due to have further extensive surgery. Mr Shahrouk confirmed the significant financial strains which the household was existing under. There were medical bills to meet, particularly for his mother, and the normal bills associated with living at home such as rent, water and electricity. Some of these bills were due, or overdue I should say, in payment. 

23Mr Shahrouk's father was not working and expected him to pay board. The relationship between Mr Shahrouk and his father is not good. His father has effectively disowned him as a result of the crimes that he has been charged with. Mr Shahrouk's motive for committing this crime, for which he was paid $10,000, was to relieve the financial situation within the household. He said that the situation was desperate and the money was in fact all spent on the household debts. 

24Mr Shahrouk acknowledged that the people who lived above the restaurant had an experience which he described as ""not very pleasant"". He acknowledged that he would not wish to put other people in the situation that he put those people in. 

25The brothers are both employed and living at home and make some financial contribution to the household, although Mr Shahrouk effectively found himself as having significant responsibilities at home.

26I was assisted by both Mr Coe, solicitor, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, and by Mr Drewett in their submissions. I will briefly refer to their submissions indicating my response to the arguments which they have presented. 

27Mr Coe correctly pointed out that although the kidnapping offence carries a higher maximum penalty, the more serious offence in this instance was the aggravated arson. The kidnapping lasted a relatively short time. Although the two crimes were closely linked, there needed to be some degree of accumulation. Mr Coe argued that the arson was clearly planned, and I accept that. However, he prudently warned me against double counting, in the sense of taking the planning into account as a normal part of an arson crime and, in addition, taking it into account as an aggravating feature under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I accept that submission and I regard the planning that went into the aggravated arson as a factor which is part of the offence and I do not take it into account separately under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

28I accept that the damage in this case was extensive and that three buildings were involved. There is a question of whether the circumstances of the fire involved a grave risk to health of another person, which would be a separate aggravating feature under s 21A(2)(ib). Mr Drewett acknowledged that, whilst the offence was clearly aggravated - by being committed without regard for public safety, a factor under s 21A(2)(i) - it was not a case where I could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it involved a grave risk of death to another person. He regarded the conclusion as amounting to a leap of faith which would need far more forensic evidence than was available to me. I think he is right in that submission and I do not take into account as an aggravating feature any factor such as a grave risk of death. However, I do take into account as an aggravating feature that the offence was committed without regard for public safety. That is clearly demonstrated by the danger which the people upstairs were put into and by the narrow escape of the passer-by. 

29It should also be noted that the person who was kidnapped and escaped ended up in hospital for a short time because he had inhaled smoke. Mr Coe reminded me that the bomb threat, which is the offence I take into account, carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment, and it involved the evacuation of 2 other businesses as well.

30So far as the contents of confidential exhibit B are concerned, Mr Coe said I need to assess the usefulness of the information. The statement, he said, could not be regarded as timely, having been produced about a year after Mr Shahrouk's arrest. He said that the maximum discount should not be attracted and he reminded me of what the Court of Criminal Appeal had said in SZ v The Queen (2007) 168 A Crim R 249 at 261-262. 

31Mr Drewett, on the other hand, argued that the combined discount for the plea of guilty - which itself carries 25 per cent - and the additional factor should be the maximum of up to 50 per cent. He argued that, although there was other evidence available to the police, it was mostly circumstantial. 

32The assistance has been promised and has not yet been delivered because there has been no opportunity for that. I regard the assistance as significant but limited by its timeliness and I propose to allow a combined discount of 35 per cent, for both the plea of guilty and for the assistance. Of the additional 10 per cent which I have allowed for assistance, I would attribute 7 per cent to assistance which will be provided in the future. In other words, of the total discount of 35 per cent, 7 per cent of that is attributable to the assistance which will be provided by Mr Shahrouk if required. 

33It should also be acknowledged, of course, that the arson was committed for financial gain. 

34Mr Drewett drew my attention to some mitigating factors relevant to his client's case under s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. He referred to his client's lack of any criminal record, which I have already taken into account. He referred to his client as being a person of good character. I make that finding but just. There is general evidence about his role within the family but there are no character references which I have received or character witnesses whom I have heard from. But the Probation and Parole Report refers to his contribution to the community.

35I think I can find, as Mr Drewett invited me to, that his client is unlikely to reoffend. This was a first but serious offence. His prospects of rehabilitation I would regard as fair. I think there is some degree of remorse shown by the offender but it is quite limited, and of course I take into account his plea of guilty. Mr Drewett argued that his client may be vulnerable in custody. There is no evidence to support that and I do not take it into account. Mr Drewett referred to the financial circumstances of the family which brought about the commission of the offence. Mr Drewett accepted that it cannot mitigate the sentence. I think that is a correct acceptance because the authorities make it clear that the impact upon a family of an offender's behaviour is rarely something which will mitigate a sentence. But Mr Drewett's point was correctly made that the motive for his client's criminal behaviour cannot be seen as greed or a personal accumulation of assets or lifestyle. I accept that submission.

36Mr Drewett and Mr Coe disagreed over how serious the aggravated arson was. Mr Drewett argued that it fell at the lower end of seriousness for crimes such as this. Mr Coe on the other hand said it was serious enough to be regarded as being in the middle point of seriousness for crimes such as this. 

37I think Mr Coe is right. There was the significant risk to the public, the damage was extensive - extending over more than one building - and the financial loss very significant. I agree with Mr Coe that it falls within the middle of seriousness for crimes such as this. It was also committed for financial gain.

38I come now to consider the appropriate sentences which I should impose given all the factors which I have referred to. The aggravated arson, as I said, carries a maximum penalty of 11 years imprisonment. I would regard an appropriate sentence, after taking into account Mr Shahrouk's personal circumstances, as one of 5 years. I need to take into account the bomb threat crime which he has asked me to take into account so I would regard an appropriate overall sentence for the aggravated arson as being 5 ½ years. 

39For the kidnap crime, the maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment. The kidnap was not a serious example of a kidnapping and I would regard an appropriate sentence to be 3 years imprisonment for that crime. 

40If I were to sentence Mr Shahrouk for both of those crimes, the potential is that the maximum would be 5 ½ years and 3 years, namely 8 ½ years. But there needs to be some overlap of those sentences because both crimes were committed on the same occasion and were closely connected. I would regard an overall sentence for both crimes of 6 ½ years as being appropriate. 

41Because Mr Shahrouk pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and because of the other matter, I would apply the discount which I have referred to, of 35 per cent. That, by my calculations, produces a rounded-off sentence of 50 months which I would reduce slightly to 4 years imprisonment. I propose to set an overall non-parole period of 2 years and 4 months. Mr Shahrouk has been on bail up until now so the sentences will commence from today. I am going to sentence you now Mr Shahrouk, if you would stand up.

42For the crime of aggravated arson I sentence you to 3 years imprisonment. That will commence today, 16 December 2011, and expire in 3 years time on 15 December 2014. I have taken into account in that sentence the bomb threat crime.

43For the kidnapping I sentence you to 1 year and 10 months imprisonment. That will commence on 15 February 2014 and expire on 15 December 2015. The overall sentence is 4 years commencing today, 16 December 2011, and expiring on 15 December 2015. 

44I fix a single non-parole period of 2 years and 4 months. That commences today, 16 December 2011, and will expire on 15 April 2014. The first day that you will be eligible for release on parole is 15 April 2014. Have a seat for a moment Mr Shahrouk.

DREWETT: May I enquire of your Honour whether you made a finding of special circumstances?

HIS HONOUR: Thank you, I was going to do it earlier - yes I have and I referred to it earlier and then I changed course.

DREWETT: I think your Honour did and then--

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I forgot, I will come back to that. Thank you, and I don't make any direction about parole because it is a sentence of more than 3 years. 

45I will add to my remarks on sentence that I accept Mr Drewett's submission that, mainly because this is his client's first time in custody, there are special circumstances for adjusting the ratio between the non-parole period and the parole period. Normally a sentence of 4 years, which Mr Shahrouk has received, would carry a non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment. I have reduced that to 2 years 4 months because of those special circumstances.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Drewett and Ms Goodwin if you could just, when you have an opportunity, check my figures please. 

DREWETT: Yes.

GOODWIN: I am content with that.

HIS HONOUR: Yes I think they are right, aren't they, and I don't fix any conditions of parole. In a moment I will explain the sentence to Mr Shahrouk, but I think that is all I need to do; is that right; Mr Drewett and Ms Goodwin?

DREWETT: Yes.

GOODWIN: Yes your Honour.

46Mr Shahrouk you have received an overall sentence of 4 years. It starts today. It finishes 15 December 2014. As I explained, normally a non-parole period - that is the time you have to spend in gaol - would be 3 years for that kind of sentence. Parliament said threequarters. But because of what Mr Drewett said I have reduced that from 3 years to 2 years and 4 months, so that you go to gaol today and you are eligible for release on 15 April 2014, which is 2 years and 4 months from today.

47Whether you are released or not depends on the Parole Authority. They assess you and you make your application, or whatever happens, and they decide. 

48Technically, the sentences are 2 sentences. The arson sentence is itself 3years. It starts today. It finishes 15 December 2014. The kidnap is 1 year and 10 months and that starts partway through the arson sentence. There is an overlap deliberately. That starts 16 February 2014 and finishes 15 December 2015. You have received a significant discount, 35 per cent, both because you pleaded guilty and because of the other matter that I have referred to. 

49Your sentence would have been 6 ½ years but instead it is 4 years because of those factors. Seven per cent of that 35 per cent is for what will happen in the future so far as your assistance is concerned. 

HIS HONOUR: Do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right I will now adjourn, good luck.

		27 April 2012",2011-12-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758420,Director of Public Prosecutions v Robert Alan PEARCE [2011] NSWLC 32,"JUDGMENT 

1The offender appears before the Court to be sentenced in relation to a charge of negligent driving occasioning death. The charge is brought pursuant to section 42(1)(a) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. The maximum penalty a court may impose for this offence is a sentence of imprisonment of 18 months and/or a fine of $3,300. Additionally, upon a conviction being entered an automatic period of three years disqualification of licence flows. A Court may exercise its discretion upon proper and reasonable grounds to reduce the automatic period. It may not reduce it to a period of less than the statutory minimum of 12 months. 

2The offender is also to be sentenced in relation to two regulatory offences of recording false or misleading entries into a work record. Each of these offences is charged under regulation 84 of the Road Transport (General) Regulation 2005. The maximum penalty for each offence is a fine of $1,650. 

The Facts 

3The agreed facts establish that at about 4.24am on the morning of 11 February 2010 the offender was driving a B Double semi trailer laden with drums of ink north on the Pacific Highway. At a point north of the small township of Ulmarra the offender fell asleep at the wheel. As a consequence his vehicle failed to negotiate a left hand bend, crossed to the incorrect side of the road and, despite the best efforts of Nathan Zanuso who was travelling in the opposite direction to avoid a collision, the offender's vehicle struck the front of Mr Zanuso's vehicle, causing extensive injuries to Mr Zanuso. Mr Zanuso was conveyed to hospital; however, despite the efforts of medical emergency staff Mr Zanuso passed away late on the evening of 19 February 2010. 

4There is no issue the offender is responsible for the tragic consequences of the collision. As the agreed statement of facts states, ""The reason the offender's vehicle failed to follow the bend is because he had fallen asleep and was no longer in control of the vehicle."" 

5Subsequent to the accident the offender sought medical assistance on the basis that he believed (correctly) that he may have fallen asleep before the accident. He raised this possibility with a Dr Farag. This is the same doctor he had seen in October 2009 as a condition of his employment and from whom he obtained a certificate indicating he was fit to drive a truck and heavy vehicles. There is no suggestion Dr Farag was made aware of the offender's issues with sleeping at this time. So much appears clear from the response to the second consultation after the accident when Dr Farag sent the offender off for examination by a respiratory physician, Dr Solin. It was on 26 February 2010 that the offender was diagnosed as suffering from ""severe obstructive sleep apnoea"". The diagnosis was cross-checked by a medical practitioner appointed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The diagnosis was confirmed. 

Basis of Negligence 

6It is not in issue that the offender was aware of the fact that the quality of his sleeping activity was not satisfactory, leaving him tired and unrefreshed in a general way. It is a singular misfortune that he did not act on these early warning indicia until after tragedy occurred. This is particularly so given the training given to him in September 2008 by his employer. 

7The training programme was in ""Basic Fatigue Management"", a course designed and aimed at assisting those engaged in the transport industry to understand the danger to the community and to drivers from fatigue and what strategies might be engaged to respond to fatigue and thereby reduce risk. An outline of the topics covered in the course is set out on page 4 of the facts. They include the potentiality for sleep apnoea in overweight persons or smokers engaged in long distance driving and of the need to ensure the statutory requirements for a 15 minute rest period in a six and one quarter hour period of driving or 2 x 15 minute periods of continuous rest time over a nine hour driving period. On the agreed facts the offender was less than diligent in his attention to this minimum standard of rest, often undertaking peripheral work activity during periods intended for complete rest with a view to reinvigoration based on the industry knowledge of the consequences of uninterrupted long hours of driving. 

8Adding to the burden of tiredness, the offender had been driving in the course of his occupation for a total of almost 36 hours out of an available 72 hours in the 3 days leading up to the accident. On the afternoon of the accident he had spent almost an additional 9 hours engaged in driving heavy vehicles. Common sense informs that this proportion of driving to available time would be expected to generate a significant level of tiredness and impact on the capacity for the appropriate level of concentration needed to ensure the safe management of an extremely large vehicle. 

The Plea 

9The offender was originally charged with dangerous driving occasioning death. He was committed to stand trial before the District Court on this charge. The charge of negligent driving occasioning death was preferred in the alternative. This charge together with the regulatory offences was taken up to the District Court pursuant to section 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

10It appears clear from the agreed statement of facts that subsequent to committal for trial and following an independent assessment of the offender's medical condition of sleep apnoea the Director of Public Prosecutions took the view it was no longer appropriate to proceed on the more serious charge. This charge was withdrawn before the District Court. By order of his Honour Judge Freeman on 1 September 2011, the summary charges were then returned to this jurisdiction to be dealt with to finality. 

11The offender entered a plea of guilty to the returned charges on 19 September 2011. This was the date fixed by the order of the District Court for first mention upon return to the Local Court. It is well settled law that where appropriate a plea of guilty is to be taken into account in mitigation of penalty. This is because there is a utilitarian value to the administration of justice in such an approach by an offender. As the High Court said in Siganto v R (1998) 194 CLR 656 at 663-664 ([22]): 

.... a plea of guilty is ordinarily a matter to be taken into account in mitigation: first because it is evidence of some remorse on the part of the offender and second, on the pragmatic ground that the community is spared the expense of a contested trial. The extent of mitigation may vary depending on the circumstances of the case. 

12Section 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 also requires a court to take into account a guilty plea. 

13Although the offender entered a plea of guilty to the summary charges on the first return date on remission from the District Court, the plea is not to be regarded as one entered at the first available opportunity such that it attracts a discount at the top of the range identified in the Guideline Judgment of R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. The principles of general application identified at points 8 and 9 in R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32] make this clear. 

14As Bathurst CJ said in R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229 at [3], courts should ""generally continue to follow the approach in Borkowski ... the principles have to be applied by reference to the particular case"". 

15It is a trite observation to make that it was open to the offender from the date of his first appearance before the Local Court and prior to committal for trial to the District Court on the more serious charge to indicate a plea of guilty to the lesser charges. Section 22(1)(b) appears to contemplate this approach. Taking these considerations into account, I identify a discount of 17.5% for the utilitarian value of his plea. 

Subjective Factors 

16The offender is 52 years of age. He was 51 years old at the time of the accident. The detailed pre sentence report prepared by Corrections Victoria establishes he is married with 4 children whose ages range from 29 to 19. He is in a supportive family relationship. The offender has no criminal antecedents. He has been in his current employment as a truck driver for approximately 10 years. 

17It is clear from the offender's lack of antecedents and the content of the pre sentence report that he is a person of good character. However, this type of offence, as remarked in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209, is typically committed by persons of otherwise good character with no or limited convictions. I am required to give weight to the offender's prior good character and I do so. It is important both on its own and in the context of considering the prospects of rehabilitation and the likelihood of re-offending. Coupled with the steps the offender took after the accident to investigate his sleeping activities I accept he will learn from this tragic experience and is unlikely to re-offend. 

Victim Impact Statement 

18In these proceedings the DPP tendered two victim impact statements from the parents of the deceased, Nathan Zanuso. Each Victim Impact Statement is eloquent in expressing the depth of the love of two parents for their son and heart wrenching in attempting to describe the deep sense of loss they feel in his passing. 

19There is no doubt the effects of this tragedy on both of Mr Zanuso's parents, immediate and extended family will be and likely will remain catastrophic. So much is quickly apparent from reading both statements. As I have observed in a previous case (Police v Curkovic, unrep., 16/1/08), in modern society we are conditioned to believe that the natural order of life means that children do not pass from this earth before their parents. When events intervene to disturb that equilibrium the ability of those directly and indirectly affected to cope with the unanticipated loss is correspondingly affected. 

20The law has no capacity to restore the balance in the lives of Mr and Mrs Zanuso. No words or outcome of this Court or elsewhere can ever replace the hopes and aspirations of a parent for their child. All I can say from my own experience and as a member of society is that I understand the pain of this tragic loss. I extend my sincerest sympathies to Mr Zanuso's parents. 

The sentence 

21Negligence represents a failure on the part of an individual to exercise the degree of care the law requires for the protection of others. 

22Were it not for the post accident diagnosis of a sleep disorder which more likely than not contributed to the cause of the accident, the negligence associated with the commission of the offence would place it at the upper end of the range for this category of offending. A reasonable member of the community would readily comprehend that long hours of driving over the preceding three days was likely to have a cumulative effect in terms of tiredness. Against that background, failure to properly take rest periods compounds the potential consequences. I would place the offender's negligence in the middle range of objective seriousness. In doing so I believe it is important to address one particular issue. 

23The offender was seised of knowledge by reason of his participation in industry training programmes that this type of activity and physical profile both lent themselves to the possible existence of sleep apnoea and its potential consequences. That he did not seek medical diagnosis and treatment until after this accident is a tragedy in itself. Hindsight, however, cannot be regarded as exacerbating conduct. 

24The offender is to be judged on how he was at the time and in what circumstances the offence was committed. He cannot be judged on what he might or ought to have done at a different time because that circumstance is separated from the act of driving on the night of the offence. It is arguably the case that because the offender had lived with this condition for a lengthy and indeterminate period of time, he was oblivious to the fact that it was a defined medical condition amenable to diagnosis and treatment. It is reasonable to conclude based on past behaviour that had it not been for this tragedy the catalyst for identifying and treating his sleep apnoea may not have been activated. 

25In the course of her submissions on sentence, Ms Phelps for the offender tendered statistics from the Judicial Commission identifying patterns of sentencing in relation to offences of negligent driving causing death. Mr Stanhope representing the Director of Public Prosecutions tendered the decision of Bonsu v R [2009] NSWCCA 316 to the Court. Sentencing statistics are ordinarily of assistance to a Court because they identify the pattern of approach by Courts in dealing with matters falling under a common legislative provision. They do not identify comparable cases because the facts of each may be different and the circumstances of offenders may vary. Nonetheless in ordinary circumstances they represent a guide that assists a Court in avoiding the imposition of sentences that are too severe, or are mercifully weak. 

26The decision in Bonsu alters the reliability placed on sentencing statistics for this offence. In Bonsu, Howie J expressed the view at [19] that: 

...little regard or insufficient regard is being paid in the Local Court or the District Court on appeal to the fact that the offender being sentenced has caused the loss of a life 

and at [24] that: 

... the range of penalties being imposed, at least in the Local Court, is inadequate.... 

27It is appropriate to consider these observations against a background of other similar remarks made by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Jurisic and R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 to the effect that general deterrence is paramount and courts must tread cautiously in showing lenience for good character in such cases. The need for proper consideration of general deterrence is also reflected in legislative changes to increase the penalty for this offence. 

28The penalty provisions were amended in 1998 to increase the term of imprisonment and maximum amount of court fines. The maximum term of imprisonment has increased in recent years from 6 months to 12 months to 18 months. The consequences of increased penalties was considered in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [52] where the court said, inter alia: 

Traditionally any intention on the part of the legislature that the offence should attract a heavier sentence has been manifested by an increase in the statutory maximum. The courts are expected to recognize and reflect that intention when sentencing offenders for offences after such amendments are made. 

29An effect of the foregoing is to establish an approach in this sentence that is consistent with an emphasis on general deterrence. That is the approach commended by Parliament at the second reading speech when the penalty for this offence was introduced in 1998. It is the approach generally adopted in relation to driving offences where death or serious injury occurs. 

30Protection of the community is a fundamental obligation of courts exercising criminal jurisdiction. General deterrence is an important objective in pursuit of that objective. The issue the Court has to decide is whether, in light of the foregoing, the conduct of the offender for this offence warrants the imposition of a term of imprisonment. 

31Section 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 further constrains the capacity for a court to impose a term of imprisonment. The relevant provision is expressed in the following terms: 

5(1) A court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied having considered all the possible alternatives, that no other penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. 

32Taking all of the relevant considerations into account, I am persuaded to the view that the sentence to be imposed in this matter must be one that emphasises general deterrence. 

33General deterrence is an important objective in the pursuit of that ultimate outcome but not an objective to be emphasised as highly in relation to this category of offence as it is in relation to more serious driving offences. This is because the objective seriousness of the two categories of offences is significantly different. So too is the nature of the conduct required to be proven. 

34Having found that the objective seriousness of this offence places it towards the middle range for this category of offence, I come to the view despite the submissions of counsel to the contrary that the appropriate sentence is one of imprisonment. Objectively the appropriate term is 12 months. After applying the 17.5% discount the identified term becomes one of 9 months and 27 days. Having determined that the offence warrants a period of full time custody, I turn my mind to the manner in which it is to be served. 

35The ultimate objective of any sentencing exercise, beyond the immediacy of punishment, is rehabilitation of the offender. As a society we recognise the need to deal with people in a manner that contains an element of humanity, an expectation of reform and provides the environment in which the prospects of rehabilitation may be enhanced rather than crushed. Society has no interest in blindly imposed sentences of imprisonment that give no thought to the future. 

36Against that background and for the reasons to which I have adverted, I am of the view that although denunciation of the offender's crime together with the objective seriousness of the offending merit the imposition of a term of imprisonment, the particular circumstances surrounding this offence merit careful consideration of the issue of compounded punishment. 

37It is my view that whilst imprisonment is warranted as a manifestation of the need for denunciation and general deterrence, the environment in which such sentence would be served is affected by the offender's personal circumstances. The offender is a resident of the State of Victoria. He lives there with his family. In other circumstances, where the offence for which he stands to be sentenced is objectively judged by Parliament by reference to the maximum available sentence to be more serious, this circumstance may be of little consideration. 

38However, in relation to an offence of this nature, the available sentencing options of Home Detention and Intensive Correction Orders are unavailable. Had the offender been a resident of New South Wales I would have been inclined to consider the appropriate prison sentence be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order. Such a penalty of imprisonment would allow the offender to remain in effect a prisoner within his own home whilst undergoing appropriate Traffic Offender and other rehabilitation programmes and performing a level of compulsory work service to the community. Neither sentence is possible. The offender cannot receive a punishment greater than that otherwise contemplated by a Court where through no fault on his part, he is not able to serve a sentence in that particular way. 

39Consequently, I am persuaded to the view the competing interests of justice are to be best met by suspending the execution of the sentence. This is a sentence urged upon the Court by defence counsel and, somewhat surprisingly, by the solicitor for the Director for Public Prosecutions. Absent either the concession by the DPP or the fact of the offender's interstate residency or both, I would not have otherwise arrived at this sentence. 

40In coming to this conclusion I acknowledge the observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [32] where the court said: 

A sentencing court must approach the imposition of a sentence that is suspended on the basis that it can be a sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent both to the general public and the particular offender. Of course it must also be recognized that the fact that the execution of the sentence is to be immediately suspended will deprive the punishment of much of its effectiveness in this regard because it is a significantly more lenient penalty than any other sentence of imprisonment... It is perhaps trite to observe that, although the purpose of punishment is the protection of the community, that purpose can be achieved in an appropriate case by a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence retribution and denunciation. In such a case a suspended sentence may be particularly effective and appropriate. 

41It is important to note that unlike offenders for non-driving related offences, the offender will suffer an additional ""penalty"" in the form of licence disqualification. The national approach to driver disqualification agreed between States and Territories means any disqualification imposed in this State will be reflected in the withdrawal of licence privileges in other states and territories. For this offender, for the last decade driving has been his livelihood. He and his family depend on the income derived from this pursuit, one that will be now taken away from him for a period of time. This is not to be overlooked when considering the totality of consequences visited upon the offender for his conduct. Nor are the consequences of a breach of a bond under section 12. The Court of Appeal in DPP v Cooke [2007] NSWCA 2 makes it abundantly clear that a breach of such a bond will invariably result in the loss of the offender's conditional liberty. 

Orders 

42The offender is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 9 months and 27 days from today. Such sentence is suspended pursuant to the provisions of section 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 upon the offender entering a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of 9 months and 27 days to appear before this Court if called upon during that time. He is to be of good behaviour during the currency of the bond. The bond is further conditioned that the offender continue to seek and receive treatment for his identified condition of severe obstructive sleep apnoea during the currency of the bond and to obey all reasonable directions of his supervising medical practitioner. 

43As a consequence of conviction, the Court is required to consider the appropriate period of disqualification from holding a licence to drive in New South Wales (and for all practical purposes in all other States and Territories). The automatic period of disqualification is 3 years. In light of the steps taken thus far to remedy his previously deleterious condition regarding his health and taking into account observations made by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the Guideline Judgment for High Range PCA offences (Re Application by Attorney General (No 3 of 2002) (2004) 61 NSWLR 305) regarding the approach to be taken by courts in determining whether to depart from automatic periods of disqualification, I order the offender be disqualified from holding or obtaining a licence to drive in New South Wales for a period of two years from today. 

44Turning to the two regulatory offences, the discount for a plea of guilty also applies to these offences. They represent misconduct of an outwardly minor nature. Subjectively, however, they represent a mindset of disobedience on the part of the offender which, had it not been present, may have reduced the potentiality for the more serious offence to have been committed. For each of these offences the offender is convicted. After applying a discount on sentence for the utilitarian value of the plea the offender is fined the sum of $825 on each charge. He is also ordered to pay court costs in relation to these two offences in the sum of $81 for each of the two charges. By law I can only grant the offender 28 days to pay. That time is allowed. Any longer period is to be such period as a Registrar may allow.

2758428,PFC v R [2011] NSWCCA 275,"Judgment 

1THE COURT : The appellant stood trial before Norrish DCJ on an indictment containing 29 counts, some with alternatives. There were 19 counts of sexual assault or acts of indecency involving 6 different complainants, 3 counts of possessing child pornography or using a child for pornographic purposes, and 7 counts of perverting the course of justice. The trial occupied 27 days from 11 May 2009 to 19 June 2009. A verdict of not guilty on one count was directed on 25 May 2009. The jury returned verdicts of guilty on 23 of the remaining 28 counts. 

2On 21 December 2009 the appellant was sentenced to a total period of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 10 years 9 months and a balance of term of 3 years 8 months. 

3On 9 May 2011 this Court, differently constituted in part, heard an appeal against sentence brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The appeal was dismissed: R v PFC [2011] NSWCA 130. 

4The appellant had filed an appeal against conviction. He was unrepresented for that appeal, and there were difficulties in bringing it on for hearing. The hearing eventually took place on 14 and 24 October 2011. 

5For the reasons which follow, the appeal should be dismissed. 

6Section 15A of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 prohibits, in substance, the publication or broadcasting of the name of a child involved (including mentioned) in criminal proceedings, even if the person is no longer a child. This extends to material likely to lead to the identification of the person. We have thought it appropriate to refer extensively to persons involved in these proceedings who were children, and to others including the appellant through whom they might be identified, by initials and otherwise to express these reasons so as to avoid identification. 

Background 

7The appellant was born in 1953. He left school at the age of 15 to work in his brother's company. He worked variously in real estate and as a motor vehicle auctioneer, and then as a projectionist technician at Greater Union for 15 years. He took voluntary redundancy and moved to Taree. 

8The appellant was unemployed for some years, and undertook volunteer work at schools and in the community. He founded and ran a computer business from 1997 to 2001. During the period of the offences with which he was charged the appellant lived at Wingham, Taree or Pampoolah in the Manning River area. 

9The appellant had been married in 1976 and was divorced in 2000. There were five children of the marriage, some of whom lived with the appellant. 

10The offences charged in the indictment covered the period 1997 to 2009. The sexual assault or act of indecency offences involved the complainants DM (4 counts); CB (3 counts), SB (2 counts); DB (5 counts); MH (1 count) and TB (4 counts). All complainants were young males. DB, SB and TB were brothers, in descending order of age. The two offences of using a child for pornographic purposes involved DM and CB. For the offences of perverting the course of justice, it was alleged that the appellant had got or had attempted to get various of the complainants to provide false evidence in relation to one of these or other offences with which he had been charged. 

11The appellant met the complainants DM and CB either through his son B or through his son's friends; they were contemporaries of his son. It was contended by the Crown at trial that they were groomed in various ways by the appellant, such as by taking them on outings, exposing them to pornography, lending them the appellant's jet ski and giving them cash, accommodation or gifts. Both complainants were either dysfunctional or from dysfunctional backgrounds before they met the appellant, and CB in particular was prone to engage in anti-social behaviour. 

12The appellant also knew the complainants DB, SB and TB through knowing their family. There had been wider dysfunction in the B family. The children lost their mother when young, and between 2001 and 2006 the appellant performed a mentoring role. The appellant extended this role when SB came to live with him and he became SB's legal guardian. It was contended that these complainants were groomed in a similar manner to that described above. 

13The complainant MH was a contemporary of either or both of DB and SB, and was one of a group of youths who knew and were known by the appellant. 

14The appellant had some criminal antecedents. They included convictions in the early 1970's for false pretences, for which he received minor fines. There were no offences recorded against him from 1972 to 1999. In 1999 he was convicted of having goods in custody reasonably suspected of being stolen. He had been convicted in 1997 for the offence of indecent assault (later quashed) and in 2006 for the offences of attempting to procure a child for pornographic purposes, inciting a child to commit an act of indecency and possession of child pornography (the last later quashed); we refer to these later in our reasons. His criminal antecedents were not in evidence at the trial, but were material to his counsel's conduct of his defence.

15The offences of which the appellant was convicted are tabulated below, and the central evidence in the Crown case is summarised with some chronological context in the following paragraphs.

16For the 1997 conviction, later quashed, to which we have referred at [14] it was alleged that on 7 June 1997 the appellant took his son B and a friend TR to Sydney, the appellant and TR slept in the back of the appellant's station wagon, and TR woke up to find the appellant touching him in the groin area. The appellant was charged with indecent assault on 11 June 1997. The Crown initially sought to rely on this as tendency evidence, but it was excluded. As earlier indicated, this was relevant to counsel's conduct of the defence. 

17The first offences in time in the present appeal involved DM. DM was born in 1983. 

18The first offence was in August - September 1997, when DM stayed at the appellant's home in company with the appellant's son B and a friend SC. DM and the two others were watching videos. They fell asleep. DM woke to find the appellant touching him on the penis. He was directed into another room, where the appellant masturbated him. DM was scared. The appellant asked if he was going to tell anyone, and he said no. Afterwards the appellant gave DM some cash. This was the subject of count 1. 

19On 27 November 1997 the appellant was convicted in the Local Court at Burwood of indecent assault on TR. Looking ahead for the moment, he appealed to the District Court and on 27 July 1998 the conviction was quashed when the complainant was unwilling to give evidence. 

20The jury was not told of the TR allegations or the TR proceedings. 

21The second offence involving DM was in December 1997. The appellant took DM, in company with his son B and SC, from DM's home in Newcastle for a trip to Sydney, where they went skating and to the markets and played video games. DM and the other boys slept at the house of the appellant's mother in Rozelle. DM woke during the night with the appellant performing oral sex on him. This was the subject of count 2. 

22The third offence involving DM was some months later, in the first months of 1998. DM was taken to a lookout around 20 minutes out of Wingham, where the appellant took photographs of him with a video camera. DM was told to undress and masturbate himself so as to be erect for the photographs. The appellant said he wanted to have sex with DM, and pressed himself against his back and attempted to have intercourse whilst clothed. This was the subject of count 3. 

23The fourth offence involving DM was later again, in March-April 1998. The appellant gave DM a lift to a party at Wingham, to see CB and other friends. He stopped the car in a rest area. DM was told to remove his clothes and the appellant grabbed him on the penis. They then moved to the back seat of the car. The appellant was masturbating DM and ""sort of"" masturbating himself. The appellant attempted to put his penis in the anus of the complainant. After some time DM returned to the front seat of the car and they drove off. The appellant made DM reassure him that he was not going to tell anyone what had occurred and gave him cash (maybe $100-$150) and bought alcohol for him. This was the subject of count 4. 

24The appellant was charged with a further sexual offence involving DM (count 5), on which he was found not guilty. It was alleged that in March-April 1998 the appellant employed and used DM, a child under the age of 18 years, for pornographic purposes. 

25The next offence in time involved CB. He was born in 1982. 

26The appellant met CB through DM in or around May 1998. He introduced CB to pornography, including child pornography, at his home. The appellant told CB that he could make money by posing in photographs similar to those he had been shown, and that the appellant would take pictures of him and find someone to sell them to and would give CB a percentage of the money made. CB initially told the appellant that he was not interested in the offer. Around one week later CB contacted the appellant and said he was willing to have some photos taken. They met in town and the appellant drove the complainant to a lookout. The appellant told CB there was no guarantee of being paid immediately. The complainant was told to pose and to arouse himself. After the photos were taken CB was given money so that he could buy some cigarettes. This was the subject of count 7. 

27The appellant was charged with other offences involving CB, on which he was found not guilty. Three occasions of sexual assault in April-May 1998 were alleged (counts 8-10; count 10 was the subject of the verdict by direction). He was also charged with acting with intent to pervert the course of justice (count 11), see at [57] below. 

28Chronologically, and material to the charge in counts 6 and 11 of perverting the course of justice, on 9 June 1998 the appellant asked DM and CB to make a video for him. The video (Exhibit B) depicts DM and CB speaking to the camera. The trial judge noted that the complainants appeared to be saying memorised lines or reading from pieces of paper. In the video DM said the following - 

""DM: CB and I would like to apologise to [ son B] and his dad Mr C. We have been to lots of parties and someone always brings up Mr C and they call him Paedophile P. We add to the gossip by saying that he felt us up and molested us. When we're at these parties everyone tries to outdo each other with bullshit. We are sorry for upsetting [son B] and his dad, they have done a lot and always been there for us to help us, me a lot since I moved out of home. Mr C is a ledge. Today is the 9th June 1998. And do you know what, Mr C is a scammer. Sorry, [son B], man. Hey DB its your turn bro. 

CB: Really let [son B] and Mr C down. When you're at a party and you don't care what you say as long as someone listens to you, you say bullshit like Mr C molested me and everyone wants to know the details and girls really get sorry for me and start to hug me. I know it was the wrong thing to say these things, wait, I can't read my own writing, but I get so mixed up that I just like attention. Sorry [son B], I hope you and your dad can forgive me. I am in a bit of trouble now and Mr C is helping me. I don't know how bullshit can get out of control. I've heard the school, I heard it at school about me and DM. I'm sorry."" 

29DM gave evidence that the contents of the recorded statement were not true and that in the video he had read from a statement that the appellant had given him. 

30The next offences in time involved DB. He was born in 1987. He first met the appellant through the appellant's nephew JR, who attended the same school. 

31The first offence involving DB was in the second half of 2001. JR and DB went out on the appellant's jet ski on a number of occasions. When they returned from one of their outings, JR and DB went back to the appellant's house and started playing on the computer in the appellant's computer room. The appellant took DB into the lounge room, and had him lie on his stomach while he gave him a massage all over his body. DB was then asked to lie on his back while the appellant massaged his chest and legs and had DB remove his shirt. The appellant started to play with the complainant's penis. DB ran away, but eventually was taken back to the lounge room when the appellant undid DB's pants and placed DB's penis in his mouth. This was the subject of count 16. 

32The second offence involving DB was about a month later. DB went to Sydney with the appellant and JR. They took JR to his stepfather's house, then went to Time Zone and thereafter to McDonalds. The appellant told DB that they should sleep in the car as it was getting late. He parked the car on a small road near bushland and had DB get into the back of the station wagon with him. There was no bedding. The appellant had the complainant face away from him and inserted his penis into DB's anus. Both slept in the car then eventually drove back to Taree with JR. This was the subject of count 17. 

33The third offence involving DB was later in 2001 or in 2002. DB, SB and a number of other boys were staying at the appellant's house. The appellant suggested that DB accompany him to get some pizza. He drove to a lookout near Taree, stopped the car and got into the back of the station wagon with DB, and inserted his penis into DB's anus. They bought pizza and returned to the appellant's home. This was the subject of count 19. 

34The fourth offence took place later in 2002. DB continued to go jet skiing with the appellant. On one occasion after they returned to the appellant's home the appellant watched DB shower, then took him to his bedroom and inserted his penis into DB's anus. This was the subject of count 20. 

35The appellant was charged with a further sexual offence involving DB, count 18, on which he was found not guilty. DB gave evidence of them driving to a motel near Lismore, where they shared a bed and the appellant touched his penis and put the appellant's mouth to it. 

36The next offence in time involved MH. He was born in 1990. He had met the appellant through a friend when he was in year 7. 

37The offence was in the first half of 2003. The appellant had offered to take MH wherever he would like to go around the Taree area. MH called the appellant and asked him for a lift. The appellant picked MH up and told him that he needed to go back to his house to collect something. The appellant took MH into the computer room where he showed him pictures and files of naked boys. MH said he was not interested in the pictures and asked to be taken home. The appellant told MH that he could make a lot of money from selling photos such as the ones he had shown him on the internet and overseas. The appellant then led MH into the shower and told him to wash himself. He took MH out of the shower, took him into the lounge room, told him to lie down on the floor and began to masturbate him. When the appellant had finished he offered to take MH home. MH dressed himself. The appellant told MH not to tell anyone. This was the subject of count 23. 

38The next offences in time involved SB. He was born in 1989. There were problems at home, and SB came to live at the appellant's house and the appellant became his guardian. 

39The first offence involving SB was about a week after SB moved into the appellant's house. It was charged as an offence in the period 1 August 2003 - 31 November 2003, but the appellant contended that SB did not come to live at his house until May 2004. The appellant disturbed SB while he was attempting to go to sleep. He touched SB on the leg. SB pushed him away. The appellant pulled down SB's boxer shorts and kept forcing himself on the complainant (who was lying on his stomach), eventually putting his penis in SB's anus and ejaculating. The appellant told SB not to tell anyone or go to the police. This was the subject of count 12. 

40Chronologically, we next refer to the proceedings between the appellant and the father of TR, whom we will call TR2. On 7 November 2003 the appellant complained to police that TR2 tried to run him over. On 2 December 2003 he commenced a private prosecution against TR2 in the Taree Local Court on a charge of intimidation. 

41During the hearing of that matter on 15 April 2004, DB gave evidence as a witness for the appellant. Count 21 charged that the appellant had done an act with intent to pervert the course of justice, namely, persuade DB to give false evidence in the TR2 proceedings. At a time before the hearing he got DB to sign, without reading them, statements to the effect that he saw a man trying to run the appellant over, whom he knew and would recognise. The appellant called DB as a witness, telling him that he had to abide by the statements or he would be in trouble. DB gave evidence in the present trial that the statements were false. 

42Also at a time before the hearing, the appellant promised MH money to sign a statement for use in the TR2 proceedings saying that he saw the appellant being hit by a man near a store. MH signed a statement dated 11 November 2003. MH ultimately did not give evidence. This was the subject of count 24. 

43The appellant subsequently withdrew the intimidation charge against TR2. 

44The second offence involving SB was in April-June 2004. SB went between his father's house and the appellant's house frequently. At a time SB was staying with the appellant he was again asleep when the appellant entered his bedroom. The appellant pulled down the blankets and SB's boxer shorts and put his penis into SB's anus. This lasted for approximately 5 minutes, SB thought the appellant ejaculated. He said he was going to inform the police what had happened. The appellant told him, ""No you won't because you're getting money out of this case"". This was the subject of count 13. 

45The third offence involving SB concerned the appellant using a video camera to record SB performing sexual acts with a carrot. The appellant and SB went on holidays together to the Gold Coast and Thredbo. Over this time the appellant asked the complainant if he would pose for pornographic photos for him, and showed him pornographic pictures of youths aged between 10 and 17. He told the complainant that he had posed in similar photos when he was the complainant's age. The complainant refused to take part. Then the appellant asked SB again, and told him that he could make money as the video could be sold overseas on the internet. SB agreed as he had no money. They went back to the appellant's house, where the video was set up in the lounge and sexual acts were recorded including masturbation and SB placing the carrot in his anus. No one else was present. This was the subject of count 14. 

46The ""carrot video"" and a ""second carrot video"" received particular attention in the appeal. At the end of the ""carrot video"" SB said, ""DB P's home. Can we stop now?"" SB gave evidence that he was told to say this by the appellant, whom he was afraid of. The appellant relied on it to show that he was not recording the video, and cross-examined SB accordingly. 

47The final sexual offences involved TB. He was born in 1991, and had met the appellant through his brothers although initially he had not been allowed to go jet skiing with them. 

48The first offence involving TB was in early 2005. The appellant asked SB and TB to chop wood for him. Whilst he was taking a break the appellant asked TB to lie on the lounge, rubbed him on the chest and body on the outside of his clothes, then asked him to take off his shirt and shorts which TB did as he was afraid of what would happen otherwise. The appellant asked TB to take off his underwear. TB did not want to do it but thought he had to. The appellant then sucked TB on his penis. TB ejaculated. The appellant asked TB to repeat the action to him. TB refused to do so. This was the subject of count 25. 

49The second offence involving TB was in the following months. TB was approached by the appellant in the street. He told the appellant he was going to his friend's house to borrow some money. The appellant said that he would give TB some money and a McDonalds meal if TB came with him to his house. They purchased some McDonalds and drove to the appellant's house. Along the way the appellant told TB to remain hidden (crouched down) in the car to be out of sight to observers. When TB and the appellant arrived at the appellant's house they went to the appellant's bedroom where the appellant told TB to remove his clothes and lie on the bed. The appellant helped TB remove his clothes and sucked TB's penis. The appellant then told TB to turn over onto his hands and knees, which he did. TB felt some liquid on his backside that he later understood to be lubricant. The appellant had anal intercourse with TB. The complainant asked the appellant to stop what he was doing. On his second request the appellant stopped. TB had a shower and the appellant drove him home. This was the subject of count 26. 

50The third offence involving TB was took place some months later again, in the latter part of 2005. The appellant invited TB over to his house. TB was reluctant to go but the appellant offered him money if he went with him. While the complainant was playing PlayStation, the appellant sucked TB's penis. TB ejaculated. This was the subject of count 27. 

51The fourth offence involving TB was in the first part of 2006. About 5 or 6 months after the preceding incident TB was approached by the appellant in his car as TB was walking to the Aquatic Centre. The appellant asked TB to come to his house, and offered him money for entrance to the Aquatic Centre and some McDonalds. TB agreed. The appellant drove TB to his house, asking TB to hide himself in the car so that he would not be seen. On arrival the appellant told TB he had something to show him. He took him to the computer room where he showed him a video of two boys giving each other oral sex. The appellant then pulled TB's pants down and sucked his penis. TB ejaculated. The appellant took TB to the Acquatic Centre and gave him money for entry to the pool and some McDonalds. This was the subject of count 28. 

52At this point we refer to ""the Port Macquarie proceedings"", from which came the 2006 convictions to which we have referred at [14]. 

53The Port Macquarie proceedings took place before Garling DCJ in the District Court at Port Macquarie in 2006. In that trial the appellant was charged with attempting to procure a child over 14 for pornographic purposes, inciting a person under 16 to commit an act of indecency and possession of child pornography. The appellant represented himself at the hearing. The appellant was convicted on all three counts. The Court of Criminal Appeal confirmed the conviction for the first two counts but quashed the conviction on the third count ( [C] v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 122; (2008) 185 A Crim R 1). The appellant was re-sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months and a balance of term of 18 months on which he was eligible for release on parole in June 2008. 

54The Port Macquarie proceedings were the occasion for the offences the subject of counts 6, 11, 15 and 22. By a statement of agreed facts, the jury was told only enough of them to explain the calling of DM, CB and DB as witnesses in the proceedings, and was told that they did not concern allegations of sexual assault made by DM, CB, DB or SB. 

55The appellant gave the police a video recording of SB stating that the appellant did not make sexual advances to him, to enable the police to call SB as a witness at the trial. He also asked SB to sign various statements containing denials that he had ever been assaulted by the appellant. SB gave evidence in the present case that he told the appellant before the Port Macquarie hearing that he would not give evidence for the appellant or lie for him, and that threats had been made to him to entice him to make various recordings. This was the subject of count 15. 

56The appellant persuaded DB to attend Port Macquarie court and give evidence under oath that he had seen DB and the complainant in the Port Macquarie proceedings kissing, which in his evidence in the present case DB said was untrue. This was the subject of count 22. 

57The appellant tendered in the Port Macquarie proceedings the video Exhibit B in which DM and CB apologised for wrongly gossiping that he had molested them. This was the subject of counts 6 (guilty) and 11 (not guilty). 

58The final count, one of perverting the course of justice, is count 29. On 8 February 2009 the appellant approached TB at a supermarket in Taree. He asked TB to record a video saying that the appellant was a ""top notch bloke"" and that his brothers had lied in their allegations against him. TB gave evidence that the appellant had offered him $250,000. He told the appellant that he would consider the offer. Later he told the appellant that he did not want to do the interview. 

The appeal 

59The appellant's former solicitors filed a notice of appeal on 17 December 2009. The appellant became unrepresented. As earlier mentioned, there were difficulties in bringing the appeal to a hearing. An earlier hearing date for the appeal was vacated. 

60The appellant filed numerous affidavits and submissions, the former largely being in the nature of submissions rather than factual and the latter containing non-evidentiary factual assertions. There were over 950 pages of these materials (""the appellant's submissions""). The issues raised included the conduct of the appellant's defence by his counsel and solicitor and his mental state at the time of the trial. Affidavits from counsel and the solicitor and from a consultant psychiatrist who had examined the appellant in connection with his trial and a post-conviction bail application were read by the Crown. The materials in appellant's submissions were supplemented by a complete set of appellant's written instructions to his lawyers. Counsel and the solicitor were cross-examined by the appellant. 

61We set out below the appellant's grounds of appeal in their final form. They will be repeated as appropriate when we deal with each. 

""The appellant relies upon the following Grounds & Submissions in that the appellant lost a 'Significant possibility' of an acquittal because of the matters referred to below.

Ground of Appeal 1 - The incompetence of trial counsel led to a miscarriage of justice in that counsel - 

a. failed to put the appellant's defence of being set up by one group of complainants to the Court. 

b. failed to act on the appellant's written and verbal instructions before and during the trial including alibi evidence. 

c. failed to call upon Crown witnesses for cross-examination. 

d. failed to call upon defence witnesses to give evidence. 

e. failed to defend the appellant with respect to the aspersion made by his Honour before the jury that the appellant may be a ""MIND READER"".

g. failed to properly and/or adequately examine the appellant in chief and/or in re-examination to establish his innocents [sic] with regard to the state of the evidence, 

h. failed in general to defend the appellant to a professional standard having regard to all matters raised in these submissions, inter alia, no proof of evidence. 

62In response to this ground of appeal affidavits by Mr Roff, the appellant's solicitor at trial, affirmed 14 June and 29 September 2011, were read. Mr Roff was cross-examined by the appellant. Three affidavits sworn 14 June, 4 October and 13 October 2011 by Mr Webb, the appellant's counsel at trial, were also read. Mr Webb was cross-examined by the appellant. Affidavits of Ms Boulous, who had instructed for the Crown, were also read. Ms Boulos was not cross-examined. 

63We found Messrs Webb and Roff to be impressive witnesses. They were honest and, to the best of their ability, endeavoured to assist the Court by setting out what occurred between them and the appellant before and during the trial. Whilst their recollections were not perfect as to every detail, it was quite apparent from their evidence under cross-examination that each of them had a good recollection of these events and that they were reliable witnesses. Unless otherwise indicated, we accept the evidence of Messrs Webb and Roff. 

64It was common ground that despite strong advice of Messrs Webb and Roff to the contrary, the appellant gave instructions both written and oral that the hearing of all the matters should proceed together and that there should not be separate trials in respect of each complainant. The rationale behind the appellant's instructions in this regard was his contention that he had been ""set up"", that the complainants had conspired together to bring false accusations against him, and that he would be better able to establish that proposition in a joint trial. 

65The flavour of what turned out to be a difficult relationship between Messrs Webb and Roff on the one hand, and the appellant on the other hand, is set out in para 8 of Mr Webb's affidavit of 14 June 2011 where he referred to what happened at either a conference of 21 August 2008 or a conference of 9 October 2008 or both - 

""8. [The appellant] said words to the effect - 

'I've been set up and when the jury hear all of the complainants and all of the allegations in the one trial they will see that it is all just a set up. I have video footage of SB masturbating at my house. That's why SB is trying to set me up. I also have video footage of DM masturbating at my house six years before I caught SB out. This is why they are trying to set me up.' 

[The appellant] also said - 

'I want to relitigate the [complainant in the Port Macquarie proceedings] matters and the [TR] matters in my trial. I also want to raise my character to show that I am innocent and I won't take no for an answer.' 

I said - 

'Mr [C] you should plainly understand that I will not raise your character in any trial in which I represent you because you have a criminal record for dishonesty and a criminal record which includes convictions for allegations of a type that you are now facing. You should also note that I will not introduce in any trial any matters to do with [TR] or [the complainant in the Port Macquarie proceedings]. It would not assist you in a trial or trials of this type to raise the issue that you have convictions for dishonesty or to raise the issue that there have been previous allegations made against you concerning sexual misconduct and dealing with children for pornographic purposes. You should plainly understand that I will not budge on these issues and if you wish to obtain other counsel you are free to do so and you should do so if you want these things introduced. I will not introduce them, full stop. I will not introduce your character into a trial or the fact that you have had previous allegations made against you which are outside the matters that you are now charged with. You should think carefully about these things because it is open to you to retain another barrister who may have different views to those which I hold. You should give this careful consideration because once the trial or trials commence, given that you know that I will not budge on these issues, your insistence on bringing these matters into evidence will lead to my withdrawing from your trial. Criminal trials cost the people of New South Wales a fortune and it would be a shocking waste if some weeks into the trial it becomes necessary for me to withdraw'."" 

66Before dealing with specific submissions by the appellant, we set out the principles applicable to a ground of appeal raising incompetence of counsel. In Monteiro v R [2011] NSWCCA 113 Simpson J, with whom Hoeben and Price JJ agreed, said - 

""[155] The principles applicable to the determination of a ground of appeal raising alleged incompetence of counsel were settled in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677. Those principles include - 

'2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 

3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of 'flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.' (p 685, per Gleeson CJ) 

[156] Earlier, Gleeson CJ had said - 

'As a general rule, a party is bound by the conduct of his or her counsel, and counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to what witnesses to call, what questions to ask or not to ask, what lines of argument to pursue and what points to abandon, are all matters within the discretion of counsel and frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to tactics. The authorities concerning the rights and duties of counsel are replete with emphatic statements which stress both the independent role of the barrister and the binding consequences for the client of decisions taken by a barrister in the course of running a case.' (p 683) 

[157] The Chief Justice cited, and plainly accepted, a passage from Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed, Vol 3(1), par 518 at 420 which is in the following terms - 

'... a barrister is ordinarily instructed on the implied understanding that he is to have complete control over the way in which the case is conducted. Unless and until his instructions are withdrawn, counsel has, with regard to all matters that properly relate to the conduct of the case, unlimited authority to do whatever he considers best for the interests of his client. This authority extends to all matters relating to the action, including the calling and cross-examination of witnesses, challenging a juror, deciding what points to take, choosing which of two inconsistent defences to put forward, and even to agreeing to a compromise of the action, or to a verdict, order or judgment.' (p 684) 

[158] The decision in Birks was essentially endorsed by the High Court in TKWJ v R [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124. There, Gleeson CJ said - 

'16 It is undesirable to attempt to be categorical about what might make unfair an otherwise regularly conducted trial. But, in the context of the adversarial system of justice, unfairness does not exist simply because an apparently rational decision by trial counsel, as to what evidence to call or not to call, is regarded by an appellate court as having worked to the possible, or even probable, disadvantage of the accused. For a trial to be fair, it is not necessary that every tactical decision of counsel be carefully considered, or wise. And it is not the role of a Court of Criminal Appeal to investigate such decisions in order to decide whether they were made after the fullest possible examination of all material considerations. Many decisions as to the conduct of a trial are made almost instinctively, and on the basis of experience and impression rather than analysis of every possible alternative. That does not make them wrong or imprudent, or expose them to judicial scrutiny. Even if they are later regretted, that does not make the client a victim of unfairness. It is the responsibility of counsel to make tactical decisions, and assess risks."" 


67Hunt CJ at CL made observations to similar effect in Ignjatic v R (1993) 68 A Crim R 333 at 336 - 

""Counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to which witnesses should or should not be called, what questions should or should not be asked, which lines of argument should be pursued, which points should be abandoned and which of two or more inconsistent defences should be raised are all matters within the discretion of counsel, and they frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to the best tactics to be adopted. Neither disobedience of instructions or even incompetence is sufficient of itself to attract appellate intervention. It is only when the error made was of such a nature in the circumstance of the case as to have led to a miscarriage of justice that this court will interfere."" 

68The task facing counsel at trial was a difficult one. Not only did he have to deal with a large number of counts of an essentially similar kind from six different complainants, but those counts included what were described as "" public justice counts"", ie doing acts intending to pervert the course of justice (counts 6, 11, 15, 21, 22, 24 and 29). Counsel also had to deal with counts involving the use of juveniles for pornographic purposes (counts 7 and 14). 

69Most of the material the appellant wished to rely upon which suggested that he had been ""set up"" by the complainants came from statements and videos taken by him from the complainants or other young persons. Counsel appreciated that the more statements taken by the appellant which were produced, the stronger the inference would become that the appellant was able to control and manipulate these young persons by getting them to sign statements that he had prepared or participate in videos which he had arranged. Neither at trial, nor in the appeal, did the appellant appear to understand the seriousness of this problem. 

70Additionally, some of the material in counsel's brief and which the appellant had in his possession could properly be classified as child pornography. In the case of the "" carrot video"", it was the appellant's position that he knew it was going to be made before it was filmed and that DB had assisted him by obtaining and providing a copy of the video to him. The appellant admitted to covertly filming young boys masturbating in his home and to downloading from the internet a picture of a young male in a bath with his face obscured masturbating which he tendered in the Port Macquarie proceedings (written instructions, 11 May 2009, pp 14, 16, 67). Throughout the proceedings, the appellant was the only person who produced such material either to the police or to a court. Counsel appreciated, but the appellant did not, that the more of this material which was used (the probative value of which was marginal at best), the more likely it was that the jury would draw an inference adverse to the appellant in respect of the pornographic photographs counts. 

71The concern and care with which counsel treated that material at the trial could not in any way be regarded as "" flagrantly incompetent"", and was well within his authority as counsel conducting a trial on behalf of the appellant. Many of the specific complaints now raised by the appellant involve a considerable element of hindsight and a failure to understand the double-edged nature of this evidence. 

72In oral submissions and in the document entitled Eighth Supplementary Submissions (appellant's submissions pp 898-904), the appellant set out his specific complaints concerning the conduct of the trial by counsel. Mr Webb responded to those complaints in his affidavits and in oral evidence when cross-examined. 

(a) The failure to put the appellant's defence of being set up by one group of complainants to the Court 

73The real complaint of the appellant was not so much that counsel did not put the defence, but that counsel did not put the defence in the way in which the appellant would have liked it to have been put. Counsel clearly raised the matter in open court before the jury (AB638) when he said - 

""Mr C's case is one which raises fabrication on the part of the complainants. Each of them individually and sometimes collectively ... "" 

Not only was this proposition put by counsel in his closing address, but it was comprehensively dealt with by the trial Judge in his summing-up. 

74On this issue, the appellant's case at trial was that he became concerned about rumours circulating in the Taree area that he was a paedophile. It seems to have been accepted that he was known as ""Paedophile P""; there was evidence that when he drove CB to a party in April-May 1998 bottles were thrown at him and he was called that. He consequently formed the belief that he might be set up. It was this belief that was relied upon to explain why he took the unusual action of gathering what he believed to be exculpatory material from various young persons in the form of statements and videos and why he kept certain pornographic material (appellant in chief AB1886-1890, 1898; cross-examination AB1964-1965; defence closing address AB2131-2132, 2138; summing-up AB156-157, 218-219). The video made on 9 June 1998, Exhibit B, in which DM apologised for ""add[ing] to the gossip by saying that he felt us up and molested us"" and CB gave a similar apology is one such video; as we have noted, DM gave evidence that what he said was not true and he had read from a statement the appellant had given him. 

75DM and CB were cross-examined on the basis that they had collaborated to bring false allegations of a sexual nature against the appellant (AB818). SB was cross-examined to the effect that the appellant did not film the "" carrot video"" and that SB intended that video to make the appellant look guilty or to set the appellant up (AB1237). (As we have earlier mentioned, the appellant relied on the video recording SB saying ""DB, P's home. Can we stop now"" to show that the appellant was not recording it, but SB's evidence was that he was told to say that.) DB was cross-examined to the effect that he made false allegations against the appellant in order to avoid going to prison for an unrelated offence (AB1377-1383). MH was cross-examined to the effect that he had fabricated his evidence involving allegations of sexual assault and that what was contained in a statement which he signed on behalf of the appellant was the truth (AB1434-1443). TB was cross-examined to the effect that he made allegations against the appellant because he became aware that his older brothers had made such allegations and he wanted to support them (AB1497, 1525). This is not exhaustive. In our opinion, consistently with awareness of the dangers of using statements and videos taken by the appellant, the defence was maintained. 

76This sub-ground of appeal has not been made out. 

(b) The failure to act on the appellant's written and verbal instructions before and during the trial including alibi evidence 

77During the trial, counsel adopted the procedure of checking with the appellant after the cross-examination of any contentious or important witness. He told the appellant that he would not move onto another witness unless he was satisfied that the appellant was happy. In his evidence in the appeal, Mr Webb said - 

""A. The defence was run that you agreed to, which was the exculpatory videos concerning [DM, CB and SB] and otherwise that the case would be run in accordance with my forensic judgment having regard to your interests and it was a feature of the way in which your instructions were settled that we would pause along the way, as to say you and I and Daniel [Roff] or the instructing officer of the firm with us, to inquire are you okay with the way the case is being run, are you happy with the way in which cross-examination is being conducted. So that in my mind, because of the way that you provided the instructions it was best to pause along the way, stop and say, are you happy with that, is that okay and then keep proceeding. And that in my mind was the best safeguard to ensure that your instructions were complied with in the context of our agreements and that is what occurred along the way."" (T14, 24 October 2011) 

78On what appears to be the only occasion when counsel did not follow this procedure, the appellant wrote a letter to his solicitors and sent copies to the trial Judge and the DPP (appellant's submissions p 127). The transcript records the Judge affording counsel time the following day to obtain further instructions (AB1408). 

79The trial transcript supports counsel's evidence to the effect that he obtained confirmatory instructions from the appellant throughout the trial (AB820, 900, 1198, 1249, 1260, 1398-1400, 1408, 1513, 1516, 1686, 1783, 1871, 1899 and 2020). 

80Both counsel and the instructing solicitor advised the appellant in clear and very definite terms that he should not give evidence. The appellant did not take that advice and gave evidence. This was a matter in relation to which the appellant would not change his instructions and counsel, against his better judgment, allowed the appellant to give evidence. 

81In addition to his written submissions, the appellant, in cross-examination, identified specific pieces of evidence which, he submitted, counsel should have used, but did not do so. These submissions are most appropriately considered under this ground of appeal. As can be seen, when counsel followed the appellant's instructions the result was often unsatisfactory. When he refused to do so, there were sound forensic reasons behind that decision. 

82It is clear from the transcript of the trial that counsel did not reject the appellant's instructions without good reason. When he thought there was a forensic advantage to be gained, he followed the appellant's instructions. Where the supposed forensic advantage was disproportionate to the prejudicial effect, counsel did not follow the appellant's instructions. As already indicated, on a number of occasions during the trial and in the course of the appeal, the appellant appeared to have no appreciation of the prejudicial effect likely to flow from evidence or lines of enquiry which he instructed counsel to use. 

Statement of SB dated 6 December 2006 

83In accordance with instructions, counsel sought to cross-examine SB on the basis of a statement produced by the appellant which he said had been signed by SB on 6 December 2006. This was a statement in which SB denied that the appellant had committed any offences against him. When shown to SB, he said that it was not his signature and testified that he had never seen the document before (AB1258-1259). 

The SB shower video 

84In accordance with instructions, counsel sought to introduce into evidence a pornographic video of SB masturbating in the shower (Exhibit 2). This was only done after SB had given evidence to the effect that the only pornographic video he had taken part in was the "" carrot video"" (AB1168). After being shown Exhibit 2, SB testified that he had no recollection of taking part in that video. Counsel then suggested to him that he had lied to cover up the fact that he had been caught out (AB1237-1238). Upon instructions, counsel put to SB (AB1263) that it was DM who took that video. SB denied this and said that he did not know a DM and could not remember ever making that film. When DM was recalled as a result of that evidence of SB, he said that he did not know SB and did not take part in the filming of the video (AB1601-1602). The result, of course, was that the jury was likely to think that the appellant took the video. 

The Dean-Tim video 

85This was a video featuring the appellant and DB which was allegedly taken on 16 June 2001. In it DB, inter alia, told the appellant that TR told him that ""he could make easy money or something by saying that [the appellant] put his hands down my pants or something"". The admissibility and probative value of this document was discussed in court in the absence of the jury (AB1395-1400). 

86The ramifications and potential prejudice to the appellant of this video were significant, in that it could open up the issue of the appellant having also sexually assaulted another young adolescent boy, ie TR. Counsel sought instructions on the tender of this video (AB1400). Oral instructions not to tender it were given, the appellant was asked to sign confirmatory written instructions, but he wrote ""do not"" into the instructions to reverse their meaning. He then changed his instructions again, and returned to instructions not to tender the video. 

87Counsel dealt with the issue of how the words ""do not"" were added to the instructions in paragraph 4 of his affidavit of 4 October 2011. There counsel said - 

""4. In the ninth supplementary submissions the Appellant refers to his having written in 'do not'. This is correct. In the course of the trial, see T851, his Honour made some remarks regarding the potentially prejudicial nature of certain evidence. These remarks were relevant in my mind to the Dean-Tim video. This video was not intended in the context of the defence case to be tendered or pressed because it introduced [TR] into the trial, raising a further allegation of sexual misconduct against [the appellant], not otherwise in the trial. [The appellant] had previously agreed to keep [TR] (and [the complainant in the Port Macquarie proceedings]) out. Mr Roff then proceeded to draft written instructions at the bar table reflecting and confirming [the appellant's] previously agreed position on this issue. Mr Roff then approached the dock to ask [the appellant] to sign the instruction. [The appellant] then wrote the words 'do not', clearly indicating he wanted the tender and/or or the issue pressed. At this point Mr Roff approached me and indicated [the appellant's] position. I then walked to the dock with Mr Roff and spoke to Mr C in words to the effect - 

'Counsel: Mr C I advise you against pressing this issue. It will bring [TR] into the trial. 

[The appellant]: All right do what you think is best, I'll trust you.' 

I then turned to Mr Roff in the presence of Mr C and said 'Daniel, are they my instructions? That is not to press the issue'. Mr Roff then said yes they are. I then indicated my instructions to the court."" 

88Mr Roff gave evidence concerning this issue (T35.4, 14.10.11) - 

""A. Mr C had said to us he wanted the Dean Tim video, as he called it, played to the jury. Dr Webb indicated the same to his Honour Judge Norrish and Judge Norrish made certain comments regarding potential dangers of that to Mr C in the circumstances. Hearing that I began to prepare a file note on the basis [the appellant], being capable of intelligence in some circumstances, would agree the tender would not be pressed. When I presented him with that document he wrote in words 'do not' and then signed it down the bottom. I took that back to Dr Webb, showed Dr Webb what [the appellant] had said and asked Dr Webb to come with me and talk to [the appellant]. We both went back to the dock, explained the situation to [the appellant] and [the appellant] said what I have written down the bottom but refused to sign it again after having crossed out the words 'do not'. So I made a note of what he had said given that something may arise if Mr C complained about us afterwards. 

Q. Were they the words he used? 
A. They were the words he used. 

Q. 'I trust youse'? 
A. 'I trust youse'."" 

89The version of events described by counsel and the instructing solicitor is consistent with the trial transcript (AB1396-1400). 

90The decision by counsel not to press the tender of this video was undoubtedly correct. Its benefit to the appellant's case was problematic at best, but its prejudicial effect would be inevitable and substantial. The tender of that video could only have damaged the appellant's case. 

The Todd Ellis video 

91The Crown sought to call Todd Ellis as a witness in its case. The evidence would have been relevant to counts 21 and 24 which were public justice offences. The Crown case was that the appellant persuaded DB (count 21) and attempted to persuade MH (count 24) to give false evidence in his private prosecution against TR2. 

92Count 21 involved the appellant persuading DB to falsely state that he had seen an incident where TR2 had tried to drive into the appellant. DB gave evidence in the Taree Local Court that he had seen such an incident. At trial, he said that the evidence he gave for the appellant at the Taree Local Court was false (AB1354-1358). TR2 was called at the trial and gave evidence that he had not been involved in any such incident (AB1613). 

93Count 24 involved an attempt by the appellant to have MH give evidence in those same proceedings by promising him money. MH signed a statement prepared by the appellant, the details of which MH said at trial were not true. The statement said that he had witnessed TR2 try to drive into the appellant. He said that he signed the statement because of the offer of money and his immaturity (AB1431). 

94Todd Ellis had also signed a statement prepared by the appellant which stated that he had witnessed the incident. On 1 April 2009, the appellant sent a copy of this statement to police asking them to investigate and to call Todd Ellis at trial. Police located Todd Ellis and obtained a statement from him on 29 April 2009 (AB1572-1580). When first shown the statement (purported to have been signed on 12 November 2003), Todd Ellis had no recollection of ever having signed it. After speaking to DB, he was reminded of an incident when he was aged 14 when the appellant came to the home of an acquaintance, produced a statement and asked him to sign it. DB was present at the time. Todd Ellis said that he signed it because the appellant said he would give him some money. Under cross-examination on the voir dire, Todd Ellis confirmed that what was written in the statement he signed for the appellant was false. He said that he was not present when the incident was said to have occurred and did not see anything (AB1584). 

95At trial, the Crown sought to use the evidence of Todd Ellis in two ways - 

(1) as a piece of circumstantial evidence to show that the incident did not happen; and 

(2) as tendency and coincidence evidence consistent with the appellant preparing false statements and arranging for them to be signed by young persons. 

96The defence objected to Todd Ellis being called in the Crown case. A voir dire was held (AB1572-1590). The Judge ruled that the evidence of Todd Ellis was inadmissible (AB59-93). There is no ground of appeal challenging his Honour's ruling. 

97At trial, the appellant gave evidence that Todd Ellis was present at the time of the incident and ran across the road to ask him if he was ""OK"". The appellant's complaint on appeal was that Todd Ellis was not called by the defence at the trial and that counsel did not see the "" Todd Ellis video"". The appellant said that the video recorded an interview between him and Todd Ellis about the incident involving TR2 in which Todd Ellis supported his version of events. 

98Had the evidence of Todd Ellis and the video been led in chief in the appellant's case, this would not have assisted him. When the appellant made a statement to police concerning the incident, he did not disclose that Todd Ellis was an eyewitness. The evidence of Todd Ellis on the voir dire was that he did not see the incident and that he was induced by the appellant to sign a false statement by the offer of money. The introduction of yet another video of a young person reciting matters which he said were false and which he was put up to by the appellant, would not have assisted the appellant. 

99In any event, the Todd Ellis video would only have become relevant had Todd Ellis given evidence at the trial. His evidence was ruled inadmissible by the trial Judge and so that issue did not arise. Finally, counsel said that he had never been provided with a copy of the Todd Ellis video. 

The ""full carrot video"" or ""second carrot video"" 

100The appellant submitted that, in accordance with his instructions, counsel should have tendered the ""full carrot video"" or ""second carrot video "" . At trial, a "" carrot video"" was tendered (Exhibit D). In the appeal, the appellant said that the ""second carrot video"" was a longer version of that which had been tendered at trial. Despite a number of requests by the Court, the appellant was not able to articulate what was in the ""second carrot video"" which would have provided more assistance to his case at trial than had already been provided by Exhibit D. Exhibit D was used to cross-examine SB, see [75] above. 

101The defence advanced at trial in respect of count 14 (which was based on Exhibit D) was that the appellant was not present or involved in the actual making of the video (AB2131-2131), but that it had been made by DB and SB. Counsel agreed that the appellant had told him that there was a ""second carrot video"" which was longer. Neither he nor Mr Roff had been provided with a copy of the longer video nor had they ever viewed it. Notwithstanding that counsel did not see the longer video, he was aware of it and proceeded on the basis that it would not assist the defence. It is not clear to us how the fact that the appellant was also in possession of a longer version of this video, or may have been involved in editing or otherwise manipulating a copy of the longer version, would have assisted the appellant at trial. This is particularly so when the appellant was not able to identify for this Court the difference between the longer ""carrot video"" and Exhibit D which would have assisted him at trial. The matter was further complicated at the hearing of the appeal by the appellant's statement that there was yet a third "" carrot video"", the contents of which he did not further describe. 

102Not only was counsel entitled to make the forensic judgment which he did in relation to the "" second carrot video"", the appellant has failed to demonstrate how he was disadvantaged by the longer "" carrot video"" not being tendered. 

The ""Car Cam video"" 

103Mr Webb referred to this document at p 14 of his affidavit of 14 June 2011 as follows - 

""Webb: 'What is the video about of you having a phone conversation, apparently with SB and a female? What is that doing in the material you have provided to Mr Roff?' 

Appellant: 'That relates to a conversation I had with SB.' 

Webb: 'Why was the conversation filmed in the car showing you to be talking on the phone - showing just you and the car?' 

Appellant: You'll be able to tender that, the video makes it look more realistic.' 

Webb: 'Do you mean that the video is just a device to make it look more realistic?' 

Appellant: 'That's right. It's better if people see as well as hear. It will make the conversation seem more realistic'. 

Webb: 'In what way is it a device?' 

Appellant: 'It's not in real time. The video is at one time and the talking is at another time. I prepared the video and the audio for my defence'."" 

104Counsel told the appellant that he would not use evidence which had been altered in that way since this was tantamount to misleading the Court. At pp 230-231 of the bundle of appellant's written instructions the appellant agreed that this evidence should not be used. The written instructions set out the danger associated with such a tender, ie it was consistent with the Crown case of a tendency on the appellant's part to fabricate and manipulate evidence. 

105Counsel's refusal to rely upon that evidence was forensically sound and the appellant has failed to show that he suffered any disadvantage by that video not being tendered. 

Alibi 

106The appellant initially instructed counsel in 2008 that he was not present at a number of the alleged crime scenes (counsel's preliminary advice, 5 August 2008 at appellant's submissions p 98). The appellant later instructed counsel that he did not have an alibi. In relation to that matter, Mr Webb said in his affidavit of 14 June 2011 - 

""9. I cannot recall whether it was in the conference of 21 August or 9 October at Chambers that I raised the issue of alibi with [the appellant]. This occurred in one of these two conferences. 

10. I said to [the appellant]: 'Mr C in relation to any of the matters that you are aware of is it the situation that you may have in fact been somewhere else, other than the place where the alleged conduct is said to have occurred?' Mr C said: 'Not really. All of the allegations basically relate to the area in which I lived and many of the allegations relate to things said to have happened in my own home'. I said: 'You need to think clearly about this issue because if you are going to raise any issue going to alibi Mr Roff needs to know well before any trial. An alibi means that you are saying that when something happened you were in fact somewhere else, positively identifying where it was that you were in terms of place and time. Mr Roff needs to provide notice to the Crown as to any issue of alibi. Alibi can't be raised on the run. It requires notice to the Crown so that the police can make enquiries. Do you understand that?' Mr C said: 'Yes but I don't have an alibi because I was living in the area where these things are said to have happened and many of them happened on the Crown case in the house that I was living at. So no I don't have an alibi for any of the matters that I am aware of.' 

11. The issue of alibi was raised by me in conference and not by [the appellant]."" 

As a result of those instructions, no alibi notice was ever served. The appellant was present in court when counsel told his Honour that he was not running alibi (AB1863, 1865-1866) and there is no record of any complaint made by him at the time. 

107The appellant submits, at appellant's submissions p 80, that the two matters where he would have relied upon alibi were in respect of counts 2 and 17. 

108Count 2 involved DM staying at the home of the appellant's mother in Rozelle. The appellant said that he stayed that particular night at his sister's house nearby. He said that SC, the friend of his son who had gone to Sydney with them, could corroborate this. 

109It was never alleged, nor was it the Crown case, that the appellant had stayed the night at his mother's home. The evidence of DM (AB688-689, 764) was that he awoke just as he was ejaculating to find the appellant giving him oral sex. The appellant then left the room. In cross-examination, DM said "" He may well have left after that happened, but what I said was true, that's a fact. That's what happened he was there and that was him"". No statement was ever obtained from SC, nor was he subpoenaed or required to be called in the Crown case by the defence. 

110Count 17 involved DB being sexually assaulted in the appellant's car. DB's evidence (AB1293-1299) was that the offence occurred after they had left JR with JR's stepfather. The appellant said that JR would be able to give evidence that DB had stayed that night with him and his stepfather and that the offence could not have occurred. 

111Police obtained a statement from JR on 5 May 2009, in which he said that the appellant had already seen him and had obtained an affidavit from him. Both the police statement and the affidavit obtained by the appellant are annexures to the affidavit of Ms Boulous sworn on 29 September 2011. The statement made by JR to the police and that obtained by the appellant are quite inconsistent on this issue. The statement made by JR to the police does not exclude the offence in count 17. 

112The police served on the defence a copy of the statement made by JR and also a copy of the affidavit which the appellant had obtained from him. The witness was made available, but was not required to be called by defence counsel. 

113Mr Webb referred to those matters in his affidavit of 4 October 2011 as follows - 

""5. On the issue of alibi, [the appellant] gave specific instructions prior to the trial that he did not have an alibi available to him of which he was aware. In respect of count 2, at [the appellant's] mother's place at Rozelle, [SC] did not in my view raise alibi. [SC] was present at the house overnight, with the question at trial being whether or not [the appellant] returned to the house during the night (as [the appellant] instructed me that he was staying at his sister's house nearby, and returned the following morning bringing croissants for breakfast). 

6. [JR] was made available by the learned Crown prosecutor at trial and was available to be called at the defence request. [the appellant] was advised of this matter during the course of the trial. I expressed a concern in the context of the trial raising public justice counts, that [JR] had previously been approached by [the appellant] to provide a statement. I raised with [the appellant] the issue that this matter might be dangerous. [the appellant] then indicated that he did not require [JR] to be called. Otherwise [JR] had initially been raised by [the appellant] as a prospective witness on the issue of character, not alibi."" 

Mr Webb was not cross-examined as to alibi by the appellant in the appeal. 

114The advice which counsel provided to the appellant in relation to JR was forensically sound. Any evidence from SC would not have provided an alibi. The appellant has failed to establish that he had an alibi defence available and that his case at trial was damaged by counsel's failure to raise that issue. 

115This sub-ground of appeal has not been made out. 

(c) Failure to call upon Crown witnesses for cross-examination 

116No submissions were made by the appellant specifically directed to this ground of appeal. In any event, the ground of appeal is not made out. Where appropriate, the Crown witnesses were vigorously cross-examined. Consistently with his evidence, however, counsel was careful to avoid referring to the TR2 proceedings and the Port Macquarie proceedings in that cross-examination. 

(d) Failure to call upon defence witnesses to give evidence 

117The appellant's complaints in this regard have already been dealt with in respect of the matters raised in sub-ground (b) above. 

118This sub-ground of appeal has not been made out. 

(e) Failure to defend the appellant with respect to the aspersion made by his Honour before the jury that the appellant may be a ""MIND READER"". 

119This is a reference to an observation made by his Honour in the course of the trial at AB1970. The appellant was being cross-examined. The context of his Honour's observation was - 

""CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. In the first sentence of that letter you say that SB has been living with you for twelve weeks? 
Appellant: A. Yes. 

Q. So it would be correct to say that he was living with you in April 2004 wouldn't it? 
A. Well I believe what I should have put is - no - if you read my letter, ""SB has now been in my care for some twelve weeks"". Probably I should have put approximately twelve weeks and I can give you the statement here that gives you the exact date SB came into my care, the day I took him to DOCS, you've got it in your files Miss. 

HIS HONOUR: No, no please Mr C. 

APPELLANT: Sorry. 

HIS HONOUR: Don't volunteer things that you say people have got because they may not have them - I don't know. 

APPELLANT: They served on you your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: No, you may be a mind reader for all I know but you can't keep on asserting that people have got things, right. Mr C. I am not going to ask you again. I'm going to have to cut you off because it's not an answer to the question. 

APPELLANT: Yes, sorry. 

HIS HONOUR: You're not answering the question, right. 

WITNESS: Okay. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q: I understand you agree that you wrote a letter to DOCS on 1 July 2004. 
A. Yes. 

Q. Saying that SB had been in your care for some twelve weeks? 
A. That's right, yes. 

HIS HONOUR: And by that you mean approximately twelve weeks? 
A. Yes. 

Q. In answer to the Crown, can he find a document that assists him to remember the date that SB came into his care, Madam Crown? 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well yes. 

HIS HONOUR: Right, without telling us what the document is, see if you can find the relevant document there in fairness to the earlier answer you gave."" (AB1969.33 - 1970.31) 

120During the appellant's evidence his Honour had warned him (for his own benefit) not to volunteer information that was not responsive and to listen carefully to each question (AB1885, 1922, 1924, 1925, 1951, 1958). The appellant did not heed those repeated warnings. The comment by his Honour at AB1970 was made against that background. Even following this comment by his Honour, the appellant continued to volunteer information (AB1978, 1979, 1983, 1998, 2009, 2010 and 2014). 

121The intervention of his Honour was designed to assist the appellant, not to belittle or demean him in the eyes of the jury. When using the expression ""mind reader"", his Honour was doing no more than attempting in a perhaps colourful way to direct the appellant that he should only answer the question which he was asked and not try to anticipate future questions. 

122Given the circumstances in which his Honour made this comment, there was no occasion for counsel to intervene. On the contrary, intervention by counsel may well have been counter-productive and have sent a message to the jury which was adverse to the appellant's interest. 

123This sub-ground of appeal has not been made out. 

(f) The failure to put exculpatory statements and/or documents before the Court and to the various Crown witnesses as outlined in the submissions. 

124This has already been dealt with in relation to the specific issues identified in sub-ground (b). The concern of counsel (and it was a legitimate concern) was that the production of too many exculpatory statements and videos would strengthen the inference that the appellant was able to control and manipulate young persons by getting them to sign statements which he had prepared and on most occasions witnessed. This would be particularly dangerous in relation to the public justice counts; it would also be dangerous in relation to the other counts as showing the appellant's influence over the young persons. 

125Counsel's decision to rely upon some exculpatory statements and not on others was forensically sound, and the appellant has failed to establish that the refusal by counsel to put all available exculpatory statements and videos before the Court damaged his case. 

126This sub-ground of appeal has not been made out 

(g) Failure to properly and/or adequately examine the appellant in chief and/or in re-examination to establish his innocence with regards to the state of the evidence. 

127It is clear from the affidavits of Mr Webb and Mr Roff that a comprehensive proof of evidence was prepared before the appellant gave his evidence and that discussions took place with the appellant in relation to that proof before he gave his evidence. Mr Roff in his affidavit of 14 June 2011 said - 

""34 On or about 11 June 2009 I received from Dr Webb a draft proof of instructions in relation to PFC. He said to me words to the effect of ""Have a look at this and see if it accords with your recollection of his instructions. We will go through it with [P] downstairs and see if he agrees"". I did not make any suggested amendments as it appeared to me to accord with the instructions provided by PFC. I do not recall any amendments or corrections subsequently being made by PFC. These instructions were the result of having reviewed the material provided by the prosecution and PFC, as well as having spoken with PFC in great detail over numerous occasions."" 

128The evidence in chief and in re-examination of the appellant is fully consistent with the case for the defence which was put to the complainants and the Crown witnesses in cross-examination. The presentation of this evidence was, however, marred by the appellant's tendency to give non-responsive replies to questions and to volunteer information. The reasons why no evidence was led concerning the TR2 proceedings and the Port Macquarie proceedings have already been given. 

129This sub-ground of appeal has not been made out. 

(h) Failure in general to defend the appellant to a professional standard having regard to all matters raised in these submissions, inter alia, no proof of evidence. 

130A proof of evidence was prepared and the structure of the evidence in chief led from the appellant is consistent with the existence of such a proof of evidence. At para 22 of his affidavit of 14 June 2011 Mr Webb set out the philosophy which underpinned the defence case and how he explained that to the appellant. He advised the appellant that he intended to run the defence case in the following way - 

Where the appellant had made exculpatory videos in respect of any of the complainants, counsel intended to rely on that video only as the best and most transparent record of his not engaging in sexual misconduct with that person. 

That he would not rely upon other evidence unless in the context of the trial and in his forensic judgment there would be a benefit to the appellant. Counsel explained that there was a limit that a jury would reach in terms of absorbing all of the statements and documents which the appellant had prepared and that at some point the number of videos and statements might look as though the appellant had something to hide. 

That he would not tender all of the material that the appellant wanted him to nor would he ask questions in cross-examination that he did not think would advance the appellant's case. 

131The course adopted by counsel in this respect was forensically sound. It reflected the fact that the public justice counts were intricately bound up with the sexual assault counts. It also reflected the position in which counsel was placed by the instructions, against his strong advice, that there should not be separate trials for each complainant; while the appellant apparently had in mind that dealing with all matters together would assist his contention that the complainants had conspired to bring false accusations against him, the danger in the course was very real and it required careful handling. Most of the material the appellant relied upon to suggest that he had been ""set up"" came from statements or videos taken by him from the complainants or other young persons. The more the appellant produced such statements, the greater was the risk that the jury would conclude that the appellant was able to control the complainants and other young persons by getting them to sign them. 

132Counsel was also rightly concerned about some of the material in the brief and other material which the appellant apparently had in his possession, but which he had not provided to counsel or Mr Roff. Some of that material would properly be regarded as child pornography. The approach to that material, which counsel correctly took, was that he would not tender it in the trial unless he was able to see some forensic advantage. One of the problems faced by counsel and the appellant was that even though the appellant claimed that some of the pornographic material was prepared by the complainants to ""set him up"", the only person who ever produced such material, either to the police or to the Court, was the appellant himself. This left the appellant open to the inference that he had created it. 

133In relation to the cross-examination of the complainants, it is apparent from the transcript that they were cross-examined at length as to the deficiencies in their evidence and the lack of immediate complaint. (We refer to this also at [366]-[367] below. Some of the complainants were giving evidence at trial twelve years after the events in question. Nevertheless, it is also apparent from the transcript that a number of the complainants found giving evidence about what had occurred quite traumatic. 

134A number of the complainants found it difficult to be accurate with the dates when various offences occurred. The trial judge directed the jury that this lack of particularity or any change in the dates on which the offences were said to have happened, was a matter which could be taken into account in assessing the credibility of the particular complainant. On the other hand, his Honour said that the jury was entitled to take into account that the offences occurred at a time when the complainants were very young and that there was no evidence that they were keeping a diary or had any reason to record precisely when these events occurred. 

135The judge directed the jury on the issue of delay and how it operated to disadvantage the appellant and also how it impacted on the credibility of the complainants. This was a strong direction and assisted the appellant. There was no occasion for counsel to ask his Honour to modify that direction in any way. Nevertheless, in each case the complainants gave reasons why they delayed in reporting the matter to the police. The acceptance or rejection of this evidence was a matter for the jury. It did not and could not reflect upon the competence of counsel in his representation of the appellant. 

136The cross-examination of the complainants demonstrates that counsel identified and relied upon inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainants with a view to challenging their credibility. In some cases he relied upon inconsistencies between the versions given by the complainants in evidence at the trial and on other occasions he relied upon the appellant's instructions as to alleged inconsistencies. It is apparent from the cross-examination of the complainants that they were fully tested on these issues. 

137This sub-ground of appeal has not been made out. 

The admission by counsel that he had failed in his duty to the appellant 

138The appellant submitted in his Ninth Supplementary Submissions (appellant's submissions p 905) that at the end of the trial counsel had admitted that he had failed in his duty to the appellant. There was a background to the exchange between the trial judge and counsel on which he relied. On more than one occasion in re-examination the appellant had stated in open court that he consented to showing his private parts to the jury. Despite the efforts of counsel to control him, the following occurred at AB2023 in the presence of the jury - 

""APPELLANT: Mr Webb, I consent to showing my private parts to the - 

WEBB: Sir is there anything else you wanted to say about that document? 
A. No about the other matter that we discussed. I'm quite happy to show my private parts to the jury - 

WEBB: Just a moment. 

WEBB: There's no further questions arising in re-examination. 

APPELLANT: Mr Webb, I've decided I'm quite happy to do that. I've put the embarrassment aside. And I'm quite happy to display it and I think that has to be done. 

WEBB: Would you just be quiet Mr C thank you. 

APPELLANT: Mr Webb I have to do that, that's my instructions."" 

139The appellant relied upon the subsequent part of the trial transcript - 

""HIS HONOUR: Mr C I'm going to give you an opportunity to speak to your barrister in a moment privately, not in open court and that's in fairness to you but Mr Webb is endeavouring to look after your interests and I just want to hear what he has to say. Yes Mr Webb? 

WEBB: In my submission in light of the way that it has emerged and the particularity of the utterance concerning I so instruct the wand waving aspect that that has without seeking to invest it with any form of humorous taint in my submission the situation it is sought to make medical investigations concerning this. Your Honour would bear in mind he is a man with five children off the bat but - 

HIS HONOUR: What, which is information he volunteered. 

WEBB: That's so and given the way that it has been raised and also some of the issues which arise in Regina v Takeo and any sense the jury might have that there's not a united and faithful approach in terms of the legal advisers of the client in my submission application is made to immediately inquire of the appropriate medical practitioners who may be able to shed some light on this issue. 

HIS HONOUR: That's why I'm raising it because it is quite clear that if I can use a colloquialism both in the context of what was not said by your client in cross-examination and the further information he provided in re-examination, that your client has I don't mean this critically of him, but a ""bee in his bonnet"" about a particular aspect of the matter and I can't ignore it as much as I can't ignore an elephant sitting in the room. So as much as someone or anyone would wish it to go away or not go away, the truth of the matter it has been raised with the jury and that's a matter that needs to be addressed. Can I ask this question of you and if you decline to answer it I would fully understand but are you in a position to tell me what the character of the issue is? 

WEBB: Yes your Honour, as I apprehend the position, Mr C indicates that he at times material to the allegations, particularly the anal/penile allegations he was impotent or unable to sustain a erection by reason of some medical aspect, the onset of which occurred ex post facto to the five children."" (AB2027-2028) (emphasis added) 

140In subsequent discussions between counsel, his Honour and the prosecution it was agreed that the appropriate way to establish any suggestion of impotency was by reference to medical evidence, not by reference to the assertions of the appellant. After seeking instructions, counsel advised the Court as follows - 

""WEBB: A decision has been made not to pursue the matter any further, to leave it as it presently stands and accordingly I'm in a position to close the defence case."" (AB2037) 

141The issue raised by the appellant at the conclusion of re-examination had been the subject of advice and specific instructions (Mr Webb's affidavit of 14 June 2011, pp 24-26, 50-51). The outburst by the appellant clearly came as a complete surprise to counsel. 

142The appellant relied on the matter we have emphasised in the passage last set out as an admission of failure in duty. In the full context, the statement by counsel is not an admission that he failed to do his duty by his client. What counsel was concerned about was an impression that the jury may have formed because of the conduct of the appellant, that there was some division of opinion between the appellant and counsel. The exchange between counsel and the trial judge could not in any way be regarded as an admission by counsel that he had not properly looked after the interests of the appellant. 

143The written instructions disclosed that the appellant provided counsel with frequent and detailed instructions throughout the course of the trial, setting out not only matters that he wanted addressed but also specific questions that he wanted asked of certain witnesses. Some of these instructions were cast in mandatory terms. These instructions were not binding on counsel. The appellant was aware that he could terminate counsel's retainer at any time but specifically chose to continue with his representation, notwithstanding the decisions made by counsel during the trial, many of which are now the subject of complaint by the appellant. 

144Counsel was entitled to exercise his discretion and to take whatever forensic or tactical decision he thought best in the circumstances. It is clear that in the light of the instructions not to seek separate trials, counsel faced a very difficult task. In the context of making appropriate forensic and tactical decisions in this case, counsel had to have regard to the risk associated with the possible disclosure of the appellant's prior convictions. Counsel also had to deal with the appellant's inability or unwillingness to understand the significant prejudice to his case had counsel followed all of his instructions. 

145Ground of appeal 1 has not been made out. 

Ground of Appeal 9 - Fresh and/or new evidence as outlined herein was never put before the Court which led to a miscarriage of justice, inter alia, counsel did not know the ""full carrot video"" existed and had never seen the ""Todd Ellis"" video. 

146It is convenient to deal with this ground of appeal in proximity to ground of appeal 1. 

147The appellant's submissions in relation to this ground of appeal are set out in Part B of his Eighth Supplementary Submissions (appellant's submissions p 900). The appellant submitted that all of the material he referred to in the submissions constituted ""fresh evidence"" on the basis that it was ""concealed"", not only by counsel but also by the police and by the Crown. The appellant submitted that because counsel had not seen the ""full carrot video"" or ""Todd Ellis video"" that the trial miscarried and the appeal should succeed on that basis. 

148A preliminary, but important issue is whether any of the material constitutes ""fresh evidence"". The principles on which fresh evidence may be admitted on a conviction appeal have been considered on a number of occasions: for example, R v Gallagher (1986) 160 CLR 392, Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259; R v Abu-Chabake [2004] 149 A Crim R 417 and GAR v R (No 1) [2010] NSWCCA 163 at [26]. 

149For evidence to be fresh, it must be evidence that was not available at the time of trial. It is not contended by the appellant that any of the material upon which he now seeks to rely was not in existence or was not within his knowledge, or not available, to be used at trial. The real complaint is that his counsel or the Crown did not adduce the evidence or chose not to rely upon it. 

150In Gallagher the following statement of principle by Rich and Dixon JJ in Craig v The King (1933) 49 CLR 429 at 439 was referred to with approval - 

""A Court of Criminal Appeal has thrown upon it some responsibility of examining the probative value of the fresh evidence. It cannot be said that that a miscarriage has occurred unless the fresh evidence has cogency and plausibility, as well as relevancy. The fresh evidence must, we think, be of such a character that, if considered in combination with the evidence already given upon the trial the result ought in the minds of reasonable men be affected. Such evidence should be calculated at least to remove the certainty of the prisoner's guilt which the former evidence produced. But in judging of the weight of the fresh testimony the probative force and the nature of the evidence already adduced at the trial must be a matter of great importance."" 

151In Mickelberg the test was expressed at 310 as - 

""There is no very precise formulation of the quality which must attach to fresh evidence before it will ground for a successful appeal. It has been said that it must be ""credible"", ""cogent"", ""relevant"", ""plausible"": See, e.g. Gallagher ; Craig v The King ; Ratten ; Lawless. In essence, the fresh evidence must be such that when viewed in combination with the evidence given at trial, it can be said that the jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused if all the evidence had been before it ( Gallagher , per Brennan J). Or, if there be a practical difference, that there is ""a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the [accused]"". ( Gallagher , per Gibbs CJ and per Mason and Deane JJ)."" (footnotes omitted) 

152In accordance with earlier directions in this Court, the appellant gave notice that he wished to tender the following items as ""fresh evidence"" on the appeal. In relation to each item of evidence in the absence of full compliance with the earlier directions, he was directed by the Court (T40, 24 October 2011) to indicate what it showed and what should have been done with it by counsel at trial. The ""fresh evidence"" was - 

(i) A video of SB masturbating on the chair in front of a computer. 

(ii) A CD containing photographic images (which could be characterised as child pornography) which was labelled ""Copy of [S's] fake pictures behind TV"" and ""[S's] music"". 

(iii) A CD entitled ""Car Cam phone calls"". 

(iv) A video entitled ""Dean - Tim"". 

(v) A full version of the ""carrot video"". 

(vi) Two floppy disks and a CD copy containing photographic images (which could be characterised as child pornography) which were labelled ""set up [P] 1998"". 

(vii) A video described as the ""Todd Ellis video"". 

153Leaving aside that this evidence was not ""fresh"", there are other reasons why the tender of this evidence should be rejected. 

154In relation to item (i), the appellant sought to answer the questions posed to him by the Court by saying - 

""Counsel should have put it before the Court because it went to the motive why SB was setting me up, or one of the motives why SB was setting me up"". (T41, 24 October 2011) 

This was not a response in accordance with the direction of the Court. Moreover, the first five minutes of this video was shown to Mr Webb in cross-examination and he denied that he had ever seen it before. 

155Since this video was not shown to Mr Webb before or during the trial, it is not open to the appellant to now argue that a copy of the video should have been used in the trial. In any event, from the limited description provided of its contents, and from the brief part of it which was viewed by the Court, the video did not in any way satisfy the tests set out in Gallagher and Mickelberg. 

156In relation to item (ii), in answer to the questions posed by the Court the appellant said - 

""Counsel should have put to SB that he'd made the first disc or both discs were made by him, the CD2, Copy of [S's] Fake Pictures Behind TV, was specifically made to set me up and SB refers to this in his retraction statement of 6 December 2006."" (T41, 42, 24 October .2011) 

157The appellant's response did not answer either of the questions put by the Court and did not provide a basis for the tender of that item. There was the added difficulty that SB had refused to acknowledge that he had signed the statement of 6 December 2006. Accordingly, the Gallagher and Mickelberg tests are not satisfied and the tender should be rejected. 

158In relation to item (iii), the appellant said - 

""Well SB's evidence was that he rang from Casino telling me I couldn't use the videos in evidence, where S's telephone conversations from Casino are that he's trying to borrow money off me and he gives the account details, so clearly this went to the credibility of SB and to Ms Crystal Egan, that they both lied about that phone call. (T42, 24 October.2011) 

159The background to this item is set out above. It was faked, and for the reasons earlier set out it is clear that counsel's decision not to rely upon the item was forensically sound. Moreover, the probative value of the item was marginal at best and would have had no effect on the outcome of the trial. 

160In relation to item (iv), the Appellant said - 

""This was one of the most important parts because it relates to DB and an interview I did with him in 2001 where he states that he has been approached by the first complainant, [TR], to set me up and that was my whole case that I'd been set up from the beginning and DB had - that video had to be put to DB as well as [TR]. That's why [TR] had to be called."" (T42, 24 October 2011). 

161We have earlier referred to the Dean-Tim video. As there described, the potential prejudicial effect of that item, had it been used at the trial, far outweighed any benefit which it might have gained for the Appellant. Counsel's refusal to tender the video was forensically sound. It can not be said that it would have been likely to cause the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt about the appellant's guilt, quite the reverse, or that it satisfies any other test for reception as fresh evidence. 

162In relation to item (v), the appellant said - 

""Okay, now as referred to in the mandatory questions and in SB's statement that I took from him at Manning River, 3 December 2004, S refers to these three videos and that the short one that was tendered in evidence was made to set me up and that it was a video by his brother, D. So clearly these questions had to be put to SB, as well as DB, that D had made that video. 

GILES JA: Made the short one as - 

APPELLANT: As well as the long one. DB made the whole carrot video. 

GILES JA: Well just on that one, what's the point of the full version rather than the short version? 

APPELLANT: Because SB refers, gives details in this 3 December 2004 statement which is also on video. That statement was taken on video where he explains how the video was made. 

GILES JA: Let me be a little more specific because we do need to understand this. 

APPELLANT: Yes. 

GILES JA: What would the full version show which would assist your case which the short version would not show? 

APPELLANT: That DB had made the video and that the words on the video were not at the end of the video as S's evidence - S states in his evidence, that at the end of the tape 'Mr C told me to say these words' where it is not at the end of the tape - it's about a third of the way in I believe. So it proves that it's not there. S is relying on just a small piece of the tape which is the set up tape saying 'hey, Mr C told me to say this at the end', and it's not at the end it's about a third of the way in."" (T42-43, 24 October 2011) 

163We have earlier related the difficulties associated with the ""carrot video"". The explanation by the appellant to the Court as to why the second or full ""carrot video"" should have been tendered at trial does not address the difficulties there identified. This is particularly so when count 14 was specifically based on the appellant's possession of Exhibit D, the ""carrot video"" which was tendered at trial. The tender of an even longer and probably more explicit ""carrot video"" would have done nothing to advance the appellant's case. It appears that the appellant eventually saw the point of its tender on appeal as showing that SB was incorrect in saying that he had been told by the appellant to refer to the appellant coming at the end, because that was not said at the end but part way through. We do not regard that as satisfying the requirements for admission of fresh evidence. 

164In relation to item (vi), the appellant said - 

""Yes. Okay, now in 1998 after I'd reported [CB] to the police for the serious assault and after I'd caught DM on a security video, hidden video, masturbating at the computer they made these fake pictures to set me up in 1998 and that was the White Bridge High photographs that I tendered before Judge Norrish on 16 July and that is why my instructions to Mr Webb put the pictures and put the White Bridge High photos into evidence so that they can freely see that I'd been set up because DM denies the pictures were made and [CB] says they were. 

So that is basically those White Bridge High photos had to go in to see that - to show that hey, DM says these were never made, they're not real, and [CB] says they are real. But they're not, they're fake photos that [CB] had made up with DM to set me up in 1998."" (T43.33, 24.10.2011) 

165While the appellant's explanation provides no basis for the tender of this item, some information as to its content can be found elsewhere in the appeal papers. Items were produced by the appellant at his bail application following the trial, and the Crown arranged for the contents of the floppy disks to be transferred to a DVD (AB2292-2298). The transcript of the bail application reveals that many of the images on these floppy disks were identical to those on other CDs produced by the appellant. Although the appellant claimed that the images on these disks were made by CB and DM in 1998 in order to set him up, he conceded in his evidence on the bail application that neither CB nor DM had ever produced these disks or photographs to anyone (AB2297). The source of these disks appears to have been the appellant. From what was said on the bail application, there appears to be nothing on the disks to support the appellant's assertion that they were made by CB or DM, or that they were made with the intention of setting him up. No basis has been established by the appellant for the tender of this item. 

166Item (vii) was the Todd Ellis video. We have earlier referred to it. The Court rejected its tender on the first day of the appeal (T55 - 56, 14 October 2011). 

167The appellant has not established any basis for the admissibility of items (i) - (vii). None of those items could be regarded as ""fresh evidence"". Even if that problem could be overcome, none of the items go close to satisfying the Gallagher and Mickelberg tests in that none of those items, either individually or together, taken in combination with the evidence given at trial, would have been likely to cause the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant. Two of the items were not provided to counsel or his instructing solicitors and so they cannot be criticised for not tendering them at trial. In relation to all of the items, either individually or in combination, there were or would have been sound forensic reasons for them not being tendered. 

168The tender of this evidence on the appeal is rejected. This ground of appeal is not made out. 

Ground of Appeal 2(a) and (c): A miscarriage of justice was caused by the Crown; 
a. failing to call upon Crown Witnesses to give evidence 
... 
c. breached its duty of disclosure in concealing exculpatory evidence from the Court 

169The appellant's submissions appeared to run the two matters together: the breach of the duty of disclosure was the failure to call witnesses in the Crown case. Before examining the particular submissions made in relation to the claimed miscarriage of justice, it is necessary to set out relevant principles determining a Crown Prosecutor's responsibility. 

170In Richardson v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 116 at 119, the Court (Barwick CJ, McTiernan and Mason JJ), addressed the question of the calling of witnesses and, in particular, both the role and the responsibility of a prosecutor as well as the powers of a trial judge in that respect. Their Honours there stated - 

""Any discussion of the role of the Crown Prosecutor in presenting the Crown case must begin with the fundamental proposition that it is for him to determine what witnesses will be called for the prosecution. He has the responsibility of ensuring that the Crown case is properly presented and, in the course of discharging that responsibility, it is for him to decide what evidence, in particular what oral testimony, will be adduced. He also has the responsibility of ensuring that the Crown case is presented with fairness to the accused. In making his decision as to the witnesses who will be called, he may be required in a particular case to take into account many factors, for example, whether the evidence of a particular witness is essential to the unfolding of the Crown case, whether the evidence is credible and truthful, whether in the interests of justice it should be subject to cross-examination by the Crown, to mention but a few. 

What is important is that it is for the prosecutor to decide in the particular case what are the relevant factors and, in light of those factors, to identify the course which will ensure a proper presentation of the Crown case conformably with the dictates of fairness to the accused. It is in this sense that it has been said that the prosecutor has a discretion as to what witnesses will be called for the prosecution. But to say this is not to give the prosecutor's decision the same character as the exercise of a judicial discretion or the exercise of a discretionary power or to make his decision reviewable in the same manner as those discretions are reviewable. In the context, the word 'discretion' signifies no more than that the prosecutor is called upon to make a personal judgment, bearing in mind the responsibilities which we have already mentioned."" 

171In R v Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 563 at 575 the Court (Gibbs CJ, Mason, Murphy, Wilson and Dawson JJ) set out some general propositions concerning the conduct of criminal trials in Australia. Included amongst the six propositions were - 

· The Crown Prosecutor alone bears the responsibility of deciding whether a person will be called as a witness for the Crown. 

· When charging the jury, the trial judge may make such comment as the judge then thinks to be appropriate with respect to the effect which the failure of the prosecutor to call a particular person as a witness would appear to have had on the course of the trial. 

· A decision of the prosecutor not to call a particular person as a witness will only constitute a ground for setting aside a conviction if, when viewed against the conduct of the trial taken as a whole, it is seen to give rise to a miscarriage of justice. 

172In considering these aspects of ground of appeal 2, the following factors may be material - 

(1) Whether the evidence of a particular witness was essential to the unfolding of the Crown case. 

(2) Whether the evidence of the witness was otherwise appropriately called in the Crown case; 

(3) Whether the evidence of the witness would be regarded as credible and truthful. 

(4) Whether in the interests of justice the witness should be subject to cross-examination by the Crown. 

(5) Whether the evidence should be called consistently with the dictates of fairness to the accused. 

173In the light of all the relevant factors, and in the context of this case, the appellant has the onus of establishing that there was an obligation upon the Crown to call the witnesses in question. To this end, the appellant must identify the relevant factors and then establish, consistently with the above principles, a failure by the Crown Prosecutor to discharge her responsibility in deciding what witnesses were to be called at trial. 

174We do not consider that the submissions made by the appellant as to the claimed failure to call particular witnesses have shown a failure involving any breach of the responsibility of the Crown Prosecutor. 

175The appellant contended that the Crown Prosecutor failed to call nine witnesses identified in his submissions. 

176TR, BH, DM, TH and JH were all listed in the Crown's tendency and coincidence notice but were not complainants in the proceedings at trial. The trial judge refused the Crown's application to call the tendency evidence, and the five witnesses were consequentially not called in the Crown case. 

177As to the remaining witnesses of which the appellant complains, witness statements of each were taken by police and the statements in the possession of the Crown were served on the defence. The Crown formed the view that those remaining witnesses would be of limited, if any, relevance. Importantly, as the Crown put in submissions, there was never any suggestion by the defence to the contrary (and no alibi notice was served for the purposes of the trial). 

178During the trial the Crown provided a typed list of witnesses which it intended to call. The list was updated and was provided to the defence. No request was ever made by the defence to call or make available a witness that the Crown had indicated it was not proposing to call. 

179Defence counsel had attended at the Crown Prosecutor's chambers where there was an inspection of relevant documents to ensure that all that was in the possession of the Crown was available to the defence. 

180The appellant's contention that the Crown failed in its duty in not calling the witnesses is mere assertion, there being no attempt in the written or oral submissions to develop a proper basis for establishing any particular breach of responsibility by the Crown Prosecutor in the decision not to call witnesses. There is no substance in the allegation that the Crown concealed evidence or breached its duty of disclosure. 

181These sub-grounds of appeal have not been established. 

Ground of Appeal 2(d): A miscarriage of justice was caused by the Crown; 

d. misstating the true state of the evidence during the trial and in Her summing-up to the jury 

182The appellant's Second Further Amended Submissions (appellant's submissions pp 35 - 40) contained a number of references to the transcript to support this ground. However, it is relevant that the trial judge's directions to the jury included (AB113) - 

""Of course, the submissions themselves are not evidence in the case. Sometimes counsel have specifically referred to a particular piece of evidence or used evidence as an illustration of a particular point, but ultimately the submissions are precisely that and what weight you give them depends upon your view of the evidence."" 

183We have examined each of the complaints concerning statements made by the Crown Prosecutor, and do not consider it necessary to set out the detail raised by the appellant and responded to by the Crown. Subject to what follows, there is nothing worthy of discussion. Save possibly for one matter, it is sufficient to say that we do not consider that matters raised by way of complaint could, in any way, have had any material effect on the course of the trial or the jury's deliberations. The closing address by the Crown Prosecutor, in particular, was subject to the trial judge's summing-up, and in relation to the particular matters of complaint there is no suggestion that the trial judge's summing-up relevantly erred or misstated the position. In other words, the summing-up by the trial judge can be accepted in relation to those particular matters as having accurately stated the facts. The jury were aware of the nature and function of closing submissions and were instructed that they were to listen to and comply with the trial judge's summing-up. 

184One complaint was to the effect that the Crown Prosecutor should not have referred to the appellant's son B and SC so many times in her address, because this may have left the jury to infer or ponder why they did not give evidence. The Crown submitted that the only references by the Crown Prosecutor to either of those persons in her closing address were, "" peripheral ones "" , and reflected the evidence during the trial when they were mentioned (see AB2064, 2093, 2098, 2099) and were not contentious. In our view that is correct, and nothing was said which would have caused the jury to infer or ponder why those persons did not give evidence. The Crown correctly pointed out that defence counsel in his closing address and the trial judge in his summing-up also made reference to the two persons referred to above where relevant to the unfolding of events. 

185The one matter which may be in a somewhat different category is a mistaken reference by the Crown Prosecutor where she said ""there's the letter from DOCs saying it was 12 weeks before 1 July"". It was acknowledged by the Crown that the Crown Prosecutor should have said ""there's the letter to DOCs saying it was 12 weeks before 1 July"". The only reason it may be in a different category is that on the appellant's evidence the letter was material to when SB came to stay with him. However, any materiality was the date of the letter, 12 July 2004, not whether it was to or from DOCS. Further, two days prior to the Crown's closing address the letter was the subject of cross-examination, and it would have been clear to the jury that the letter was one that had been written by the appellant to DOCS. There is no suggestion that the trial judge made any such error in the course of his summing-up. We do not think that the error was of any significance in the overall context of the trial. 

Ground of Appeal 2(b) and (e): A miscarriage of justice was caused by the Crown; 

b. becoming emotionally involved in the trial 
... 
e. caused unfair prejudice to the accused in cross-examination by casting aspersions against his character in that he had lied to the court when in fact the appellant had told the truth and the Crown had evidence to support this. 

186No particular submissions addressed sub-ground (b) beyond those apparently directed to sub-ground (e). The submissions appeared to be those in which it was said that the Crown Prosecutor cast aspersions against the appellant's character ""in that he lied to the court when in fact he told the truth and the Crown had evidence to support this"" (appellant's submissions p 31). Reference was made to a passage in the transcript of the appellant's cross-examination (AB1912 sqq) of which the central part is - 

""Q. Are you seriously suggesting that these young boys when they were children would have download child pornography? 
A. Madam Crown they would - 

Q. No, listen to my question. Are you seriously suggesting that? 
A. SB and DB have already admitted that. 

Q. Mr C that is an absolute lie."" 

187The trial judge rebuked the Crown Prosecutor, who withdrew what she had said; his Honour said that she and counsel for the appellant ""are not here to make comments"". (It may be noted that in later cross-examination SB's evidence was put to the appellant; SB had only admitted to downloading images of ""sheilas ... over the age of 18"" (AB2033-2066).) 

188We do not think that this incident, in the course of a lengthy trial, has any significance in relation to a miscarriage of justice. From our further reading of the transcript, we see nothing to indicate that the Crown Prosecutor was diverted from her proper role by an emotional involvement in the trial. The Crown Prosecutor was entitled, if not obliged, to cross-examine the appellant in accordance with the Crown case, if necessary by expressly putting (rather than commenting) that he had lied. 

189These sub-grounds have not been established. 

Ground of Appeal 3: The learned trial judge erred and/or misled the jury as to the true state of the evidence in his Honour's summing-up, this led to a miscarriage of justice 

190The appellant made a considerable number of complaints in support of Ground of Appeal 3. As the Crown observed, Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies to each of these complaints. We will return to Rule 4 below. 

191The appellant's individual complaints are identified in the Second Further Amended Submissions in paras (a) to (v) (appellant's submissions pp 48-54). We address each in turn. 

(a) An allegedly ambiguous statement which would have led to confusion on the part of some, if not all, jurors as to the state of the evidence concerning the complainants 

192The particular statement in the summing-up was the trial judge's statement that ""... there is one complainant giving evidence of matters denied by the accused"". 

193When this statement is read in context, no ambiguity or confusion can possibly arise. In the more full passage (AB122) the trial judge referred to the fact that, in relation to each count ""... the case depends very much on a direct conflict between the evidence of the accused and the complainant"". His Honour referred to particular exhibits, and then said - 

""In terms of establishing the guilt of the accused as having done certain things such as to constitute a particular crime, there is one complainant giving evidence of matters denied by the accused. Thus we have what I have said is this direct conflict."" 

194In context, the trial judge's statement emphasised the importance of the jury determining, in each case, whether they accepted the complainant over the appellant or the appellant over the complainant. No ambiguity arises. There is no likely confusion as alleged. 

(b) That the trial judge ""transferred the burden of proof from the Crown to the appellant"" 

195The transcript reads (AB123) ""... but that does not relieve you of resolving the issue of whether the accused (?) has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt"". The particular passage in which this appears ends with the need to consider ""whether the prosecution has proved it's case to the requisite standard"". 

196There was either a typographical error or a slip by his Honour. It is clear in context that the word "" accused"" was incorrect. However, there could have been no possible doubt in light of the passage as a whole and the preceding comprehensive directions given as to the onus of proof (AB120 sqq). The jury would have clearly understood that the burden of proof lay with the Crown. 

197There is no substance to this complaint. 

(c) Propensity and tendency direction 

198The appellant's complaint is not easy to understand. The trial judge directed (AB124) the jury against using propensity or tendency reasoning, as was both appropriate and favourable to the appellant. The appellant complained that the direction ""led the jury to believe that [he sexually assaulted young males and perverted the course of justice] when one considers the fact that the judge is misstating the evidence in the trial see below"". 

199There was no error in the direction. There is no substance to this complaint. 

(d) The age of SB at the time of the offence 

200The offence the subject of count 12 was alleged to have been committed in the latter part of 2003 when SB was living with the appellant; the living with the appellant was the basis for the element in the count that SB was under the appellant's authority. The appellant contended that SB came to live with him in May 2004. As best we understand it, the complaint was that the trial judge did not direct the jury that SB could not have come to live with him when 12 years old and in year 9, as he had said in his evidence in chief, and so the offence (which the appellant denied) could not have been committed in 2003 when SB was living with him. 

201The offences under counts 12 and 13 contained as an element sexual intercourse with someone under 16 years but, as the Crown Prosecutor emphasised in her closing address, the circumstance of aggravation in relation to those two counts was that SB was under authority at the time. A person in authority who breaches the trust relationship aggravates the offence. SB initially had said he thought the offence the subject of count 12 was in October 2004 but in evidence said that he thought he was 12 years old and in year 9. SB's father gave evidence that SB initially moved in with the appellant in August 2003 for a short period, then moved back home, and then moved back in with the appellant in 2004. The Crown submission was that SB's initial reference to October 2004 should be taken as having been an intended reference to October 2003. 

202No misdirection was identified, and it was for the jury to be satisfied as to the facts. We do not consider there is any substance in the complaint. 

(e) Typographical error re evidence by the accused 

203The appellant complained of a mistake in the summing-up which he said was likely to have affected the jury. In the transcript the trial judge is recorded as saying, ""The choice by the accused not to give evidence does not mean that the evidence he gave was necessarily true"" (emphasis added). 

204The first ""not"" was obviously either said in error or a typing mistake. The full passage (AB180-181) was a careful and appropriate direction concerning the appellant having given evidence but the burden of proof remaining on the Crown. The jury saw and heard the appellant give evidence and would have understood the ""not"", if it was said, as a slip. 

205There is no substance in this complaint. 

(f) Evidence by DM 

206The trial judge said, according to the transcript (AB181), ""Now in respect of the allegation of DM, the accused first gave evidence about exhibit B"". The appellant said that this was wrong, and that it was DM who first gave evidence about the exhibit. He further said that the transcripts of Exhibit B were incorrect. 

207When what the trial judge said is read in context, his Honour was dealing with the appellant's evidence. There was no error, certainly not one which would have misled the jury. It was not established that the transcripts were wrong, and they were tendered and admitted without objection (AB1879-1880). The jury had the video recording, and were told that the transcripts were simply an aid and may not be entirely accurate. 

208We do not consider that this complaint is of any substance. 

(g) Support for CB's evidence 

209The statement complained of was, ""You will note in relation to CB's evidence that his allegations were not supported by any other independent evidence ..."" (AB190). The appellant said that the trial judge was mistaken, because DM gave evidence to support CB's allegation that the appellant had stayed at a Mayfield motel. He further said that the Crown concealed evidence that the appellant had never stayed at the motel with CB or DM. (Some inconsistency may be seen in these complaints.) 

210As the Crown pointed out in relation to CB's evidence, the statement in question was immediately followed by, ""You will bear in mind in relation to his evidence his account of what happened at Mayfield, although it is not the subject of a particular charge, it is not materially supported by DM so far as he alleges an impropriety by the accused against him in the bed whilst DM was in the room"". The statement complained of was not as to staying at the motel, but as to what occurred there. We do not believe this complaint raises a matter of any substance that could have affected the jury's consideration. Further, there is no evidence that the Crown concealed evidence that the appellant did not stay at the motel. From the affidavit of Ms Boulous sworn on 29 September 2011, the material in its possession was disclosed. 

211Again, there is no substance in the complaint. 

(h) A misstatement in the evidence 

212In the course of the summing-up the trial judge referred (AB171) to - 

""... the accused having C4 and blowing up a car with people inside, and those sort of things, and taking $100,000 to a funeral parlour ..."" 

There was a subsequent reference to $100,000 (AB195). The appellant complained that the judge misstated the evidence by stating an amount of $100,000 instead of $10,000 when referring to evidence of CC of what DB had told him about the appellant. 

213The evidence of CC in this respect was peripheral, and for such relevance as it had an error in referring to $100,000 rather than $10,000 was not material. We do not think the jury can have been materially misled, or that there was any risk that they would have misused the reference to $100,000 in lieu of $10,000. 

(i) No evidence to support summing-up statement concerning Exhibit D 

214Under this sub-ground, the appellant contends that there was no evidence to support what the trial judge said in the summing-up (AB210) - 

""In relation to Exhibit D, he made no mention, when he was shown that video in May 2007, of his reasons for saying on the video, '[DB, P's] coming home' or words to that effect. He made no reference in that statement to P telling him to say those words and it was suggested to him that this account that he gave in the trial was a recent invention on his part. In his statement to police he claimed that he told Uncle Don about the making of the video, Exhibit D, and how it was made and what happened."" 

215The appellant says that SB stated that he had never seen the ""carrot video"" and did not want to see it; and further, that there was no police statement in evidence at the trial. 

216The trial judge had referred to count 14 and an alternative count, and to the circumstances in which SB claimed that Exhibit D was made (AB203). His Honour was summarising the cross-examination of SB by defence counsel. The evidence of SB as to whether he had seen Exhibit D, or where he had seen it or how much of it he had seen, was to an extent unclear. However, there was no dispute that SB claimed to have had a recollection of what he said on the video. The police statement of SB concerning Exhibit D was not tendered in evidence, but defence counsel specifically cross-examined SB about what he said in that statement (AB1153-1156). 

217The appellant's submission was to the effect that the trial judge misled the jury in what he said about Exhibit D and SB. That is not correct. There is no merit to this sub-ground of appeal. 

(j) The evidence of Sergeant Rumbel 

218The relevant passage appears at AB217, in the following terms - 

""And finally Sergeant Rumbel gave short evidence of attending upon a motor accident in Maitland on 6 July 2005 when a motor vehicle had collided with a power pole and he had taken a statement of [the appellant] and SB. He later took a second statement of SB at Raymond Terrace."" 

219The appellant contended that Sergeant Rumbel took a statement from him and Sergeant Rumbel's partner took a statement from SB, and that Sergeant Rumbel did not take a second statement of SB. 

220The evidence was that Sergeant Rumbel attended the accident with Constable Newton; he took a statement from the appellant and Constable Newton took a statement from SB; and Sergeant Rumbel at a later time became aware that SB had made a second statement at Raymond Terrace but had not seen that statement (AB1769-1770). 

221There was a discrepancy in the trial judge's reference to the evidence, but it was of no materiality and could not possibly constitute or contribute to a miscarriage of justice. 

(k) A mistaken reference to the appellant instead of DB 

222The passage in the summing-up on which the appellant relied was concerned with the evidence of DB. His Honour said (AB221) - 

""Now that does not mean to say that the evidence that he gives in this court is truthful under the protection of that certificate. But you should bear in mind that the accused has been given a certificate in respect of the evidence he gives about what happened at Taree and what happened at Port Macquarie and the purpose of that certificate is to ensure that he is not prosecuted for perjury or some other offence relating to what he claims to be now the false evidence he gave at the District Court and the Local Court, as that evidence relates respectively to count 22 and count 21."" (emphasis added) 

223The reference to ""the accused"" was incorrect; it should have been to DB. The appellant submitted that the trial judge ""discredited the appellant and seriously caused (a) gross miscarriage of justice"", that his Honour ""transferred [the] immunity from prosecutions certificate to the appellant"", and that in doing so his Honour created in the mind of the jury that he had sought or had been given a ""certificate from prosecution"". That had in fact never been the case. 

224The trial judge commenced his discussion of the evidence of DB at AB220. His Honour told the jury that they would have to assess DB's evidence very carefully. He then addressed the evidence given by DB in relation to counts 21 and 22. In the paragraph preceding the paragraph on which the appellant relied the trial judge stated - 

""I should tell you that in respect of the evidence he has given about falsehoods given at Taree and Port Macquarie courts I gave him in your absence a certificate under the Evidence Act. That certificate is a protection against him for being prosecuted for perjury or giving false evidence on previous occasions ... "". 

225When the passage in question is seen in context, it is clear the jury would have understood that the trial judge meant to refer to DB and that the protection given by the certificate operated in favour of DB and not the appellant. There had been no prior discussion or suggestion that such a certificate had ever been issued to the appellant. What was under discussion was the evidence of DB, and the mistaken reference to the appellant would have been understood in that context. 

226There is no basis for a miscarriage of justice by reason of the trial judge's incorrect reference to the appellant. 

(l) Reference to SB in the appellant's care in 2006 

227The complaint was as to a reference in the summing-up to documents that had been obtained from the Department of Community Services ""showing that the complainant was in [the appellant's] care in 2006"". The complainant was SB. The appellant said that the trial judge was mistaken, because SB was not in his care in 2006. 

228The trial judge was referring to Detective Hatchwell's evidence, and his Honour said that the evidence was, inter alia, that he had obtained some documents from the Department of Community Services showing that the complainant was in the appellant's care in 2006 (AB222). This was incorrect. However, shortly afterwards the Crown Prosecutor reminded the trial judge, in the presence of the jury, that the documents disclosed that the correct year was 2004 and not 2006 (AB 224). His Honour confirmed to the jury that he had meant the year 2004. There is no substance to this sub-ground of appeal. 

(m) Evidence of CB 

229The appellant's complaint appears to relate to the evidence of CB rather than what was said in the summing-up. The trial judge referred to evidence of CB to the effect that he was given a copy of his statement a week before the trial. The appellant's point appears to be that this was incorrect, and further that evidence was available but not tendered (part of a transcript of the Port Macquarie proceedings) showing that CB had read his police statements at that time (December 2006). 

230CB gave evidence (AB864) that he had been given a copy of his statement in 2006 and had a copy available whilst he was in custody. He was later given a copy when he came to court, that being the occasion to which the trial judge referred. It was not his evidence that he had not been shown his police statements until a week before the trial. There is no substance in this complaint. 

(n) Reference to the witness H 

231The appellant's complaint relates to part of the trial judge's summing-up concerning count 18. H was the elder sister of SB. For count 18, it was the Crown case that the appellant picked SB up from H's place having telephoned to see whether he wished to go for a drive, and they drove up north. The particular passage in the summing-up was recorded - 

"" ... she described it, 'there was just [P] and he, and they went up past Maclean'."" 

232The complaint was that H had not given this evidence and ""she"" should have been ""he"". That is correct. Again, either there was a typing error or there was a slip by the trial judge. However, when read in context it was clear, and it would have been clear to the jury, that the trial judge was referring to the evidence of DB and not evidence of H. The statement was made as part of describing DB's account of the circumstances that gave rise to count 18. In any event, the jury acquitted the appellant on that count. There is no substance in the complaint. 

(o) Reference to drinking alcohol 

233In relation to count 18 the trial judge's reference to SB's evidence is recorded in the transcript - 

""They stayed at a motel, it was in a town, he did not know the name of the town it was 'near Lismore or something'. 'Both of us' just drank alcohol, he said, they did not eat anything. He drank some spirits, he said he was 'pretty pissed'. They slept on the double bed."" 

234The appellant said that the evidence of DB was that he (DB) and he alone drank alcohol. He said that what the trial judge said would or could have been misinterpreted by the jury and ""cross-pollinate[d] the other complainant's evidence"", because the appellant was a non-drinker. 

235The evidence of DB was (AB1324-1325) - 

""Q. Whereabouts was the motel? 
A. In a town. 

Q. Which town? 
A. I don't know, near Lismore or something. 

Q. Do you remember what time that you got to the motel? 
A. Yeah it was night time, pretty late. 

Q. How many motel rooms were booked? 
A. Just that one. 

Q. Who stayed in that motel room? 
A. Both of us. 

Q. Did you have anything to eat or drink in the motel? 
A. Didn't eat anything, just alcohol. 

Q. What alcohol did you have? 
A. Some spirits. 

Q. Who bought you those spirits? 
A. [The appellant] did."" 

236The trial judge was plainly repeating the evidence, although the punctuation as what was said is recorded does not fully reflect that. It was not clear that the appellant consumed alcohol, probably the evidence was to be understood that he did not, but that was the evidence. In any event, whether the appellant consumed alcohol was not an issue at trial. 

237There is nothing in this complaint. 

(p) Discount on sentence for DB 

238The trial judge told the jury that DB ""agreed that he obtained a discount"" on a sentence for an offence of reckless wounding (glassing). The appellant said that this was ""in relation to DB's offer to police that if he gave a statement alleging the appellant sexually assaulted him"" his sentence may be reduced, and that it was reduced; he said that the Crown knew that fact but it was not brought up in the Crown's case, or when DB gave evidence or was cross-examined. 

239This was not a complaint as to the summing-up, but as to the conduct of the trial. DB had pleaded not guilty in the Local Court to a charge of reckless wounding. He was found guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 18 months with an additional term of 6 months. He appealed to the District Court, and the sentence was varied to one of 12 months imprisonment which was then suspended under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. DB provided a statement to police complaining about the appellant while he was in custody pending his appeal. 

240These circumstances were disclosed by the Crown to the Court and to the defence (AB1311), and Mr Webb cross-examined SB on the issue at length (AB 1377-1383; 1401). The trial judge referred to this (AB244-245) and gave the jury a direction under s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995. 

241There is no merit in this sub-ground of appeal. 

(q) A related issue to sub-ground (p) 

242The trial judge's reference to DB's glassing offence and discount included (AB244) that DB had said that - 

"" ... the glassing of this other individual was a mistake. He agreed that he obtained a discount although he could not get a letter of support in relation to the matter from the police. He was asserting that he had not deliberately injured this other person. Of course you bear in mind DB is not on trial in relation to that allegation. 

The circumstances of that allegation are relevant to understanding the circumstances in which his statement making allegations against the accused came into existence baring in mind he had been interviewed by police in July 2007 and had not volunteered any wrong doing on the part of the accused at that point ... "". (emphasis added) 

243The appellant said DB had been convicted so it was no longer an allegation, and that the jury ""could perceive that his Honour is on the complainant's side"". 

244There is no substance to this sub-ground of appeal. It was made clear to the jury, by the evidence and submissions, that DB had been convicted and sentenced, initially in the Local Court and subsequently by the District Court although the sentence had been reduced by the last mentioned court. The use of the word ""allegation"" in that context does not carry any weight. The circumstances giving rise to the offence involving DB were clearly made known to the jury, and the charge brought against him and its disposition were also the subject of detailed evidence. It was appropriate to tell the jury that it was not a matter for them to be concerned with the criminal liability of DB in relation to the ""glassing"" incident. 

(r) Reference to motor vehicle accident near a wine bar in Taree 

245The statement in the summing-up the subject of complaint was (AB248) - 

""In relation to DB, the accused's evidence was concerning counts 21 and 24, as it relates to MH, that he was hit by a motor vehicle near a wine bar in Taree."" 

246The appellant said there was no evidence of any ""wine bar"", and that the reference to it by the trial judge was a mistake; further, that the jury could misuse the statement and the other evidence identified in relation to sub-ground (m) to believe that the appellant was a drinker; he said that ""the appellant's character has been tainted"". 

247The evidence as to the incident was that it was near premises referred to as ""Saltwater Wine"". There was no evidence as to the nature of the business conducted at those premises. However, there was evidence or suggestion that the appellant had been to or was going to those premises. There was no basis for an inference, from what was said by the trial judge in the summing-up or on the evidence, that the appellant may have been a drinker. We also repeat that the appellant's drinking habits were not an issue at trial. 

248There is nothing in this complaint. 

(s) Complaint concerning appellant's assistance to StB 

249SB was an older brother in the B family. The trial judge said, referring to the appellant's evidence, that the appellant ""had taught [StB] or assisted him with reading at some stage"". The appellant's evidence had been of helping DB with reading (AB2008). 

250As the Crown submitted, the trial judge's slip was a minor matter. StB was not a complainant in the trial, nor did he give any evidence suggesting sexual impropriety on the part of the appellant. The jury can not have been diverted from proper attention to the appellant's guilt or innocence. 

(t) Calling witnesses in the TR2 proceedings 

251The trial judge stated (AB250), in relation to the cross-examination of the appellant about calling DB as a witness - 

""The accused said he was concerned about the people that said they saw the accident giving evidence. He was concerned for their safety. He believes he said in cross-examination, that there were five witnesses. He didn't know all their names and it was in the cross-examination he spoke of seeing a woman and her daughter for a few days later at Wingham and he took a statement in writing from them. He said that the reason he did not call them to given evidence was the same reason as he didn't call MH and Todd Ellis to give evidence. He wanted to just rely upon DB."" 

252The appellant said that this was not the evidence and that he ""had always intended to call MH, Todd Ellis and DB as there were two matters running against TR2 at the same time"". This is not easy to understand, but it was a correct summation of the evidence and it was not the appellant's evidence at the trial that he always intended to call the three persons mentioned. In fact he called DB alone. 

(u) The date of the conversation between TB and Pastor Hodson 

253Exhibit L was an agreed statement of facts as to TB's disclosure of certain matters to Pastor Hodson and his wife. The appellant said that the trial judge incorrectly said (AB265) that the date of the conversation was 2 December 2006, when it should have been 2 December 2008, and that it was a serious error because the credibility of TB was ""advanced"" by a complaint shortly after the alleged event. 

254Exhibit L recorded the date of the conversation as 2 December 2008. It was read out to the jury with the correct date. TB gave evidence that he spoke to the Pastor in late 2008. 

255Earlier in the summing-up the trial judge told the jury (AB157) - 

"" ... TB first approached the authorities after speaking to Pastor Hodson in early December 2008. But for reasons which I need not go into and nobody has made much about, he did not make a statement to police until February 2009 ..."". 

256In the passage complained of the trial judge reminded the jury of the agreed facts, saying - 

"" ... the agreed facts relate that TB on 2 December 2006 in the course of a conversation with Pastor Glen Hodson and his wife ... told them that [the appellant] had threatened to harm his sister. That agreed fact is based upon the detail of the recording that was made by Mrs Hodson and passed onto the police. 

You might remember that the chronology was that TB went to the Pastor, some notes were taken of what he was alleging. Those notes were typed up and emailed or passed on to one of the detectives, although the detectives did not get around to taking a statement from him until February of the following year."" 

257It would have been clear to the jury that the trial judge was intending to refer to 2008, not 2006, in the summing-up. There had been earlier reference to 2008, and his Honour immediately went on to tell the jury that the Pastor's notes were typed up or emailed or passed on to one of the detectives although there was delay in a statement being taken until February of the following year, 2009. There is no basis upon which the mistaken reference to 2006 could give rise to or contribute to a miscarriage of justice. 

(v) Photographic evidence 

258In the summing-up the trial judge emphasised the importance of the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt in the jury's assessment of the evidence before any findings could be made. His Honour went on (AB122) - 

""In this regard you must bear in mind in relation to this case that in respect of each complainant, in respect of each count concerning a particular complainant, the case depends very much on a direct conflict between the evidence of the accused and the complainant. There is, apart from of course the film, evidence of the videos which are relevant to count 6 and 11 and 15 and Exhibit 1, relevant to Exhibit E, in respect of count 15, and of course for the film which has been called the 'carrot video' and the related video if I might call it that Exhibit 2, of which there is direct photographic evidence, in terms of establishing the guilt of the accused as having done certain things such as to constitute a particular crime, there is one complainant giving evidence of mattes denied by the accused. Thus we have what I have said is this direct conflict."" (emphasis added) 

259It was contended by the appellant that the reference to ""direct photographic evidence"" was very damning and extremely serious. In that respect the appellant said - 

""Fact the 'carrot video' was tendered by the appellant before Garling DCJ [Port Macquarie proceedings] to show that I had been set up. His Honour has turned the defence exhibit as DNA and made it finite to prove the guilt of the accused when this was not the case. It was up to the jury to decide this fact."" 

260As the Crown observed, it appears that the appellant asserted that the ""carrot video"" was a defence exhibit because it was produced by him at the Port Macquarie proceedings, and that it should not have been referred to by his Honour as something ""finite"" to prove the appellant's guilt. However, the Crown relied on the ""carrot video"" in relation to count 14, and its relevance was dealt with in the summing-up at AB141-143; 156-157. 

261The paragraph in which appeared the statement of which the appellant complained was part of a general reference to the conflict between the evidence of the complainants and that of the appellant, but with mention of evidence by way of film or video constituting what the trial judge referred to as ""direct photographic evidence"". In the passage in question his Honour was indicating that the film and video evidence was part of the Crown case, all of which was contested by the appellant. There is no basis for a miscarriage of justice in relation to this sub-ground of appeal. 

262Taking all of the complaints in (a) to (v) together, in our opinion no miscarriage of justice has been established. 

263In relation to the complaints in (a) to (v), we have earlier indicated that Rule 4 arises. 

264Rule 4 specifies - 

""No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground of appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal."" 

265There was no application made at trial in respect of the matters that have been raised in complaints (a) to (v) above. In considering whether or not leave ought to be granted now to argue these matters of complaint, the Court is entitled to have regard to the substance of the complaints and their materiality to the proceedings as a whole and whether or not they raise matters of significance such as to potentially result in a miscarriage of justice. 

266We have taken into account each of those matters. We are firmly of the opinion that leave should not be granted under Rule 4. 

267Accordingly, this ground of appeal should be dismissed. 

Ground 4: The learned trial Judge cast an unjustifiable aspersion against the appellant which was highly prejudicial this led to a miscarriage of justice 

268In his written submissions the appellant set out the passage in the course of his cross-examination which we have already set out in relation to ground of appeal 1(e); for convenience, we repeat it in part. The subject-matter was SB coming to live with the appellant. The passage was - 

"" Q. So it would be correct to say he was living with you in April 2004 wouldn't it? 

A. Well I believe what I should have put is - no - if you read my letter. 'SB has now been in my care for some weeks twelve weeks.' Probably I should have put, approximately twelve weeks and I can give you a statement here that gives you the exact date SB came into my care, the day I took him to DOCS, you've got it in your files Miss. 

His Honour: No, no please Mr C. 

Witness: Sorry. 

His Honour: Don't volunteer things that you say people have got because they may not have them - I don't know. 

Witness: They served on you your Honour. 

His Honour: No, you maybe a mind reader for all I know, but you can't keep on asserting that people have got things right, Mr C I'm not going to ask you again. I'm going to have to cut you off because it's not an answer to the question."" 

269The appellant submitted that he was justified in answering and had a ""fundamental right"" to answer as he did, as the material to which he referred had been served on him and his counsel as part of the Crown brief of evidence and was part of his ""comprehensive defence portfolio given to his counsel"". He further submitted - 

""... that the jury would have inferred that the appellant was lying, making up the matters inter alia ' being set ' up and that the files did not exist when in fact they did. Especially since the appellant's counsel did not rectify the aspersion against his character."" 

270We have referred at [120] to the many occasions on which the trial judge warned the appellant not to volunteer information which was not responsive and to listen carefully to each question. The appellant did not pay heed to the warnings. The trial judge was, with respect, correct in his observations in relation to that part of the appellant's answer to the question in cross-examination which stated ""... and I can give you a statement here that gives you the exact date SB came into my care ..."". That statement was not responsive to the question asked. 

271The appellant was in the position of a witness being cross-examined, and it was not open to him to answer a question by offering to provide a statement that he said he had available to him. It was for that reason that the trial judge stated "" Don't volunteer things that you say people have got ..."". When the trial judge further stated, ""I'm going to have to cut you off because it's not an answer to the question"", it was a correct and proper ruling on a purported answer by the appellant. 

272There is no basis for the contention that the statements made by the trial judge in some way constituted ""an unjustifiable aspersion against the appellant which was highly prejudicial ..."". It may be noted that Mr Webb gave evidence in the appeal (affidavit of 14 June 2011, pp 51-2) that he saw the trial judge's remark as to the appellant being a ""mind reader"" as ""made ... in the context of forbearance"", and not in his view at the time occasioning any significant prejudice to the appellant. 

273There is no substance to this ground of appeal. 

Ground of Appeal 5: The appellant was mentally ill shortly before and during the trial which led to a miscarriage of justice 

274Particulars of this ground were set out in the appellant's submissions. The appellant said that he was ""mentally ill"" due to the effects of medication that he was taking prior to and during the trial, namely Efexor, an anti-depressant drug. The appellant was taken into custody on 8 April 2009, and was transferred to the MRRC where he said he was seen by a nurse. He said that he advised the nurse that he had, in the past, been treated with Efexor but had discontinued it because of his forthcoming trial. He further said that over the next few days the nurse provided him with Efexor in high dosages. He claimed that the ""normal dose"" of Efexor was 75 mg per day. He claimed that he was ""forced"" to take double the normal dose, namely, 150 mg per day. 

275In his submissions, the appellant asserted that over the next few days he experienced severe headaches which he attributed to the Efexor, and could feel himself becoming ""grandiose, irrational and hypo manic"". He said that during the trial, the effect was that - 

""[he had] absolutely no fear of the consequences when his [sic] is on such a high dose of the medication. Through out [sic] the trial the appellant was unable to focus and give rational instructions to his counsel"". 

276The submissions included - 

""(l) Because of the medication and the threats, the appellant in his grandiose state decided to make sure he was found guilty in the trial to protect his children and grandchildren deliberately compromising his defence. See ... T 1437, 18."" 

277This related to the question of "" threats"" and ""duress"" which arises for separate consideration under ground of appeal 8. The reference to T 1437 was to the trial judge's observation in connection with the exposure of genitalia episode that he had warned the appellant ""so many times how unhelpful it is for him to think he is smart in volunteering information, which the jury will quite clearly see is merely prevarication and obfuscation and grandstanding on his part"" (although his Honour continued, ""but that's - he's made a considered judgment about that because I've given him so many warnings to protect him from himself""). 

278In summary, the appellant contended that the dosage of Efexor (of the order of 150 mg on a daily basis) led him in some way deliberately to compromise his trial, to make sure that he was found guilty so as to be found as ""some kind of martyr"". He said in his submissions - 

""... It is submitted that Justice Health in forcing the appellant to take the high dose of medication without seeing a doctor has compromised the appellant's chance of a fair trial. Therefore, the appeal should succeed on this ground as justice has miscarried ..."" 

279At the conclusion of the trial, whilst the jury were deliberating, the appellant sent counsel a document headed ""Trial compromised"" (appellant's submissions p 149). In that document he claimed that he had returned to normal after not being on the medication for five or six days, and that his ability to properly instruct and obtain a fair trial had been ""gravely compromised "" . 

280For the reasons which follow, we do not accept that the appellant's mental state was such that there was any miscarriage of justice. 

281The appellant was examined by Dr Allnutt, consultant psychiatrist, on two occasions. Dr Allnutt produced three reports, the first dated 14 April 2009, the second dated 16 December 2009 and the third dated 22 October 2010. (It will be recalled that the trial commenced on 11 May 2009 and continued until the jury returned guilty verdicts on 26 June 2009.) Dr Allnutt swore an affidavit dated 30 September 2011 which was read in the appeal. Copies of the reports were annexures A, B and C to the affidavit. Dr Allnutt made corrections to typographical errors in a report and, having done so, concluded - 

""None of these changes affect my opinion of his fitness to stand trial as expressed in that report dated 22 October 2010 (Annexure C)."" 

282In the report of 14 April 2009, Dr Allnutt's opinion was that the appellant was fit to stand trial and that it was unlikely that he was mentally ill at the time of the commission of the offences. Dr Allnutt noted that, whilst the appellant reported difficulties concentrating on matters such as television, he nonetheless ""... maintained focus on his criminal and civil Court cases ..."". The appellant had reported to Dr Allnutt that, since initially being diagnosed in about 1997 with depression and commencing at that time to take Efexor, he had continued to take Efexor ""on and off since then"" and that this had helped his depression. The appellant observed that Efexor ""... made him confident so that, by 2001, he felt 'super confident'"". Dr Allnutt noted that the appellant's speech was clear and coherent, and he observed - 

""He did not manifest evidence of side effect to psychiatric medication or neurological illness. He spoke in a clear and coherent manner. There was no significant evidence of psychosis. He endorsed a depressed mood with some mild neurovegetative symptoms of depression but none of mania or hypomania. He manifested adequate cognitive capacity and capacity for insight and judgment."" 

283For the report of 16 December 2009, the appellant gave Dr Allnutt a history that, after he was incarcerated, he felt ""forced "" to take Efexor commencing on 16 April 2009 at a dose of 150 mg which he continued to take during the course of his trial. It was noted in the report - 

""... He was given 150 mg in the morning by a nurse; he tried to refuse it and was told that he could not refuse it; he was told this by the nursing officer if he refused he was going to be 'thrown in a dry cell'."" 

284The appellant's history at that time included that Justice Health had contacted his general practitioner who advised them that the appellant was on Efexor. The report again noted ""He felt coerced, so he took the medication; he denied at the time that he was feeling any depressive conditions ..."". 

285No precise factual account was recorded by Dr Allnutt to support the statement that the appellant ""felt"" coerced. 

286Dr Allnutt recorded that the appellant took the Efexor at a dose of 150 mg a day for four to six weeks prior to the trial and during the trial until three weeks before the end of the trial. He recorded that during the course of the trial when the appellant was taking the Efexor ""... he said he began to feel invincible; these symptoms took about three to four weeks to emerge after commencing the Efexor ..."". The report also recorded - 

""He thought he could run his own trial; he was also distracted and had difficulty focussing on what was going on with the trial and recalled frequently making inappropriate comments in the Court; three days prior to the end of the trial the medication was discontinued and he came 'crashing down'; he said he felt different and began to feel less confident ..."" 

287Dr Allnutt reported - 

""I have reviewed the transcript of his evidence and until near the end of his evidence of the 17 June 2009, I was unable to identify significant evidence of symptoms consistent with hypomania expect [sic: accept] that his Honour noted on occasion that he seemed to become tangential; however, it appears that despite this observations, he was able to be re-directed to answer the questions put to him; in addition, there was an incident when he wrote something on a note that he said was a joke."" 

288Dr Allnutt conducted a documentation review of notes from the appellant's general practitioner between February 2005 and November 2009. This revealed that for periods in 2005, 2006 and 2008 he had been prescribed Efexor at dosages of 150 mg twice daily. 

289In the report of 16 December 2009, which was prepared for the purposes of the sentencing proceedings, Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion that the appellant did not manifest any significant symptoms of major mental illness, and observed - 

""... there is some objective evidence to support his report to me that Efexor induces a change in his mood consistent with hypomania. On this basis, there are grounds to raise concern that he has an underlying vulnerability to mood fluctuations and raises the possibility that he has experienced hypomania induced by Efexor in the past."" 

290In the report of 22 October 2010, Dr Allnutt stated that at the time he saw the appellant in April 2010 he thought he had some residual symptoms of a mild depression probably more consistent with an adjustment disorder with a depressed mood, and that the antidepressant that he was taking at the time (Efexor 37.5 mg daily) were ameliorating his depressive conditions. In that report Dr Allnutt expressed the view that, while the appellant may have acted in a manner that was not in his interests and even if he had been dis-inhibited due to mild symptoms of hypomania, he retained capacity based on Presser criteria. Accordingly, Dr Allnutt considered that he would have been fit to stand trial on the evidence provided to him. Dr Allnutt was prepared to accept that Efexor had induced a change in the appellant's mood consistent with hypomania, but said that ""... the information provided suggested these symptoms were likely relatively mild"" (referring to symptoms of hypomania, over-confidence and dis-inhibition). 

291Leaving to one side the allegations that he was, in effect, forced or pressured into the daily dosage of Efexor, the medical opinion does not support the appellant's submissions as to the effect of the drug upon him. 

292Whilst Dr Allnutt accepted that Efexor had induced a change in the appellant's mood (consistent with hypomania), he stated that the information indicated that such symptoms were ""likely relatively mild"". There is no warrant from Dr Allnutt's reports for concluding that the ingestion of Efexor by the appellant not only affected his mood, but also caused him to be ""irrational"" or ""... unable to focus and give rational instructions to his counsel"". There is no support from Dr Allnutt's reports for the proposition that Efexor had produced such an effect as to interfere or impair his cognitive processes to the point that he became irrational during the course of the trial or was unable to properly give instructions. 

293It is not necessary further to consider and determine the appellant's account to Dr Allnutt that Justice Health ""forced"" him to take the higher dosages of Efexor without him having seen a doctor. The important question is whether or not there is evidence, in particular, expert medical opinion, from which it should be concluded that Efexor materially impaired or affected his cognitive processes so as to materially interfere with his ability to provide rational instructions and to otherwise act rationally. It may be said that apart from the appellant's general allegation of having been ""forced"" to take doses of 150 mg of Efexor daily, there is no direct evidence to establish that the dosages given to him were either excessive or were forced upon him. 

294In oral submissions the appellant submitted that Dr Allnutt had erred in his assessment of him through applying the Presser standard; instead, it was argued that the test espoused in M'Naghten's Case (1843) 1 Car & Kir 130n; (1843) 4 State Tr NS 847; [1843-60] All ER 229; (1843) 10 Cl & Fin 200; (1843) 8 ER 718 applied. 

295The Presser test was expressed by Smith J in R v Presser [1958] VR 45, wherein his Honour said at 48 - 

""He needs ... to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceeding, namely, that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand ... the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge. Where he has counsel he needs to be able to do this through his counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel, if any."" 

296The Presser test has in recent years been considered by this Court in Clarkson v R [2007] NSWCCA 70; (2007) 171 A Crim R 1. See, in particular, the judgment of Beazley JA at [127] - [144]. 

297We do not consider there is any substance to the submission that Dr Allnutt erred in his assessment of the appellant by application of the Presser standard. It is relevant to note that, in the course of his submissions, the appellant conceded (T54, 24 October 2011) - 

""... [Dr Allnutt's] affidavits refer mainly to Presser. Clearly I agree that I was capable of satisfying Presser, but when it comes to the McNaughton [sic] test and the intoxication and the defaults in judgments, that's where I think Dr Allnutt would be able to give his opinion on what sort of effects and how it would affect one's judgment."" 

298On the issue of the appellant's mental state, it is also relevant for this Court to have regard to the evidence of the appellant's counsel Mr Webb and that of his solicitor Mr Roff. The effect of their evidence was strongly against the proposition that the appellant suffered an apparent impairment of his cognitive processes during the course of the trial; it is destructive of any basis for the contention that the appellant laboured under a mental state during the course of the trial which compromised his ability to give rational instructions. 

299Mr Roff said in cross-examination before this Court by the appellant in respect of his mental state prior to and during the trial (T9, 14 October 2011) - 

""Q. I wanted to take you back to before the trial and during the trial and Mr Webb commenting on my behaviour or my demeanour and ringing Dr Allnutt as the trial started and he had a problem with whatever was going on, some problem with me, and that is why he rang Dr Allnutt because something was going on with me. Can you elaborate why he rang Dr Allnutt or whether he had a conversation with you to that effect? 
A. I did have a conversation with Dr Webb about a conversation he had had with Dr Allnutt wherein according to Dr Webb he discussed what he thought was an interesting finding of Dr Allnutt that you were capable of giving instructions and Dr Webb said to me that Dr Allnutt's response was well, he may seem crazy and indeed he may seem like he goes up and down but he knows exactly what he is doing. 

Q. During the trial you mentioned at the end of the trail [sic] the difference in my demeanour when I was on the medication and not. Do you recall you noticed a difference in me? 
A. I do recall that at times you would be more insisting upon particular courses of action and at other times less insistent about those courses of action."" 

300Mr Roff was cross-examined by the appellant on a file note dated 17 June 2009. It contained the comment ""wants to bring up a few things ... about SB and the Public Trustee ... too unstable"". In cross-examination before this Court (T11-12, 14 October 2011) the following was said - 

""Q. If you read down to where it says 'Too unstable' is that referring to the evidence or me? 
A. I am sorry referring to? 

Q. In the first paragraph with the asterisk 'Wants to bring up a few things' and the 'Public Trustee. Not advisable. Too unstable' is referring to the evidence or to me, that I am too unstable at the time? 
A. That note would refer to the fact we were unsure what it was you would say in evidence if you were called. 

Q. You are saying I was too unstable? 
A. I am saying looking back at what that note would refer to in its context that your evidence would in effect be unstable, not necessarily you."" 

301In his affidavit sworn on 14 June 2011 Mr Webb referred to the occasion on which the appellant gave him instructions, in effect, to not proceed with severance applications and separate trial applications, and that all complainants were to proceed in the one trial with tendency and coincidence evidence. He said that he asked the appellant whether he was sure that he wanted to proceed in that way, saying to him, ""It is my belief that you will be taking on a significant disadvantage in terms of your prospects of success by doing this"". Mr Webb said that that evening he drafted written instructions which were signed by the appellant in the presence of Mr Roff the following day. Mr Webb then indicated to the trial judge that the severance and separate trial applications would not be pursued, and the trial then commenced with the empanelment of the jury the following Monday. 

302In the affidavit Mr Webb deposed - 

""27. In my mind, the decision to execute [the appellant's] instructions was a very serious matter by way of the abandonment of separate trial and severance applications. Before doing so, I was satisfied in my mind as to the following - 

(i) That [the appellant] was of sound mind in terms of his ability to provide proper instructions. Prior to the trial commencing, I had requested and was in receipt of a psychiatric report provided by Dr Allnutt addressing the issues that he was fit to plead, fit to provide proper instructions, and did not present as having any relevant mental illness at times material to the alleged allegations. 

(ii) That [the appellant] had been given clear and forceful advice as to the undesirability, in my opinion, of taking such a course. 

(iii) That [the appellant] believed there to be a tactical advantage to him in taking the course of having all complainants in the one trial. 

(iv) That a record of [the appellant's] instructions be obtained by way of written instructions as to wishing to take course that he had indicated."" 

303In the same affidavit, in responding to some of the applicant's written submissions, Mr Webb said that he did have difficulty in understanding the appellant's instructions. In particular, in his mind, he said that the appellant's instructions often appeared to be antithetical to his own interests. He said that, although he was in receipt of Dr Allnutt's report diagnosing the appellant as fit to plead well before the commencement of the trial, on two occasions after the trial proper commenced, he telephoned Dr Allnutt with a view to seeking his medical opinion on the fitness issue. He said that the two calls were about two weeks apart and occurred in May 2009 during the Crown case. He said that in one of the telephone conversations with Dr Allnutt, he asked - 

""Dr Allnutt, I am concerned about [the appellant] in relation to the instructions that he is providing me with in this trial. On the one hand he seems quite intelligent. But on the other hand, his instructions do not make much sense to me. He wants me to tender things and place matters in issue which are very bad for him in the trial."" 

304He said that Dr Allnutt replied, ""[the appellant's] problems are not fitness problems"". 

305In cross-examination the appellant put to Mr Webb (T36-37, 14 October 2011) - 

""Q. I want to take you back before the trial started and when you contacted Dr Allnutt in relation to my medical abilities? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Prior to the trial, would you say I was acting just normally like this with you? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And then subsequently, or just before the trial started, a day or two whenever we were speaking to you, that's when my demeanour changed? 
A. I don't agree there was a change within the terms you have suggested. 

Q. But you did contact Dr Allnutt. Why did you contact Dr Allnutt? There must have been a reason you contacted him twice? 
A. I contacted him twice during the course of the trial about two weeks apart in May when the trial got under way, prior to that I spoke with Dr Allnutt before the trial commenced in respect of the matter of a report. 

Q. But you were concerned when you rang him those two times that I may not be fit to give instructions? 
A. Yes, I was. 

Q. And what led you to think I wasn't fit to give instructions? 
A. Because in my mind there was an incongruence between, on the one hand what appeared to me to be your intelligence and on the other hand the instructions you were providing which in many respects I thought were antithetical to your interests."" 

306A little later the appellant put to Mr Webb (T37, 14 October 2011) - 

Q. I am putting this to you: One of the reasons you rang Dr Allnutt was because I was speaking too fast, I was pressuring my instructions upon you, and it was in an over assertive manner, not aggressive but wasn't in a normal fashion like I am talking to you now. That's why you rang Dr Allnutt because of my demeanour. I wasn't rational, I was talking too fast, pressured speech. Would you agree with that? 
A. No, your [sic] were never aggressive in your demeanour. 

Q. No. Overassertive, saying pressured speech, forcing my instructions upon you? 
A. No."" 

307A little later, the appellant questioned Mr Webb as follows (T38, 14 October 2011) - 

""Q. At any time during the trial did you notice I had pressured speech? 
A. No."" 

308Having regard to all the evidence, in our opinion this ground of appeal has not been made out. 

309It may be noted that when in the post-conviction bail hearing the appellant asserted that the reason he had not given evidence about a matter was ""probably because of the medication"", the trial judge said (AB2213) - 

""Mr C as the tribunal of fact, not just the innocent bystander or a legal advisor or a judge of law, I have to put on the record that I saw no hint in your evidence nor in your participation in the proceedings of you being adversely affected by any medication. I'm not saying you weren't on medication. I'm not saying you weren't on medication, but I didn't see anything at all that reflected a lack of judgment on your part. 
A. Right. 

Q. I have to put that on the record. In fact you might remember from time to time when I addressed you directly when it was permissible for me to do so, usually I spoke through your counsel, on a number of occasions you made comments, not inappropriate comments, but you made comments that seemed to suggest to me that you were fully alert and aware of your circumstances?"" 

310In his reasons on the bail application, his Honour said - 

""I must confess, although I hasten to say I have no proper qualification to make a definitive judgment, I saw no evidence of the applicant being unable to instruct his counsel or exhibiting inappropriate behaviour consistent with what psychiatrists might describe as a psychotic state or some manifestation of mental illness that made the applicant incapable of considering the issues that were arising at trial. No issue of this nature was raised with me during the trial. The applicant gave evidence of course over a period of time. He appeared to understand the questions that were asked of him and was well capable of answering each of the questions that were asked of him. On several occasions the applicant would volunteer information not responsive to questions asked of him but which, in my view, related to material that the applicant thought at the time was advantageous to his position in the trial. I make no criticism of him for doing that. Every witness will do that from time to time. Thus on the medical evidence, my observations of the applicant and other matters concerning the conduct of the trial, including matters said in the presence of the applicant by the applicant's legal representative about the applicant's condition. I could not be persuaded on the material that any ground in relation to the applicant's mental state during the trial would likely be successful."" 

311The Crown referred to these observations by the trial judge. Their evidentiary status is not clear. We come to our conclusion without regard to them. If they are properly to be taken into account, they support that conclusion. 

Ground of Appeal 6: The appellant was under duress that if he exposed that the complainants had set him up, his family would be gravely endangered this led to a miscarriage of justice 

312This ground of appeal is framed in terms of ""duress"". The concept of duress is ordinarily understood as raising a defence to the commission of a crime: R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 541 (Hunt J, as his Honour then was). The appellant sought to invoke the concept of ""duress "" in a different way. The central allegation by him was that, on a number of occasions, he had been threatened with harm to himself and to his family by some of the complainants or people connected with one or more of them. In this context, the appellant's contention can be understood as asserting that he was subject to intimidatory threats with the aim of having him refrain from maintaining a defence or giving evidence to the effect that he had been ""set up"" by one or more of the complainants in question. 

313The appellant relied upon the following alleged circumstances supportive of his ""duress"" claim - 

(1) In approximately May 1997, he was robbed and assaulted by TR. 

(2) In the latter half of 1998, he was robbed by CB. 

(3) In 1999, that an extortion note was given to him claiming that his daughter would be hurt if money was not paid. 

(4) Between 1999 and 2003, various threats were made by TB. 

(5) In November 2003, the father of TR attempted to run him over. 

(6) In late 2003 or early 2004, a letter was handed to the appellant's daughter threatening one of his grandchildren; it was made and delivered by DM and SB. 

(7) In November 2007, he was attacked by the uncle of MH whilst in custody. 

(8) In late 2008, DB threatened his grandchildren; no details of these threats were provided. 

(9) In early 2009, he was pushed by SB, who threatened the appellant's grandchild if he mentioned SB in connection with child pornography; around the same time he was ""crash tackled"" by MH. 

(10) At some point in transit between the MRRC and the Court, DM yelled at the appellant, ""How's [K] and [B] "" , referring to the appellant's daughter and grandson respectively. 

314These assertions emerged late. The Crown's written submissions included - 

""16. The appellant also gave evidence on his bail application to the effect that he was prevented from giving evidence about his case because of his fear of the complainants, and because of threats allegedly made to his children and grandchildren (see AB2239 & 2267). The appellant however conceded that the alleged threat to his grandson was made in 2003, some six years prior to the trial (AB2267.10). It is clear, so it is submitted, that the transcript of the trial, particularly the cross examination of the complainants, discloses none of the fears or hesitation, or a holding back of direct questions, complained of by the appellant."" 

315The Crown's submissions accurately described the effect of the appellant's evidence. The evidence given on the bail application was not of the above series of circumstances. The appellant said he was fearful for his grandson but he did not know who made the threats against the grandson until 2006, and (in a general statement) that CB had ""tried to have me killed in custody"". 

316In seeking to establish ""duress"", the evidentiary onus to establish the same rested with the appellant. That onus would require the appellant to establish that the alleged threats were present and operating at the time of the trial and further that they did in fact operate to impede or restrain the presentation of the appellant's defence case. There is little first hand evidence, and no satisfactory evidence, to establish the threats that were allegedly made, and substantial periods of time elapsed between most of the alleged threats and the trial. 

317It is well accepted that one element in establishing a defence of duress is that ""the threat was present and continuing, imminent and pending ... "", R v Hurley & Murray [1967] VR 526 at 543 per Smith J. In addition, as that case establishes, it is necessary for a person alleging duress to establish by evidence that the threat operated so as to induce the person subject to it to commit a crime. In the context of the present case, the appellant had the onus of establishing that he instructed counsel not to pursue the complainants who allegedly made the threats with appropriate vigour by reason of the alleged threats. 

318There are many difficulties in accepting that duress or intimidation affected the appellant's defence of the charges against him. 

319First, the appellant's submissions included, in the context of evidence not used by counsel, a letter said to have been written by DM and placed in the appellant's daughter's letterbox by SB in 2003. It said ""Back off or [grandson] won't make seven"". Mr Webb gave evidence (affidavit sworn 14 June 2011, pp 59-60) that he raised with the appellant that the letter was written by use of a stencil and that other material in his brief from the appellant utilised a stencil of and apparently similar size and kind. The appellant said, ""OK, I will not rely on the threatening letter"". This does not bring confidence in the appellant's assertions. 

320Secondly, as recounted in Mr Webb's affidavit of 14 June 2011 the appellant provided materials to his lawyers of which he said, ""You will be able to intimidate the witnesses by telling them that I have pictures of them and videos of them doing things in my house. You will be able to intimidate them and get them to admit anything"". Counsel declined. The proposal to intimidate witnesses is not consistent with fear of antagonising the complainants. 

321Thirdly, elsewhere in his written submissions (appellant's submissions p 916) the appellant said that he instructed counsel ""words to the effect to use 'Shock and Awe' Iraq-Bush, to put to the complainants that their allegation was fact then strategically point out the truth"". This also is not consistent with fear of antagonising the complainants. 

322Fourthly, from our reading of it we accept the Crown's submission that the transcript, and in particular the cross-examination of the complainants, ""shows none of the fears or hesitation, or a holding back of direct questions, complained of by the appellant"". Nor does the barrage of written instructions given by the appellant to his lawyers show any inhibition on challenging the complaints. 

323There is stark inconsistency in the appellant's position. In one of his affidavits the appellant states that he instructed counsel not to ""antagonise"" SB and DM because they threatened his grandson and ""tried to kill me to stop me giving evidence against them"", but that counsel ignored his instructions and ""launched into vicious attack on the complainants"" (appellant's submissions p 93). From this, any fear of antagonising the complainants had no effect on the conduct of the defence. On the other hand, the thrust of the appellant's complaints on appeal that counsel did not properly conduct his defence was that the complainants were not challenged with the vigour the appellant required, and in particular were not challenged on the basis of conspiring together to set him up; that is, the appellant contended that (despite the alleged threats) his instructions were to pursue the complainants with vigour. 

324We do not consider that the evidence establishes that the appellant was prevented, through fear for himself and/or his family, from instructing his counsel to pursue his defence in a vigorous manner. We are unable to accept the appellant's assertions that he acted under duress, or that his defence was hampered by any concern for himself or his family at the hands of the complainants or anyone acting in their supposed interests. 

325In our opinion, there is no substance to ground of appeal 6. 

Ground of Appeal 7: The prosecutions were malicious carried out by police who were defendants in the appellant's statement of claims for malicious prosecution this led to a miscarriage of justice 

326The appellant's submissions asserted a number of historical matters including the fact that in 1998 he filed a statement of claim for malicious prosecution in respect of an alleged soliciting of a bribe from the appellant by a police officer. The submissions set out a number of facts concerning those proceedings, those facts not being material to the issues arising in respect of the counts upon which guilty verdicts were returned. They asserted the taking of a statement by a Detective Muxlow from a person referred to as CDB in relation to matters pertaining to the appellant, with the complaint was that this was done despite that person being a defendant to the proceedings for malicious prosecution. They refer also to statements having been taken from two complainants in an interview conducted by a Detective Stone, and it is asserted that in early 2008 the appellant joined Detective Stone as a defendant in the proceedings. 

327The Crown's submissions accepted that the appellant had brought civil proceedings. It said that one of the proceedings had been struck out for abuse of process ( [C] v State of New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 673) and that the others were unresolved. However, there was no satisfactory evidence of the proceedings, let alone of matters alleged in them against police officers or others. 

328The central submission made by the appellant was that the prosecutions were ""malicious"", in that some police officers had been joined as defendants to his civil proceedings and that, by reason of the involvement of those police officers in particular by interviewing and taking statements from complainants, those officers acted in investigations concerning the appellant's offences whilst they were affected by a conflict of interest. 

329The mere existence of the civil proceedings could not lead to a miscarriage of justice, and the jury came to their verdicts on the evidence before them whatever had happened in the course of police investigations and bringing the proceedings. In the Crown submissions it was said that ground of appeal 7 appeared to raise an issue that no evidence was led at the trial disclosing that the appellant had ""issued statements of claim alleging various matters against various police officers and civilians"". In our view this correctly saw the issue raised by this ground of appeal. 

330Even if it could be said that the fact that the particular police officers had been joined by the appellant in civil proceedings gave rise to a potential conflict of interest, it does not follow that there was thereby any miscarriage of justice. It was open for that to be explored at the trial, but the prospect of any advantage to the appellant's defence is no more than speculative. 

331If the appellant's factual assertions are to be regarded as further evidence sought to be relied on on appeal, they do not meet the tests for admissibility to which we have earlier referred. In particular, that the civil proceedings had been brought by the appellant was known at the time of the trial and the appellant's counsel plainly considered, as was in our opinion a sound forensic judgment, that there was no advantage in pursuing any question of conflict of interest. It is evident from the trial transcript (AB1632, 1658) that it was agreed that no reference be made to the civil proceedings, and Mr Webb gave evidence (affidavit 14 June 2011 p 49) that the appellant agreed not to introduce evidence of ""his statements of claim as against [TR], [TR2] and the New South Wales Police"". 

332There is no substance in this ground of appeal. 

Ground of Appeal 8: That the verdicts of the jury on all counts which the appellant was found guilty by the jury were unsafe and/or unreasonable and/or unsatisfactory and/or inconsistent having regard to the whole evidence at the trial. And the learned trial Judge had reservations about the guilty verdicts of the Jury; see his Honours remarks, sentencing and bail transcripts 4 days, December 2009. 

333The appellant's submissions relied on some observations by the trial judge in his sentencing remarks, as a preliminary to his Honour's factual findings consistent with the jury's verdicts. His Honour said - 

""In setting out the facts of this case, I must of course only provide a brief summary of all the evidence consistent with the jury's verdicts. I do not propose - given the limitations in time and purpose of these remarks - to raise matters raised by the prisoner that are not consistent with these verdicts. It should be pointed out that the prisoner gave evidence and he raised, in the cross-examination of the complainants, a number of matters said to reflect adversely upon the credibility of the complainants. Many of the matters that arose from the evidence of the complainants, whether it was in-chief and/or cross-examination, were capable potentially of reflecting adversely upon their individual credibility. 

Some aspects of that matter that might be pointed out in passing, include the facts that it would seem on their version of events that the brothers B did not discuss among themselves the fact that they had been sexually assaulted by the same man over an extended period of time. It is difficult to understand how that could possibly be true. It is also difficult to understand that DB and SB, sexually assaulted as they allege, would not have taken some steps to put TB on notice, or warn him, of the risks of him in being associated with the prisoner. If TB is to be believed, his knowledge of the sexual assaults upon his brothers was the barest knowledge indeed and certainly no attempts were made, on his version of events, to deflect him from Mr C's thrall. 

This situation is scarcely believable when one has regard to some of the subtext of the allegations of SB and DB including supposed threats made to them, an attempt made - on SB's account - by the prisoner to kill him in a motor vehicle accident, and the like. 

In relation to the verdicts, it is a somewhat strange affair that the jury might find the accused 'guilty' of count 6 and yet find him 'not guilty' in relation to count 11, involving a recording made at the same time, although involving a different complainant. It is true that, in relation to Mr B, particular warnings had to be given in relation to his evidence. But in that regard I note the warnings may have been in reality more pertinent in respect of the offences alleging sexual assault committed upon him where his evidence stood alone. 

Count 29 involved allegations by the complainant TB which - amongst other things - claimed certain things happening in a particular area of a supermarket in Taree. When the closed circuit television in relation to that event came to light, it did not support a critical aspect of TB's account. It must be fairly said that none of the brothers B was a particular impressive witness for a range of reasons. However, it is clear that the jury accepted the essential truth of their evidence and the prisoner will be sentenced accordingly. 

They were, it must be also fairly said, convincing, particularly DB and SB, as to the extent to which the accused would have had them in his thrall, that is, particularly to CB, he was the author of a number of entirely false stories about the accused to other persons. Some of those false stories he denied making albeit that there was evidence independently available of the making of the stories. 

On the other hand there was an essential truth in their evidence of having a particularly close relationship with the prisoner at the relevant time. The prisoner's account was that this was entirely for altruistic purposes, as was his relationship with the brothers B. In respect of the jury's verdicts, those verdicts must involve a rejection by the jury of that claim, or at the very least certainly a rejection of the existence of a reasonable possibility, that the accused was not guilty by reason of the prisoner having only altruistic motives in his relationship. 

Any further analysis upon the evidence so far as the credibility of the witnesses in my view would traverse the verdicts of guilty returned by the jury."" 

334In his submissions, the appellant also said that the evidence was that SB came into his care in 2004, not 2003, and so the offence as charged had not been proved; and that there was inconsistency in that the jury had found him not guilty of counts in the indictment involving CB except for count 7 (using a child for pornographic purposes), but had found him not guilty on count 5 involving DM (also using a child for pornographic purposes). The submissions did not otherwise address in a focussed way any deficiencies in the evidence whereby the jury's verdicts were not open on the evidence. 

(a) Inconsistent verdicts 

335Inconsistency was suggested between the verdicts of guilty on count 6 and not guilty on count 11 (the trial judge's observations), and between the verdicts of guilty on count 7 and not guilty on count 5 (the appellant's submissions). 

336The offence the subject of count 6 has been earlier described; it was charged that the appellant did an act intending to pervert the course of justice by tendering in the Port Macquarie proceedings a tape recording of DM making a false statement. Count 11 charged an offence in the same terms save that the tape recording was of CB making a false statement. The ""tape recording"" was Exhibit B. 

337The offence the subject of count 7 has also been earlier described; it was charged that between 1 April and 31 May 1998 the appellant used CB, a child over the age of 14 years and under the age of 18 years, for pornographic purposes. Count 5 was in similar terms, a charge that between 1 March and 30 April 1998 the appellant employed and used DM, a child under the age of 18 years, for pornographic purposes. 

338Inconsistency of verdicts is a circumstance in which it may be concluded that the guilty verdict ""should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence ... or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice"": Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(1). 

339The appellant bears the burden of establishing inconsistency of verdicts, and ""it is only where inconsistency rises to the point that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside"": Dungay v R [2010] NSWCCA 82 at [22]; Still v R [2010] NSWCCA 131 at [58]. 

340Where factual inconsistency is alleged, for example in acceptance of the evidence of a complainant on some counts but rejection of the complainant's evidence on other counts, and particularly where the evidence concerns different instances, an inference that the trial miscarried is not lightly drawn. In Jovanovski v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCCA 284 Basten JA said - 

17. ... As explained in the joint judgment Mackenzie [ Mackenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; (1996) 190 CLR 348] at 367 : 

'Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury.' 

18 In some cases, of which the present is an example, the appellant may combine an attack on the inadequacy of the evidence with the appearance of factual inconsistency between verdicts. 

19 In Markuleski [ R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; [2001] NSWCCA 290; (2001) 52 NSWLR 82], Spigelman CJ rejected the view that Jones [ Jones v R (1997) 191 CLR 439; (1997 98 A Crim R 107], 'established the proposition that in a pure word against word case a mixture of acquittals and convictions cannot be sustained unless the Court can detect a relevant difference in the quality of the complainant's evidence': at [64] and [65]. Where separate incidents are involved, cases which can be described as 'pure word against word' may well be rare. Extraneous circumstances will often provide support in one situation, but not in another. Further, whereas the detail supplied in respect to one incident may differ from that provided in relation to another, being a point of distinction which will be apparent from the transcript, nuances in the manner of describing the events which may readily have been perceptible to the jury will not appear on the transcript. In MFA [ MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606], Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ noted a number of features which may need to be considered in circumstances where juries discriminate between counts, at [34]: 

'First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. ... In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. ... A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others.' 

20 Their Honours identified a third matter namely that ""it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only"", referring to the reasoning of King CJ in R v Kirkman (1987) 44 SASR 591 at 593. The same passage was referred to by McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ in MFA , noting that it had been cited with approval in Mackenzie at 367-368. 

21 How much weight should be placed upon the power of a jury to adopt an ameliorative or compassionate role by not convicting in circumstances where they were satisfied that a particular charge was proved is difficult to assess. In Kirkman , King CJ identified the possibility as a reason for caution in concluding that there was a miscarriage where a verdict was adequately supported by the evidence: 44 SASR at 593. He said that he mentioned the point 'as a matter of general observation' but thought it 'unnecessary to look to considerations of that kind in the present case'. Further, it is not clear that there has been a case in which apparent factual inconsistency has been rejected on that basis. That is understandable because such a conclusion would usually be based on pure speculation. Secondly, it would be speculation adverse to the interests of the appellant. In most cases, because juries are not directed that they may acquit on such a basis, that approach would seem to involve an assumption that the jury has not followed its directions. By contrast, there are many circumstances in which a conviction appeal will be dismissed because, despite the weakness of the prosecution case, it is generally to be assumed that the jury applied the directions they were given and were therefore satisfied beyond reasonable doubt: see, eg, Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 at [13] (Gleeson CJ and Gummow J)."" 

341In Jovanovski v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) it was said at [23] that these factors ""demonstrate the need for great caution in assuming that a jury has acted inappropriately in reaching a conclusion of guilt in some circumstances and a contrary conclusion in others"". In Still v R Johnson J, with whom Basten JA and Rothman J agreed, said at [60] - 

""60 An appellate court should be cautious before concluding that a jury (as a whole) has acted contrary to its clearly explained duty. There may be many reasons why a jury does not convict on a particular count and an appellate court must allow for the advantage of the jury when considering questions arising under s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 : R v TK [2009] NSWCCA 151; 74 NSWLR 299 at 301-302 [6], 331 [194]. Where there is evidence to support the verdict, there is a need for great caution in presuming that a jury has acted inappropriately in reaching a conclusion of guilt in some circumstances, and a contrary conclusion in others: Jovanovksi v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) at [23]."" 

342In the present case the trial judge clearly and appropriately directed the jury as to the Crown's burden of proof, and that the appellant's guilt had to be proved in relation to each count by relying upon the relevant evidence in relation to each count and not through propensity or tendency reasoning. His Honour also directed the jury that in judging witnesses they did not have to accept all of what the witness said, and might accept only some of what was said. 

343Counts 6 and 11 were both concerned with tendering Exhibit B in the Port Macquarie proceedings. It was necessary that the jury be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that DM had made a false statement (count 6) or that CB had made a false statement (count 11). The jury were correctly instructed that unless they were satisfied that the appellant had sexually assaulted DM, as had been charged in counts 1 to 4, or that he had sexually assaulted CB, as charged in counts 8 and 9, they would have a reasonable doubt concerning count 6 or count 11. The jury found the appellant guilty on counts 1 to 4 and found him not guilty on counts 8 and 9. Thus there was no inconsistency in finding the appellant guilty on count 6 and not guilty on count 11. 

344Counts 5 and 7 concerned incidents at different times with different complainants. Before going to the asserted inconsistency, all of counts 1 to 5 essentially depended on the evidence of DM, and there is a prior matter of the guilty verdicts on counts 1 to 4 but the not guilty verdict on count 5. 

345In the case of the incident the subject of count 5, DM said that the appellant was driving him back to Newcastle, the appellant stopped at the side of the road and asked him to ""do more photos for him"", and got him to take his clothes off and masturbate and ejaculate on the front of the car while the appellant took photographs. However, when DM was asked for some detail he was unsure of the time of year (even whether it was cold when he took his clothes off) or the time of day, or whether he was given money and the amount. That is not to say that DM's other evidence was given in precise detail, but in our view a reasonably available explanation for the jury's acceptance of DM in relation to other counts but not in relation to count 5 is that, on careful consideration as directed by the trial judge",2011-12-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758453,R v Mark YOUNIS [2011] NSWDC 229,"Judgment


1Ms B Butt, solicitor, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, asserts that there has been a failure to comply with the conditions of a good behaviour bond which I imposed on Mark Younis.

2Mr A Sandroussi, solicitor, who appears for Mr Younis, argues that there has not yet been any failure to comply. He says the reason is that the conduct said to amount to a breach has resulted in a charge or charges against his client. To those charges his client is pleading not guilty and the case has not yet been determined by the Local Court. He therefore says that it is not appropriate for me yet to determine Ms Butt's application for me to act on an alleged breach.

3A little more needs to be said about the background. I sentenced Mr Younis originally in 2008. I imposed a sentence of imprisonment but suspended it under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and imposed a good behaviour bond as well. The law provides that if an offender breaches that good behaviour bond then it is very difficult not to be sent to gaol once the failure to comply is proved.

4In January this year I received notification that Mr Younis had failed to comply with the good behaviour bond which I had imposed. The allegation was that he had committed certain offences in 2009. I directed that Mr Younis be brought before me for determining whether or not he had failed to comply with the good behaviour bond. 

5The matter has been before me throughout this year on about half a dozen different times. The problem was caused by Mr Younis originally pleading guilty to the conduct which resulted in the claim that he had failed to comply with his bond. He pleaded guilty when he was charged with the offences in the Local Court but then he applied to the Local Court to reverse his pleas of guilty to not guilty. There followed a series of administrative errors, misunderstandings and oversights.

6The result is that the charges against Mr Younis arising from his alleged conduct in 2009 have not yet been determined. Ms Butt urges me to proceed in any event. She adopted my observation that s 98 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act - which deals with breaches of good behaviour bonds - provides that I may act if I am ""satisfied that an offender appearing...has failed to comply with any of the conditions of a good behaviour bond"". Ms Butt adopts my suggestion that I can determine that myself, perhaps to a standard of beyond reasonable doubt (that has not been determined), and take one of the actions provided for in s 98 (2).

7Mr Sandroussi on the other hand argues that that could result in an injustice to his client. He points out that the Local Court documents now clearly show that the plea to the 2009 conduct is not guilty. The case is coming back in January for a Local Court magistrate to look at it and to finally decide whether the plea that Mr Younis entered is guilty or not guilty. If the court accepts that the plea is not guilty then it will proceed to fix a hearing date. If the court accepts that the plea is guilty then Mr Younis will be sentenced straightaway and the breach can come back before me. (I might add that it would seem in light of authority provided to me by Ms Butt, namely R v Nicholson [2010] NSWCCA 80, that the more desirable course if the plea is accepted as guilty would be for the Local Court to postpone sentence until I determine the breach and then to sentence Mr Younis.) 

8Mr Sandroussi's arguments are these. First, he argues that the process of reporting the breach to me evidently depended upon the plea which was entered in the Local Court rather than the conduct itself. As I said, the conduct occurred in 2009. It is apparent that Mr Younis made a number of appearances in the Local Court over the following year and did not enter a plea of guilty until about October 2010. The day after he entered that plea of guilty a breach notice issued concerning my good behaviour bond. Mr Sandroussi's point is that the record now shows a plea of not guilty so that it would be appropriate in the exercise of my discretion not to determine the breach because the trigger which prompted the issue of the breach notice resulting in my direction no longer appears on the face of the record. Indeed the opposite appears.

9Secondly, Mr Sandroussi argues that if I proceeded to determine the failure to comply and determine that there had been a failure to comply, the Local Court is still left to determine its case. There could be two inconsistent determinations potentially. It could be that I am satisfied that there was a failure to comply. It could be that an independent judicial officer in another court is not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Younis is guilty of the offences that he was charged with arising from the 2009 conduct. Mr Sandroussi points out that the consequence of my determination could be that his client goes to gaol today whereas when that conduct has been determined by a judicial officer considering an offence his client would be acquitted. Such a state of affairs would be undesirable so far as the criminal justice system is concerned.

10Mr Sandroussi's third argument is that there remains unexplored by him or Ms Butt or by me the question of whether there might be an estoppel which would arise from any determination made by me today. 

11Finally, although Mr Sandroussi did not raise it today, there has been tendered before me on previous occasions evidence that his client suffers from mental health problems. That should concern me in deciding whether to proceed with the breach proceedings today.

12It is obviously desirable that alleged breaches of good behaviour bonds, especially those associated with an order made under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, should be determined swiftly. The offender and the community should not be left in suspension on the question of whether or not a breach has occurred and the consequence. If it has occurred then the offender has not complied with the good behaviour bond and the suspension should be revoked and the offender should be in gaol. The offender after all received a custodial sentence. It is not appropriate for that process to be postponed indefinitely.

13The proceedings in this case have reached a most unsatisfactory stage. One of the problems is that there are two jurisdictions involved. I am sitting in the District Court determining, or invited to determine, the question of whether there has been a breach of an order imposed by me. There are separate proceedings in the Local Court which are relevant to and may impact on the question I have to determine. Needless to say I cannot control what happens in the Local Court. But Mr Sandroussi urges me to abide the Local Court process until the issue is determined one way or the other.

14Although it is very unsatisfactory, I propose to allow the adjournment. Mr Sandroussi has helpfully put on the record that the Local Court Magistrate who dealt with the charges recently was fully aware of the history of the matter and expressed the view that it was unsatisfactory and needed to be resolved. I take encouragement from that. Secondly, Mr Sandroussi indicated that he would not stand in the way of an early hearing date being allocated for determination by the Local Court of the offences charged resulting from the 2009 conduct.

15I have suggested to Ms Butt that her Office might give consideration to taking over the Local Court proceedings under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986. This would mean that the same prosecutor is appearing in both courts and can be apprised of the difficulties arising because of the connection between the two cases. That prosecutor can make sure that those difficulties from its point of view are drawn to the Local Court's attention and urge that court to give the matter expedition. Whether or not that occurs is of course a matter entirely for her Office and the Director of Public Prosecutions. There are factors which he has to take into account apart from any that I have referred to. 

16Ms Butt helpfully suggested that if that did not occur then she would liaise with the Police Prosecution office at the Local Court where this is being heard and draw the attention of the prosecutor to what was going on.

17For the reasons that I have indicated I propose to adjourn, on Mr Sandroussi's application, the proceedings brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions for resolution of the question of non-compliance with a good behaviour bond.

2758465,R v Natasha YOUKHANA [2011] NSWDC 205,"SENTENCE 

1In 2006 and 2007 a joint New South Wales Crime Commission and New South Wales Police task force investigation known as Operation Schoale led to the arrest of a number of men and women associated with various aspects of the importation and later sale of large quantities of cocaine. Two senior figures in that importation and supply business were Alen Moradian and Luke Sparos. Natasha Youkhana, now known as Natasha Moradian, the offender now before the Court, is the wife of Alen Moradian. The offender has pleaded guilty to four counts: 

(1)Between 1 December 2005 and 31 May 2006 conduct transactions to avoid reporting requirements ($386,172.15): ss 31(1)/31(3) Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth), maximum penalty five years and/or 300 penalty unit fine. 

(2)On 14 May 2007 give false evidence at the Crime Commission: s 21 NSW Crime Commission Act 1995, maximum penalty five years and/or 500 penalty unit fine. 

(3)On 17 May 2007 do an act with intent to pervert the course of justice: s 319 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), maximum penalty fourteen years. 

(4)Between 29 October 2005 and 25 July 2007 knowingly deal with proceeds of crime ($4,642,135): s 193B(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), maximum penalty fifteen years. 

2The offender was initially arrested in 2007 for the false evidence and pervert the course of justice matters on 14 June 2007. She received bail. Part of the dealing with the proceeds of crime offence was committed whilst on this bail. She was arrested for this offence on 25 July 2007 and spent seven days in custody before being bailed again on 30 July 2007. The continuation of offending while on bail is an aggravating feature that must be taken into account on sentence. She must also have the benefit of her time in custody. 

The guilty pleas 

3The guilty pleas were entered in the Local Court towards the end of the committal proceedings. They came after negotiation between the defence and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Attempts were made to proceed on the basis of Agreed Facts, however, as agreement could not be reached on all matters, factual issues were required to be resolved by me. Evidence was called over a number of days as it was impossible to allocate a fixed block of time to this matter and my spare court time was also taken up by others involved in Operation Schoale . There were further adjournments because of the illness of the offender and after sentencing submissions to allow for urgent and necessary medical treatment. 

4Despite the delay in entering the pleas and the hearing of the matter, I was told by the solicitor for the Director of Public Prosecutions and accept, that the guilty pleas had considerable utilitarian value. Such is that value that it was initially accepted by the Director that a reduction in the otherwise appropriate sentence of twenty-five per cent was warranted. This concession has been made in relation to all offenders sentenced following Operation Schoale whose guilty pleas were indicated in the Local Court despite the fact their pleas were not timely. This concession was later qualified because the protracted factual dispute here did reduce the utilitarian value of the pleas entered in the Local Court. As will be clear, many of those disputed matters have been determined against the offender. Given the generous concessions made in other Operation Schoale matters and made initially here, I must consider issues of parity and fairness as a factor in assessing any reduction for the plea. I am conscious of what was said recently by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229 at [2] and [33] about the impact of disputes and by the Chief Justice in Thompson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and Howie J in Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1, about the timeliness of the pleas. Nevertheless, as the High Court has recently made quite plain in Muldrock [2011] HCA 39, no one factor can be determinative when it comes to the exercise of a sentencing discretion. 

5I have determined that in all the circumstances a reduction of twenty-five per cent should be extended in this case to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea. Those circumstances include: the pleas were indicated in the Local Court; the initial concessions made by the Director; my allowance of twenty-five per cent reductions for all those involved in Operation Schoale who did plead in the Local Court; and the considerable delay in this matter, not all of which can be blamed on the offender and which, in part, results from the inability to secure court resources to deal with the matter promptly. So far as the Commonwealth matter is concerned, the offender's willingness to facilitate the course of justice must also result in a similar reduction of the otherwise appropriate sentence. 

Offender's background 

6The offender was born in Kuwait in June 1972. Her parents are Assyrian Iraqis and members of the Assyrian Christian Church. They fled persecution because of their religion and settled eventually in Australia in 1974. The offender's parents worked hard to provide for her and her sister, Tanya. Times were often hard and tough, especially after her father was involved in a serious work accident when she was fifteen years old. All the evidence indicates she was a hard-working and ambitious young girl who did well at school and university. She entered the workforce at fifteen and has been constantly employed in responsible positions since graduation from university. 

7The material before me indicates she has a great capacity for hard work and industry and cares greatly for her family. She was, until the commission of these offences, a woman of strong character, respectful and devout in her duties to her church and her local community. She presently assists in the care of her parents who both have serious medical problems, which is set out in exhibits before me. Prior to the commission of these offences she was a woman of good, even exemplary, character. She had never, previous to her first arrest, been in any trouble with the law. 

8When the offender was in her early thirties she met Alen Moradian. Although he was also from an Assyrian Iraqi family who worked hard to repay this country for the refuge from persecution it offered, his background was quite different: see Moradian [2011] NSWDC 130. He had rarely had legitimate employment. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had spent periods in gaol, primarily on remand or pending a successful appeal. Despite their different characters they fell in love, lived together, became engaged and eventually married. By all accounts it was, and remains, a loving and supportive relationship. It is clear that, had the offender not fallen in love with Mr Moradian, she would not now find herself before a court. 

9The first of these offences occurred in 2005. They continued until her arrest in 2007. The explanation offered by the offender for this change from a highly concerned and decent individual to a serious criminal offender is difficult to understand. In her letters to me, her statements to her psychologist and her evidence on 16 November 2011, she says Mr Moradian was over-bearing and dominant: a person who did not explain, was flamboyant and did not abide by society's rules. She, however, is an intelligent, well educated woman who had, at least initially, a strong social conscience. She herself, from all the material before me, has a strong personality and is, I find, capable of manipulative behaviour. 

10Her offending began when she agreed to commit the offences regarding avoiding of reporting requirements. It is clear that she was aware the source of the money was illicit. She did so to launder money which was to be used for the deposit for the home she and Mr Moradian intended to buy. She involved her sister in this offence. She failed to consider the consequences of this behaviour. She told me that she was aware her husband had had a drug problem and had told her that he was in debt as a consequence. Drug debts, however, do not explain the source of the money nor why she chose to involve herself in the laundering of large sums of money which she accepts must have come from illicit sources. She told me that when they were engaged in April 2006 she gave Mr Moradian an ultimatum, ""stay away from crime or else risk the relationship"", but the transaction matters continued beyond this time. It is clear that if she made the ultimatum it was not kept and she was prepared to accept from the offender the benefits of cash derived from his illicit transactions. By 2007, well after this ultimatum, she had also been engaged for some time in laundering large sums of her husband's cash with the assistance of a former work colleague, Mr Torelli. She was also prepared to spend large sums on her wedding, their home and other luxury items. 

11In a letter to me (Exhibit 2) she paints a very different picture of her husband to the man I sentenced earlier this year. In that letter she says she made some extremely poor decisions and these decisions spiralled out of control. She said she is: 

""...so sorry I allowed myself to benefit from material possessions. I have always worked hard and enjoyed working professionally. All those objects are merely that"". 

12She spoke of her desire to have children, her desire to be a good person and her fears for her elderly and sick parents. There is evidence in Exhibit 3 that she feared either she or her husband would be kidnapped because of publicity in relation to their wealth. 

13Mr Watson-Munro, forensic psychologist, whose report is Exhibit 1, provides some background to the offender's life. This is set out again in the report of Ms Robilliard, psychologist, which is Exhibit 14. The offender is understandably anxious and depressed as a result of her and her husband's present predicament and her fears for the future. The Pre-Sentence Report and an update were also tendered. The update notes she has developed some insight into her offending behaviour but continues to be guarded in discussing it. The reports, however, offer no real insight into her offending behaviour. 

14Some understanding of her criminal behaviour can be gleaned from an undated letter to her husband (Exhibit A, Tab 7). In it she criticises her husband for showing off his drug profit derived wealth: 

""We need to be smart, baby...Why do you sit there and show off...Do you see the Sopranos doing that? Would you see Tony Soprano doing that?...He points it all on the junior for a reason: to take the heat away from him. He doesn't care who people think is boss. Papers"" - money, I interpolate - ""this is the number one priority"". 

15As Ms Gray for the Director submitted, this is not a letter of a manipulated woman but someone who, at the time it was written, was not concerned about her husband's criminal behaviour. Rather, she was worried about the risks his showing off created and the fact that he was sharing his wealth with underlings who did not deserve it. 

16The offender gave evidence in relation to a number of matters. As with many witnesses, there were some parts of her evidence that I can accept. Other parts are clearly contrary to the bulk of material that was tendered and is available to me in these sentencing proceedings. I cannot accept all of her evidence. As Mr Boulten SC for the offender properly submitted I should, and do, pause before rejecting her testimony. But, that done, much of what she said to me in letters and evidence to those who prepared the various reports to me cannot be accepted. 

17I cannot accept her evidence she made very few cash payments in relation to the premises at West Pennant Hills. It flies in the face of earlier cash payments put through the bank account, her dealings with cash in relation to her wedding and her dealings with Mr Torelli. It also appears inconsistent with what was said in evidence and the statement by Mr Atmalian and the conclusions of Ms Requelim that both the offender and her husband made cash payments for jewellery (Exhibit E). When she gave her evidence it was clear to me that, even as late as November 2011, she was, as she did in her letters to me, attempting to minimise her role in spending and benefiting from large amounts of cash which her husband's business had made available to them both. 

18Evidence and material such as Exhibit K indicates she was actively involved in spending her husband's cash for his and her own benefit. It is not clear why she attempts to minimise her behaviour in some aspects when, in others, she appeared fairly frank in her recognition of her criminal behaviour. I can only surmise that she, herself, does not recognise the enormity of her criminal behaviour or the results of that behaviour, despite its obvious consequences for herself and her family. 

19I can only conclude that the offender was, because of, initially, her relationship with Mr Moradian, seduced by the things and the lifestyle her husband's illicit business could provide her and thus her motivation for offending was simple greed. She shared in her husband's excessive wealth and assisted him in hiding, spending and using it for his benefit, her benefit and the benefit of their marriage partnership. Such was her greed that it overrode her own well-entrenched social conscience and background which is clearly a law-abiding one. Her choice will have significant consequences. It was a choice that, at various times, she could have backed away from but I find, to the beyond reasonable doubt standard, that by the time of her engagement in April 2006 she was actively and continually involved in assisting Mr Moradian in laundering and spending his illicit drug profits. 

20As a consequence of her offending behaviour she will lose her liberty. Only a full-time custodial sentence can meet the purposes of sentencing that apply here in relation to each offence. These proceedings have been delayed to enable some IVF treatment which may allow for future impregnation but she has clearly lost a significant opportunity to have a child. She is unable to care for her parents who have many infirmities. Her business will inevitably suffer. She will also suffer from an inability to visit her husband and separation from his son with whom she has a close relationship. I accept that she has regret, shame and remorse for the harm caused to herself, her sister and her parents but in her evidence she showed little insight into how serious her crimes were. 

The offences 

21The offender's motivation can be understood by analysis of the four offences before the Court. The bulk of the facts are agreed or not subject to significant dispute. They can be found in Exhibit A, Tab 2. There were, however, two issues that require determinations to be made by me. 

Factual issues in dispute 

22The first issue was who, the offender or her husband, should bear the responsibility for the amounts expended on cash purchases such as jewellery and, in particular, the family home at West Pennant Hills. To a degree this issue, which took much court time, did not require precise resolution: see Weininger v The Queen (2003) 212 CLR 629 at [23] and [24]. This will be clear from what is set out below. 

23The second issue involved the nearly $2 million in cash said to have been handled by Mr Alessio Torelli at the offender's bidding. 

24As to the first issue, evidence was called, particularly from Mr Chard, a designer associated with the Versace company. He gave evidence on 21 October 2011. He told me that the Versace vision for the West Pennant Hills homes was Mr Moradian's but that he dealt more often than not with the offender. The offender told me her husband formed his Versace vision when they stayed at a luxury Versace hotel on the Gold Coast. She said she was powerless to stop him, his home was his passion and, encouraged by Mr Chard, he was out of control in what was done to the home. Certainly the photographs indicate an extraordinary degree of opulence (Exhibit A, Tab A). 

25Mr Moradian was not sentenced for offences relating to the renovation of the home but the fact he was not charged can have no bearing on my decision here. I have no doubt that he provided all the money, which came from his illicit drug business. It is not suggested the offender was involved in this other criminal activity. Nevertheless, it was clear to me that she knew the source of the money and was prepared to play a significant role in spending it. Despite what was pressed upon me by Mr Boulten I do not believe the victim was a victim of an overbearing, violent husband who forced compliance with his wishes. I am certain she wished to please him and to do so she acceded to his vision of grotesque opulence. It is clear from the material before me that many of the purchases were for Mr Moradian's personal use: many thousands of dollars were spent on men's watches, belts, men's necklaces, men's pendants and bracelets. He was prepared to spend thousands of dollars on the renovations and the Versace makeover but many other items were clearly for the benefit of the offender: sandals, handbags, women's necklaces and the like. 

26Like most marriages, there was here give and take and mutual responsibility. The offender, it is clear from all the evidence, took on the role of homemaker, even if her own tastes were more modest than her husband's. She was prepared to play an active role in the many cash purchases set out in the material before me. I do not propose to parse each purchase. It is clear, however, from what was said in the evidence by Mr Atmalian, Mr Chard and the other evidence tendered, that the offender herself engaged in handing over cash, both on her own and her husband's part. It is clear that what was done was for their mutual benefit. It is clear that, while she would have preferred a much more low-key approach, she knowingly participated in dealing with close to $2 million for her husband's and her benefit. This, of itself, is a significant crime. 

27The second area of dispute involved the cash said to have been handled by Mr Torelli. Objection was taken to Mr Torelli's statement being admitted. That statement was admitted. A separate judgment has been published: see Youkhana [2011] NSWDC 204. Despite a warrant having issued for Mr Torelli's arrest he was not available for cross-examination. The Evidence Act 1995, having been invoked in relation to this evidence, Mr Boulten says properly that I should caution myself before acting on Mr Torelli's statement because he is criminally involved, he admitted lying to the Crime Commission and he could not be cross-examined. I take into account the warnings that should be given pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act but, that done, I accept it. It appears compelling despite the obvious problems drawn to my attention by Mr Boulten. I note that much of what was contained in Mr Torelli's statement is against his interest. When the offender gave evidence on 16 November 2011 she confirmed as correct matters that had initially been placed in dispute. She did, however, contest what is set out in summary form in paras [38] to [40] of Exhibit A, Tab 2. Given the material which is before me in relation to the sums of cash available to Mr Moradian, given that the offender's sister, despite having no feelings for Mr Moradian, agreed to help her sister, the offender, by hiding Mr Moradian's cash, given that Mr Torelli had no reason to exaggerate the amount of cash with which he dealt with, his evidence as supported as it is by others such as Ms Bitzmirza and Mr Maciel, can be accepted. 

28When the offender gave evidence about these issues she did seek to minimise her knowledge of the amount of cash, which she agrees she took initially to her parents and induced Mr Torelli to mind on her behalf. She also gave an unconvincing account of the return of cash payments. Her evidence on this matter was simply unbelievable. The offender told me she did arrange for Mr Torelli to launder some money and that she did give him $20,000 to make an overseas purchase of a watch on behalf of her husband. She did give him a bag of money which she had taken to her parents' place, presumably to hide there. She was at the time so desperate she contemplated risking leaving money with her aged parents. Whilst, as Mr Boulten points out, it is hypothetically possible that Mr Torelli hid about $1 million at the direct instigation of Mr Moradian without the intervention of the offender, this is so unlikely that I discount it. In all the circumstances, the evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that in order to assist her husband dispose of large sums of cash, knowing that the NSW Police and Crime Commission officers had raided co-offenders and were closing in on her husband, she chose to assist him by manipulating her friend, Mr Torelli, into assisting her husband, and thereby herself, as part of the marriage partnership. 

29When I consider all the material before me I accept the Crown's submission and what is set out in Mr Torelli's statement (Exhibit G) and summarised in Exhibit A paras [29] to [44]. 

30These findings support important conclusions: 


the offender was actively involved in seeking to hide large sums of her husband's illicit cash from May 2006 to mid 2007; 

the offender played a significant role in inducing others' involvement in the hiding of this cash; and 

the offender was prepared to engage in numerous cash transactions for her and her husband's individual and mutual benefit. 

31The offender told me that her husband had promised at her engagement that he was not to engage in illicit activity. She clearly did not hold him to this promise and clearly continued her involvement in illicit activities up and until her arrest in July 2007. 

32When I review the established facts in relation to each of the offences the following becomes clear. 

33In 2005 the offender commenced involvement in processing a large sum of cash, together with her sister, seeking to avoid Commonwealth reporting requirements. One of the mischiefs to which the Commonwealth Act is directed includes the laundering of the proceeds of crime. She was aware that that money was the proceeds of crime and it was for her and her husband's benefit that the money was laundered as she wished to legitimise money to purchase a family home. The offence was relatively unsophisticated. She used her own accounts and I accept she was not, at this stage, aware of how criminal her behaviour was. Nevertheless, the sum involved was a substantial one, $386,172.15. There were forty-one transactions and, as I have said, she involved her sister in this offence. It was a serious example of its type. 

34The State offence of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime is the most serious offence I have to deal with. The immense sums able to be taken from users by drug traders are clearly illustrated by this case, although this offender is not to be sentenced for any direct involvement in the drug trade. Black money in the community undermines the community's economic well-being. To willingly assist in this process, knowing what she was doing and knowing the source of the money was illicit and the enormous sums involved, make this a very serious offence indeed. The money was dealt with in a number of ways. Hundreds of thousands of dollars of it were spent on herself, much more was spent to the mutual benefit of herself and her husband, including presents for her husband, staying at luxury hotels, money spent on the home and money spent on their wedding. This involved her making substantial cash payments. I do not accept her evidence that she rarely handled cash, particularly when dealing with Mr Chard. His evidence was that mostly the offender handed over the cash. This accords with the pattern of offending in all the material before me. 

35It is clear, although it is hard to understand why, that the offender still seeks to minimise her involvement, despite the fact she accepts responsibility for dealing with her husband's cash in other areas. Nevertheless, material such as Exhibit A, Tab 7 and Exhibit K confirm me in my opinion she was involved on a regular basis in dealing with large sums of cash. 

36On arrest on 25 July 2007 she was found with $760,300 cash. She collected this money at her husband's request so he could deal with what I accept she thought was a kidnapping attempt. The truth is he had been induced, pursuant to a police controlled operation, to provide $500,000 to ostensibly corrupt police. The sting was instituted in order to flush out cash which police were correctly suspicious he had available to him. 

37The reference to this offence at para [28] of the Facts document (Exhibit A, Tab 2) was expressed in neutral terms. An issue arose as to the offender's motives in obtaining this cash. The prosecution put forward the theory that she was assisting her husband in dealing with the sting with the ultimate aim that he and she would leave the country and escape. Mr Boulten submits that all the evidence supports the conclusion that while this may have been Mr Moradian's intention, the offender, as she told me in evidence, believed he had been kidnapped and was panicked into doing what her husband said. I am prepared to accept, on balance, that the offender did believe her husband had been kidnapped and that she was doing his bidding in order to prevent harm being caused him. I am prepared to accept that she obtained the money in a panic. That said, she took anti-surveillance measures, she was readily able to understand her husband's coded conversation, she utilised friendships in order to obtain the money and it is clear that she was able to readily tap into a conduit her husband had for obtaining the sums of money that he had secreted with associates. She did so knowing she was on bail and knowing what she did was a serious crime. 

38The fourth category of dealing with money involves what occurred with Mr Torelli. It is clear from the facts set out above that her actions here were wilful, deliberate and manipulative. 

39These offences would not have occurred if her husband had not had access to illicit cash but she continued, not just to live with him but to become engaged and then to marry him, knowing that he did not work, knowing that she no longer needed to work, and knowing that large sums of money needed to be laundered to help him and for her to spend for their mutual benefit. This is a particularly serious example of the type of offence contemplated by s 319 Crimes Act 1900. It is the type of offence that provides a rationale for the high maximum penalty provided by Parliament. Only a significant custodial sentence could be imposed for a matter such as this. 

40I agree with the Crown's submissions at para [58] of their submissions document that the objective seriousness of the offence is high because: 

(a)of the amount involved, both as to money expended or warehoused; 

(b)the offender was a willing participant; 

(c)the offender co-opted others; and 

(d)the offences were conducted over a lengthy period of time, including while on bail. 

41The offender knew her husband was in trouble and she compounded her offending behaviour by committing two public justice offences: the first involved trying to help Mr Torelli give false evidence to his and her mutual benefit (hers in particular) and she lied to protect herself and her husband at the Crime Commission. In her evidence on 16 November 2011 she said she lied to the Crime Commission out of panic. During cross-examination it became clear the offence relates to one of many lies she was prepared to tell the Crime Commission and that what she did was calculated and deliberate. It is true that the Crime Commission, in effect, set a trap for her and they knew full well the answers to the questions asked. As a consequence, they did not expend unnecessary resources in following such matters up. Nevertheless, this is a serious offence. Our system of justice has the potential to be undermined when lies such as this are told on oath. 

42Both offences were committed with the intention of interfering with the investigation of serious crimes her husband was involved in, some of which she chose to involve herself in. It has been properly said that justice inevitably suffers when false evidence is given. It is clear she did so deliberately and of her own volition and that the pervert justice offence involved preparation and deliberate involvement of others. 

43As indicated earlier, in evidence and in her letters she sought to minimise her involvement. I accept she was not involved in her husband's business - she is not being sentenced for those offences - but it is clear she knew: 

(a)what was done was illicit; 

(b)that it involved drug profits; 

(c)that large sums of cash were available to her and her husband to spend; 

(d)large sums needed to be laundered and warehoused; and 

(e)she was prepared to use others and she was an active and willing participant in these crimes. 

Assistance 

44Well after his arrest the offender's husband, with the assistance of a solicitor, negotiated the surrender to the NSW Crime Commission of a large quantity of firearms, firearm parts and ammunition. Primarily Mr Moradian directed these surrenders. On 29 April 2011 the solicitor gave evidence that the present offender was also involved (Exhibit 7). He said she gave him photographs of weapons to be forwarded to the NSW Crime Commission. The weapons themselves were, however, delivered by people described as ""unknown Middle Eastern fellows"". The offender told me she facilitated the delivery of the weapons to the solicitor by meeting these unknown men in a Sydney suburb and having them follow her to the meeting with the solicitor in a Sydney park. She did not directly have anything else to do with the men. She did not discuss anything with the men and she did not take part in all the gun transfers. The offender wishes her role in the surrenders to be acknowledged by reduction of sentence. 

45Exhibit B is a report from Detective Sergeant Agius in relation to the surrender. He also gave evidence in Mr Moradian's matter. That transcript was tendered in these proceedings as part of Exhibit 7. The extent of the surrenders includes: a revolver, pistols, rifles (some with military applications), and machine guns. The report of Professor Alpers (Exhibit 8) confirms the extent and nature of the items surrendered. Sergeant Agius, in his report, noted that the police had no direct contact with the offender, that no arrests were made or are likely and that there is no threat or risk posed to the offender by the disclosure. 

46The removal of such large numbers of illicit firearms from the community must significantly reduce the risk they would have been involved in, or used to commit, future crimes. As a consequence of the surrender I reduced Mr Moradian's sentence by an additional five per cent to recognise and reward what was done, no matter that it appeared to me his motivation was self-interest and my suspicions generated by his capacity while in custody to influence such a large surrender. Here, as with Mr Moradian, I recognise that s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) gives a court a power to reduce a sentence after having regard to the degree to which an offender has assisted the prevention of other offences. A similar power exists in s 16A(2)(h) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). There would have been no surrender had not Mr Moradian been arrested. The surrender was not timely, he did not demonstrate contrition, it will not lead to future arrests and poses no significant risk to this offender. 

47One aspect of the offender's case before me was to the effect that in her dealings with the proceeds of crime she was induced, manipulated and controlled by her husband. I have rejected this assertion. One aspect of the argument for reduction because of assistance is the offender's genuine and independent involvement in the surrender of the weapons. I do accept that she played some logistical role in the surrender but it seems clear that it was a very minimal one. It was her husband, who hoped to apportion some additional benefit to his wife, who controlled the surrender. As she herself told me in evidence, speaking in a general sense, ""He was trying to fix a wrong he put me in"". 

48I will take into account her willingness to assist when I come to consider all matters in mitigation of sentence and their willingness to facilitate, in a most general sense, the course of justice but I could not, and do not, attempt to quantify in a percentage or other term the degree of assistance here. In doing so I note in particular that because of her antecedents and good prospects for the future I intend to extend considerable leniency to the offender and I am conscious of the requirement in 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that the sentences must remain reasonably proportionate to the seriousness of the offending behaviour. 

Conclusion 

49It needs to be asked: What sentences would be appropriate here? They were all serious offences. Their seriousness is reflected in the maximum penalties provided by Parliament. Their seriousness is evident from the material comprehensively set out in the Crown exhibits which I have attempted to summarise in these remarks. It is evident that each of the offences is so serious that, despite the fact the offender has no prior criminal history and the subjective material tendered and evidence given, only custodial sentences can be imposed. 

50I have regard to the sentences imposed on others involved in Operation Schoale , particularly those who warehoused or otherwise dealt with the enormous sums of money involved. 

51Sentences must be individual and the offender's crimes are different than the others. Nevertheless, where possible, a degree of proportionality must be maintained as between those involved in the same criminal enterprise and engaged in similar criminal activity. There can, however, be no direct parity between this offender and others as their crimes were quite distinct from hers. 

52I must consider each offence separately and also look at the totality of offending. While proper individual sentences must be imposed, the aggregate sentence must also be just and appropriate. In doing so I acknowledge what was put to me by Mr Boulten, that there is considerable overlap, both in the objective facts of the offences and those purposes of sentencing, which would apply to all of the offences. It is clear that they were part of a course of conduct that had its genesis in the relationship the offender formed with Mr Moradian. I recognise both the need for separate and discrete punishment for each offence and the compounding effects of long sentences: severity is not directly proportional to time served, the longer the sentence the greater its impact. 

53I will structure the sentences to give effect to these principles and to allow for a finding of special circumstances. That requires a reduction in the non-parole period for the proceeds of crime offence. Reasons for finding special circumstances include: 


the offender's need for supervision and assistance in adjusting to normal community life on release; 

her need for psychological assistance and supportive psychotherapy - this is evidenced by the helpful report of Ms Robilliard (Exhibit 14); and 

the fact that the sentences have been accumulated. 

54Because of the structure of the sentences, the offender's antecedents, including the commission of other offences which need to be the subject of partially concurrent sentences, I have not set a non-parole period or Recognisance Release Order for the Commonwealth offence or the State false evidence or pervert the course of justice offences. It would seem, in all the circumstances, that to do so would be otiose given any non-parole period or Recognisance Release Order would be subsumed by the non-parole period for the principal offence, so fixed terms are therefore appropriate. 

55While I will exercise my discretion to allow a twenty-five per cent reduction in the sentence because of the utilitarian aspect of the plea of guilty, I am also aware that sentencing should not be a strictly mathematical exercise. Had it not been for the guilty pleas, sentences of five years for the proceeds of crime and one year for each of the other offences would have been imposed with a total sentence reflecting overall criminality involved of six years. 

56When I come to consider those individual and total sentences I put particular emphasis on matters of general deterrence. Given the material and evidence before me I find it is unlikely this offender will re-offend. The community does not need protection from her. I accept, despite my concerns, that she was not totally frank with me when she gave her evidence or wrote her letters and that she is remorseful in the sense that she regrets the consequences of her involvement in her husband's criminal activity. It is clear her expressions of remorse were really of regret. They had self-serving elements and were belated. Nevertheless, a powerful case in mitigation was presented. That said, it bears repeating that such are the potential rewards for those who seek to involve themselves in dealing with the proceeds of crime deriving from the sale of illicit drugs and in seeking to subvert the investigation of serious crimes, courts, by the severity of the sentences they impose, must make it clear to the public at large what I am confident this offender knows: that all the glitz, wealth, fake prestige of illicitly earned wealth are not worth the loss of liberty, family and community life. 

57The sentences must also recognise the harm done to the community and make this offender accountable for her actions. What she did in relation to each of the offences, including the various components of the principal offence, must be denounced. What then is an adequate punishment? 

58Please stand, Ms Moradian. In relation to Count 4 (conduct dealing to avoid reporting requirements, Commonwealth), you are convicted and sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of nine months, to commence on 13 December 2011 and expire on 12 September 2012. I am formally required to explain that sentence to you but the reasons for it should be clear from my remarks. It involves an effective separate penalty of three months imprisonment. 

59In relation to Count 2 (give evidence at a hearing that is false and misleading), you are convicted and sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of nine months, to commence on 13 March 2012 and expire on 12 December 2012. 

60In relation to Count 1 (do act with intent to pervert the course of justice), you are convicted and sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of nine months, to commence on 13 June 2012 and expire on 12 March 2013. 

61Fixed terms are being imposed in relation to counts 4, 2 and 1 because the non-parole periods would be subsumed by the non-parole period imposed for Count 3. 

62In relation to Count 3 (knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime), taking into account a finding of special circumstances, you are convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years and nine months, consisting of a non-parole period of two years and three months, to commence on 13 September 2012 and expire on 12 December 2014. 

63You will be eligible for consideration for release to parole on 12 December 2014 to serve the balance of term of one year and six months, to commence on 13 December 2014 and expire on 12 June 2016. 

64The s 166 matter (unlawfully obtain goods) is marked withdrawn and dismissed. 

65The total effective sentence is four and a half years with a three years non-parole period. Please take a seat. 

66I note that the offender has recently attended hospital and the reports which are Exhibit 19 set out a need for urgent ultrasound and possible hospital treatment. I will allow for a copy of Exhibit 19 to go with the warrant and would recommend to the prison authorities that the prisoner be subject to an immediate and urgent medical examination to determine if future treatment is required.

2758468,R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288,"HEADNOTE 
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment] 
On 29 May 2009 the respondent was involved in a ""home invasion"" in Narwee. He pleaded guilty to two offences under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) which occurred on this day, the first being the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal and the second being robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. In the early hours of 31 May 2009, just two days after committing the previous offences, the respondent committed a number of crimes in the course of a robbery at the Lakes Hotel, Mascot, at which time he was apprehended by police. He was charged with five offences on that occasion, being robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, two counts of detaining for advantage whilst in company, wounding with the intent to prevent apprehension and shooting at a person with the intent to murder. He pleaded guilty to four of the five offences and was later convicted by a jury in respect of the most serious offence, namely shoot at a person with intent to murder. 
On 23 May 2011 the respondent was sentenced by Sweeney DCJ in the District Court. The cumulative effect of the sentences imposed for the seven offences was a period of mandatory custody of 11 years, to date from the date of his apprehension on 31 May 2009, together with a further term of 4 years imprisonment. The respondent was eligible for parole on 30 May 2020. 
The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the sentence imposed in respect of the aggravated break, enter and steal offence committed at Narwee and in respect of the sentence imposed for the offence of shoot at a person with the intent to murder. He further challenged the adequacy of the overall period of imprisonment on the basis that there was inadequate accumulation. 
The issues for determination on appeal were: 
(i) whether the trial judge erred in her approach to standard the non-parole periods 
(ii) whether the sentence imposed for the Narwee offence was manifestly inadequate 
(iii) whether the sentence imposed for the Lakes Hotel offence was manifestly inadequate 
(iv) whether the accumulation of the overall period of imprisonment was manifestly inadequate 
The Court held (per Basten JA, Adams and Johnson JJ agreeing) allowing the appeal and resentencing the respondent. 
In relation to (i) 
1. The court is required to treat the sentencing exercise as a complex but unitary process requiring consideration of all relevant factors in quantifying the sentence to be imposed, based on both indeterminate standards and human judgement considering the deprivation of an individual's liberty in the interests of maintaining public order: [11] - [13]. 
King v Ward [1918] HCA 36; 25 CLR 141; Markarian v The Queen [205] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357; R v Hampton (1998) 44 NSWLR 729 considered. 
2. The standard non-parole periods found in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) cannot have determinative significance but the sentencing judge needs to bear it in mind as a marker, whether or not there are reasons why it should not be applied: [19]- [21] 
Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; Carlton v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 244 applied. 
In relation to (ii) 
3. The harm in these circumstances was foreseeable and relevant but was correctly not treated as an aggravating feature. It would be a misapplication of s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) to take account of characteristics of the offending which, even if it not elements of the offence, are inherently part of such offending: [24] - [27]. 
R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168; R v Youkhana [2004] NSWCCA 412; R v Solomon [2005] NSWCCA 158; Regina v Ancuta [2005] NSWCCA 275; Elyard v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 43; 45 MVR 402. 
4. To assess the aggravated break, enter and steal, as ""just in the mid range of seriousness"" for an offence of that kind was to fail to give appropriate weight to the various circumstances of aggravation and underestimated the seriousness of the offence, warranting the intervention of this Court: [34] - [36]. 
R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 considered. 
In relation to (iii) 
5. The court must approach the characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence as a matter classically in the hands of the sentencing judge; however the appellate court retains a statutory responsibility to intervene in circumstances where, upon application of the correct principles, error is established: [50] - [52]. 
Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282; Ayshow v R [2011] NSWCCA 240 Leslie v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 203; R v KB [2011] NSWCCA 190; House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 applied. 
6. A 10 year non-parole period should have been imposed in relation to the offence of shoot at with the intent to murder. As this was the last of the sentences to commence, the balance of the term was the effective sentence remaining after completion of the last of the non-parole periods. There was no reason to find special circumstances in relation to this offence: [53] - [57]. 
In relation to (iv) 
7. The increase in the two offences required a proportionate increase in the total period of mandatory custody without imposing a crushing sentence or not taking into account the total criminality of the offences. The result is what might otherwise appear to be an unusual degree of accumulation: [64]. 


			Judgment 

1BASTEN JA : Early in the afternoon of Friday, 29 May 2009, the respondent, in company with two other persons, was involved in what is colloquially known as a ""home invasion"" at Narwee, in the south of Sydney. He was later to be charged with two offences in relation to those events, being aggravated break, enter and steal, under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act . He was to plead guilty to those offences and came before Sweeney DCJ for sentencing, in the District Court at Sydney, on 23 May 2011. 

2His apprehension resulted from a second criminal enterprise undertaken two days later, in the early hours of Sunday, 31 May 2009. On that occasion he committed a number of crimes in the course of a robbery at the Lakes Hotel, Mascot, at which time he was apprehended by police. He was charged with five offences on that occasion, being robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon (s 97(2)), two counts of detaining for advantage whilst in company (s 86(2)), wounding with intent to prevent apprehension (s 33(2)) and shooting at a person with intent to murder (s 29). He entered pleas of guilty with respect to four of those offences but went to trial, and was convicted by a jury, in respect of the most serious offence, namely shoot at a person with intent to murder. 

3The cumulative effect of the sentences imposed on the respondent for the seven offences was a period of mandatory custody of 11 years, to date from the date of his apprehension on 31 May 2009, together with a further term of 4 years imprisonment. The total effective term of the sentence was thus 15 years. 

4The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the sentence imposed in respect of the aggravated break, enter and steal offence committed at Narwee and in respect of the sentence imposed for the offence of shoot at a person with intent to murder, committed at the Lakes Hotel. He further challenges the inadequacy of the overall period of imprisonment on the basis that there was inadequate accumulation. 

5In respect of the aggravated break, enter and steal, the trial judge imposed a non-parole period of 3 years with a further term of 2 years and 3 months imprisonment, giving a sentence period of 5 years and 3 months. In respect of the offence of shoot at with intent to murder, her Honour imposed a non-parole period of 6 years with a further term of 4 years. 

6In respect of both offences, the Director has made good his challenge to the inadequacy of the sentences, and the Court should intervene to set aside the sentences and resentence the respondent. 

7Each of the two specific sentences under challenge is subject to a standard non-parole period prescribed by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). In relation to the Narwee offence, the period specified is 5 years; in relation to the Lakes Hotel offence, the period is 10 years. (The maximum sentences prescribed by the Crimes Act are 20 years and 25 years respectively.) In dealing with offences for which a standard non-parole period is specified, the Court now has the benefit of the reasoning of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39, delivered on 5 October 2011 and thus not available to the sentencing judge. The immediate consequence of Muldrock is to remove one basis of error relied upon by the Director. This is not a case in which a judgment of the High Court, handed down after sentencing, may affect the course which should have been adopted at the sentencing, adversely to the offender. How this Court would deal with an appeal by the Director in such circumstances need not be considered. However, in order to resentence the offender, it will be necessary to adopt an approach in accordance with the principles identified in Muldrock . 

8It is convenient to address the issues raised in the following order: 

(a) approach to standard non-parole periods; 
(b) adequacy of sentence for Narwee offence; 
(b) adequacy of sentence for Lakes Hotel offence; 
(c) structure of sentences imposed, and 
(d) resentencing the respondent. 

Approach to standard non-parole periods 
9The core statutory provisions with respect to standard non-parole periods are to be found in the Sentencing Procedure Act and read as follows: 

"" 54A What is the standard non-parole period? 

(1) For the purposes of this Division, the standard non-parole period for an offence is the non-parole period set out opposite the offence in the Table to this Division. 

(2) For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the Table to this Division. 

54B Sentencing procedure 

(1) This section applies when a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for an offence, or an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to one or more offences, set out in the Table to this Division. 

(2) When determining the sentence for the offence ..., the court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period. 

(3) The reasons for which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in section 21A. 

(4) The court must make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period. The court must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account."" 

10The deprivation of an individual's liberty in the interests of maintaining public order is an important aspect of public law. As with other public powers, the power to impose a sentence is constrained in respect of: 

(a) the conditions of engagement (including the jurisdiction of the court and the conviction of the offender); 
(b) the parameters of the power (including the range of available penalties and the determination of relevant, permissible and irrelevant considerations); 
(c) procedural constraints on the exercise of the power (including according the offender procedural fairness), and 
(d) the recording of the outcome in the individual case, with reasons. 

11The conduct of a criminal trial, including the imposition of a sentence, is a paradigm of the operation of judicial power. In the not too distant past, legislation with respect to sentencing went little further than conferring jurisdiction on courts and identifying the range of available penalties: see, eg, The King v Ward [1918] HCA 36; 25 CLR 141. Sentencing principles, involving mandatory, permissible and impermissible considerations were routinely found within the general law rather than statute. The same was true in respect of sentencing procedure and in relation to reasons for sentencing. The proliferation of statute law in the last 25 years has been driven by a number of concerns, including the achievement of ""greater certainty and consistency in the imposition of punishment"": Australian Law Reform Commission, Sentencing of Federal Offenders , Report No 15 Interim (AGPS, 1980), par 29. Other purposes may also be identified in respect of particular legislation. 

12What is often unclear, however, is the level at which a particular provision is intended to operate. These questions are not novel. Thus, the Sentencing Procedure Act states that ""[w]hen sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, a court is first required to set a non-parole period"" and a balance of the term which ""must not exceed one third of the non-parole period ..., unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more"": s 44(1) and (2), see also its predecessor, s 5(1) of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW). That language gave rise to a question as to whether the court was required to start by specifying the total sentence and then adjust the component parts, or whether it should first set the non-parole period and then fix the additional term. As explained in R v Hampton (1998) 44 NSWLR 729, by Spigelman CJ at 732B-C, in relation to the Sentencing Act 1989 : 

""The issue turns on whether s 5(1)(a) requires a sequential or two-step process, on the one hand, or whether the primary consideration is the total sentence on the other hand. In view of the affirmation in R v GDR that general sentencing principles guide all relevant steps in the process, it is not necessary to resolve the issue, which has a chicken and egg quality about it. The two approaches may go on simultaneously ...."" 

13In terms of the different elements identified at [10] above, these provisions were said to be directed, not to the constraints on the exercise of the power at (c), but the final act of imposing a sentence, at (d). In effect, the Court thus reaffirmed the importance of treating the sentencing exercise as a complex but unitary (or integrated) process requiring consideration of all relevant factors in quantifying the sentence to be imposed. It is an evaluative assessment ""based on indeterminate standards and human judgment"": Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [72] (McHugh J). 

14Legislation now defines the factors to be taken into account in sentencing, although in a way that restricts the list to those that are relevant and known in a particular case and without limiting those which might be relevant under the general law: Sentencing Procedure Act , s 21A. The legislation was, however, understandably reticent about how such factors might operate. Although stating that the Court ""is"" to take the identified matters into account - s 21A(1) - it also states that ""[t]he fact that any such aggravating or mitigating factor is relevant and known to the court does not require the court to increase or reduce the sentence for the offence"": s 21A(5). That the factors are to be taken into account in determining ""the appropriate sentence"" is an indication that they may be taken into account in different ways and for different purposes. 

15The introduction, in 2002, of standard non-parole periods in relation to some offences raised a question as to the extent to which the principles underpinning s 21A were being varied: Sentencing Procedure Act, Part 4, Div 1A. There was no doubt that, as this Court held in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [50] affirmed by the High Court in Muldrock at [27], there were now two legislative guideposts for some offences, namely the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period. In Way , the Court went further, noting that s 54B(2) was ""framed in mandatory terms"" so that, absent identification of reasons for ordering otherwise, it identified the period to be prescribed. Because the power of engagement was identified by reference to the ""objective seriousness"" of the offence, the effect of a mandatory provision would either be to devalue the other considerations prescribed by s 21A, or to prescribe the adoption of a two-stage procedure or, arguably, both. To the extent that Way upheld those approaches, its conclusions were rejected in Muldrock , the High Court stating at [25]. 

""The court is not required when sentencing for a Div 1A offence to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period nor to proceed to an assessment of whether the offence is within the midrange of objective seriousness."" 

16Their Honours also said at [28]: 

""Nothing in the amendments [introducing Div 1A] requires or permits the court to engage in a two-stage approach to the sentencing of offenders for Div 1A offences, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with an hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period."" 

17So understood, the standard non-parole period provisions operated at level (b), by identifying, where applicable, another factor (or guidepost) to be taken into account. They did not operate at level (c), by imposing a procedural constraint on the process. Other provisions operated at level (d) by requiring the Court to identify in its reasons the facts, matters and circumstances by which the non-parole period imposed varied from the standard non-parole period: s 54B(4); Muldrock at [29]. The Court emphasised that this exercise did not require the ascription of mathematical values to various elements, nor the need to ""classify"" the objective seriousness of the offending. Muldrock affirmed (at [26]) that the broad ranging and flexible inquiry envisaged by s 21A and confirmed in Markarian was not subjected to a procedural straitjacket in respect of particular offences by the introduction of Div 1A into Part 4. 

18Perhaps because this Court in Way took the view that, where applicable and absent reason for departure, the standard non-parole period should be applied, it permitted a broad range of factors to be considered in determining the ""objective seriousness"" of the offence: at [84]-[86]. Muldrock weakens the link between the standard non-parole period and the sentence imposed in a particular case and limits the range of such factors: at [27]. 

19What remains in doubt, however, is whether the sentencing court is required or permitted to classify, or prohibited from classifying, the particular offence by reference to a low, middle or high range of objective seriousness. The statements at [25] and [29] indicate that the sentencing judge is not required to undertake such an assessment or classification. The statement at [28] indicates that it would be wrong to adopt a two-stage approach which commenced with such an assessment and then sought reasons for departure. On the other hand, to treat the standard non-parole period as a guidepost requires that the phrase ""the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" must be given content: see [27]. Further, the Court recognised the need for a sentencing judge to maintain ""awareness"" of the standard non-parole period as an additional consideration bearing on the appropriate sentence: at [31]. That exercise must include reference to the statutory context for its consideration. Nor did the Court suggest that a conventional assessment of the objective offending, according to a scale of seriousness, was to be eschewed. The diminished role accorded the standard non-parole period is, in effect, a function of the fact that it involves an hypothetical offence, ascertained by reference to a limited range of considerations. In Carlton v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 244; 189 A Crim R 332 at [90], I noted that, whilst s 54A refers to ""the range"" of objective seriousness: 

"" The statutory language does not require the determination of a low range, a middle range and a high range of seriousness: it envisages a single range and an offence in the middle of the range. ... As a practical matter, it must be accepted that the middle of a range of seriousness is not a precise point, nor is there any paradigm by which it can be identified. This follows almost inevitably from the scope and variety of circumstances which can be relevant to considering seriousness."" 

20Further, I suggested at [88] in Carlton that while the standard non-parole period is said to ""represent"" the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, the term ""represents"" is a curious one: 

""Section 54A(2) does not say that the standard non-parole period is that which 'should be' set for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. That the legislature eschewed such language may reflect the fact that a non-parole period is not determined solely by reference to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence; the exercise also takes into account subjective factors specific to the offender, but not relevant to the seriousness of the offence."" 

21These comments do not appear to be inconsistent with the remarks in Muldrock . One consequence of Muldrock is that a sentencing judge will need to bear the standard non-parole period in mind as a marker, whether or not there are reasons why it should not be applied. One reason for non-application is a plea of guilty entitling the offender to a discount, although that is not a factor relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence, in the terms identified in Muldrock . More importantly, the standard non-parole period cannot have ""determinative significance"" - see Muldrock at [32] - nor even, as the Court also noted, much weight at all in circumstances such as those which arose in Muldrock itself. 

Adequacy of sentence for Narwee offence 
22At about 1pm on 29 May 2009, the respondent went with two other persons to the home of Ms W in Narwee, apparently in the belief that she had a supply of cocaine. Ms W had three daughters of whom two, aged 17 years and 3 years, were at home. (The third was at school.) One of the respondent's co-offenders, Jasmine Ahearn, tricked Ms W into unlocking the front door, at which the respondent pushed the door wide open with his shoulder, threatened her with a wrench which he was carrying and demanded to be given her ""stash"" of cocaine. The trial judge described what followed (Judgment, p 3): 

""Mr Koloamatangi pushed [Ms W] into the laundry, grabbed her by the back of the neck and held the wrench to her face. She cried and pleaded with him not to hurt her or her daughters. Mr Koloamatangi forced her to sit on the laundry floor. He continued to hold her by the neck, waved the wrench near her face, use intimidating words and demand her 'stash'. There was no cocaine in the house, although a small amount of cannabis was later stolen. 

Mr Koloamatangi searched through cupboards in the laundry. Ms Ahearn came in a few times and told him that the house did not look like a 'professional's', a reference I infer to a drug dealer. Mr Koloamatangi then searched the kitchen cupboards. He refused to let [Ms W] check on her younger child, who was crying. 

Mr Raad joined Mr Koloamatangi in the kitchen. Mr Koloamatangi picked up [Ms W's] purse and demanded her cash. She gave him $150. He again demanded her stash. Mr Raad took [Ms W's] purse from her, took out her key card and asked for her PIN. Mr Koloamatangi waved the wrench close to her face, and fearing he was going to hit her with it, [Ms W] told them her PIN. Mr Raad took her photo identity card and said if she called police they would come back. 

Mr Koloamatangi found some tiling grout in the laundry which he thought was cocaine, and when told it was not, yelled at [Ms W] to stay on the floor, not to move and not look at him. 

Mr Koloamatangi and Mr Raad searched the rest of the house. During the search, Ms Ahearn sent [Ms W's] elder daughter to check on her mother and tell her to cooperate. The daughter ... saw her mother sitting on the laundry floor with her head down and Mr Koloamatangi standing above her holding a wrench. ... 

The property stolen from the house included a computer monitor and hard drive, a gold watch, two working mobile phones and three old phones used as toys by the younger child, and four gold necklaces, as well as the $150 cash, key card and photo identity card taken from [Ms W]."" 

23The trial judge referred to a victim impact statement prepared by Ms W, in which she had said that the family had moved home because of her fear and that she had fitted her new home with a deal of security. Because of her fear of leaving home, she had lost her employment, had had counselling and was on medication for anxiety and depression. She said her youngest daughter had become clingy and her eldest daughter troubled. By that she explained that the daughter had become distant from her mother and had lost her enthusiasm and motivation. 

24In assessing the objective seriousness of the offences at Narwee, the trial judge stated that the victim impact statement indicated that she and her children had ""suffered the kind of trauma to be expected from these kinds of offences"": Judgment, p 15. That statement could be read in any of three ways. First, it is possible to read the statement as dismissive of the harm identified. That approach is implausible, particularly given the legitimate purpose of such a statement, as next noted, in the context of sentencing. Secondly, it could be an affirmation that such consequences are to be taken into account as ones that could reasonably have been foreseen by the offender, in accordance with R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 at [25] (Howie J); Josefski v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 41 at [3]-[4] (James J). Thirdly, the statement could be so read, but implying not merely that it was relevant and was being taken into account, but also that it was not to be treated as an aggravating factor, under s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act . Where the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by an offence is substantial, it constitutes an ""aggravating factor"" to be taken into account in sentencing, pursuant to s 21A(2). However, as the last sentence of that provision requires, the Court is not to have ""additional regard"" to any such factor if it is ""an element of the offence"". It is the last sentence of the sub-section, in combination with the relevant factors, which was intended to be referred to by the Court in R v Way at [106]-[107]. 

25Consistently with this principle, the Court has noted that it would be a misapplication of s 21A(2) to take account of characteristics of the offending which, even if not elements of the offence, are inherently part of such offending. They are likely to be reflected in the maximum penalty (and the standard non-parole period), by which the legislature has indicated the proper view to be taken of the seriousness of the offence. Whilst such characteristics may properly be noted in their particular context, to treat them as statutory ""aggravating factors"" is to risk double counting: R v Youkhana [2004] NSWCCA 412 at [26] (Hidden J, McColl JA and Levine J agreeing); R v Solomon [2005] NSWCCA 158 at [15]-[20] (Howie J, Grove and Latham JJ agreeing); Regina v Ancuta [2005] NSWCCA 275 at [11]-[13] (Brownie AJA, Buddin and Latham JJ agreeing); Elyard v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 43; 45 MVR 402 at [11] and [14] (in my judgment) and [40] (Howie J). 

26The scope and limits of this principle were most clearly stated by Howie J in Solomon . However, despite this established line of authority, the Director submitted that in Josefski , at [46]-[47] Howie J had in some way qualified his earlier statements of principle. However that is not so. His concern (by reference to otherwise unidentified authority), was that a misunderstanding of the principle that foreseeable harm did not necessarily constitute an aggravating factor meant that it should be ignored. His Honour described that as a ""common misunderstanding of the decision of this Court in R v Youkhana ... and R v Solomon "": at [44]. Indeed, his Honour reaffirmed the principle explained with some care in Solomon . 

27I would read the statement of Sweeney DCJ as acknowledging succinctly both that the harm was foreseeable and therefore relevant, but that it should not also be treated as an aggravating factor. That approach demonstrates no error. 

28Next, her Honour noted that there was ""an issue of parity"" in sentencing the respondent, as his co-offender, Mr Raad, had already been sentenced on 30 April 2010 by Madgwick ADCJ. How that came about is obscure, as Mr Raad was also involved in the Lakes Hotel enterprise, which will be discussed further below. Judge Madgwick sentenced Mr Raad for offences of aggravated break, enter and steal whilst in company and robbery armed with an offensive weapon, to 4 years imprisonment on each count, each with a 2 year non-parole period, to date from 15 June 2009, being the day on which he surrendered to police. 

29Ms Ahearn was sentenced by Sweeney DCJ on 15 July 2010. She was charged with one offence of break, enter and steal in circumstances of aggravation, namely being in company with the respondent and Mr Raad. Her role in the enterprise was less serious than that of the other offenders and her personal circumstances differed. She received a two year sentence with a non-parole period of 15 months to date from 9 June 2009. 

30It was unfortunate, in the interests of equal treatment, that Mr Raad was not also sentenced by Sweeney DCJ: Dwayhi v R [2011] NSWCCA 67; 205 A Crim R 274 at [33]-[46], [146] (Johnson J, Whealy JA and Hidden J agreeing); Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227 at [77]-[83] (Bathurst CJ, James and Johnson JJ) . In sentencing him, Judge Madgwick ADCJ remarked that the evidence before him gave the impression that ""there is much more to his personal history that is not being revealed"": Judgment, 30 April 2010, p 3. In sentencing Mr Raad for his role in the Lakes Hotel offence, Judge Sweeney stated: 

""He said he committed the Narwee offences because of a bad drug habit, having escalated from using cannabis to using 'ice'. He also had a gambling habit on poker machines."" 

31Both accepted that the leader of the enterprise was Mr Koloamatangi. Sweeney DCJ also noted Mr Raad's ""limited"" criminal history before May 2009 and that his drug problem ""did not seem too entrenched"" which, combined with family support, led her to a similar conclusion in relation to his potential for rehabilitation. 

32In assessing the objective seriousness of the offences, her Honour took into account the following factors (Judgment, pp 15-16): 

(a) the offences occurred in the presence of the two children; 
(b) the offenders stayed in the home for some time, despite being told there was no cocaine there; 
(c) the use of the wrench as a weapon to threaten and subdue Ms W (noting it was an element of the robbery charge); 
(d) the robbery took place in company, which was not an element of the offence pleaded but was relevant to the coercion placed on Ms W; 
(e) the trauma experienced by Ms W and the children; 
(f) the respondent was the leader of the enterprise. 

33The charging of two closely related offences, in circumstances which may involve aggravating factors in respect of one offence, which are elements of another, can cause difficulty in respect of sentencing. Such circumstances invite consideration of the power to impose an aggregate sentence, where available, pursuant to s 53A of the Sentencing Procedure Act . That power was not available in this case, pleas of guilty entered before 14 March 2011 (and not withdrawn) being involved: Sentencing Procedure Act , Sch 2, cl 62 and R v AB (No 2) [2011] NSWCCA 256 at [14]-[15] (Johnson J, Bathurst CJ and Hoeben J agreeing). The course adopted by her Honour was substantially to the same effect, identical sentences being imposed for each offence, to be served entirely concurrently. One consequence of that approach may have been to diminish the overall sentence by attributing some factors to one rather than the other, thus avoid double counting, but with the result that, given total concurrency, the sentences imposed did not reflect the seriousness of the offending. It is necessary to assess the approach taken to both offences. 

34The trial judge assessed the objective seriousness of the aggravated break, enter and steal as ""just in the mid range of seriousness for offences of this kind"". The Director took issue with that assessment. He submitted that the sentencing judge failed to give proper weight to the following matters: first, that the respondent knew from the outset that the house was occupied; secondly, that corporal violence was used; thirdly, that the victim was deprived of her liberty and fourthly, that there were two children present. Further, her Honour said that the property taken ""was not large in quantity"" and that most of it was recovered. However, the property was that which might have been readily exchanged for cash, was not insignificant to its owner and included a key card for which the PIN was extracted from the owner under duress. The fact that the property was largely recovered did not diminish the objective seriousness of the offending. The offender's circumstances did not permit leniency, although they provided some explanation for his descent into criminal activity, through drug use. 

35The primary judge assessed the robbery as ""approximately equivalent to the characteristic robbery considered in the Henry guideline judgment, although there are differences, such as the weapon being a wrench, not a knife, Mr Koloamatangi not being a young offender with little criminal history and that the offence was committed in [Ms W's] home"": Judgment, p 16. 

36That assessment underestimated the seriousness of the robbery offence. In considering the range of sentencing appropriate for an offence under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act , the guideline judgment suggested a generally appropriate range of between four and five years: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [162]-[165] (Spigelman CJ). The sentence imposed fell within that range. Nevertheless, the factors relied upon by the Director warranted a sentence in excess of that range. However, no challenge is made to the sentence in respect of that offence. The complaint arises in respect of the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal, where the circumstance of aggravation relied upon in the charge was commission of the offence in company: Crimes Act , s 105A(1), circumstances of aggravation , (b). Although each offence bears the same maximum penalty and can attract the same circumstances of aggravation for the purposes of s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act , this offence carried a standard non-parole period of 5 years. Because ""the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" for such an offence, her Honour expressed an opinion according to that standard: Sentencing Procedure Act , s 54A(2). The appropriateness of that approach will be considered in the light of comments in Muldrock , discussed below. However, to assess the aggravated break, enter and steal as ""just in the mid range of seriousness"" for an offence of that kind was to fail to give appropriate weight to the various circumstances of aggravation, including not only those referred to by her Honour, but those noted by the Director. But for one factor, that would warrant intervention of this Court on the Director's appeal. The countervailing consideration is that, in written submissions handed up on sentence, the prosecution, under the heading ""Accumulation and Totality"" stated: ""there is a parity issue on the home invasion offence of the 29 th such that Mr K should receive the same sentence"": par 11 at p 7. 

37The other person being sentenced was Mr Raad and it appeared that the stance taken by the prosecution was that the respondent should receive a non-parole period of two years in respect of ""the home invasion charge"", a submission which was imprecise as to which of the two charges in respect of Narwee was referred to (if it were not both). Counsel for the respondent referred to this concession in his submissions on sentence (Tcpt, 11/05/11, p 58(30)): 

""Lastly your Honour I suppose the most difficult part in this exercise for your Honour may well be in terms of the issue of totality and issues of accumulation. ... [T]he Crown in his written submissions has submitted that effectively you could give my client a sentence in respect of the first matter I suppose akin to what Mr Raad received. Now I don't know whether your Honour necessarily agree[s] with that proposition but perhaps one way of addressing that would be if there was no concurrency between the 29 May offence and then the offences of 31 May that they were made cumulative if your Honour was contemplating perhaps a sentence of the order that Mr Raad received."" 

38The prosecutor also referred to this issue briefly in reply, stating (Tcpt, p 63(20)): 

""... the reason that I argued parity was because his other offences are much more serious and I believe that the issue of totality would look at that so that is why I have suggested that there be a particular starting date. I agree that that's a matter for your Honour but that was the way I approached it."" 

39There is no doubt that the respondent's role in the Narwee offences was greater than that of each co-offender: so much was conceded by his counsel at Tcpt, p 50(5). That her Honour acted upon that basis is demonstrated by the fact that both his non-parole period and his overall sentence were longer by 12 months and 15 months respectively than those imposed on Mr Raad. So understood, there was an issue of proportionality, rather than parity. In this context, her Honour's reference to ""parity"" appears to have been reflected in the order with respect to accumulation, which required that the respondent serve 2 full years of the sentences for the Narwee offences, before the commencement of the sentences for the Lakes Hotel offences. 

40A consideration of these submissions indicates that the ""concession"" was neither concise as to its import, nor was it treated by the parties, or by the trial judge, as in some way constraining the exercise of her discretion. In the circumstances it can be disregarded. 

41The circumstances set out above demonstrate that the ""home invasion"" was an offence aptly described as being within the middle range of objective seriousness of aggravated break, enter and steal offences, depending on how broad a band is identified: see Carlton at [19] above. This was on any view an offence requiring a non-parole period in the order of 5 years, taking into account the respondent's personal circumstances. The trial judge approached the matter on the basis that a discount of 12.5% was appropriate for the plea of guilty. That approach was not challenged on appeal. The resultant non-parole period is, in round terms, 4 years and 4 months. Absent special circumstances, that would call for a further term of 17 months, giving a total sentence of 5 years and 9 months. For reasons which are explained below, the structure of the sentencing should not be varied to take account of the greater sentence for this offence. Accordingly, there is no basis for a finding of special circumstances and the sentence imposed should be that just identified. 

Adequacy of sentence for Lakes Hotel offences 
42Within hours of committing the Narwee offences, the respondent commenced preparation for the Lakes Hotel robbery. As explained by the sentencing judge (Judgment, p 5): 

""On the night of 29 May 2009, Mr Koloamatangi went into Mr Raad's unit and retrieved the gun which was later used in the robbery, while Mr Raad and Jasmine Ahearn acted as lookouts nearby, because the police were interested in Mr Raad and his home because of the earlier home invasion offences. Mr Koloamatangi took the gun and stored it in a garage at the home of the uncle, Silivesiteli Lopeti, who was employed in a security role at the Lakes Hotel. There, in the early hours of Saturday, 30 May, in discussion with Mr Lopeti, as he admitted in his evidence in the sentence hearing, Mr Koloamatangi made the plan to rob the Lakes Hotel."" 

43The Narwee offenders were traced because the eldest daughter had the presence of mind to note the number plate of Mr Raad's car as they were leaving. The offenders returned to Mr Raad's apartment in South Coogee where they left the stolen property. It appears they arrived before the police, but by the time the respondent left by taxi, the police were outside the unit in South Coogee and followed the taxi. The respondent was arrested and taken to Randwick Police Station later than night. He refused to be interviewed or photographed and was released without charge. On the same evening, the police searched Mr Raad's unit and found most of the stolen property. They also seized Mr Raad's motor vehicle: statement of facts, paragraphs 11-16. 

44Later that night, the respondent and Mr Raad, with others, went to a hotel in Kings Cross. They left shortly after 2.30am and went via Rosebery to the Lakes Hotel at Mascot. On the way in the car, the respondent dressed in black and loaded Mr Raad's gun, dropping a bullet in the car: Judgment, p 5. 

45The hotel closed around 4am, but staff stayed until approximately 5.20am, at which stage the respondent was waiting outside and Mr Raad was nearby in the car. When the manager, Damien Robinson and the supervisor, Matthew Edmonds, were leaving, with the respondent's uncle, Mr Lopeti, the respondent approached them holding the gun and forced them back into the hotel. He did not, however, see the licensee, Diane Moran, who was able to alert police. Her Honour's account of the events of the early morning continued (Judgment, pp 6-10): 

""Mr Koloamatangi ushered Mr Edmonds and Mr Robinson with Mr Lopeti towards the office demanding the money. Because Mr Robinson had left the office keys inside the office in accordance with hotel procedure, Mr Edmonds and Mr Lopeti were required to break down [the] door to enter the office, Mr Robinson was required to open the safe in the office, and Mr Edmonds to put money in a bag, all while Mr Koloamatangi was brandishing a gun and demanding money. 

This was the robbery and the beginning of the detaining in company of Mr Robinson and Mr Edmonds. Mr Koloamatangi did not succeed in taking any money out of the hotel because of the events that followed. As it happened, the amount of money in float trays and in the safe in the office was not a significant amount. 

Police, including Sergeant de Lorenzo, arrived and entered the hotel. Because Sergeant de Lorenzo had been about to end his shift when he left Botany Police Station, he did not have his Glock pistol. He had a taser on his appointments belt. He went to the northern end of the bar near a door into an area where the office, a bottle shop and a small corridor were located. He discharged the taser at Mr Koloamatangi. He intended to disable Mr Koloamatangi with the electric shock from the taser, but although Mr Koloamatangi moved backwards, he was not disabled by the taser. 

During the trial, Sergeant Brown, a taser expert, said that although Mr Koloamatangi may have been startled by the taser, the taser did not affect Mr Koloamatangi because of the clothing he was wearing. The taser had a camera incorporated in it. The camera showed Mr Koloamatangi step into the camera's view, crouch slightly as if to steady himself, raise his gun to shoulder height, aim and fire it at Sergeant de Lorenzo. Mr Koloamatangi gave evidence in the sentence proceedings that he was affected by the taser, blinded, disoriented, unable to hear or think, for split seconds. Whether that was the initial effect, the taser camera footage shows that he had recovered sufficiently to deliberately take aim and fire at Sergeant de Lorenzo. His evidence to the contrary cannot be accepted. 

... 

Fortunately the shot missed Sergeant de Lorenzo. 

Sergeant de Lorenzo retreated and obtained a Glock pistol from another police officer. He fired a shot from the southern end of the bar which hit Mr Koloamatangi in the head. Mr Koloamatangi, Mr Lopeti and the hotel employee hostages had moved into the bottle shop. There were police outside the bottle shop window and police inside the hotel were calling for Mr Koloamatangi to surrender. 

Mr Koloamatangi moved into the corridor near the office. 

Mathew Edmonds, one of the hostages, was lying on the bottle shop floor and he saw Mr Koloamatangi's gun with the barrel projecting out from the wall close to the floor as if the butt of the gun was touching the floor. It was the Crown case that Mr Koloamatangi was lying in wait for Sergeant de Lorenzo, shielded by the wall. ... 

... 

The evidence of Sergeant de Lorenzo and Mathew Edmonds, the hostage witness, was that Sergeant de Lorenzo stepped into the doorway. He was thus visible to Mr Koloamatangi in the corridor. Sergeant de Lorenzo said Mr Koloamatangi fired his gun and he returned fire and I accept Sergeant de Lorenzo's evidence. The bullet fired by Mr Koloamatangi went through Sergeant de Lorenzo's shoulder and struck some objects in the bottle shop. Mathew Edmonds then took the opportunity to escape from the bottle shop. 

The jury found Mr Koloamatangi not guilty of the charge of wounding Sergeant de Lorenzo with intent to murder him. Consistent with that verdict and on the basis of the evidence available in the trial I do not find that Mr Koloamatangi lay in wait for Sergeant de Lorenzo, but I am satisfied that when he was lying in the corridor and Sergeant de Lorenzo stepped into the doorway and became visible to Mr Koloamatangi, Mr Koloamatangi shot at him, wounding him in the shoulder, to avoid him apprehending him, as he admitted by his plea. 

He had been told several times by police to surrender himself and had not done so. I accept that because he had already been shot, and because he later repeatedly told the police negotiator, that Mr Koloamatangi also feared for his own safety at the time he fired at and wounded Sergeant de Lorenzo to prevent him apprehending him. Sergeant de Lorenzo retreated. Mr Koloamatangi shut himself, Mr Robinson and Mr Lopeti in the office and held Mr Robinson at gunpoint for four hours. For part of that time Mr Koloamatangi and Mr Robinson spoke to a police negotiator by phone. Despite the police negotiator's assurances of his safety Mr Koloamatangi refused to surrender until about 10am. He was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds to his head, abdomen and leg. ..."" 

46These events gave rise to the following convictions and sentences: 





(1) 

Robbery armed with a dangerous weapon 

non-parole period - 5 years to date from 31 May 2011 with a balance of 2 years 


(2) 

Detain Mr Edmonds for advantage in company 

non-parole period - 3 years to date from 31 May 2012; balance of 2 years 


(3) 

Detain Mr Robinson for advantage in company 

non-parole period - 5 years to date from 31 May 2012, with a balance of 2 years 


(4) 

Wound with intent to prevent apprehension 

non-parole period - 6 years to date from 31 May 2013, with a balance of 2 years 


(5) 

Shoot at with intent to murder 

non-parole period - 6 years to date from 31 May 2014, with a balance of 4 years 

47The Director's challenge related specifically to the sentence for the last offence, which resulted from a jury verdict on a plea of not guilty. 

48The disparity between the sentence for detaining Mr Robinson and that for detaining Mr Edmonds appears to have been based on the fact that Mr Robinson was held for four hours at gunpoint, whilst Mr Edmonds escaped at an earlier point, although, as her Honour had noted in her reasons, the respondent ""could not take credit for Mr Edmonds' escape and therefore relatively early release"": Judgment, p 12. The other significant point in terms of a comparative assessment of the sentences flows from the guilty pleas entered in respect of each of the offences other than the shooting with intent to murder, for which pleas her Honour conferred a discount of 12.5%: Judgment, p 22. 

49In assessing the objective seriousness of the offence for which the respondent went on trial, her Honour noted that ""the factors to be considered include the gravity, skill and determination of the attempt, whether it was premeditated, the likelihood of death and any injuries inflicted"": Judgment, p 13. She stated (pp 13-14): 

""Mr Koloamatangi fired one shot at Sergeant de Lorenzo. It was a deliberately aimed shot, premeditated for a short time beforehand, in that Mr Koloamatangi moved to face Sergeant de Lorenzo, steadied himself, aimed and fired. It was not premeditated for some time beforehand, but was premeditated in reaction to Sergeant de Lorenzo firing the taser. Mr Koloamatangi did not persist beyond the one shot, at least at that time in the course of this offence. The skill of his attempt was low, in that he missed Sergeant de Lorenzo despite firing at him at close range. The weapon used had the ability to kill, but fortunately Sergeant de Lorenzo did not suffer any injury from this offence. 

Sergeant de Lorenzo was a police officer in the course of his duty attempting to defuse a serious situation involving hostages and a gun. He was unarmed. I accept Mr Koloamatangi's motivation for committing the offence was to attempt to prevent his capture, but that does not derogate from the jury's verdict that he had the intent to kill Sergeant de Lorenzo. Balancing all those factors, I assess this offence by Mr Koloamatangi as slightly below the mid range of seriousness for offences of this kind. Therefore, the standard non-parole period need not be imposed but it remains a reference point or guidepost."" 

50The Director's challenge to this sentence involves two elements, namely: first, whether her Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence was open to her and, secondly, what should have been the correct approach to the standard non-parole period of 10 years, specified in respect of this offence. 

51The respondent submitted that the Court must approach the characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence as a matter ""classically within the role of the sentencing judge"", with whose determination the Court should be ""very slow"" to interfere: Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] (Spigelman CJ, Simpson J agreeing ""most emphatically"" at [45] and [46]; Adams J to similar effect at [70]); Ayshow v R [2011] NSWCCA 240 at [38] (Johnson J, Bathurst CJ and James J agreeing); Leslie v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 203 at [43]-[44] (Hoeben J, McClellan CJ at CL and Howie J agreeing), following Spigelman CJ in Mulato . It may be that an appellate court's reluctance to interfere with such an assessment will be accentuated in circumstances where the trial judge, as in this case, has conducted a trial resulting in conviction and has thus had a more extensive opportunity to assess the nature of the offence than in circumstances where there has been a plea. Nevertheless, the appellate court retains a statutory responsibility under s 5D or s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act to intervene in circumstances where, upon an application of the correct principles, error is established: R v KB [2011] NSWCCA 190 at [53] (Bathurst CJ, Buddin and Harrison JJ agreeing). 

52The accepted principles are those identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505. As has been noted on other occasions, the principles in House refer to appellate interference with discretionary orders; nevertheless, similar principles are to be applied in relation to evaluative judgments such as that now in issue. 

53Each of ss 27-30 of the Crimes Act identifies a number of categories of attempts to murder; each carries a liability to imprisonment for 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The relevant mental element in s 29 is an intent to commit murder. Some circumstances may appear to bear higher moral responsibility than others, depending on the narrowness of the failure to kill or, viewed from the other point of view, the distance from achieving the intended effect. The moral turpitude of the offence may be reduced, as in the case of murder, by factors such as the mental state of the offender or the conduct of the victim, in each case falling short of providing a defence. What is less clear is why the gravity of the offence should be diminished by the incompetence of the offender. No doubt it is true that the offence was not premeditated in the sense that the intention to kill Sergeant de Lorenzo arose other than on the spur of the moment. However, that factor does not greatly diminish the moral quality of the act. The respondent had embarked on a criminal enterprise not merely by carrying a gun, but by carrying a gun which he had personally loaded on the way to the scene of the crime. It is possible that he did so with the intention of being able to fire a warning shot or wound any person providing resistance. Nevertheless, when the threat arose, he used the gun in a potentially lethal way, and with intent to kill, as the jury found. 

54It is also true that the shot was fired after Sergeant de Lorenzo had attempted to disable the respondent. It may well be that the respondent did not know at that time whether Sergeant de Lorenzo had a gun, but that can hardly diminish the severity of the response. Any attempt or threat of serious violence offered to police officers in the execution of their duties must place the offence at the higher end of the spectrum. This was not an offence which warranted the maximum penalty, nor anything near it. However, a sentence, the full term of which, equated with the standard non-parole period, was a manifestly inadequate response to the seriousness of the conduct. 

55The primary judge set out the personal circumstances of the offender with some care, identifying all the matters which could bear on factors in mitigation. It is not necessary to repeat the factors here. After setting out his personal history her Honour concluded (p 18): 

""No doubt his behaviour is connected with childhood experiences and the psychological consequences identified by Ms Hopkins [a psychologist], including aggression, impulsivity and anti-social personality traits, combined with his low intelligence."" 

56Her Honour continued: 

"" Mr Koloamatangi gave evidence that he has always relapsed into drug use when he was released from custody. He and Emma Barber, his former partner, gave evidence that when he was last released from custody before these offences, in 2008, he tried to find a job and housing, saw some mental health professionals, and tried to stay away from his old drug using and drug dealing friends. However, he ended up back with his old associates using drugs, despite Ms Barber's attempts to support him. She remains supportive of him, but says he has to get help for his drug and emotional problems. ... 

Given Mr Koloamatangi's life history, his diagnosed psychological issues and entrenched long-term substance abuse, it is difficult to make any positive forecasts about his prospects of rehabilitation. ... 

Mr Koloamatangi expressed remorse for the victims of all his offences, including Sergeant de Lorenzo, although he maintained his innocence of shooting [at] him with intent to murder him. Mr Koloamatangi is not the most articulate person, but I accept he feels genuine remorse, except where it is qualified in respect of Sergeant de Lorenzo."" 

57Viewing the offence in isolation, and taking into account all the matters identified above, including the standard non-parole period and the personal circumstances of the offender noted by the trial judge but not repeated here, a 10 year non-parole period should have been imposed. As this was, appropriately, the last of the sentences to commence, in accordance with the structured periods of partly accumulated and partly concurrent sentences, and absent the imposition of an aggregate sentence, which was not available in this case, the balance of term will be the effective sentence remaining after completion of the last of the non-parole periods. Subject to the question of totality, there would be no reason to find special circumstances in relation to this offence. The additional term should therefore be 3 years and 4 months and the total sentence 13 years and 4 months. 

Structure of sentences imposed 
58According to the sentences as structured by the trial judge, the respondent served the first two years of his imprisonment solely in relation to the Narwee offences, each of which ran concurrently with the other. There is a question as to whether the two sentences should have been entirely concurrent. There is a further question as to whether the increase in the sentences proposed above should result in a higher degree of accumulation. 

59The sentencing judge imposed sentences on Mr Raad with respect to his role in the Lakes Hotel enterprise entirely cumulative upon the two year non-parole period imposed on him by Judge Madgwick in respect of the Narwee offences. Given the greater role of the respondent in the Narwee offences, and the significantly greater sentence imposed upon him, it is inappropriate that each should serve the same period of time attributable solely to those offences. 

60The third year of mandatory custody imposed by the trial judge was attributable to both the Narwee offences and the armed robbery at the Lakes Hotel. The remaining four years of the armed robbery non-parole period were entirely cumulative with the sentences for detain in company. 

61Of the two detain in company sentences, each commenced on 31 May 2012, after three years served in respect of the other offences, the whole of the sentence in respect of Mr Edmonds was concurrent with the sentence with respect to Mr Robinson and all but one year of the sentence imposed in respect of detaining Mr Robinson was concurrent with the sentence imposed for wounding Sergeant de Lorenzo with intent to prevent lawful apprehension. 

62Finally, the six year non-parole period imposed for the shoot at with intent to murder, was accumulated as to one year only on the sentence for wounding with intent to prevent lawful apprehension. 

63Her Honour imposed sentences involving a total 31 years of mandatory custody, with an additional 16 years. Due to the degree of accumulation, the resultant period of imprisonment involved 11 years mandatory custody and four years by way of the additional term, giving a total sentence period of 15 years. The period of mandatory custody is therefore only one year more than the standard non-parole period for the final sentence, being the appropriate non-parole period for that offence. 

64The increase in the two offences requires a proportionate increase in the total period of mandatory custody. To increase the total period of mandatory custody by the full amount of the increased non-parole periods for the two offences would risk the imposition of a crushing sentence. In some circumstances it is appropriate to adjust the individual sentences to achieve a proper outcome, having regard to the principle of totality. To take that course in the present case, which would require a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44, would, on the other hand, tend to distort the sentences imposed for the individual offences, thus undermining in part the need to impose sentences properly reflective of the objective seriousness of the offences. The better course is to accept a higher degree of accumulation than might otherwise be warranted. 

65In the result, the non-parole period for the offence of shooting at Sergeant de Lorenzo with intent to murder should commence on 31 May 2013 and terminate on 30 May 2023. The total period of mandatory detention will then constitute 14 years with a balance of term of 3 years and 4 months. While the balance constitutes one-third of the last non-parole period to expire, it is slightly less than one-quarter of the total period of mandatory custody. Nevertheless, it is not an insignificant period and is appropriate in all the circumstances. 

Resentencing the respondent 
66To give effect to the foregoing reasons, the Court should make the following orders: 

(1) Allow the appeal of the Director of Public Prosecutions and set aside the sentences imposed on 23 May 2011 by Sweeney DCJ in the District Court on the respondent, Tevi Koloamatangi, in respect of the following offences: 

(a) aggravated break, enter and steal, committed at Narwee on 29 May 2009, and 

(b) shoot at Sergeant de Lorenzo with intent to murder, committed at the Lakes Hotel, Mascot on 31 May 2009. 

(2) In lieu thereof, resentence the offender as follows: 

(a) in respect of aggravated break, enter and steal at Narwee, set a non-parole period of 4 years 4 months commencing on 31 May 2009 and expiring on 30 September 2013, with an additional period of 17 months, commencing on 1 October 2013 and expiring on 28 February 2015; 

(b) in respect of the offence of shoot at Sergeant de Lorenzo with intent to murder, committed at the Lakes Hotel, Mascot, on 31 May 2009, set a non-parole of 10 years, to commence on 31 May 2013 and terminating on 30 May 2023, with an additional period of 3 years and 4 months, commencing on 31 May 2023 and terminating on 30 September 2026. 

(3) The offender is first eligible for release from custody on 30 May 2023.

68JOHNSON J : I agree with Basten JA.

		20 December 2011",2011-12-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758481,Aoun v R [2011] NSWCCA 284,"Judgment 

1BASTEN JA : The Applicant seeks leave to appeal in respect of sentences imposed for the offences of offering to supply 3.36 kilograms of ecstasy (in tablet form) and supplying a little under 1 kilogram of cocaine. Each sentence involved a non-parole period of seven years. He also sought leave to appeal against the totality of the period of imprisonment imposed for four offences, including the two separately challenged. 

2As explained by Johnson J, the Applicant has not made good his challenge to certain aspects of the fact-finding undertaken by the trial judge, nor has he made good his claim that the sentences imposed were outside an appropriate range. Although it is necessary to set out the factual background in some little detail to explain why this is so, I would have been minded to refuse leave to appeal. Leave being granted, I agree that the appeal should be dismissed. 

3With one minor qualification, I also agree with the reasons of Johnson J. The qualification relates to the circumstances in which this Court will interfere with fact-finding undertaken by a sentencing judge. 

4The statement by Hunt J in R v O'Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397 at 401 (set out at [34] below) was concerned with fact-finding by a trial judge in determining, on a voir dire, a dispute as to the admission of evidence. His Honour's succinct description of the nature of an error in respect of fact-finding is not to be treated as a comprehensive statement of the circumstances in which such error can arise. The scope of the appeal against conviction, provided by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) , s.6(1), is not limited to an error of law: any ground demonstrating that there has been a miscarriage of justice may suffice. The circumstances which can constitute such a ground are not to be constrained by the identification of common circumstances. Nor does it assist greatly to describe such grounds as forming ""the very narrow basis"" upon which the Court can intervene in relation to a finding of fact. Further, although it is undoubtedly helpful to be reminded that this Court can only intervene in a case of ""error"" and not in order to ""substitute its own findings for those of the trial judge"" , such timely reminders do not, in close cases, provide any useful criteria for locating the boundary between errors and differences of opinion. 

5The present case involved findings by way of inference drawn from a statement of facts, agreed between the parties. No relevant oral evidence was adduced. 

6On the basis of the conversation between the Applicant and the undercover operative, occurring in circumstances otherwise revealed by the agreed facts, the sentencing judge inferred, beyond reasonable doubt, that the Applicant had access to and was in a position to supply the ecstasy tablets which he had offered to supply. 

7It is not in doubt that such a finding was open to the trial judge. Nor was it in doubt that the trial judge fully understood that such a finding, being adverse to the interests of the offender, could only be made if the facts were established beyond reasonable doubt: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [27] (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ). His Honour used that language and, being an experienced trial judge, undoubtedly understood what was required. 

8At times the Applicant's submissions appeared to adopt the proposition that if an alternative reasonable inference were open, the finding could not stand. That statement, however, elides the distinction between the assessment made by the sentencing judge and that which might be made by this Court, if it were to form and act upon its own view of the agreed facts. If his Honour were not bound to accept the alternative inference, but was entitled to dismiss it as not raising a reasonable doubt in his mind, he was entitled to reach the impugned finding. The boundary between a difference of opinion and a finding of error may not be a bright line, but it involves a distinction which must be respected. 

9In the present case, the Applicant did not demonstrate that the conclusion reached by the sentencing judge was not reasonably open to him. The ground of appeal therefore failed. 

10In other respects I agree with the reasoning of Johnson J and, accordingly, with the orders proposed. 

11ADAMS J : I agree with Johnson J with the additional comment, in respect of Ground 3, that although the effective sentence imposed by Sides DCJ was, with respect, well towards the top of the discretionary range, I am unpersuaded that it was manifestly excessive. 

12JOHNSON J : Larren Aoun seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed at the Parramatta District Court on 23 November 2010 for a number of drug supply offences. 

13The Applicant adhered to pleas of guilty entered in the Local Court with respect to the following offences: 

(a) Sequence 2 - on 17 September 2009, supplying a prohibited drug (27.7 grams of cocaine) contrary to s.25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (""DMT Act"") (maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment with no standard non-parole period); 

(b) Sequence 4 - on 28 September 2009, offering to supply not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (3.36 kgs - 10,000 tablets of ecstasy) contrary to s.25(2) DMT Act (maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years); 

(c) Sequence 5 - on 9 October 2009, supplying not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (276.97 grams of cocaine) contrary to s.25(2) DMT Act (maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years); 

(d) Sequence 6 - on 21 October 2009, supplying not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (989.6 grams of cocaine) contrary to s.25(2) DMT Act (maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years). 

14In passing sentence on Sequence 6, the Applicant asked that the following offences be taken into account: 

(a) on 17 September 2009, supplying an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug (2.01 grams of 1-benzylpiperazine) contrary to s.25(1) DMT Act; 

(b) on 28 September 2009, supplying an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug (1.68 grams of ecstasy) contrary to s.25(1) DMT Act. 

15On 23 November 2010, his Honour Judge Sides QC imposed the following sentences: 

(a) Sequence 2 - non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 21 October 2009 and expiring on 20 October 2010, with a balance of term of six months commencing on 21 October 2010 and expiring on 20 April 2011; 

(b) Sequence 5 - non-parole period of two years and six months commencing on 21 January 2010 and expiring on 20 July 2012 with a balance of term of one year and three months commencing on 21 July 2012 and expiring on 20 October 2013; 

(c) Sequence 6 - taking into account the matters on the Form 1, a non-parole period of seven years to commence on 21 October 2011 and to expire on 20 October 2018 with a balance of term of three years and three months commencing on 21 October 2018 and expiring on 20 January 2023; 

(d) Sequence 4 - non-parole period of seven years commencing on 21 October 2012 and to expire on 20 October 2019 with a balance of term of five years to commence on 21 October 2019 and to expire on 20 October 2024. 

16For all the offences, the total effective sentence comprised a non-parole period of 10 years commencing on 21 October 2009 and expiring on 20 October 2019 with a balance of term of five years commencing on 21 October 2009 and expiring on 20 October 2024. 

Grounds of Appeal 

17By Notice of Appeal filed on 30 June 2011, amended on 8 November 2011, the Applicant notified the following grounds of appeal: 

(a) Ground 1 - in relation to Sequence 4, his Honour erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time of making the offer, the Applicant had access to and was in a position to actually supply the 10,000 ecstasy tablets. 

(b) Ground 2 - in relation to Sequence 4, his Honour erred in finding that the offence was towards the lower end of the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences under this provision. 

(c) Ground 2A - the sentence imposed in relation to Sequence 4 was manifestly excessive. 

(d) Ground 3 - the total aggregate sentence of 15 years and a non-parole period of 10 years for all the offences was manifestly excessive in the circumstances. 

(e) Ground 3A - the sentence imposed in relation to Sequence 6 was manifestly excessive. 

Facts of Offences 

18An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered on sentence. The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. In view of the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to set out the Agreed Statement of Facts: 

""1. The accused is a single male person who resides at xxx McArthur Street Guildford. 

2. In September 2009 investigators from the State Crime Command Drug Squad commenced investigations into the supply of 3, 4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) (also known as ecstasy) and cocaine by the accused person Larren AOUN and his associates within the Sydney metropolitan area. 

3. On 11 September 2009 the authority to conduct a Controlled Operation (CO 09/0255) was granted by Detective Acting Chief Superintendent SMITH authorising an Undercover Operative (UCO) to participate in conversations and negotiations concerning the supply of prohibited drugs and to purchase and possess prohibited drugs from the accused AOUN and or any of his associates. 

4. Between 14 September 2009 and 16 September 2009, the accused person AOUN and an Undercover Operative (UCO) commenced negotiations for the accused person AOUN to meet for the purposes of the accused AOUN supplying the UCO with prohibited drugs. 

5. About 4.45pm on 16 September 2009, the accused AOUN met the UCO in the McDonalds car park located on Canterbury Road Hurlstone Park. At this time the accused AOUN spoke to the UCO about his drug supply activities. The accused AOUN stated that the MDMA he sold was of a good quality and he never had any problems with it. The accused AOUN did not have any at this time but was awaiting a phone call to obtain the next lot of MDMA pills. The accused AOUN told the UCO the price of the pills would be between $8.50 and $8.75 each, although the price is negotiable. The UCO indicated he would require at least 5,000 pills each week and asked the accused AOUN if that was 'sweet'. The accused AOUN replied, 'Yeah'. The accused AOUN stated to the UCO that he would supply 10 pills as testers for free in order to check the quality that would be supplied. The accused AOUN stated, 'we don't charge for samples.' The accused AOUN and the UCO discussed when they could next meet. 

6. The accused AOUN questioned the UCO about being supplied 'Coke'. The accused AOUN stated he was able to source good quality cocaine 'straight off the block' in large quantities. The accused AOUN stated that the cost of the cocaine is $8,000 per ounce. The accused AOUN stated he could supply a tester of this cocaine for $300 and the quality was good. The accused AOUN stated he 'doesn't do business for one person and then they go' and he was in it 'as a long term thing'. 

7. The accused AOUN indicated to the UCO his ability to supply also the prohibited drug 1-benzylpiperazine. 

8. Later this date the accused AOUN contacted the UCO where he indicated he was able to supply the samples to him and requested to meet. Arrangements were then made for the UCO and the accused AOUN to meet on Thursday 17 September 2009. 

Sequence 1: Supply prohibited drug  > indictable quantity (2.01 grams of 1-benzyipiperazine) on 17 September 2009 
Form 1/Item 1 

9. At about 4:35pm the UCO contacted the accused AOUN and arrangements were made for the UCO and the accused AOUN to meet in Burwood. About 5pm on Thursday 17 September 2009, the UCO met with AOUN in the grounds of the Uniting Church located at 134 Burwood Road Burwood. During this meeting AOUN supplied the UCO with 6 tablets which he stated were 'Ecstasy'. Four (4) of these tablets were yellow in colour and had a star symbol stamped into one side and two (2) of the tablets were blue In colour with a Mercedes symbol stamped on one side. The two (2) blue coloured 'Mercedes Benz' stamped tablets were scientifically analysed, revealing they were 1-benzylpiperazine with a purity of 21.5% and a total weight of 0.67 grams. The four (4) yellow colour 'star' stamped tablets were analysed revealing they were 1-benzylpiperazine with a purity of 19% and a total weight of 1.34 grams. 

10. During this meeting the accused AOUN said he would be able to supply tablets to the UCO within 24 hours of an order being placed by the UCO. The UCO and the accused AOUN discussed the ability of AOUN to supply 40,000 tablets. The accused AOUN stated that he may be able to supply this amount 'but it depends how much they're pumping, but they're going like that, there's not only you ... there's a lot of people'. The accused AOUN stated that if the UCO was purchasing 40,000 tablets at a time, the price per tablet would be $8. Further to discussions between the UCO and the accused AOUN at the first meeting on 16 September 2009, the UCO enquired about purchasing cocaine from the accused AOUN. The accused AOUN offered to supply the UCO with 3 ounces of cocaine at $8000 per ounce. This price is consistent with the price offered by the accused AOUN at his first meeting with the UCO on 16 September 2009. The accused AOUN stated that the quality of the cocaine was very good and the cocaine was clean and had just 'come off the block'. The accused AOUN left a short time later and entered a silver Toyota Camry bearing NSW registration number SB-50-BE and left the location. 

Sequence 2: Supply prohibited drug > indictable quantity (27.7 grams of cocaine on 17 September 2009) 

11. About 6pm on Thursday 17 September 2009, the UCO contacted the accused AOUN and arrangements were made for AOUN to supply the UCO one (1) ounce of cocaine. About 7.50pm the accused AOUN met with the UCO in the car park area at the rear of Oporto's Restaurant at the corner of Addlestone Road and Merrylands Road, Merrylands. The accused AOUN entered the UCO vehicle where he supplied the UCO with a knotted, white coloured plastic bag containing a white powder substance which he stated was one ounce (28 grams) of cocaine. The UCO paid AOUN $8000 for this. The white powder was analysed revealing it was cocaine with a purity of 59% and a weight of 27.7 grams. 


12. Between Monday 21 September 2009 and Monday 28 September 2009, the UCO and the accused AOUN negotiated for the accused AOUN to supply the UCO with prohibited drugs. Arrangements were made for the accused AOUN and the UCO to meet within the McDonalds car park at Rosehill. 

Sequence 3: Supply prohibited drug > indictable quantity (1.68 grams of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine on 28 September 2009) Form 1/Item 2 

13. About 6.43pm on Monday 28 September 2009, the accused AOUN drove a silver Subaru WRX bearing NSW registration number BKS-78U into the car park area of the McDonalds located between Arthur Street and James Ruse Drive, Rosehill. The accused AOUN exited his vehicle and entered the UCO's vehicle. The accused AOUN entered into discussions with the UCO in relation to the supply of MDMA pills. The UCO enquired about the tablets supplied to him by the accused AOUN on 17 September 2009. The accused AOUN replied, 'They came from a, they're not from our source, they're from a guy that knew our sourc e but now look, we got these ones here.' The accused AOUN then handed the UCO five (5) black tablets with a '' symbol stamped on one side. The accused AOUN then said, 'It's drying up everywhere ... be happy with what you're going to get, like honestly, th ere's no more 'M' man, people are screaming for it, there's nothing around'! The UCO enquired what was in the tablets. The accused AOUN replied. 'MDMA, go pop 'em, go put 'em on a tester, do what you have to do ... they're good fuckin' pills, people love 'em, they're going crazy, they love 'em, they don't get smacked ... they want to feel humble. That's why we know how to do it with 'em.' The UCO then asked if the tablets provided were definitely MDMA and the accused AOUN responded 'Yeah ... whatever they tell me I tell you I'm not the one doing them. There's only 40,000 left, 30,000, about twenty's going now, another 20,000 that's all there is for now'. 

14. The five (5) black colour '' â‚¬ stamped tablets were analysed revealing they were 3,4-methylenedioxy amphetamine with a purity of 9% and a weight of 1.68 grams. 

Sequence 4: Supply prohibited drug (Offer to supply) > large commercial quantity (10,000 tablets/3,360 grams (approx) of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine pills on 28 September 2009) 

15. During the meeting on Monday 28 September 2009, between the accused AOUN and the UCO, the accused AOUN spoke in detail about his ability to supply large quanti ties of tablets. The accused AOUN offered to supply 10,000 of the black colour 'â‚¬ stamped tablets. The accused AOUN stated that there were 10,000 left which he could put aside for the UCO if he was happy with the quality of the pills given to him to test. The accused AOUN stated that if the UCO wanted to confirm the purchase of the 10,000 that he should send a text message to the accused AOUN stating 'Are you feeling better'. The accused AOUN stated that if the UCO did not get back to him on this night, that he would not hold them for the UCO. The accused AOUN stated that the cost of the 10,000 tablets would be $85,000 ($8.50 per tablet). The UCO did not contact the accused AOUN until the following day but by then the accused AOUN said he no longer had the pills. 

16. The average weight of the black colour â‚¬ stamped tablets supplied by the accused AOUN was 0.336 grams. The offer to supply the 10,000 of these tablets would give an estimated weight of 3.360grams. This weight is well in excess of the large co mmercial quantity. 

17. During this meeting the UCO spoke with the accused AOUN about the accused's ability to supply one (1) kilogram of cocaine for $260,000. (refer to Sequence 6 for further details of the offence). Between Tuesday 29 September 2009, and Friday 9 October 2009, the accused AOUN and the UCO negotiated the supply of ten (10) ounces of cocaine. 

Sequence 5: Supply prohibited drug =/> commercial quantity (276.97 grams of cocaine on 9 October 2009) 

18. About 4:00pm on 9 October 2009 the UCO met with the accused AOUN and an unknown male at the McDonalds car park located between Arthur Street and James Ruse Drive, Rosehill. The accused AOUN was driving a silver Subaru WRX bearing NSW registration number BKS-78U. The accused AOUN spoke with the UCO and requested the UCO travel to Alice Street, Rosehill. 

19. The accused AOUN exited his vehicle and entered the UCO vehicle. The accused AOUN handed the UCO ten separate small plastic bags containing a compressed white powder/rock-like substance which he indicated was ten (10) ounces of cocaine. The UCO paid AOUN $80,000 for this. 

20. The powder/rock was analysed revealing it to be cocaine with a purity of 70.5% and a weight of 276.97 grams. 

Sequence 6: Supply prohibited drug =/> commercial quantity (989.6 grams of cocaine on 20 October 2009) 

21. About 6.43pm on Monday 28 September 2009, the accused AOUN met the UCO in the car park area of the McDonalds located between Arthur Street and James Ruse Drive, Rosehill. The accused AOUN spoke with the UCO about his ability to supply one (1) kilogram of cocaine for $260,000. The accused AOUN indicated he would sell the UCO one (1) ounce of cocaine from the 1 kilogram block of cocaine and place the rest of the cocaine aside for the UCO. If the UCO was happy with the quality of the one (1) ounce of cocaine, he would then supply the remaining portion of the one kilogram of cocaine. At the conclusion of this meeting the accused AOUN entered vehicle BKS-78U and travelled to the car park of the Westfield Shopping Centre, Parramatta, 

22. On Monday 12 October 2009, the accused AOUN contacted the UCO and arrangements where made to meet at the 3one7 Cafe, located on Church Street, Parramatta. During this meeting the accused AOUN provided the UCO with a mobile telephone and SIM Card which the UCO was instructed to use to communicate with AOUN. The accused AOUN negotiated the supply of one (1) kilogram of cocaine with the UCO and stated he would only need one days notice to effect the transaction. The accused AOUN stated that he pays $250,000 for one kilogram of cocaine and sells it for $260,000. 

23. Between Monday 12 October 2009 and Monday 19 October 2009, negotiations continued in relation to meeting for the purpose of discussing how the supply of 1 kilogram of cocaine would take place from the accused AOUN to the UCO. The accused AOUN indicated that if all went well with the one kilogram supply of cocaine, he would be able to supply the UCO with one kilogram of cocaine per week. 

24. About 2.20pm on Monday 19 October 2009, the accused AOUN drove a silver coloured Subaru WRX bearing NSW registration number BKS-78U on Rider Boulevard, Rhodes and parked directly across the road from the Gloria Jeans Coffee Shop at that location. The accused AOUN met with the UCO at Gloria Jeans, 

25. During this meeting, the accused AOUN and the UCO discussed the purchase of 1 kilogram of cocaine for $260,000. The accused AOUN insisted that the UCO give him the $260,000 and that he would go away to obtain the cocaine and return a short time later. The accused AOUN requested to supply the UCO the cocaine in 10 or 12 ounce lots as he was unable to take a full kilogram from his supplier unless he paid for it up-front. Negotiations continued where the accused AOUN agreed to supply the UCO with the 1 kilogram of cocaine in two (2) x eighteen (18) ounce (approximately 500 + grams) lots. The accused AOUN stated that the cocaine would cost $130,000 for each 18 ounce amount. The accused AOUN requested that the UCO bundle the money into $ 10,000 amounts as it was easier for him. The accused AOUN and the UCO agreed to meet the following day for the purpose of the accused AOUN supplying the UCO with the cocaine. 

26. About 2.40pm on Tuesday 20 October 2009, the accused AOUN met with the UCO outside the Rhodes Shopping Centre. The accused AOUN entered into negotiations into the supply of the 1 kilogram of cocaine for $260,000. The accused AOUN and the UCO spoke in detail about how the accused AOUN wanted the supply to take place. The accused AOUN was shown $260,000 by the UCO and AOUN counted out $5,000 of this money and placed it aside. After some extensive negotiations the accused and the UCO travelled in the UCO's vehicle to George Street North Strathfield with the accused AOUN giving direction to this location. Whilst travelling to this location the accused AOUN and the UCO continued the negotiations for the supply of the cocaine. At George Street, the accused AOUN exited the UCO's vehicle and walked to a nearby cafe where he met with two unidentified males who appeared to be giving him certain instructions. The accused AOUN returned to the UCO's vehicle and continued negotiations with the UCO. The accused AOUN again left the UCO's vehicle and returned to the two unidentified males where he was seen to speak with them A short time later the accused AOUN returned to the UCO's vehicle where they again discussed the process for the supply of cocaine by the accused AOUN. At this time arrangements were unable to be made and the UCO and the accused AOUN travelled back to the Rhodes Shopping Centre area. The accused AOUN exited the UCO's vehicle and entered vehicle AFJ-67D a red colour Mitsubishi Mirage and drove from the location to his home at Guildford. 

27. About 8.30pm on Tuesday 20 October 2009, the accused AOUN met with the UCO in the car park of McDonalds, Hassall Street Rosehill. The accused AOUN was driving the red Mitsubishi Mirage AFJ-67D. The UCO was then requested by the accused AOUN to travel to a park in the Parramatta area. The UCO then followed the accused AOUN to George Street Parramatta where both the accused AOUN and the UCO exited their vehicles. The accused AOUN then walked the UCO to an area of the park where he introduced the UCO to an unknown male 'Sam'. 'Sam' then negotiated with the UCO for the supply by AOUN to the UCO and 'Sam' and the UCO then made arrangements for a set process to occur the following day in order for the supply to take place. At the conclusion of this meeting the UCO left the location. 

28. About 2.38pm on Wednesday 21 October 2009 the accused met with the UCO outside the Rhodes shopping centre on Rider Boulevard as previously arranged At this time further arrangements were made for the accused AOUN to bring his motor vehicle to the vicinity of the UCO. The accused AOUN walked to a silver Toyota Camry bearing registration SB-50-BE parked a short distance away. The accused AOUN parked vehicle SB-50-BE in the vicinity of the UCO vehicle. The UCO showed the accused AOUN the $260,000 before securing the money in vehicle SB-50-BE. 

29. The UCO then drove motor vehicle SB-50-BE from the location whilst the accused AOUN at this time was seated in the front passenger seat of the vehicle. The accused AOUN directed the UCO to 73 Victoria Street, Concord West. Whilst travelling to this location the accused AOUN and the UCO continued negotiations relating to the supply of the 1 kilogram of cocaine. At the location the accused AOUN exited the vehicle and walked behind a set of colourbond gates out of sight. A short time later the accused AOUN returned to vehicle SB-50-BE. The accused AOUN handed the UCO a blue and black coloured carry back with a large black zipper across the front. Inside this backpack was a clear plastic bag containing a compressed white powder substance believed to be cocaine. This was further wrapped in brown packaging tape. At this time the accused AOUN was arrested whilst standing at the passenger side of vehicle SB-50-BE. 

30. The accused AOUN was conveyed to the Campsie Police Station where he was introduced to the custody manager. The accused AOUN was given his Part 9 and interview R0112945 was conducted. The accused refused to answer any questions put to him by investigators. 

31. The weight of the cocaine supplied by the accused AOUN to the UCO was 989.6 grams with a purity of 64.5%, 

32. On 21 October 2009 a search warrant was executed at the home of the accused where no money, drugs or other indicia of supply were seized. 

33. The accused was charged with the matters now before the Court. 

34. On 20 October 2010, a co-offender Nicholas SAAD was arrested. He was charged with supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine which relates to the supply of 989.6 grams of cocaine by the accused AOUN. Investigating police allege that Nicholas SAAD was one of the unidentified men with whom the offender met on 20 October 2009 and who appeared to be giving him instructions and that he is also the person identified as 'Sam' who met with the UCO in the park at Parramatta on 20 October 2009 and negotiated with the UCO. 

35. On 26 October 2010, a co-offender Anthony TRIOLO was arrested. He was charged with supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine which relates to the supply of 989.6 grams of cocaine by the accused AOUN. Investigating police allege that Anthony TRILO was one of the unidentified men with whom the offender met on 20 October 2009 and who appeared to be giving him instructions."" 

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances 

19The Applicant was 27 years' old at the time of the offences and 28 years at the time of sentence. 

20The sentencing Judge summarised the Applicant's subjective circumstances in the following way, in a manner which is not challenged in this Court (ROS10-13): 

""The Offender was a good student at primary school and was vice captain in his final year. However, because of bullying at high school, he did not enjoy those years as much but compensated by excelling in athletics and rugby league. Nevertheless, at times he feigned illness to avoid going to school. His academic results declined. He felt too embarrassed to reveal the bullying to anyone. He walked away from his tormentors and did not fight back. The Court notes that his two older brothers apparently attended a different high school. The bullying left him with heightened levels of vigilance and wariness. 

Towards the end of 2003 one of his brothers was imprisoned. By this time the eldest brother was living independently with his wife and children and greater responsibilities fell on the Offender at home including care for his mother who is unwell. According to the evidence the Offender funded his brother's trial and borrowed money for the appeal. The material tendered this morning indicates that he borrowed just over $100,000 on 19 September 2006. It was apparently secured by a mortgage over the home where he lived in Guildford and his mother was surety. The loan is over about 30 years. Monthly repayments for the first three years was $673 and thereafter $688. These obligations clearly added to his stress. 

He told Sam Borenstein [psychologist] about symptoms of depression such as worry, variable motivation, sleep disturbance and a degree of agitation. He saw his general practitioner who told him that it was just stress and made no referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist. 

The Offender started at TAFE after finishing school but did not complete his apprenticeship because of financial pressures apparently relating to his brother's need to have his representation funded. He worked as a carpenter until his arrest, although he does not have a trade certificate. The evidence disclosed that he possessed skills in the field and was well regarded by his employer. His employer at the time of his arrest remains supportive of the Offender and has kept in contact with his family. Clearly the Offender has a sound work ethic and would have no trouble securing employment in the future. 

The Offender played rugby league in the SG Ball Cup competition, a competition for players under eighteen. Later, he played in the Jersey Flegg Competition, a competition conducted in the New South Wales by the NRL for those under 20. These competitions are the nursery for clubs that play in the National Rugby League competition. The Offender had ambitions playing in that competition as a professional player, which had the potential to provide a handsome income. He had to forego those ambitions after his brother's imprisonment and the disappointment that ensued added to his emotional problems. However, he continued to play A-Grade football in a team participating in a competition in Sydney's inner west. He also trained children playing in the junior grades. 

The Offender told Sam Borenstein that the commencement of his drug usage coincided with his brother's arrest. As reported at page 3 of Sam Borenstein's report [exhibit 1] he was 19 at the time. However, earlier in the report it is said to have been 2003 when the Offender would have been 21. Apart from indicating that he is not an accurate historian nothing turns on the difference. The same applies to his belief concerning his age when his father died. 
In the ensuing years he abused drugs, mainly cocaine and liquor, on his own and in a social context. He told Mr Bornstein that he was still grieving the loss of his father as well as the loss of his potential professional football career and his substance abuse was a way of dealing with increasing depression. He said that he ran up debts in the tune of about $20,000 with his drug suppliers which he had to clear. However, he made clear that he had not been the subject of any threats in that regard. The Court notes that the Offender did not give evidence and was still working and playing football at the time of his arrest. However, members of his extended family observed symptoms consistent with drug usage. 

The Offender told Mr Borenstein that his moods vacillated between depression and anger and that the anger management course he completed whilst in custody had helped a bit. He has also done a drug and alcohol program in gaol and appreciates the need to undertake further psychological therapy. He also appreciates that he needs to confront his emotional problems and that he cannot hide them behind drugs and/or liquor. 

The Court notes that the Offender's eldest brother and his wife have separated and the eldest brother now lives with their mother. The other brother is serving a prison sentence. 

His background and personality indicate that he is an individual who is likely to have an elevation in acting out, suggesting behavioural problems including impulsivity and sensation seeking. He is withdrawn, indicating social detachment and discomfort in close relationships. He has an elevation in suicidal thinking and alienation as well as heightened vigilance and weariness. 

As the Offender's only prior convictions are for relatively minor matters in 2000 and 2001 the Court extended the benefit of prior good character. The Court notes in this context his work ethic, generosity and being well-regarded by responsible members of the community. He has not breached any prison rules."" 

Ground 1 - Suggested Error in Findings Concerning Offer to Supply Offence in Sequence 4 

Ground 2 - Suggested Error in Finding of Objective Seriousness for Sequence 4 Offence 

21These grounds of appeal were argued together and it is appropriate that the Court consider them together. 

Submissions 

22Mr Strickland SC, for the Applicant, submitted that it was not open to the sentencing Judge to make a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant had access to, and was in a position to actually supply, the 10,000 ecstasy tablets relevant to Sequence 4. Mr Strickland SC submitted that there were two key facts which were overlooked or given insufficient weight by the sentencing Judge. First, during the entire period of his criminal offending, the Applicant never supplied large quantities of ecstasy tablets to the UCO. He submitted that this was cogent evidence of the Applicant's inability to access the quantities of that drug that he stated he could access. Secondly, it was submitted that the Applicant told the UCO several times that, in the then current market for ecstasy tablets (at least in relation to his suppliers), there was a severe shortage of supply of those tablets, and that demand for ecstasy tablets significantly outstripped supply. 

23It was submitted for the Applicant that the evidence did not support a finding beyond reasonable doubt, that when the Applicant offered 10,000 to the UCO, he was in a position to actually supply the 10,000 ecstasy tablets. 

24Mr Strickland SC submitted that the Court could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant's offer was not a ""salesman's pitch"" . He submitted that it was not reasonably open to make the challenged finding beyond reasonable doubt, as there was another reasonable hypothesis (T19, 11 November 2011). 

25Mr Strickland SC submitted that Ground 2 would be made out if the Court upheld Ground 1. If the Court could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant had the capacity to supply 10,000 tablets, he submitted that the objective seriousness of the offence would fall to the lower end of the range because, if he did not have that capacity, there was no potential for 10,000 tablets to be distributed to the wider community as a result of the Applicant's crime. It was submitted that the offence clearly did not cause any actual harm to the community because the supply never materialised. 

26Mr Strickland SC submitted that the actual or potential consequence of an offender's criminal conduct is critical in assessing the objective seriousness of a large range of crimes, including crimes of personal violence, offences of dishonesty and fraud and that this was also true in relation to offences of supplying prohibited drugs. Reference was made to the decisions of this Court in Fahs v R [2007] NSWCCA 26 and R v Gao; R v Lim [2007] NSWCCA 343 at [22], [30] concerning the relevance to an assessment of objective seriousness, if drugs would not have found their way into the community. 

27The Crown submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge to make the finding presently under challenge. 

28The Crown submitted that, had the Applicant given evidence to the effect that he did not have access to the number of tablets he had promised the UCO on 28 September 2009 and if such evidence was not challenged, the sentencing Judge may have been more amenable to a submission that it was mere ""puffery"" on the part of the Applicant. However, the Applicant did not give evidence. The evidence upon which his Honour relied was the Agreed Statement of Facts as set out above. 

29The Crown submitted that this Court is bound by findings of fact of the sentencing Judge unless they were not open on the evidence or unless error is shown in the sense referred to in House v King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. 

30With respect to the two topics which the Applicant submitted the sentencing Judge had overlooked, the Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had taken them into account. 

31Concerning Ground 2, the Crown pointed to the finding that the Sequence 4 offence lay towards the lower end of the middle of the range of objective seriousness. It was submitted that the sentencing Judge had taken into account that, if the 10,000 had been actually supplied, they could not have been consumed by anyone given that the supply would have been to the UCO (ROS19). The Crown noted that the sentencing Judge had applied R v Gao; R v Lim and concluded that the fact that there would have been no supply to the community ""resulted in a very minor diminution in culpability"" (ROS15). 

32The Crown submitted that error had not been demonstrated in accordance with Grounds 1 or 2. 

Decision 

33Ground 1 seeks to challenge a finding made by the sentencing Judge. This Court is a court of error. The jurisdiction of the Court to interfere with a sentencing decision is exercisable only where there can be seen to have been an error of principle, or some other mistake of fact or law: R v Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 108. 

34It is important to keep in mind the limits of the jurisdiction of this Court where a finding of a first-instance Judge is challenged on appeal. A frequently cited and applied statement of principle is that of Hunt J (Carruthers and Wood JJ agreeing) in R v O'Donoghue at 401: 

""It is important to emphasise that, unlike appeals to the Court of Appeal in civil cases, an appeal to this court is not by way of re-hearing. An appeal which is not by way of re-hearing is no more than the right to have a superior court interpose to redress the error of the court below: A-G v Sillem (1864) 10 HLC 704 at 724; 11 ER 1200 at 1209; Victorian Stevedoring & General Contracting Co Pty Ltd v Dignan (1931) 46 CLR 73 at 109. Error may be demonstrated if there is no evidence to support a particular finding, or if the evidence is all one way, or if the judge has misdirected himself. But this court has no power to substitute its own findings for those of the trial judge. The members of this court may individually disagree with the findings which were made, but the court cannot for that reason interfere with those findings. It is only where the very narrow basis upon which this court can intervene in relation to a trial judge's findings of fact has been established that the conviction can be set aside, and then only if the error has led to a miscarriage of justice: see Regina v Merritt & Roso (1985) 19 A Crim R 360 at 372-373; Regina v Kyriakou (1987) 29 A Crim R 50 at 60-61."" 

35This statement has been applied in a multitude of cases, including sentence appeals where a finding of fact is challenged on appeal: R v Khouzame [2000] NSWCCA 505 at [38]-[41]; R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; 59 NSWLR 557 at 573 [60]-[61]; Kardoulias v R [2005] NSWCCA 456; 159 A Crim R 252 at 265 [56]; Camm v R [2009] NSWCCA 141 at [68]-[70]; SBF v R [2009] NSWCCA 231; 198 A Crim R 219 at 335 [75]. 

36I approach this ground of appeal with these principles in mind. 

37It is helpful to place the challenged findings in the broader context of findings made by the sentencing Judge concerning the Applicant's course of criminal conduct. His Honour said (ROS14): 

""He told Sam Borenstein that he came under pressure from the undercover officer. The Offender did not give evidence and the evidence placed before the Court does not support this claim. The Court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the offences were premeditated and that he appreciated by his participation in them he was enmeshing himself in organised criminal activity. None of the four offences are an isolated aberration. It is clear that the Offender was involved in drug trafficking at a wholesale level to a substantial degree and for financial reward. The four offences cover a period slightly in excess of a month. It is clear that his illegal activities were not limited to his dealings with the undercover officer."" 

38Soon after, his Honour found (ROS15): 

""In this illicit trade those operating within the upper rungs of the hierarchy tend to hide behind the activities of others, such as the Offender, to avoid detection and punishment. Clearly, he had the authority from those above him in the hierarchy to negotiate with purchasers in terms of price and they trusted him with large quantities of money and valuable drugs. During his conversations with the undercover officer he demonstrated a sound knowledge of the trade at a wholesale level as well as skills as a salesman. 

Clearly he did not know he was dealing with an undercover officer and that the drugs he sold or offered to sell would not be consumed. Consistent with authority this factor resulted in a very minor diminution in culpability: R v. Gao and Lim [2007] NSWCCA 343. He obviously expected that they would be consumed and had no idea who those consumers would be and whether any of them were vulnerable."" 

39His Honour then turned to make findings concerning the Sequence 4 offence (ROS17-18): 

""The offence Sequence 4 involves an offer to supply, which, in contractual terms, occurs before there is an agreement to supply. As is made clear by the definitions of 'supply', 'sell' and 'take part', s 25 covers a wide range of criminality. Consistent with the legislation the cases make clear that the criminality is determined by the facts of each case rather than characterising an agreement or an offer to supply as being less serious than an actual supply: R v Vu [2006] NSWCCA 188 at paragraphs 81 to 88; R v McKibben [2007] NSWCCA 89 at paragraph 16. 

At paragraph 89 in Vu , Hall J, with whom James and Buddin JJ agreed, said 'in terms of offering to supply factors which will often be relevant in determining the objective seriousness of an offence under subs 25(2) of the Act will include: 

Â· The terms of the offer, in particular, as to the quantity of a drug, its price, etc. 

Â· Whether a particular offer is an isolated one or whether it occurs in the context of an ongoing supply of drugs. 

Â· Whether, and if so, the extent to which the offer is motivated by reasons of commercial gain or greed. 

Â· Whether the offeror at all material times had the intention to fulfil the offer. 

Â· Whether the offeror had the capacity to fulfil the offer to supply. 

Â· Whether the offeror attempts to fulfil the offer. If not, whether any failure to perform was the result of a decision by the person concerned not to supply or whether it was due to some intervening or extraneous circumstance.' 

The Court notes the large commercial quantity for ecstasy is 500 grams. The weight that the Offender offered to supply, calculated on the basis of the sample, was a little over 6.7 times that quantity. The purchase price mentioned in connection with this offer was $85,000. The Court notes at 9%, the purity of ecstasy within the sample tablets with the Euro symbol was quite low. The Court is satisfied that the offer related to 10,000 tablets like those in the sample supplied to the undercover officer on 28 September."" 

40The sentencing Judge then made findings which are challenged in the first ground of appeal (ROS19-20): 

""Mr Hamill SC on the Offender's behalf pointed out the Offender never delivered the 10,000 ecstasy tablets, the subject of this offer and negotiations were little more than puffery. However, the evidence discloses that the Offender made clear that he had a limited amount of ecstasy tablets available and that the market forces meant that they would not be available for long. He clearly stated that the offer remained on the table until only that night. The offence was complete when he made the offer. The ecstasy did not pass to the undercover officer because he did not indicate an acceptance of the offer by the stipulated time. The Court notes that if actually supplied the 10,000 tablets could not have been consumed by anyone. 

The Offender chose not to give evidence. He sold cocaine to the undercover officer before and twice after this, the latter two involving substantial quantities and the evidence discloses the sales of drugs to others. On 16 September he told the undercover officer that the ecstasy he sold was of good quality and spoke of waiting for a telephone call to obtain the next lot of ecstasy pills. On that day he also mentioned the price range that he charged. He said: 'we don't charge for samples' and did not hesitate in indicating that he could supply the 5,000 ecstasy tablets per week that the undercover officer said he needed. On the following day he supplied the undercover officer with six tablets indicting they were ecstasy but they, in fact, contained a different drug. He said that he could supply them within 24 hours and he discussed supplying 40,000 tablets but indicated that the amount: 'depends on how much they're pumping, but they're going like that, there's not only you....there's lots of people', which, in the Court's view, indicates that he was supplying to others and that the demand was high. On 18 September he supplied a sample of five ecstasy pills with the Euro symbol on them that he said came from another source and indicated that the source was drying up and people were screaming for them. 

The Offender did not give evidence. There is no credible evidence that he did not intend to supply the undercover officer with the 10,000 ecstasy tablets with the Euro symbol on them that were the subject of the offer. This offer was part of his activities as a wholesaler of illicit drugs. Having considered all the circumstances the Court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time of making the offer, the Offender had access to and was in a position to actually supply the 10,000 tablets and that by the time the undercover officer contacted him the next day they were not available to sell to the undercover officer because the Offender or someone else had sold them to another purchaser. However, there is no evidence that the Offender actually sold them to that other purchaser. There is no evidence that the Offender voluntarily withdrew the offer for any reason or decided against pursuing it and there is no evidence that he made the Offender [sic - offer] to impress the undercover [officer] or as part of a salesman's hype."" 

41There is a broad definition of ""supply"" in s.3(1) DMT Act: 

"" supply includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things."" 

42The definition of supply includes ""sell"" , and that term is also defined widely in s.3(1) DMT Act: 

"" sell includes sell whether by wholesale or retail and barter and exchange, and also includes dealing in, agreeing to sell, or offering or exposing for sale, or keeping or having in possession for sale, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for sale or on sale, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things."" 

43The offence charged in Sequence 4 is an offence under s.25(2) DMT Act of supplying an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug. The broad definition of ""supply"" in s.3(1) of the Act means that the offence is defined to include a comparatively wide range of circumstances, some of them overlapping. When an offence is defined to include any of several categories of conduct, the gravity of the conduct in a particular case depends on the facts of the case: Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; 163 CLR 447 at 452; R v Dinh [2010] NSWCCA 74; 199 A Crim R 573 at 582 [46]. 

44The charge under Sequence 4 to which the Applicant pleaded guilty was based upon an offer to supply. The relevant intention that must be proved where there is a charge of supply involving an offer to supply is the intention inherent in the making of the offer. It must be a genuine offer made with the intention that it be regarded as genuine by the offeree. The intention required to bring conduct within this part of the definition does not involve any intention of ultimate supply - the intention is bound up with the making of the offer itself: R v Dendic; R v Mazzeo (1987) 34 A Crim R 40 at 45; R v Addison (1993) 70 A Crim R 213 at 217; R v Swan [2003] NSWCCA 318; 140 A Crim R 243 at 246-247 [12]-[18]. 

45A prosecution for supply based upon an offer for supply does not, of course, involve an actual supply. Nor does it involve an offender who has a prohibited drug in possession for supply, a different form of supply contained within the extended definition in s.3(1) DMT Act. 

46The approach to sentencing for offer to supply offences has been considered in a number of decisions of this Court. An early decision was that of R v Kalpaxis [2001] NSWCCA 119; 122 A Crim R 320, where an offender offered to supply a large commercial quantity of cocaine to a purchaser without any means or intention of doing so. The decision in R v Kalpaxis has been described as ""exceptional and extraordinary"" since, from beginning to end, it involved nothing more than a ruse by a mentally disturbed offender, who was out of touch with reality, and who was seeking to obtain sufficient money to enable him to spend time in Greece with his family and with his father who was dying of cancer. The exceptional and extraordinary circumstances in R v Kalpaxis have been emphasised in later decisions: R v Smith [2002] NSWCCA 378 at [16]; R v Yaghi [2002] NSWCCA 396; 133 A Crim R 490 at 492-494 [11]-[22]. 

47The more typical offer to supply case involves an offer made to an undercover police officer or to a third person, in circumstances where the relevant conversation is recorded by way of telephone intercept or surveillance device. If there is an offer to supply a large commercial quantity of the nominated prohibited drug, then the offender is guilty of that offence. It is not necessary for the prosecution to prove more than the elements of the offence of offer to supply. An offender's plea of guilty to a charge of offer to supply admits the elements of that offence. 

48It is appropriate for a sentencing court to have regard to the potential consequences intended by an offender who is to be sentenced for a drug supply offence based upon an offer to supply. This Court has observed that there is no reason in principle why a genuine agreement to supply drugs should be regarded as any less serious than a proven act of supply: R v Smith at [16]. 

49In the course of a helpful analysis concerning the approach to sentence for offer to supply offences, Hall J (James and Buddin JJ agreeing) said in Vu v R [2006] NSWCCA 188 at [88]: 

""88 There will usually be a varying degree of objective seriousness between one or other of the activities that fall within the statutory definition of supply, but this, as reflected in the judgment of Bell, J., depends, not upon any general concept of a hierarchy of seriousness attaching to one or other of the activities that may constitute a 'supply' as defined in s.3, but upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Plainly, agreements to supply or offers to supply prohibited drugs each constitute transactional activities that play an important and essential role in the chain of drug trafficking."" 

50Hall J proceeded at [89] to recite the factors referred to by the sentencing Judge in the extract from the remarks on sentence at [39] above. 

51The decision in Vu v R has been applied by this Court in circumstances where a submission similar to that contained in the Applicant's Ground 1 was advanced on appeal. In McKibben v R [2007] NSWCCA 89, Howie J (Simpson and Hislop JJ agreeing) said at [16] (emphasis added): 

""It was further submitted that it was erroneous that the penalty for the agreement to supply was greater than the actual supply. I do not believe there is anything inconsistent or erroneous in that approach. As was explained in Vu v R [2006] NSWCCA 188, the seriousness of any particular activity falling within the concept of 'supply' under the Act will depend upon the particular facts of the case before the court and no generalised statement can be made about the relative seriousness of differing forms of supply. There is no suggestion here, as there was in 1985, that the applicant had no intention of supplying that quantity of the drug. In the absence of evidence from the applicant, the facts should be taken at their face value and that she intended to supply that amount of drug but was denied the opportunity of doing so before her arrest. It was open to the Judge to sentence as he did. This ground is not made out ."" 

52In R v Choi [2010] NSWCCA 318, a challenge was made on a Crown appeal to a finding by the sentencing Judge that the respondent could not realistically have obtained the drugs for the purpose of a proposed transaction with an undercover police operative. The respondent had given evidence that an unnamed person, from whom he was endeavouring to source drugs, was a person he had met by chance in a nightclub and, according to the respondent, that person had said to him that if ever he needed any help with drugs he should come to him. The sentencing Judge found that the drugs did not exist and could not realistically have been obtained by the respondent. This Court overturned that finding. Reference was made to evidence of conversations which did not indicate that the drugs could not be acquired at all, but simply that they could not be acquired by a particular time. RA Hulme J (Giles JA and Hislop J agreeing) said at [63]-[64] (emphasis added): 

""63 It is important to bear in mind that the criminality inherent in the offence to which the respondent pleaded guilty was an agreement to supply, not the fulfilment of such an agreement. The agreed facts disclosed that he entered into such an agreement without hesitation in the very first conversation with Kwon on 19 November. He continually reaffirmed his participation in such an agreement over the ensuing nine days. He approached three different people in his endeavour to acquire a substantial quantity of drugs in order to fulfil the agreement. The evidence disclosed that the first contact indicated a preparedness to provide the drugs, but was unable to do so within a short timeframe. There was no evidence of any inability of the second and third contacts to fulfil at least a significant proportion of the order . 

64 In my view, and with respect, the findings by the sentencing judge that the respondent and Kwon were not able to effect this size of supply, that the drugs did not exist, and that they could not realistically have been obtained by the respondent, were findings which were not open. The genuineness of the respondent's endeavours to fulfil his agreement is indicated by his obtaining and providing the sample tablets . It follows that the description of the respondent's role as 'youthful fantasy' cannot be sustained."" 

53These statements from other cases provide a framework of principle in which the issue raised by the first ground of appeal is to be considered. 

54In my view, it was open to the sentencing Judge to make the challenged finding. It is necessary to keep in mind that this offence lay within a series of events in which the Applicant offered to, and actually supplied, prohibited drugs. As the sentencing Judge found, the Applicant was involved in drug trafficking at a wholesale level to a substantial degree and for financial reward, and he demonstrated a sound knowledge of the trade at a wholesale level as well as skills as a salesman. 

55The Applicant was 27 years' old at the time of the offences. He was actually involved in the supply of prohibited drugs and demonstrated a capacity to hand over prohibited drugs as part of that process. There was no element of fantasy or delusion (as in R v Kalpaxis ) in this case. The Applicant was engaged actively in the real and hard world of drug supply. 

56The Applicant supplied a sample of ecstasy to the UCO in the early evening of 28 September 2009, as part of a discussion about a larger supply in a climate of some demand for the product (paragraph 13 of Agreed Statement of Facts at [18] above). The facts relied upon directly in support of the offence in Sequence 4 are contained in paragraph 15 of the Agreed Statement of Facts. The Applicant offered to supply 10,000 ecstasy tablets to the UCO, making clear that there was a limited window of opportunity for that to happen. A price was indicated and a coded message proposed by the Applicant if the UCO was to take up the offer. The UCO did not contact the Applicant within the specified time and the Applicant said that he no longer had the tablets. 

57It is important to observe that the Applicant was not arrested until 21 October 2009. It may be taken that he had direct knowledge of what occurred on and after he made the offer to supply 10,000 ecstasy tablets on 28 September 2009. He did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. To make this observation is not, in some way, to cast an onus of proof upon the Applicant. Rather, it is to make the point referred to by Howie J in McKibben v R at [16] (cited at [51] above). 

58In the absence of evidence from the Applicant, the facts should be taken at face value - that he intended to supply 10,000 ecstasy tablets which were available in the timeframe prescribed by him, but that he could not later do so in circumstances where the UCO sought the supply outside that timeframe. Indeed, the fact that the offer was made in the context of a short timeframe, supports the view that there was a realistic prospect of 10,000 ecstasy tablets being supplied by the Applicant to the UCO within the specified timeframe. The provision of a sample of ecstasy tablets in the context of the making of the offer, supports the practical reality of the Applicant's offer to supply. 

59The sentencing Judge had regard to relevant evidence in making the findings presently under challenge. This was not a case like R v Choi where the offender gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. It was entirely open to the sentencing Judge to be satisfied that, at the time of making the offer, the Applicant had access to and was in a position to actually supply the 10,000 tablets, but that they were not available to sell at the time when the UCO sought them after the nominated deadline had passed. 

60In my view, the first ground of appeal ought be rejected. 

61The rejection of the first ground of appeal narrows substantially the submissions upon which the Applicant can rely in support of Ground 2. 

62The sentencing hearing proceeded upon the accepted basis that the offer to supply 10,000 ecstasy tablets was related in weight and purity to the sample ecstasy tablets, producing an estimated weight of 3.36 kgs and a purity of 9%. 

63His Honour had regard to purity as a factor relevant to an assessment of objective gravity: R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78; 152 A Crim R 462 at 472 [56]; Paxton v R [2011] NSWCCA 242 at [129], [141]. Further, the fact that the ecstasy was offered to be supplied in tablet form was relevant. It may be taken that ecstasy in tablet form is ordinarily designed for supply in that form to end users without further processing, so that the issue of purity is of less importance in such a case: Ayshow v R [2011] NSWCCA 240 at [43]. 

64The sentencing Judge undertook a careful assessment of the objective gravity of the Sequence 4 offence, referring to R v Vu and McKibben v R as part of that process. 

65His Honour took into account the submission that, even if supplied, the ecstasy would never have reached the drug-using public as the supply was to be made to police as part of an undercover operation. The sentencing Judge observed that this factor resulted in a very minor diminution in culpability, a conclusion supported by decisions of this Court considered in R v Achurch [2011] NSWCCA 186 at [88]-[100]. 

66In my view, no error has been demonstrated in the sentencing Judge's finding that the Sequence 4 offence lay towards a lower end of the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of that type. 

67I would reject Ground 2. 

Ground 2A - The Sentence Imposed in Relation to Sequence 4 Was Manifestly Excessive 

68Mr Strickland SC repeated the submissions made in support of Grounds 1 and 2 with respect to Ground 2A, the claim of manifest excess. 

69To establish a ground claiming manifest excess, it is necessary for the Applicant to demonstrate that the sentence under challenge is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-372 [27]. 

70The sentence imposed for the Sequence 4 offence comprised a non-parole period of seven years with a balance of term of five years. This sentence, of course, was one of several overlapping sentences imposed upon the Applicant for a series of serious drug supply offences. 

71The large commercial quantity for ecstasy is 500 grams. Upon the agreed basis of calculation referrable to the sample, the Applicant offered to supply 3.36 kgs (a little over 6.7 times the large commercial quantity). The nominated purchase price was $85,000.00, with the drug having what his Honour described as the quite low purity of 9%. 

72In light of the findings made concerning this offence, which were open to the sentencing Judge, and the finding of objective gravity which was open, a very substantial period of imprisonment was necessary for this offence. The standard non-parole period of 15 years was and remains a ""legislative guidepost"" which the sentencing Judge and this Court must take into account: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154 at 1162 [27]. 

73His Honour gave due weight to the Applicant's subjective circumstances. 

74It has not been demonstrated that the sentence imposed for the Sequence 4 offence was unreasonably or plainly unjust. The claim of manifest excess ought be rejected. 

75I would reject Ground 2A. 

Ground 3A - The Sentence Imposed in Relation to the Sequence 6 Offence Was Manifestly Excessive 

76It is appropriate to consider this discrete ground of appeal before returning to Ground 3 which challenges the aggregate sentence upon the ground of manifest excess. 

Submissions 

77Mr Strickland SC submitted that a sentence comprising a non-parole period of seven years and a balance of term of four years and three months for the Sequence 6 offence was manifestly excessive. 

78He referred to the facts of that offence and sought to support the submission by reference to other sentencing decisions, although acknowledging that the cases upon which he relied did not establish a range (T13, 11 November 2011). 

79Reference was made to a number of sentencing decisions including Fahs v R , R v Kazzi [2008] NSWCCA 77, Coetzee v R [2007] NSWCCA 12, R v Taouk [2005] NSWCCA 53 and Buttrose v R [2011] NSWCCA 35. It was submitted for the Applicant that an examination of these cases, although not establishing a range of sentence, would assist a conclusion that the sentence imposed in this case for the Sequence 6 offence was manifestly excessive. 

80The Crown pointed to the serious nature of the Sequence 6 offence and the fact that offences were taken into account on a Form 1 in passing sentence for this offence. The Crown also urged caution in considering a ground alleging manifest excess by reference to a comparison with other sentencing decisions, citing Stock v R [2011] NSWCCA 49; 206 A Crim R 574 at 587-588 [48]. 
 
Decision 

81The Applicant does not challenge the finding of the sentencing Judge that the Sequence 6 offence lay somewhat above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences under that provision (ROS17). This offence involved the supply of 989.6 grams of cocaine, just 10.4 grams short of the large commercial quantity for this drug. It was almost 6.96 times greater than the commercial quantity. The Applicant negotiated this transaction on the basis that it was a kilogram, and that he would receive $10,000.00 out of the $260,000.00 purchase price. The sentencing Judge found that the purity of the cocaine, at 64.5%, was quite high (ROS16). 

82It is necessary to bear in mind that two offences of supplying a prohibited drug were taken into account on sentence with respect to the Sequence 6 offence. 

83Mr Strickland SC did not submit that the other sentencing decisions to which he referred disclosed a range of sentence for this type of offence. In a long line of cases commencing with R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371, this Court has emphasised the limited use of sentencing decisions concerning persons who are not related offenders, unless a range of sentence is demonstrated from those decisions. In this regard, see also R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247; 149 A Crim R 38 at 47 [48]; R v Araya [2005] NSWCCA 283; 155 A Crim R 555 at 567 [69]-[70]; Han v R [2009] NSWCCA 300 at [32]-[39] and Stock v R at 587-588 [48]. 

84In Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 536-537 [53]-[54], French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ emphasised the need for care to be taken, when other sentencing decisions are referred to on the question of sentence. 

85In Hili v The Queen at 527 [18], 535 [48], their Honours observed that, with respect to consistency of sentencing, what is sought is consistency in the application of relevant legal principles, not some numerical or mathematical equivalent. 

86I do not consider that the selection of cases relied upon by the Applicant provides support for the claim of manifest excess on this count. The circumstances of the present case are different, and this case involves a series of offences committed by the Applicant with the totality principle to be applied on sentence. 

87The findings of the sentencing Judge concerning the Sequence 6 offence are unchallenged, and the Table 1 offences were to be reflected on sentence on this count as well in accordance with the principles in Attorney General's Application Under Section 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at 159 [42]. 

88I am not persuaded that the sentence passed with respect to the Sequence 6 offence was unreasonable or plainly unjust. 

89I reject Ground 3A. 

Ground 3 - The Total Effective Sentence of 15 Years With a Non-Parole Period of 10 Years For All the Offences Was Manifestly Excessive in the Circumstances 

Submissions 

90In support of this ground, Mr Strickland SC submitted that a total effective sentence comprising an aggregate non-parole period of 10 years and a balance of term of five years was manifestly excessive in view of the objective circumstances of the offences, the subjective circumstances of the Applicant and application of relevant principles concerning concurrency, accumulation and totality. He pointed to the Applicant's subjective circumstances as summarised by the sentencing Judge in support of this argument. 

91In addition, reliance was placed upon a series of other sentencing decisions. Whilst acknowledging that these decisions did not establish a range of sentence, Mr Strickland SC submitted that they assisted in identifying sentencing outcomes in other cases which supported the claim of manifest excess with respect to the Applicant's total effective sentence. 

92To this end, Mr Strickland SC referred to decisions including Lam v R [2006] NSWCCA 11, Fahs v R (above), R v Gao; R v Lim (above), Edwards v R [2008] NSWCCA 281, Hristovski v R [2010] NSWCCA 129 and DAB v R [2010] NSWCCA 275 together with a number of other decisions of this Court. 

93The Crown submitted that there were significant points of distinction between the present case and the cases relied upon by the Applicant, identifying particular differences in Lam v R, Fahs v R, R v Gao; R v Lim , Edwards v R , Hristovski v R and DAB v R . 

94Further, the Crown submitted that more than usual caution was required in considering sentencing outcomes in other cases because of the imposition of substantially overlapping offences in the present case: Hristovksi v R at [60]. Once again, the Crown referred to the line of authority requiring caution where a manifest excess ground is sought to be supported by reference to other sentencing decisions. 

Decision 

95This ground of appeal involves a claim by the Applicant that the total effective sentence passed for his various crimes was manifestly excessive. To make out this ground, the Applicant must demonstrate that the total effective sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust (see [69] above). 

96Set out earlier in this judgment (at [83]-[85]) are relevant principles concerning the use to be derived from other sentencing decisions by an appellate court. The caution referred to in those authorities is further heightened where a challenge is made to a series of sentences calculated individually, and then by application of principles of accumulation, concurrency and totality, such as occurred in this case. Other sentencing decisions will be even less useful as possible yardsticks in these circumstances. 

97It must be kept in mind that very substantial levels of concurrency were ordered in this case. Although non-parole periods of seven years were ordered with respect to each of the offences in Sequence 4 and Sequence 6, there was accumulation for one year only as between those sentences. 

98The Applicant had engaged in a course of significant criminal conduct over a period of time. This was not an isolated offence. The Applicant, then 27 years of age, was involved in the commercial supply of drugs for profit. Although there were very serious separate crimes, the sentencing Judge applied the principle of totality in a manner not unfavourable to the Applicant. Further, viewed as an aggregate, the effective non-parole period of 10 years represented 66% of the aggregate full term. 

99Having regard to the totality of the Applicant's offending, and making all due allowance for his subjective circumstances, I do not regard the total effective non-parole period and balance of term as being unreasonable or plainly unjust. 

100I reject Ground 3. 
 
Conclusion 

101The Applicant has not established patent error on the part of the sentencing Judge as alleged in Grounds 1 and 2, nor latent error (in the form of manifest excess) as alleged in Grounds 2A, 3 and 3A. 

102I propose the following orders: 

(a) leave to appeal against sentence be granted; 

(b) appeal dismissed.

2758498,Director of Public Prosecutions v JJ and SH [2011] NSWChC 2,"JUDGMENT 

Introduction 

1The young person JJ has pleaded guilty to: 

One charge of attempted robbery in company with the victim being Mitchell Cassidy and the property being cash belonging to the Shell service station at Buronga (sequence 1); 
One charge of robbery in company with the victim being the late Colin Ferrier and the property being a Ford Ranger motor vehicle registered [xxx]30P (sequence 2); and 
One charge of larceny with the victim being the late Colin Ferrier and the property being his wallet (sequence 13). 

2JJ also admits a further five offences that he asks be taken into account on sentence for the charge of attempted robbery in company (sequence 1). Those offences have been placed on Form 1 documents pursuant to Division 3 of Part 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Those five offences are: 

Larceny of a Commodore sedan motor vehicle registered [xxx]179 (sequence 4); 
Destruction by fire in company of the Commodore sedan motor vehicle registered [xxx]179 (sequence 5); 
Destruction by fire in company of the motor vehicle registered [xxx]627 (sequence 6); 
Destruction by fire in company of the motor vehicle registered [xxx]037 (sequence 7); 
Destruction by fire in company of the motor vehicle registered [xxx]620 (sequence 8); 

3Additionally, JJ also admits a further three offences and asks that they be taken into account on sentence for the charge of robbery in company (sequence 2). Those three charges have also been placed on a Form 1 and are: 

Taking and driving a motor vehicle registered [xxx]323 without the consent of the owner of the vehicle (sequence 9); 
Larceny of various items of personal property valued at $200 and belonging to Colin Wright (sequence 10); and 
Attempting to take and drive a motor vehicle registered [xxx]210 without the consent of the owner of the vehicle (sequence 11). 

4The young person SH has pleaded guilty to: 

One charge of attempted robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon with the victim being the Shell Service Station and the weapon being a knife (sequence 4); 
One charge of robbery in company with the victim being the late Colin Ferrier and the property being a Ford Ranger motor vehicle registered [xxx]30P (sequence 12); and 
One charge of stealing from a person, with the victim being the late Colin Ferrier and the property being the wallet of the deceased (sequence 13) 

5I have noted that SH has been charged and pleaded guilty to stealing from the person of the late Mr Ferrier. It seems that this may have been done in error as the facts sheet for this part of SH's matter reads the same as that for JJ who has been charged with larceny simpliciter . The facts sheet for SH also has a sub-heading that describes the offence as being larceny. It therefore might be the case that sequence 13 for SH will be amended at a subsequent date. 

6SH also admits a further four offences that have been placed on a Form 1 and which are to be taken into account on sentence for the offence of attempted robbery whilst armed (sequence 4). Those four offences are: 

Larceny of a Commodore sedan motor vehicle registered [xxx]179 (sequence 2); 
Destruction by fire in company of the Commodore sedan motor vehicle registered [xxx]179 (sequence 3); 
Destruction by fire in company of the motor vehicle registered [xxx]620 (sequence 7); and 
Destruction by fire in company of the motor vehicle registered [xxx]627 (sequence 8). 

7Additionally, SH also admits a further three offences and asks that they be taken into account on sentence for the charge of robbery in company (sequence 12). Those three charges have also been placed on a Form 1 and are: 

Destruction by fire in company of the motor vehicle registered [xxx]037 (sequence 9); 
Taking and driving a motor vehicle registered [xxx]323 without the consent of the owner of the vehicle (sequence 10); and 
Larceny of various items of personal property valued at $200 and belonging to Colin Wright (sequence 11). 

8All of the offences are said to have occurred between the 15 and 16 June 2010. JJ and SH have been charged along with various co-accused who have come before the Court at various times since late June 2010. 

9In the case of JJ, the proceedings were commenced by way of Court Attendance Notice and first came before Wentworth Children's Court on 11 March 2011. In the case of SH the proceedings were commenced by way of Court Attendance Notice and first came before Wentworth Children's Court on 19 June 2010. Ultimately each set of proceedings was transferred to Broken Hill Children's Court which sits more frequently and which is more regularly attended by officers of the Director of Public Prosecutions. 

10JJ pleaded guilty to the substantive offences on 18 October 2011 and on that date it was indicated that a number of matters would be placed on a Form 1. The position with regards to the offences admitted by way of the Form 1 offences was confirmed on 22 November 2011. JJ has therefore pleaded guilty to the offences at a relatively early stage in proceedings, and will in all likelihood receive a substantial discount on sentence. I will not quantify the extent of that discount, as I do not intend to sentence him. I have however taken into account the likely discount in determining the issue at hand. 

11SH pleaded guilty to his substantive offences on 20 September 2011 and on that date it was indicated that a number of matters would be placed on a Form 1. Like JJ, the position with regards to the offences admitted by way of the Form 1 was confirmed on 22 November 2011. SH has therefore also pleaded guilty to the offences at a relatively early stage in proceedings and will thus receive a substantial discount on sentence. Again, I will not be quantifying the extent of that discount, as I do not intend to sentence him. I have however taken into account the likely discount on sentence when determining the issue at hand. 

12For some time in these proceedings it has been apparent that regardless of how the matters progressed I would have to give consideration to the issue of whether it is appropriate for the charges to remain in the Children's Court or whether it is more appropriate that they be dealt with in the District Court. In relation to this issue I have taken into account the agreed facts that have been tendered on the issue of sentence and the young people's criminal records. Additionally, Confidential Background Reports from Juvenile Justice have been made available to the Court and I have heard submissions from all of the parties as to what orders - if any - should be made with respect to the appropriate court for sentence. I have taken all of these things into account in coming to my decision. 

13Not surprisingly the position of each of the young people is that the matters should remain in the Children's Court as they can be appropriately dealt with here. The position on behalf of the Director is ostensibly a neutral one, with Mr Doohan making no submissions either way as to which course these matters should take. Rather, the prosecution takes the view that it is a matter for the Court as to whether these charges should remain in the Children's Court. 

Factual issues 

14The facts are agreed and have been handed up to the Court and are less than two pages long in the case of JJ and only slightly longer in the case of SH. Leaving aside some minor differences the agreed facts for each young person are ostensibly the same. They reveal that in the early hours of the morning of 16 June 2010 JJ and SH were members of a group of males that attempted to rob the Shell service station located at Buronga. JJ and SH were in the company of three other young males. The attempt was unsuccessful as the service station attendant was able to lock the front entry to the shop area of the station. The attempt included of one of the group kicking the bottom panel of the door causing it to smash but not so as to enable entry. Another member of the group swung an object at the door, which damaged it. 

15The robbery in company that forms sequence 2 for JJ and sequence 12 for SH was effected by two youths from the group attacking the late Colin Ferrier and forcing him out of and away from the utility that was ultimately taken. Michael Ferrier, the son of Colin Ferrier, was forced to intervene in order to try and protect his father. The vehicle was ultimately driven away by one of JJ and SH's accomplices. It is the Crown's position that the person who drove the vehicle away was another member of the group known as JK. Although it is not referred to in the facts, it is common ground that JK has separately been charged with various serious offences including murder. 

16The facts continue on to describe how the late Colin Ferrier was run down and killed by the offender who was driving the utility. After that occurred, JJ, SH and some co-offenders who were in a different car pulled up next to the late Mr Ferrier's body. They all got out of that other car and stole the late Mr Ferrier's wallet from his body. They all then left the scene. The facts confirm that the late Mr Ferrier was deceased at the time the wallet was stolen. 

Legal issues 

17There is very little case law dealing with the operation of section 31 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. Notwithstanding this, I have had the benefit of well-formulated submissions from Mr Winch and Mr Schultink as to what course I should take in this matter. Mr Schultink addressed first and provided very helpful submissions as to why we have a Children's Court and the importance of emphasising prospects for rehabilitation when sentencing young people. He also submitted that the offences committed by JJ were not of such gravity as to require them to be dealt with in the District Court. Mr Winch addressed for SH on similar themes and also referred to section 18 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, which whilst not directly on point raises issues analogous to those that arise under section 31. I have taken into account all of these arguments and I will deal with the most cogent of them below. 

18The starting point for these matters is section 31 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, which relevantly states: 

31 Hearing of charges in the Children's Court 
(1) If a person is charged before the Children's Court with an offence (whether indictable or otherwise) other than a serious children's indictable offence, the proceedings for the offence shall be dealt with summarily. 
(2) ... 
(3) ... 
(4) ... 
(5) Notwithstanding subsection (1): 
(a) if a person is charged before the Children's Court with an indictable offence, and 
(b) if, at any stage of the proceedings, the person pleads guilty to the charge, and 
(c) if the Children's Court states that it is of the opinion that, having regard to all the evidence before it (including any background report of a kind referred to in section 25), the charge may not properly be disposed of in a summary manner, 
the proceedings for the offence shall not be dealt with summarily but shall be dealt with in accordance with Division 5 of Part 2 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 as if the offence were a serious children's indictable offence in respect of which the person had pleaded guilty as referred to in that section. 

19From the outset it should be noted that none of the charges levelled against JJ and SH are serious children's indictable offences and so according to sub-section (1) of the provision it is presumed that they will be dealt with in the Children's Court. However, subsection (5) creates a power on the part of the Court to order that the proceedings be dealt with as if the charges levelled against JJ and SH were serious children's indictable offences. In making this decision the Court has to take into account all of the evidence that is before it - including the content of any background report - and must be satisfied that the charge or charges may not properly be disposed of in a summary manner. Notably, section 31 provides no guidance as to what factors should be taken into account when making this decision. 

20The practical effect of having the matters dealt with in accordance with Division 5 of Part 2 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 is that JJ and SH will face the maximum penalty for each of the substantive offences. The maximum penalty for the two most serious charges levelled against the young people is twenty years imprisonment on each count. The maximum penalty for stealing is five years imprisonment and the maximum penalty for stealing from the person is 14 years imprisonment. There would be no limit on the extent to which the sentencing judge could accumulate the terms other than the maxima themselves. Additionally, if JJ and SH were to receive a custodial sentence there is the potential that they would serve at least part of the term in an adult prison. 

21By contrast, if JJ and SH are sentenced by the Children's Court the maximum penalty is reduced to two years for the two more serious charges and one year for the offences of larceny and stealing from the person. If a custodial term were imposed, JJ and SH would be made the subject of a control order, which would commit them to the control of the Minister. The maximum penalty upon accumulation - if any - would be reduced to a total term of three years, and the bulk - if not the entirety - of the sentence would almost certainly be served in a Juvenile Justice Centre as opposed to an adult prison. Therefore, from JJ and SH's perspective the course I take in relation to this issue has extremely important implications. 

22In making this decision it is important to take into account the statutory framework under which the Children's Court operates. In that regard section 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 sets out a series of principles to which the Court must have regard in considering this issue: 

6 Principles relating to exercise of functions under Act 
A person or body that has functions under this Act is to exercise those functions having regard to the following principles: 
(a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them, 
(b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance, 
(c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption, 
(d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home, 
(e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind, 
(f) that it is desirable that children who commit offences be assisted with their reintegration into the community so as to sustain family and community ties, 
(g) that it is desirable that children who commit offences accept responsibility for their actions and, wherever possible, make reparation for their actions, 
(h) that, subject to the other principles described above, consideration should be given to the effect of any crime on the victim. 

23In my view these principles produce two issues that I must consider. The first issue is whether the need to ensure that JJ and SH bear responsibility for their actions outweighs the benefit to JJ, SH and the community of their receiving guidance and assistance from the authorities. This guidance and assistance would no doubt include access to educational resources at a Juvenile Justice Centre that would better cater to their needs than those that would potentially be available for them at an adult prison. 

24The second issue is whether it is necessary in order to ensure that JJ and SH bear responsibility for their actions that they be subject to a harsher penalty regime, and one that in all likelihood will mean that they will be removed from the broader community and thus their homes for a substantial period of time. 

25In considering these questions it is important to remember why we have a Children's Court. As referred to by Mr Schultink in his submissions, Kirby J canvassed this issue in the case PM v The Queen [2007] HCA 49 at [70]. In that regard there are two compelling public policy reasons why we have a Children's Court, the first of which is that because of their immaturity it is often inappropriate to invoke the full range of criminal punishments against young people. Secondly, having a separate Children's Court system and a separate system of detention helps to prevent young people becoming associated with older and more experienced offenders; it grants them a second chance and possibly diverts them away from a life of crime. Both of these rationales reflect the capacity young people have to reform themselves as they mature. Although Kirby J was dissenting in his judgment in PM v The Queen I feel that his observations on this issue would hardly be controversial. 

26Of course general principles of sentencing also apply to varying extents when a Court sentences a child or young person. It therefore seems appropriate to consider the rationale behind the imposition of sentences. During the course of submissions I canvassed whether section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 applied to these proceedings. The consensus position reached was that regardless of whether the provision formally applied, the purposes of sentencing enunciated by section 3A would have application in that they represent the common law purposes. Relevantly, section 3A states: 

3A Purposes of sentencing 
The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows: 
(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
(c) to protect the community from the offender, 
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community. 

The reason why I have averted to these purposes applying to varying extents is because some of these purposes may be given more or less weight in the case of young people when compared to adults who have committed the same type of crimes. For instance, when sentencing JJ and SH the Court will give considerable weight to their capacity for rehabilitation given that the law stresses the public interest associated with promoting the rehabilitation of young offenders (KT v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 51 at [22-26] per McLennan CJ at CL). 

27A more difficult issue to deal with is what weight should be given to the issue of general deterrence and retribution. Broadly speaking the starting position on this issue is that less weight should be given to these factors when sentencing a young people such as JJ and SH (KT at [22-26]). However, this principle is by no means set in stone and sentencing courts must still have regard to the principle of general deterrence when sentencing children and young people for serious offences (R v WKR (1993) 32 NSWLR 447 at 465) and there remains a significant public interest associated with deterring antisocial conduct (R v Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135 per Lee CJ at CL). 

28These issues are by no means easy to resolve, and from the outset it must be observed that the purposes of assisting JJ and SH and promoting their rehabilitation point the court in a different direction than the purposes associated with general deterrence and retribution, which in turn requires me to consider whether the actions of JJ and SH were so serious or antisocial as to warrant these matters not being dealt with summarily. 

29In balancing all of these issues I have also been referred to section 18 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. This provision is not entirely on point, but it deals with similar issues to those raised by section 31. Section 18 deals with factors to be considered by sentencing judges of the District and Supreme Courts when dealing with children and young people for indictable offences other than serious children's indictable offences. It also grants a discretion on the part of the sentencing judge to remit such matters to the Children's Court. In terms of factors to be considered section 18(1A) states: 

(1A) In determining whether a person is to be dealt with according to law or in accordance with Division 4 of Part 3, a court must have regard to the following matters: 
(a) the seriousness of the indictable offence concerned, 
(b) the nature of the indictable offence concerned, 
(c) the age and maturity of the person at the time of the offence and at the time of sentencing, 
(d) the seriousness, nature and number of any prior offences committed by the person, 
(e) such other matters as the court considers relevant. 

30Section 18 is not entirely on issue because it deals with the inverse situation to that envisaged by section 31, but it provides some insight into this matter because it sets criteria that can be considered in deciding whether indictable matters can be appropriately dealt with in the Children's Court. I will therefore be taking these factors into consideration. Having identified the factors to be considered I will undertake an analysis of them below. 

Analysis of the issues 

Issues arising from section 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and the emphasis to be placed on rehabilitation. 

31As highlighted above, the consideration of the factors referred to in section 6 involve balancing the need to ensure that JJ and SH are held responsible for their actions against the recognised goal of providing guidance and assistance to young offenders and the undesirability of removing young people from the community for lengthy periods of time. Incarcerating young people is an extremely undesirable measure that should only be used as a last resort; therefore the second issue virtually speaks for itself. In terms of providing guidance and assistance to young offenders, I take this to be a reference as to how the courts and authorities can assist in rehabilitating young people. 

32On the issue of rehabilitation for JJ, I have taken into account the contents of the Confidential Background Report prepared by Juvenile Justice, which highlights a number of relevant issues. The first such issue is that JJ has a large and supportive family network, which would be conducive to his reform. 

33Another issue is that JJ describes himself as liking school, but unfortunately his use of marijuana has prevented him from succeeding with mainstream schooling. By contrast, when in Juvenile Detention JJ attends school regularly and receives positive reports. This bodes well for his future prospects; as if his drug problem can be adequately addressed JJ may be able to get a good education, which would enhance his employment prospects and thus his potential for rehabilitation. JJ has expressed that he wishes to go to TAFE and has an interest in manual labour. It therefore seems that JJ has put together at least a rudimentary plan for his future. 

34Additionally, whilst on remand JJ has engaged with a psychologist in order to address coping issues/skills, grief and loss and alcohol and other drug issues. All of these issues are significant criminogenic factors, and if JJ were able to overcome them it would lessen his likelihood of re-offending. JJ has been described as 'a pleasure to have on the unit' at Riverina Juvenile Justice Centre, and so it is obvious that with the right support and motivation JJ responds and behaves well. 

35On the issue of rehabilitation for SH, I have also taken into account the contents of the Confidential Background Report prepared by Juvenile Justice. In that regard I have noted that SH also has a supportive family, which would aid in his rehabilitation. 

36It has to be noted though, that SH's educational history is very poor and in the past SH has promised Juvenile Justice that he will go to school, only to then become a long-term truant. Unfortunately, SH's mainstream educational prospects have been marred by periods of incarceration. However, whilst in custody SH has been attending school and is studying for his Year 10 certificate, has participated in Aboriginal Cultural Studies and is also completing a brick laying trade skills course. Therefore, if SH can be encouraged to continue on with his education he too could have good prospects for rehabilitation. 

37Like JJ, SH has also engaged in counselling whilst in custody and is addressing his problems with alcohol and other drugs. He is also currently on the highest level - that being the best - of the Kariong Juvenile Correctional Centre behavioural management programme. Unfortunately, it would also seem that he might be prone to misbehaviour, as he has previously been removed from one of the Centre's programmes due to a deterioration in his behaviour. These factors would indicate that SH mostly responds and behaves well, but there may be the need for further support to be rendered to him. 

38Therefore my conclusion is that both young people have good prospects for rehabilitation if provided with the right assistance and opportunities. This is based not just on their age, but also the analysis contained in the Confidential Background Reports. 

Section 18(1A)(c): age and maturity at the time of the offence and at the time of sentencing 

39JJ was born on 19 May 1993 and is currently 18 years old. At the time of the commission of the offences he had just turned 17. There is nothing in the material before me that would indicate that JJ's level of maturity is anything other than normal for a person his age. This would mean that he would have a reasonable level of impulse control and intellectual and moral reasoning. However, he would not have the experience and maturity level of a fully developed adult. Notwithstanding this, JJ should have a well-developed sense of right and wrong and the ability to resist peer pressure when invited to commit crimes. 

40SH was born on 19 August 1993 and is currently 18 years old. At the time of the commission of the offences he was 16 years old. On this issue I have taken into account the psychological report of Ms. Player prepared on 7 November 2011. This report indicates that SH is immature for his age and is easily led into misbehaviour. There are also some indicators that SH has a lower than average intelligence level although Ms Player was not able to confirm this due to anomalous test results. In the circumstances I accept Mr Winch's submissions that SH is immature for his age. This is a relevant consideration because when considering sentences for young people it is their youth and actual maturity level that is the relevant consideration, not their age ( R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451 at [25]). Additionally this immaturity can lessen the criminality of the offender if it was a significant causal factor in the commission of the offence ( Hearne at [25] and MS2 v The Queen (2005) 158 A Crim R 93 at [61]). 

Section 18(1A)(d): the seriousness nature and number of prior offences committed 

41In relation to JJ I have been provided with both a New South Wales and a Victorian criminal history. The New South Wales history reveals a number of relevant property offences with offence dates starting from 30 December 2007. He also has entries for crimes of violence including assault and affray. All of these matters have been dealt with by way of sentences at the lower and middle parts of the sentencing spectrum, namely cautions, bonds and probation orders. The Victorian history shows six offences committed on 21 August 2008, which include property offences and which were dealt with by way of the equivalent of a bond and then dismissed following compliance with that bond. Overall, my assessment of JJ's criminal history is that it does not necessarily assist him in that it does include some serious offences - including counts that are strictly indictable when committed by adults but nor is it terribly damning. 

42In terms of SH I have been provided with a New South Wales criminal history that shows a first offence date of 6 June 2005. Since that time SH has accumulated numerous entries for property offences and crimes of violence. He has been the subject of many sets of call-up proceedings and has received numerous control orders. Of concern is the aggravating factor that at the time of the commission of these offences SH was serving a 12 month probation order for receiving stolen property and a 6 month good behaviour bond for assaulting an officer in the execution of their duties. SH has also committed offences that for adults would be strictly indictable. Therefore SH's criminal history is of little assistance to him and may even indicate that previous attempts at rehabilitation have failed. 

The seriousness of the offences and the need to deter antisocial behaviour 

43When dealing with young people the assessment of the seriousness of their offending often goes beyond the usual assessment as to where their individual offences fall on the scale of objective seriousness. Often the exercise examines whether the behaviour exhibited by the offenders can be characterised as adult-like or whether it is consistent with youthful criminal behaviour. Because of this I will examine each of the substantive offences from both perspectives. Of course the offending of the young people goes beyond the substantive offences and includes numerous matters that will be taken into account on sentence. I am also taking them into account, in that the sheer volume of offences committed by the young people really does make them stand out by comparison to other young offenders. 

44By way of preliminary observation, it has been submitted on behalf of the young people that their conduct is not characteristic of adult conduct. I do not accept this submission. The robbery offences are very serious and they are not typical of the types of matters that are dealt with by the Children's Court. In drawing this conclusion I am taking into account not just the pattern of juvenile offending within the Broken Hill Circuit - and these matters do very much stand out from the types of matters generally dealt with in this region - but also my experience as a Children's Magistrate at Parramatta and Bidura Children's Courts. Robberies more commonly committed by young people have a much lower degree of violence than those at hand. They tend to not involve the use of weapons or implements and the value of the items stolen are generally lesser than the items taken in the subject case. 

45In the case of the attempted robbery I do not accept that it could be classified as falling towards the lower end of objective seriousness. Rather it falls towards the middle range. I draw this conclusion for a number of reasons including that the service station attendant would have been very frightened by the crime that was unfolding before him. It was only his quick thinking and the sturdiness of the service station door that prevented the robbery from being perfected. Of further relevance is that when the perpetrators were frustrated in their attempt to get into the service station they attempted to smash their way in, which would have added an additional layer of menace to the victim of this crime. 

46Likewise the robbery committed upon the late Mr Ferrier is well outside the lower range of objective seriousness and is squarely within the middle range. The robbery involved the late Mr Ferrier being set upon by a group of people engaging in thuggish, animalistic behaviour. The actions of JJ and SH and their co-accused would have rendered Mr Ferrier's last moments alive terrifying. This type of behaviour is extremely serious and very much atypical of the types of matters that are dealt with in the Children's Court. 

47The facts associated with the larceny of the late Mr Ferrier's wallet are even more chilling. In terms of the objective seriousness they are very much towards the upper end as the facts are so grave. The act of stealing the wallet of a man who had just been run down by a car, and who was lying lifeless on the road is so morally reprehensible it almost defies description. It would stun even the most jaded observers of the human condition, and was an act of thievery so serious that it alone could be virtually beyond the purview of the Children's Court to punish. 

Final analysis 

48As alluded to in the introduction of this judgment, the factors that need to be considered for these matters are numerous; individually they point the Court in different directions as to whether these offences can be properly disposed of in a summary manner. On the one hand, both young people may have good prospects for rehabilitation if provided with sufficient guidance. SH was at the time of the offence a relatively immature person and JJ has a limited - albeit still relevant - criminal record. These aspects are highly relevant mitigating factors. 

49On the other hand, even accounting for his immaturity SH has a lengthy criminal history and has demonstrated a tendency to not make use of the opportunities afforded him through good behaviour bonds and probation orders. He has been the subject of numerous call-up applications and has received numerous control orders including for property offences and crimes of violence. This lessens his prospects for rehabilitation although it does not completely eliminate them. SH was actually the subject of a good behaviour bond and a probation order at the time these offences were committed which is an aggravating factor that must be taken into account. These factors lend weight to the argument that SH's offences cannot be properly disposed of in a summary manner. 

50Additionally, JJ was sufficiently mature to know that what he was doing was extremely wrong. He could have declined to become involved in this whole episode or at the very least decided to walk away when the proposed crimes became more serious. This makes it seem more appropriate that the Children's Court not deal with the matters. 

51My overall assessment of the substantive offences is that they involve dangerous, antisocial and reprehensible behaviour. The actions of the young people very much enliven the need to send a message of general deterrence to the community; this type of behaviour simply will not be tolerated and offenders - even if young people must be punished for such acts. 

52Having balanced all the considerations referred to above my finding is that these matters cannot properly be disposed of in a summary manner. Rather, they should be dealt with according to law as to deal with these matters in the Children's Court would result in sentences that are too lenient. 

Orders 

53I commit both of the young people for sentence in the District Court of New South Wales on a date to be fixed. I also order that an updated Confidential Background Report be prepared for the use of the sentencing judge. Finally, I order that pursuant to section 34(4) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 this judgment be issued forthwith to the young people as a statement of reasons for my decision to commit them for sentence in the District Court. This is to be done both by this judgment being handed down to the legal representatives of the young people and by a copy of this judgment being forwarded by facsimile to the Detention Centres where the young people are being detained.

2758503,R v Bruce GOSEN [2011] NSWDC 260,"Judgment


1In this prosecution Bruce Gosen has been charged with importing cocaine into Australia. That is a Commonwealth offence and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has briefed Mr I S McLachlan to prosecute the case on his behalf. 

2Mr Gosen's defence is that he knew nothing about the cocaine which was found in the suitcases which he brought into Australia. He acknowledges the presence of the cocaine but says that the clever secreting of the drugs was something he knew absolutely nothing about. 

3Mr Gosen's account included his trip being arranged by somebody else who had paid for his travel. When he was being interviewed by the Australian Federal Police, he made it clear that he has never owned a credit card himself and he confirmed that in his own evidence. 

4Mr McLachlan tendered in evidence Exhibit VDM which was a printout from the records of a travel agent in Vancouver. It showed that the travel had been paid by a credit card in the name of Mr Gosen. The document was described by Mr Jason Watts, who appears for Mr Gosen, as a screen shot from the records of the travel agent. 

5Mr Watts objected to the tender of VDM, relying upon s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. Mr Watts argued that I have to refuse to admit this evidence because the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to his client, Mr Gosen. 

6I decided (at T 383) to admit the evidence. I made that decision on 14 December 2011 and I indicated that I would give my reasons later. The jury has retired to consider its verdict and I am now taking the opportunity to deliver my reasons. 

7Mr McLachlan argued that the probative value of the evidence was at least twofold. First, it was evidence of a lie told by the accused who had asserted that he owned no credit card. Secondly, it was inconsistent with the accused's case that the travel had been set up by others and he was essentially sent on his way by those others. This indicates that he himself had made a contribution to his own travel. It is, as Mr McLachlan argued, more consistent with the actions of a person who was himself expecting some benefit from the trip. 

8In articulating his objections, Mr Watts described VDM as a ""flawed document"". This was in a sense an accurate description because Mr Watts was able to point to several internal inconsistencies within the document itself. In other words, the document itself contained mistakes. Mr Watts' argument was that the exhibit, if admitted, would ""assume a significance in the case which it does not warrant and that is where it may take a prejudicial effect"". He pointed to the nature of the documents which were not business records sent by a business to other people, but documents generated by the business for its own use. It is, as he described it, ""just a screen shot as it were, of their internal records. It's only reliable if it's entered properly."" He then went on to point out that its reliability is compromised by the demonstrable errors which it contains. The disproportionate weight, he said, was that the jury might be led to adopt a line of impermissible reasoning of concluding that the document represented a lie and therefore ""he must be guilty"". 

9I admitted the document because I regarded its probative value as high. It could form the basis of an argument attacking the accused's credibility as being a possible lie. In addition it was, as Mr McLachlan argued, inconsistent with the assertion by the accused in his interviews that his travel was arranged by others and that he was simply sent on his way. 

10There is always a danger that a jury may use a lie, or at least an assertion which is argued to be a lie, impermissibly and rush to a conclusion. However, I must consider that risk in the light of directions which must accompany any argument about a lie. In this case those directions were formulated and given so that the jury were, so far as I am concerned, properly directed about the use which can be made of an argument asserting a lie as consciousness of guilt and affecting credibility. 

11So far as the reliability of the document is concerned, I regarded that as a factor which Mr Watts could use to argue in his address before the jury. He did this appropriately and in addition he invited me to give the jury a warning about the document under s 165 of the Evidence Act. I accepted that application and gave the jury a direction accordingly. 

12At the time of admitting the document I did not regard its probative value as being outweighed by the danger of any unfair prejudice to Mr Gosen. For those reasons I decided to admit Exhibit VDM, which became an exhibit in the proceedings.

		02 January 2015",2011-12-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758521,R v Eken; R v Potrus [2012] NSWSC 2,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: Ishmail Eken was found by a jury to be not guilty of murder and manslaughter but guilty of riot. This is an offence against s 93B Crimes Act 1900 for which there is prescribed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years. He was also acquitted of a separate charge of affray which was alleged to have occurred shortly before the riot. 

2Usama Potrus was also found not guilty of murder and manslaughter but guilty of riot. He was not charged with the affray. 

3The trial commenced with empanelment of the jury on 24 May 2011. There were seven accused. The jury retired on 29 September 2011 and returned its verdicts on 2 November 2011. 


Facts 

4By way of background, it was an agreed fact in the trial that there was ongoing hostility between two rival motorcycle gangs, the Comancheros and the Hells Angels, and that each of the accused were aware of this state of affairs. The Comancheros were headed by a national president, Mahmoud Hawi, who had absolute power. It was a club which had a hierarchical structure, underpinned by strict and enforceable rules. These rules governed the behaviour expected from members and reinforced a strong culture of loyalty of members towards one another and to the club. Such rules included that any display of cowardice would not be tolerated. 

5The riot occurred in the Qantas domestic terminal at Sydney Airport on 22 March 2009 when there was a confrontation between members of the Hells Angels and the Comancheros. Both offenders were members of the Comancheros. Indeed, Mr Eken was wearing a t-shirt with a prominent Comanchero logo at the time. Some of the participants were not actually members of either gang but were either nominee members or associates of members. However, for convenience, I will refer to people as being a member of one or the other. 

6Mr Eken was in Melbourne over the weekend of 21-22 March 2009 with some other Comanchero members. He, together with Hawi, Christian Menzies, Pomare Pirini and Maher Aouli, caught Qantas flight 430 back to Sydney. The flight left Melbourne at about midday on 22 March 2009. Mr Eken was sitting in a middle row towards the back of the plane with Hawi to his left and Menzies to his right. Pirini sat in a row immediately in front of them and Aouli sat a number of rows further forward. 

7Derek Wainohu, the president of the Hells Angels, happened to be on the same flight and was seen by Comanchero members. Hawi exhibited animosity by glaring and gesturing as he walked up and down the plane past Wainohu a number of times. He directed Aouli to contact other members in Sydney in order to have them attend the airport. Wainohu sent text messages to members of his gang for the same purpose. When seated beside Mr Eken, Hawi was heard to say, ""Get the guys to meet us at the other end"". Mr Eken contacted Daux Ngakuru, a senior Comanchero office holder, and then sent him a text message before the flight left Melbourne. There was no evidence as to the content of these communications but Mr Young, senior counsel for Mr Eken, accepted that it was obvious what their purpose was - to have Comanchero members come to the airport. 

8There followed a series of communications between Comanchero members in Sydney which culminated in seven of them proceeding with haste to the airport: Mr Potrus took his mother's car with SP and AL (publication of their names has been suppressed) and Zoran Kisacanin as his passengers; Farres Abounader drove another car with Frank LaRosa and Tiago Costa as his passengers. SP said that Mr Potrus told him, ""We're going to the airport to pick up Mick and some of the other boys on the plane. ... (T)here was maybe some Hells Angels on the same flight or going to be at the airport at the same time"" (T2613). 

9Seven Hells Angels members or associates also came to the airport: Peter and Anthony Zervas, Musa Ovalle, David Padovan, Tom Baker, Peter Martin and Elias Khoury. 

10The seven Comancheros who came to the airport did so under the obvious impression that their attendance was required as a matter of urgency. The two cars with their seven occupants proceeded to a meeting with senior club members at Brighton before going to the airport. On arrival at the airport the cars were parked illegally directly outside the lower, baggage claim, level. All the occupants alighted and entered the building. They immediately went via escalators at the eastern end of the terminal to the upper, departure hall, level where they walked in front of the check-in counters towards the security checkpoint at the western end. Five of them proceeded through security screening into the ""sterile area"" and then to Gate 5 where passengers from QF430 were disembarking. The other two, Potrus and Abounader, waited in the departure hall. Mr Potrus had been through security screening but he looked around to see Abounader hanging back and he returned to join him. 

11There was no dispute in the trial that Abounader was armed with a knife and it is reasonable to infer that he did not go through to Gate 5 because he feared it would trigger the walk-through metal detectors. Given there was such haste for the men to get to the airport to meet the arriving flight, it would be surprising if Abounader did not explain this to Mr Potrus; if he did not know already that Abounader was armed. 

12Two of the Hells Angels who came to the airport, Baker and Padovan, went through to Gate 5. The other five waited in the departure hall. 

13Security camera footage showed that Potrus and Abounader waited in the area immediately outside the security screening area at the western end of the terminal, near to where arriving passengers emerge from the sterile area. The five Hells Angels members milled around behind the check-in counters about 60 metres to the east of that location. There is no direct evidence that Potrus and Abounader were aware of the presence of the Hells Angels or vice versa. 

14The affray, for which Mr Eken was acquitted, occurred in the immediate vicinity of Gate 5 after the arriving passengers disembarked. It is unnecessary to go into the detail of what occurred aside from saying that there was a fight involving three Hells Angels, Wainohu, Baker and Padovan, and a number of the Comancheros. The fight commenced very shortly after Hawi and Wainohu came face to face after disembarking from the plane. The jury were satisfied of the involvement in the use, or threatened use, of violence by Hawi, Menzies and Kisacanin, given the verdicts of guilty of affray they returned in respect of them. SP and AL, Pirini, Aouli, La Rosa and Costa had earlier pleaded guilty to affray in respect of this incident. The Crown did not contend that Messrs Wainohu and Baker were aggressors. It did in respect of Mr Padovan, but he was acquitted. The submission by his counsel in his closing address to the jury that ""he was flogged"" by the Comancheros was, in my view, apt. 

15It was Mr Eken's case that he played something of a peacemaker role during the affray at Gate 5. AL said that he heard someone say words to the effect, ""Not here, let's go outside"" . There was evidence that SP had told a police officer in July 2009 that Mr Eken had settled things down and had said, ""Not in the airport"" . Some of the eyewitnesses heard someone say ""Let's take it outside"" or the like. The Crown, on the other hand, submitted that if the jury accepted any of this evidence, they should consider that Mr Eken was not trying to discourage fighting; he was simply counselling the participants to do it elsewhere. 

16There was evidence that at the conclusion of the events at Gate 5, Hawi pointed and uttered threats towards one or more of the Hells Angels. One witness said that he heard, ""You're dead, you are fucking dead"" . Another heard, ""You're a dead man, you're fucking dead, you've got bullet holes in you"" . If the witnesses were able to hear these threats, Mr Eken must have as well. 

17Whilst the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of Mr Eken's guilt in respect of the affray, and so he is to be regarded as innocent of that offence, the fact that he undoubtedly witnessed the violence at Gate 5 cannot be ignored. It must have been the freshest thing in his memory as he emerged, with his fellow gang members, into the departure hall. A feature of what he witnessed was the preparedness of at least some of his companions to use or threaten violence in a public place in front of many members of the public, including children. The accounts given by many of those who gave evidence about the affray made it abundantly clear that many were horrified and frightened. 

18From the foregoing, I am satisfied of a number of matters that are worth recapping in order to put what next occurred in context. The Comancheros and Hells Angels motorcycle gangs were, in effect, at war with each other. Mr Eken was a member of the Comancheros. He was subject to its strict rules requiring loyalty and prohibiting cowardice. There was a prospect, of which he was aware soon after boarding the flight in Melbourne, of a confrontation with one or more Hells Angels upon arrival in Sydney. Given the history of hostility between the two gangs it was a reasonable possibility that such a confrontation would involve violence. On Hawi's command, he assisted in summoning reinforcements. A violent fight broke out between the Comancheros and the Hells Angels soon after the flight landed. Mr Eken was a witness to this but did not participate and may have tried to encourage the participants not to fight in that particular location. After it had ended, it was apparent to him, and his companions, that their gang president was extremely displeased and had indicated that he wanted vengeance at the next opportunity, whenever that might be. 

19Mr Potrus was a full Comanchero member as well. He had been summoned to attend the airport and he did so as a matter of urgency. He was made aware that fellow Comanchero members, including the national president, were arriving on a flight from Melbourne and that there was a prospect of Hells Angels being present. Again, given the history of hostility, it must have been obvious that if any confrontation occurred, there could be violence. Mr Potrus did not witness what occurred at Gate 5 but he must have been made aware of it, at least in a general sense, very soon after. 

The confrontation in the check-in area 

20The Comancheros walked as a group out of the sterile area and emerged into the departure hall where they were immediately met by Potrus and Abounader. The group of now 12 Comancheros then walked in an easterly direction towards where the 5 Hells Angels were milling about. The Crown accepted that Mr Eken was towards the back of the group. 

21There was an issue in the trial as to why the Comancheros walked in this direction. Were they aware of the presence of the Hells Angels? Were they intent on confronting them? It was contended on behalf of the Comancheros that they were simply heading towards the escalators at the eastern end of the terminal that had been used earlier by the seven who had come to the airport in order to go downstairs to the cars. Such an explanation strained credulity. There were escalators immediately to the right as the ten Comancheros emerged into the departure hall. Potrus and Abounader had been waiting in the immediate vicinity of those escalators for several minutes. There were signs indicating that those escalators could be used to go downstairs to the arrivals hall. The escalators at the eastern end of the building were about 140 metres away. The cars were parked immediately outside the arrivals hall. Potrus and Abounader were the owners of the cars and it may be assumed that they had an interest in knowing where they were and how to get back to them. Mr Eken, and others, had luggage to collect. Hawi and Menzies, the only accused to give evidence, said that they were intent on getting out of the airport (T3784; T3995). They had abandoned any thoughts of collecting their luggage; they just wanted to get to the cars and get away, given what had occurred at Gate 5. How 12 men were going to get away in 2 cars was not explained. Mr Eken had arranged to be met by his girlfriend. What became of that plan was not explained either. 

22It seems highly likely that the Comancheros walked deliberately towards the waiting Hells Angels; probably because Abounader and Potrus had become aware of their presence. However, it is unnecessary to decide this issue. What is of significance is what occurred when the two groups came together. 

23If the Comancheros were not previously aware of the presence of the Hells Angels, they obviously became aware of them as they walked in their direction. As they got closer to the Hells Angels they quickened their pace. This was a disputed issue but I am satisfied that the security camera footage clearly indicates this. Kisacanin peeled off and ran between the check-in counters and then continued running east in an apparent attempt to approach the Hells Angels from a different angle; something of a flanking manoeuvre. Very soon after the two groups came together a violent fight erupted. It commenced behind the check-in counters and then moved through the counters towards the front of the terminal building. 

24A general theme of the cases for the Comanchero accused was that it was the Hells Angels waiting in the departure hall who were the aggressors and that Mr Anthony Zervas initiated the fighting by attacking Mr Hawi. Some counsel for Comanchero accused suggested that the jury could infer that telephone communications from Hells Angels at Gate 5 to Hells Angels waiting in the departure hall immediately after the affray had ended were for the purpose of alerting them to the presence of the Comancheros who would soon emerge into the departure hall. That may well be so. But there was no movement by those waiting Hells Angels towards where the Comancheros would emerge. They simply remained where they were which was in an area where arriving passengers were unlikely to go. The security camera footage did not show them making any movements which could suggest that they planned to attack the Comancheros prior to the Comancheros rushing towards them. 

25I have mentioned that much was sought to be made on behalf of the Comanchero accused of Anthony Zervas attacking Hawi and that this initiated the violence. It was common ground that he did attack Hawi. He had high levels of illicit drugs in his system and an incident two days earlier demonstrated his propensity to act with impetuous violence. Attacking Hawi was foolish - Hawi was 178 cm tall with a heavy muscular build while Mr Zervas was 161 cm tall and weighed only 58 kg. I am not persuaded that the violence was initiated by this attack. The fact is that violence was inevitable as the 12 Comancheros hurried towards the 5 Hells Angels. Anthony Zervas simply tried to make a pre-emptive strike. 

26It was the evidence of SP and AL (but not that of anyone else in the vicinity) that Abounader called out something to the effect that Anthony Zervas had a gun as he approached Hawi. There was a contention that this prompted the Comancheros to ""run for their lives"". That contention ignored SP's evidence that he realised immediately when Anthony Zervas' hands became visible that he did not have a gun, but had a sharp instrument, a pair of scissors. There was no evidence of any guns being at the airport that day. 

27I am satisfied that Anthony Zervas was then very quickly pursued, put to the ground, bludgeoned with one or more bollards and stabbed to death. Hawi has been found guilty of his murder. All of the other Comanchero accused were acquitted of murder. Some were also acquitted of manslaughter while the jury could not agree in respect of manslaughter for Menzies and Abounader. Menzies has since pleaded guilty to manslaughter. 

28In order to find Mr Eken and Mr Potrus guilty of riot, the jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were among twelve or more persons who had a common purpose to fight and that they used unlawful violence for that purpose. It is unsurprising that the jury were also satisfied of the other element of the offence of riot: that the conduct of the twelve or more persons was such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety. 

29The fighting that took place, although short-lived, was shockingly vicious. One witness spoke of ""an explosion of fighting"" (T1281). This witness was sitting on a bench with her two very young children, one of whom was in a pram. She became ""frozen with fear"" and held her children close to protect them. Another witness said that that she ""saw the large group of men fighting incredibly violently and aggressively"" (T2293). She said that the men were fighting in one group and then they split up into smaller groups. Another witness referred to the fighting as ""chaotic and quite wild and uncontrolled""; the men were ""raging, really angry"" (T1533-4). This witness and her companion fell over when he tried to pull her out of the way as the brawling continued into the area in front of the check-in counters. Her companion also gave evidence that there was a little girl in front of him who he grabbed to get her out of the way. The fatal assault upon Anthony Zervas took place near the front glass wall of the terminal, within a metre or two of an elderly couple who were seated on a bench waiting for a wheel chair to be brought to them. 

30The fighting generally involved wrestling, punching and kicking. However, some of the participants picked up bollards to use as weapons. A witness referred to the men moving through the check-in counters and said, "" As they got slowed down by the [passengers queuing to check their bags in], it started breaking off into groups and then they started having their own little altercations, throwing punches, kicks, with barrier poles, signs, just about anything they could find"" (T1025). Another said that he ""saw the metal bollards being thrown through the air and smashed on to people"" (T1052). A Qantas staff member said that the fighting men ""fell into the crowd; people went flying, screaming; and the bollards were flying"" (T1109). 

31The riot was short-lived; it took less than a minute. Nevertheless, it is clear that many witnesses found the incident most distressing. The witness who was trying to protect her two small children said that she went into shock and felt like she could not breathe (T1288). Her husband described her as being ""really distressed, yelling, crying"" (T1314). Another witness said that the mother was ""clearly ... very distressed and looked quite shocked and she burst into tears"" . This witness added, ""I suppose I became distressed myself"" (T2513). An elderly woman said that she had to turn away because she ""got too distressed because (she had) never experienced anything like this"" (T1353). The elderly couple seated close to where the fatal assault took place were observed to have been in distress (T1676). One of the first police officers on the scene said that a number of the members of the public who were present ""appeared distressed and upset"" (T2518). Mr Eken acknowledged in an affidavit which was tendered in the sentence proceedings that ""the witnesses to the events would have been shocked and disturbed and that they may suffer well into the future as a result of the incident"" . 

Eken 

32SP gave evidence of seeing Mr Eken involved in fighting in front of the check-in counters with Peter Zervas and another one of the Hells Angels (T2623). It would seem that this fighting was confined to punching and wrestling; there is no suggestion that he was involved in using any implement as a weapon. SP said that Mr Eken was on the ground at some stage, having either fallen or been knocked down. This could have been in the area where his small brown bag was later found, between two of the check-in counters. In his closing address to the jury, Mr Young did not dispute that Mr Eken was involved in some fighting. His case was put in terms of him having only acted in self-defence - ""He was fighting someone off so he could get away"" (T4558) - a proposition rejected by the jury beyond reasonable doubt. 

33Mr Eken left the scene in a taxi with some of the other Comancheros. They were arrested a short time later at Brighton-Le-Sands. Mr Eken's t-shirt was ripped and subsequent analysis revealed the DNA, most likely from blood, of one of the Hells Angels in two locations. 

34Mr Eken was charged with affray. He was remanded in custody until being released on bail on 15 June 2009. On 14 July 2009 he was charged with murder, refused bail, and has remained in custody since. It is agreed that his sentence should be backdated to 19 April 2009 to give credit for this pre-sentence custody. 

Potrus 

35Mr Potrus lost his shoes during the riot: one was found between the check-in counters and he was seen on security camera footage to be carrying the other one. The witness with the two children described seeing three men passing in front of her, coming from the direction of where the deceased was lying on the ground. She said one of them had no shoes on. No-one else lost their shoes and so it is reasonable to infer that this was a description of Mr Potrus coming from somewhere near to where the fatal assault occurred. I note that the Crown did not suggest that Mr Potrus was directly involved in that assault. 

36Potrus, Abounader, Costa and SP ran out of the terminal and, via a convoluted route, returned to the cars and made good their escape. Mr Potrus could be seen in security camera footage in the carpark lift carrying one of his shoes and wearing a singlet that was torn. He had clearly been involved in the fighting in some fashion. There was evidence from SP that he saw Mr Potrus fighting (T2622). In cross-examination he agreed that Mr Potrus had been hit and had fallen to the ground in the vicinity of where his shoe was later found. He also said that Mr Potrus had later complained of an injury to his jaw (T2909 - 2911). There was no medical evidence of any injury. The most there was on this topic was some vision of Mr Potrus rubbing his jaw when in the carpark lift. Mr Driels, counsel for Mr Potrus, as did other counsel, strongly challenged SP's honesty and reliability as a witness. It does not seem to me to be safe to act upon it unless independently confirmed. 

37Mr Potrus' case was that he had simply gone to the airport to meet ""his friends"" and to take them home safely (T4506). If he was involved in any fighting, it was in self-defence. Clearly the jury rejected that case in relation to the riot charge. 

38Mr Potrus was charged on 14 July 2009. He has been in custody since that time and so it would be appropriate to back-date his sentence to that date.

Objective seriousness of offence 

40This was an unusual riot. Commonly a riot involves public disorder directed at the government, government agencies such as the police, or commercial institutions, or is prompted by racial and/or religious tensions. Substantial property damage and looting are often encountered. This riot was concerned with the continuation of ongoing hostilities between rival outlaw motorcycle gangs. 

41There has been no suggestion that the riot was the subject of any real planning or premeditation. It had its genesis in three significant factors - the nature of the Comancheros with their culture of loyalty and with cowardice eschewed; the war with the Hells Angels; and the chance encounter with the Hells Angels president on flight QF430 from Melbourne. The first response from both sides was to summon reinforcements to Sydney airport. This may not have been done with the specific intention that there would be a violent confrontation but this confluence of events created what the Crown Prosecutor submitted in her closing address to the jury was the ""perfect storm for the eruption of violence by the Comanchero Motorcycle Club that day"" (T4143). 

42As between the two groups, I am satisfied that it was the Comancheros who were the principal aggressors. They were prepared to engage in violence at Gate 5 with their obvious advantage in numbers of 10 to 3. As can be seen from the above table, 9 out of those 10 have been found guilty by the jury or have earlier pleaded guilty. The Comancheros were prepared to continue with violence at an escalated level in the departure hall. Anthony Zervas having the temerity to make a pre-emptive strike against Hawi probably fuelled the aggression of at least some of the Comancheros. They outnumbered their enemy by 12 to 5. All but 1 of those 12 have either pleaded guilty, or have been found guilty, of playing a role in the unlawful violence that took place in the departure hall. On the other hand, only 2 of the 7 surviving Hells Angels have been found to be accountable. There has never been a suggestion that 4 of them (Wainohu, Baker, Martin and Khoury) were criminally responsible and the other (Padovan) has been held by a jury to be not criminally responsible. 

43A matter that is particularly relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the riot is the location in which it occurred. The participants were prepared to engage in wanton and significant violence regardless of the presence of many airline and airport staff and members of the public. An airport terminal is a place where people are entitled to expect safety and security. There were elderly people and small children present. A significant number of those who witnessed the events were utterly distressed and fearful. I have no doubt that the memory of it will live long in their minds. For example, I very much doubt that the mother who cowered in fear trying to protect her infant children would easily forget the experience. 

44In assessing the seriousness of the offence, I have had regard to the riot overall as well as to the actual role played by the offenders. I have borne in mind that the jury's verdicts necessitate that I exclude from consideration any responsibility of Mr Eken and Mr Potrus in relation to the death of Mr Anthony Zervas. Neither Mr Eken nor Mr Potrus could be regarded as having played a leading, organisational or inspirational role. Moreover, whilst they were clearly involved in the fighting, there is no suggestion that they took up weapons as others did. 

45I am satisfied that this was a serious example of an offence of riot. Indeed, Mr Driels, on a bail application, submitted that ""whilst the matter is serious ... it's not the worst"" (3.11.11 at 15.7). I accept that submission. 

46Not every one of the Hells Angels and the Comancheros were actually involved in the fighting. Some were merely present and willing to assist if required while others were present and not involved at all. Only three of the Hells Angels and about half of the Comancheros, including Mr Eken and Mr Potrus, were involved in the actual use of violence. Subject to consideration of the matters which follow, a significant period of imprisonment is called for in respect of both offenders. 


Subjective features - Eken 

47Mr Eken was born in 1983 and was aged 26 at the time of the offence. He is the third eldest of five children. His childhood was uneventful. He was educated to Year 11 and then has been in employment ""on and off"" until he entered custody. 

48He said in an affidavit that was tendered in the sentence proceedings that his father left the family and returned to Turkey when he was 6 and thereafter his eldest brother adopted a father figure role. This brother was sent to gaol for a lengthy period when Mr Eken was in his early 20's which, he said, left him feeling that he had no male support. 

49It was around this time that he was introduced by a friend to the Comancheros. He became a nominee member in 2006 and a full member in 2007. He said it ""felt as though it was a family kind of thing"" and he felt ""comfortable and secure because [he] was part of a brotherhood"" . He claimed that he was not a particularly active member and was not involved ""in the managerial or any other business of the club"" . He attended meetings only when he felt like going and he enjoyed the social aspect of the club. He said that he left the club after going to gaol and was successful in applying to be moved in the gaol away from other members. 

50The evidence concerning the latter was disputed. Detective Sergeant Walpole gave evidence of inquiries he had made of Corrective Services NSW. He referred to the situation concerning Menzies where there was both police intelligence and Corrective Services records that confirmed he had left the Comancheros and had applied to be moved to another gaol. In the case of the present offender there was ""zero intelligence"" and no Corrective Services records of any application to be moved away from fellow Comanchero members. Visitor records indicated that twice in the previous six weeks Mr Eken had received visits from persons who were Comanchero members with criminal records. In cross-examination it was suggested that these men were known to Mr Eken since before his Comanchero days. Detective Walpole did not know one way or the other. No evidence was proffered to support the suggestion. The Crown Prosecutor made the point that regardless of whether Mr Eken's association with these men predated his Comanchero membership, it remained significant in terms of his rehabilitation prospects that he was still associating with Comanchero members with criminal records. 

51Mr Eken said that at the time of his arrest he was a full-time carer for his disabled brother, Emre. Emre, who is now aged 23, was born with cerebral palsy and has a severe intellectual disability. He requires assistance with all aspects of daily living. He attends the Wesley Life Skills program at Granville for 6 hours a day on 4 days of each week but is otherwise, presumably, at home for the rest of the time. Mr Eken's mother has a severe and chronic psychiatric illness and is unable to provide adequate care for Emre on her own. Since the offender has been in gaol his sister, Nurten, has ceased full-time work in order to assist. Mr Eken's evidence, which was not challenged, was that his mother and sister are experiencing stress while he is absent and unable to fulfil the important role in the family that he carried out in relation to Emre prior to his incarceration. 

52Mr Eken said that he has spent his time in custody attempting to remain fit and by reading religious texts. He has attained a position of head sweeper. Upon his release he plans to return to live with his family; find employment in the construction industry; and assist with the care of his brother. His ultimate goal is to start a family business and try to provide for his family. 

Criminal history 

53Mr Eken has a criminal history which commenced with an offence of robbery in company. For that he received a community service order in the Children's Court in 1998. He was fined for an offence of goods in custody in 2002. Possession of steroids in 2006 brought a fine and a bond. Whilst this history is relatively modest in length, it denies to Mr Eken the leniency that could otherwise have been afforded to a person with no prior convictions. 

Remorse 

54Mr Eken's affidavit includes reference to his ""attitude to the offence"". He said that he is ""devastated"" by the behaviour at the airport and acknowledges that his behaviour and that of the others led to the death of another human being, something for which he is extremely sorry. He also appears to be quite perceptive in acknowledging that his membership of the Comancheros meant that other people's problems became his own and led to his completely unnecessary involvement in activities which had significant effects on other people and the community as a whole. There was no challenge to this evidence. I accept that he is genuinely remorseful. 

Rehabilitation prospects 

55Mr Young submitted that Mr Eken's rehabilitation prospects were ""reasonable"". He noted in this context that he has a family to whom he intends to return. I note as well that he appears to be committed to the care of his brother and appears to be concerned about the stress that his absence has caused to other members of his family. This has been his first experience of custody and it is to be hoped that this, and the other factors I have just mentioned, have provided him with the motivation not to offend in the future. There is, however, a concern about his continued association with Comanchero members and I am not persuaded by his claim that he is no longer a member. I conclude that Mr Young's assessment of Mr Eken's rehabilitation prospects as ""reasonable"", as opposed to ""good"", is a realistic one. 

Discount for willingness to plead guilty 

56Mr Eken was committed for trial on 23 September 2010. On 1 November 2010 his solicitors wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions conveying an offer to plead guilty to manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment. Surprisingly in my view, the offer was refused. On 16 May 2011 there was a renewed offer to plead guilty to manslaughter but it was again refused. 

57It is common ground that some discount should be allowed to Mr Eken for his willingness to plead guilty. Pomare Pirini pleaded guilty to manslaughter in this Court on 16 December 2010. Negotiations in relation to that plea were probably in train in the November-December 2010 period in which the present offender's offer was first advanced. It seems fair to allow the same discount as was allowed to Pirini, that is, 20 per cent. 

Onerous custodial conditions during trial 

58A submission was made that I should take into account certain onerous custodial conditions that Mr Eken has experienced. This is confined to the time he has been required to attend court for his trial. Normally, as the Crown Prosecutor rightly pointed out, it is not a mitigating factor that an offender has been required to attend court. However, in this case the trial was protracted, including the period during which the jury were deliberating. This involved Mr Eken being taken from his cell at an early hour; not returned until late in the day; being denied other than legal visits on those days and being denied recreational opportunities for an extended period. Being required to remain in the court cells for much of each day while the jury were deliberating for over a month, often without being required to be brought up to the court room at all, is also a relevant matter. Whilst this is not a major factor in mitigation, it is something to which I have had regard. 

Special circumstances 

59It was submitted by Mr Young, and not opposed by the Crown, that there should be a finding of special circumstances. I accept that submission. It would be in the interests of both Mr Eken and the community that there be a longer than usual period of parole supervision. The purpose of this is to ensure, as far as possible, that after Mr Eken's release from his first experience of gaol that he re-establishes a normal lawful community life, lives up to his undertakings to care for his brother and find employment, and avoids any further involvement with outlaw motorcycle gangs and their members. 


Subjective features - Potrus 

60Mr Potrus was born in Iraq in 1983 and so he was also aged 26 at the time of the offence. He is the eldest of three children. His family fled Iraq in 1990 and eventually found their way to Australia in 1993. 

61He left school at the age of 16 and has been in employment from that time until he entered custody. 

62The offender's sister described him in her affidavit as non-violent, respectful and hard-working. 

63A good friend and work-mate, Mr Charlie Ciantar, said in an affidavit that the offender had expressed a desire to ""get back to work, settle down and live a good law abiding life"" . Mr Ciantar works as a contract courier driver for a discount electrical retail outlet. The offender worked with him prior to going into custody and there is an offer of the same work being available upon his release. Mr Ciantar vouched for the offender being an honest, responsible and hard-working employee. 

64Mr Steve House, who is the chaplain to the inmates and staff at the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre at Silverwater, provided a testimonial. He stated that the offender is ""a welcoming, helpful and encouraging inmate"" . He attends the mid-week bible study group and Sunday church services. 

Criminal history 

65Mr Potrus has no previous criminal convictions. This, together with his prior good character, are mitigating features that should be taken into account in his favour. 

Remorse and rehabilitation prospects 

66The offender's father's affidavit records that the offender is aware of the worry and hurt he has caused to ""all persons involved in this matter"" as well as to his family. He has ""promised ... that he will never again put himself in this position again"" . He has expressed a desire to work, settle down and live a meaningful life. He is welcome to resume living in the family home upon his release. 

67The offender's sister believes that he has learnt from his time in custody. She said that he has promised that ""he will not be involved in anything like that [which] has caused him to be in prison"" . 

68Mr Ciantar expressed the opinion that the offender's experience in gaol has had a positive effect upon him and also that the offender would not re-offend. 

69Mr House thinks that the offender appears ""extremely remorseful for his actions, the pain and stress it has caused his family, friends, loved ones and the community"" . 

70It is a positive sign that the offender has expressed such thoughts to these people. However, whether he has truly accepted responsibility for his actions remains a difficult finding to make. It is hard to say when the evidence is confined to a few sentences in affidavits and a testimonial, some being reports of what the offender has said and others being expressions of the author's personal opinion, with nothing direct from the offender himself. 

71I am prepared to accept that the offender might be remorseful. I do accept that his past history, family support and employment prospects are positive indicators for his rehabilitation prospects. On the other hand, there is nothing to indicate that he understands the negative aspects of his membership of the Comanchero gang, or that he has any plans to renounce it. His rehabilitation prospects can be assessed as no more than ""reasonable"". 

Discount for willingness to plead guilty 

72As with Mr Eken, solicitors for Mr Potrus wrote to the Crown in November 2010 conveying an offer to plead guilty. In his case it was an offer to plead to riot. Although it was not offered, there was an implicit invitation to the Crown to indicate whether it was prepared to accept a plea to manslaughter. Remarkably, in my view, the Crown replied that it would only accept a plea to murder. 

73For the same reasons as I indicated in the case of Mr Eken, it is appropriate to allow a reduction of sentence of 20 per cent for the willingness of Mr Potrus to plead to the charge that he was subsequently convicted of. 

Onerous conditions of custody 

74Mr Driels made a submission along the same lines as that made by Mr Young about the unusually onerous conditions of his client's custody over the 6 months or so of the trial. He also referred to the 3 months that Mr Potrus was required to attend at the committal hearing. As I have said, this is a relevant, although not major, consideration and I will take it into account. 

Special circumstances 

75Mr Driels also submitted that there should be a finding of special circumstances because this was his client's first offence and that an extended period of supervision would serve as a reminder to him of the consequences that would befall him if he re-offended in the future. I do not think there is anything special about those circumstances. I do, however, think that an extended period under parole would serve a useful purpose in assisting him to resume his previous lawful lifestyle but particularly in ensuring that he avoids association with undesirable outlaw motorcycle gang members. 


Deterrence 

76Another important matter that must be factored into the assessment of the appropriate sentence is deterrence. Personal deterrence cannot be ignored, given the qualified findings I have made as to both offenders' rehabilitation prospects. 

77More important, however, is general deterrence; that is, the deterrence of others. It was brazen and arrogant for the offenders and their Comanchero colleagues to continue their dispute with the Hells Angels by carrying out a violent attack in such a public place as an airport terminal. 

78It is a regrettable and distressing fact of modern life that wars between rival bikie gangs occur from time to time. Those who perpetrate serious violence or property damage in pursuit of such wars must know that significant punishment awaits them upon detection. However, when the violence spills out into the public arena, as exemplified by this case, a clear message must be sent that it will be met by punishment that is severe. This is not the only reason, but is a major one, why I cannot accede to the submissions of counsel for each offender that they should be sentenced so as to facilitate their immediate or imminent release on parole. 


Parity 

79The only two offenders who have been sentenced for riot in respect of this matter are SP and AL. They pleaded guilty and were sentenced in the District Court. It has become apparent that they were sentenced on an incorrect factual basis; that they were not involved in perpetrating any actual violence but only for threatening violence. The elements of the offence of riot require that, in a context of 12 or more people using or threatening violence, the person under consideration actually used violence. This is something that the Crown had overlooked until part way through the trial, explicable perhaps because of an error in one of the criminal practice and procedure services. 

80It was an agreed fact in relation to both SP and AL that they had moved aggressively with the other Comancheros to confront the Hells Angels behind the check-in counters. Thereafter, SP did not assault anyone and AL picked up a bollard but threw it away, rather than using it offensively. His Honour Judge Charteris gave their subjective cases the same mitigating weight. Some aspects were more favourable than for the present offenders while others were not. A starting point of 6 years imprisonment for the charge of riot was adopted which was then discounted for the pleas of guilty and assistance to authorities. The total sentences imposed, involving partial accumulation with sentences for the affray, were 3 years with non-parole periods of 9 months. 

81I do not propose to adopt the same starting point as was applied by Judge Charteris in respect of SP and AL for riot. It was the same riot, of course, but their role was less than that of the present offenders. I will, however, bear their sentences in mind. 

82Costa, Aouli, La Rosa and Pirini were each sentenced upon their pleas of guilty to manslaughter and affray: R v Costa [2011] NSWSC 1392; R v Aouli [2011] NSWSC 1393; R v La Rosa [2011] NSWSC 1394; and R v Pirini [2011] NSWSC 1395. There was some variation in the facts of each case, both objective and subjective. The actual role they each played in the fighting was extremely minimal. They were dealt with on the basis that they were participants in a joint criminal enterprise to assault Hells Angels. Pirini confronted a Hells Angels member who was menacing him with a bollard but did not land a blow. Costa, Aouli and La Rosa were not involved in any fighting but acknowledged that they were willing to assist if required. 

83The total sentences imposed upon these four men ranged from 6 years 2 months to 7 years 1 month with non-parole periods ranging from 3 years 6 months to 3 years 9 months. The maximum penalty for manslaughter is 25 years whilst the maximum for riot is 15 years. Manslaughter involves the unlawful taking of a human life whereas riot does not. On the other hand, Mr Eken and Mr Potrus played a greater physical role in what took place than did Aouli, La Rosa and Costa and, in my assessment, Pirini. 

84Given that none of these offenders were sentenced for riot, no direct comparison of sentences is possible. It is difficult to compare a sentence for minimal involvement in a serious manslaughter to a sentence for actual involvement in a bad riot. Nevertheless, as the offences arose from the same incident it is appropriate to bear the other sentences in mind in order to maintain appropriate proportionality. 

85Mr Driels submitted that I should also have regard to the sentences imposed upon Ovalle and Peter Zervas. I was told that they each pleaded guilty to affray in the Local Court and were sentenced as indicated in the table above. I was not given any detail as to the basis upon which the sentencing magistrates arrived at their decisions. The Crown Prosecutor told me that one factor taken into account in the disposition of Peter Zervas' case was that there was extra curial punishment; a few days after the incident at the airport he was shot by someone believed to be a Comanchero and nearly died. Given the lesser offence for which they were dealt with, carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years and a jurisdictional limit in the Local Court of 2 years, it seems to me that the sentences imposed upon Ovalle and Peter Zervas are of very limited significance, if any at all. 

86As between Mr Eken and Mr Potrus themselves, there is nothing really to distinguish in relation to the seriousness of their offence. Their subjective cases are, of course, different, but balancing all factors, it seems to me that they warrant the same mitigating weight. Neither Mr Young nor Mr Driels submitted that there should be any distinction between the two. I intend to impose identical sentences, subject only to differences in commencement dates. 


SENTENCE - Eken 

Convicted. 

Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of the term of the sentence of 2 years. 

The sentence is to date from 19 April 2009. Mr Eken will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 18 April 2012. 


SENTENCE - Potrus 

Convicted. 

Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of the term of the sentence of 2 years. 

The sentence is to date from 14 July 2009. Mr Potrus will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 13 July 2012. 

In each case, that is a total sentence of 5 years. Without the offers to plead guilty which were rejected by the Crown, it would have been a sentence of 6 years 3 months.

2758542,R v Mitchell PERRINGTON [2012] NSWDC 55,"SENTENCE


1This is not the first time that Mitchell Perrington is to be sentenced for break enter and steal. He has several convictions for that very offence on his criminal record. 

2On this occasion his offence was more serious and he has pleaded guilty to an aggravated break enter and steal and is to be sentenced by me.

3Section 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 fixes a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to the offence which Mitchell Perrington committed. Not only that, the Parliament has seen fit to fix a standard non-parole period of 5 years to that crime.

4Briefly, this is what happened which brought about the charge which Mr Perrington is being sentenced for. 

5He had a significant drug and alcohol problem for a young man who was at the time about 22. Under the influence of drugs and alcohol, he and some others broke in to somebody's home. The people who lived in the home were both aged in their mid seventies. The home was next door to where one of Mr Perrington's co offenders lived. The home was in Windale.

6What Mr Perrington and the others had done was to jump over the fence, smash a glass panel and let themselves in. They ransacked a cupboard downstairs and took an air rifle and an ornamental bow and arrows set. Mr Perrington raided the fridge and took some food and they also took a couple of mobile phones and a camera, as well as a bottle of whiskey and some keys. They tried to get into the car, but the keys would not operate the car. 

7They went back to the co-offender's house. One of the phones they used to make abusive phone calls to numbers which were already on the phone. One of the phone calls they made was to the victim's adult daughter. She came to her parents' place to investigate and found that the house had been robbed but that, fortunately, her parents were upstairs asleep.

8The police raided the neighbour's place and found evidence which linked Mr Perrington to the crime. He was arrested almost a month later, on 29 June 2011. He was interviewed by the police and placed in custody. He was in custody until 10 August 2011, some six weeks.

9As I said, he has committed the offence of break enter and steal on previous occasions. He was sentenced by the Newcastle Local Court on 1 December 2011 and given the benefit of a bond under section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He was back before the Belmont Local Court a couple of months later, where he again received a bond for the same kind of offence, this time with a recommendation or requirement for drug and alcohol rehabilitation. Some months later he appeared again in the Newcastle Local Court for the same kind of offence and was given the benefit of another bond.

10Mr Perrington has received an encouraging report from John Murtas, an officer of the Probation and Parole Service at the Lake Macquarie District Office. The report describes Mr Perrington as being a ""product of his dysfunctional upbringing, having experienced significant periods of his formative years witness to domestic violence and family dysfunction. His development has been strongly influenced by associations with like minded groups with antisocial tendencies. Nevertheless, he has managed on this occasion to complete an alcohol and other drugs residential rehabilitation program."" The report noted that he has made ""a shift in his behaviours and maintained a lifestyle which has not attracted the attention of law enforcement."" The author of the report described Mr Perrington's ""presentation to this service"" as being ""positive and respectable, given his history of poor response in the past."" The author thought that Mr Perrington may have reached a watershed in his life. He thought that he was suitable for a medium level of supervision. The report referred to a past which had been affected by drug and alcohol abuse. He had taken alcohol as long as he could remember and had a significant alcohol problem by the age of about 12 or 13. He started cannabis at the age of 13 and was smoking it on a daily basis, up to 20 cones a day. He was also taking ecstasy and ice 2 or 3 times a week. He left school when he completed year 7, aged about 15.

11Mr Bruce, who appeared for Mr Perrington, called his client to give evidence. Mr Perrington gave evidence about his father being violent and affected by alcohol. He has stayed, however, in contact with his own mother who has recently, or in the last 12 months or so, commenced to live with her partner, Mr Delore, with whom Mr Perrington has developed a positive relationship. 

12At least one other partner of his mother, after Mr Perrington's father left, drank heavily and was very violent. He was a man who was in his mid-forties and very tall and on one occasion when Mr Perrington and his sister confronted the man for being violent to their mother, the man hit Mr Perrington and broke his jaw. Mr Bruce tendered as exhibit 2 an x-ray report confirming that Mr Perrington had suffered a broken jaw in 2008.

13Mr Perrington said his mother was always there for him, but his father, in addition to being violent, had also hurt his mother and at one stage had kidnapped him and his sister. It was his father who had introduced him to his first drink.

14Mr Perrington has, with his current partner, a daughter, Allayna, who is 10 months old. 

15When he was interviewed by the police, he offered them significant assistance and still maintains his readiness to give evidence against any co offenders.

16The six weeks he spent in Cessnock Prison, bail refused, was his first experience in custody, and he described himself as being ""really scared"" and described the prison as being a ""frightening place"". It, however, gave him an opportunity to think about the sort of behaviour he had been engaged in and what he had done to the victims of the crime I am sentencing him for. He realised that his behaviour was affecting all those around him who loved him, and realised that he was in fact loved by those around him. He acknowledged that the victims of his offence would probably not feel safe in their own home, and was very remorseful. He acknowledged under cross-examination by Mr Outram, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, that he had put aside a couple of hundred dollars to make provision for compensation, which the victims of the crime are claiming in the amount of some $2200. He is prepared to pay the balance of that off. He acknowledged that the crime which he committed was a very stupid thing to do. He is hoping to secure some employment in the future in Morisset. He described to Mr Outram in cross-examination his drug taking habits and the fact that a SIM card from one of the stolen phones was broken. He described Mr Delore as his mentor.

17Significantly, when Mr Perrington was released on bail from his remand on 10 August 2011, he entered some weeks later an alcohol and drug rehabilitation centre called The Glen Centre. There is a report which Mr Bruce tendered as exhibit 1 from that centre dated 22 November 2011. It said that Mr Perrington had ""participated well in the program and has talked to the counselling staff when issues have come up for him. Mitch is a nice young man who has worked hard while in residence with us to address his issues around his drug use."" It said that he had attended counselling as well as group sessions, parenting courses and had enjoyed the work and sporting programs.

18Mr Bruce realistically acknowledged that the offence called for a penalty involving imprisonment, but argued that the penalty should not exceed, ultimately, 2 years. He argued that the objective seriousness of the crime was below the middle of the range of objective seriousness, and Mr Outram did not take exception to that submission.

19Although there was some planning, said Mr Bruce, it was limited.

20There was an early plea of guilty and an offer of assistance to authority and his client's remorse, he argued, was patently genuine.

21He referred to his client's background in his formative years and his experience in custody.

22The rehabilitation course at The Glen Centre was for some 3 months, and Mr Bruce argued that it was a strictly residential program, so that it was not unlike being required to stay in custody, and I could allow some 50 per cent of that time to count as pre-sentence custody, along with the six weeks which his client had served in gaol on remand.

23He argued that his client's prospects of rehabilitation were good.

24Mr Outram pointed to the sentence which one of the co-offenders had received. He pointed out that parity is strictly not an issue because the co offender was a juvenile. The co-offender had been dealt with in the Children's Court for the same offence, and received a probation order for 12 months.

25Mr Outram did not disagree with the submission that the final sentence might be one of 2 years or less, given the period of pre-sentence custody and the period in the residential rehabilitation centre and there was, he said, no factor under section 21A(2) which was appropriate to draw my attention to. There must be some good prospects of rehabilitation, given Mr Perrington's experience at The Glen. He acknowledged Mr Perrington's remorse and demonstrated contrition by putting aside the money for compensation.

26I regard an appropriate commencement sentence as 3 years imprisonment. I find it to be well below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I have also taken into account that Mr Perrington has effectively served some 4 months of imprisonment already and I have taken that into account in assessing 3 years as an appropriate commencement figure for the sentence. The planning was very limited. Mr Perrington is a young man and his rehabilitation prospects I regard as very good.

27Mr Perrington has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity which itself attracts a discount of some 25 per cent to the sentence which I would ordinarily impose. In addition, he has already assisted the authorities by giving them information and has agreed to provide further assistance if need be. I regard an appropriate combined discount for those two facts as being some 33 per cent.

28Accordingly, I propose to reduce the otherwise appropriate sentence of 3 years imprisonment to one of 2 years imprisonment, which is the sentence which I will impose.

29The sentence which I originally fixed before the discount does not involve the standard non-parole period for the following reasons. First is the plea of guilty entered by Mr Perrington and, secondly, his good prospects of rehabilitation. In addition, I have taken into account his genuine remorse and the assistance which he gave to the authorities. Those are all factors which I have taken into account in fixing that sentence, which are also factors which are relevant to not fixing the standard non-parole period.

30Despite the opportunities he has been given by courts in the past with good behaviour bonds, I propose to suspend the sentence as Mr Bruce submitted I could do, and Mr Outram did not disagree with that submission.

31I propose to do that because of the significant commitment which Mr Perrington has made to his own rehabilitation, as demonstrated by the three months which he has spent in the full time residential rehabilitation centre, The Glen Centre. As I said, I think his prospects of rehabilitation are good.

HIS HONOUR: Now, Mr Perrington, if you would stand up.

32I convict you of the offence of aggravated break enter and steal. I impose a sentence of imprisonment of 2 years in respect of that offence and under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I suspend the execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole period of the 2 years and I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for 2 years.

HIS HONOUR: Have a seat. Now, Mr Bruce and Mr Outram, terms of the bond, please. Conditions, I should say.

BRUCE: It is clearly a matter that your Honour would be attracted to the proposition that he attend upon Probation and Parole, drug and alcohol being matters that--

HIS HONOUR: Probation and Parole supervision; drug and alcohol. Anything else? I don't think so. Which office should he report to? What's the nearest?

BRUCE: Your Honour, Newcastle would be more convenient, for reasons of transport and the like.

33The conditions of the bond are these: one, that he be of good behaviour; two, that he attend court when called upon to do so; three, that he notify the registrar of this Court of any change in his residential address; four, that he accept supervision from the Probation and Parole Service and any reasonable recommendations and directions given by that service, including directions concerning the following - alcohol and drug rehabilitation, areas of relapse, aggression and violence, completing any program addressing those issues, as well as the managing emotions developmental program. He is to report to the office of the Probation and Parole Service at Newcastle on or before 5.00pm next Wednesday, 8 February 2012.

34I note that the indictment by which Mr Perrington was arraigned was dated 2 February 2012, but in fact he was arraigned on 1 February 2012.

HIS HONOUR: Now, in a moment I will explain what I need to explain. Are there any other formal matters that I need to do, Mr Outram, Mr Bruce?

OUTRAM: No, your Honour.

35Now, Mr Perrington, you have received a gaol sentence. It is 2 years. Do you understand, I have given you 2 years. But I have suspended the sentence. You have not had one of those before. It means just that, your sentence is suspended. It is suspended for 2 years, and attached to it is a good behaviour bond, just like you have had before. You have had similar conditions before. I am sending you to Probation and Parole. They know what they are doing, they will help you, or they will support you in the good work you are already doing. They have got some programs which are referred to in their report, which Mr Bruce has asked you to read, relapse prevention, obviously important with somebody with issues like you, dealing with aggression or violence, and managing emotions, things like that. It is important that you turn up to the Probation and Parole Office here at Newcastle before next Wednesday at 5.00pm.

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.

36And there are certain other formal conditions. You have got to behave yourself generally; no drunken driving, or fights or anything like that. If you change your address, you have got to let the registrar of this Court know, you have got to write a letter or send an email. And if you get a notice saying you have got to come to court, then you turn up. We do not want to have to send the police or the sheriffs out to get you; you have got to turn up.

37Now, the most important thing to say to you about this is something I think Mr Bruce referred to earlier. This is not like the other good behaviour bonds that you have had. It is not. It looks the same, but if you breach this one and you come back before me - and I usually ask for offenders to come back before me - it might have been Mr Outram who said this, it is very hard for the judge not to send you to gaol. The legislation is such that, pretty well, if you break the bond, my hands are tied. All I have to do is fix a non-parole period and send you back into gaol. It is very difficult to get out of it. It is not just a matter of saying, ""Well, look, this is what happened when he broke the bond, it was just bad luck, and he just had too much to drink, and this and that."" It does not count. In you go. That is because it is a suspended sentence. It is not just saying, ""Look, off on a good behaviour bond, don't do it again."" I have actually sentenced you to gaol for 2 years, but I have suspended it on condition that you behave yourself, and if you breach it, then it is pretty well my obligation to impose that sentence and fix a non-parole period. So you have got to be very aware of that, and I think you will find that Mr Bruce will probably remind you again. I think you probably have to go to the registry to sign the bond, so Mr Bruce will tell you about that as well.

HIS HONOUR: Now, anything else?

OUTRAM: Only this; for abundant caution, I might amend the indictment, if I can, and initial the amendment, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: If you can, yes.

OUTRAM: I can do that.

HIS HONOUR: That's why I looked at it, and it looks as though it's signed by Ms Booth, and I wasn't sure whether you would be able to amend it or not, which is why I put it on the record.

OUTRAM: I have been around forever, your Honour, and have that delegated authority.

HIS HONOUR: Good. Thanks, Mr Bruce, thanks, Mr Outram.

38Now, you have heard everything that I said. It sounds as though you are getting things back on track, Mr Perrington. As you could hear, I was very impressed by your Glen program. You have got the family behind you, you have got your own family now, and you have got Mr Delore as your mentor, you have got your mum, your partner and your daughter. So it is up to you now. So, good luck.

2758544,R v Mathew John RIDGEWAY [2012] NSWDC 53,"SENTENCE


1I am sentencing a man who took exception to the behaviour of somebody else in the community. Rather than assisting in lawfully resolving what he saw to be inappropriate behaviour, the man acted to mete out his own form of punishment that he thought was appropriate. The man I am sentencing put the other man through what must have been a terrifying ordeal for some hours. 

2The man I am sentencing is Mathew John Ridgeway who is now 30 years old. As a result of what he did, he has been charged with 2 crimes.

3One I will call aggravated kidnapping which is an offence against s 86(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to that crime.

4The other is aggravated robbery which is an offence against s 95(1) of the Crimes Act and also carries a maximum of 20 years imprisonment. (If I referred to aggravated kidnapping, I withdraw that. It is kidnapping - formally known as detaining with intent to obtain an advantage.) 

5In addition, Mr Ridgeway has asked me to take into account, when I am sentencing him, another crime that he has pleaded guilty to. That is a crime of stealing a motorcar and it was committed the day after, or at about the same time as, the crimes that I am sentencing him for. He and the solicitor for the prosecutor have signed a document asking me to take that into account under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and I will take that into account and I sign the document accordingly.

6It is important for a judge, in sentencing a person, to briefly set out what happened to bring about the charges that the judge is sentencing the person for. I referred in my opening remarks to inappropriate behaviour. The man whose behaviour Mr Ridgeway took exception to was called Darren Ridley, a 42 year old married man. 

7Mr Ridley ran into some teenage girls in the early hours of one morning and over the next few months stayed in contact with them and regularly gave them lifts around Newcastle. He was almost acting as a taxi service, responding to their requests for lifts here there and everywhere. 

8On one occasion he received a text message from one of the girls to which he responded. It had some sexual connotation to it. The sexual connotation, it seems, was contained in both the text sent by the girl and the text which Mr Ridley responded with. 

9Mr Ridley assisted in buying some alcohol on the evening of 1 September 2010 for the girls and a boy who was with them. He dropped them off near Hunter Street Mall here in Newcastle that night. The particular girl whom he had exchanged texts with, he called aside and told her that he liked her. She replied, ""That's weird"" and ran off. The two girls involved were 16, although Mr Ridley says he thought they were 17. They asked him whether he was married and he said he was, including that he had children. Mr Ridley told the girl that he really liked her and she maintained that she found that to be weird. He still offered to give them a lift later on if they needed one. 

10Indeed, a few hours later at 3.00am on 2 September 2010 he received a phone call asking whether he could collect them from Wickham and then to get one of the other girls from Waratah. When he turned up at Wickham at about 3.00am, Mr Ridgeway was waiting with another man, Mr Mitchell. They all got into the car. Mr Ridgeway sat in the front passenger seat and Mr Mitchell sat in the back. The girls were in the back. As Mr Mitchell got in he showed a screwdriver which he held to Mr Ridley. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence before me that Mr Ridgeway knew that Mr Mitchell was showing Mr Ridley the screwdriver. 

11Mr Ridley was told to drive the group around and as they were driving around Mr Ridgeway expressed his grievance to Mr Ridley. He said, ""Do you like picking up young girls?"". Mr Ridley said, ""No"". Mr Ridgeway said, ""Do you know they're only 15?"". Mr Ridley replied, ""No, I was told they were 17"". Mr Ridgeway said, ""Come on mate, they look like bloody 10 year olds"".

12Mr Ridgeway told Mr Ridley that the girls had contacted him because of the remark he had made earlier on to the girl about liking her and Mr Ridgeway told Mr Ridley that that had ""freaked them out"". Mr Ridley said that he did not mean to scare them and Mr Ridgeway replied, ""You're a paedophile and a rock spider"". They continued to talk about the girls and their age, then Mr Ridgeway punched Mr Ridley in the mouth. Mr Ridley, it was clear, had no choice about his own movements at that stage. He was directed to the Waratah train station where they picked up the girl that Mr Ridley had made the remark to. Mr Ridgeway told Mr Ridley that he, Mr Ridgeway, was associated with the Life and Death Motorcycle Club and he was supposed to take Mr Ridley back to their clubhouse. In addition, Mr Ridgeway told Mr Ridley that they were going to stab him. 

13After they picked up the girl from the Waratah train station, Mr Ridgeway demanded Mr Ridley's phone and it was handed over. Mr Ridgeway then asked Mr Ridley for his wallet. He handed that over as well but kept back his key card. 

14Mr Ridgeway then took over the driving of the car. They drove to the house of one of the girls. The mother of the girl came out and abused Mr Ridley. Again, Mr Ridgeway punched Mr Ridley in the face. Mr Ridgeway required Mr Ridley to apologise to the girl he had made the remark to, which he did. 

15They kept on driving. Mr Ridley was blindfolded for a time. The threat to stab him was repeated. The key card which Mr Ridley had removed from his wallet before handing it across to Mr Ridgeway was found by Mr Ridgeway in the compartment in the door of the car. Mr Ridgeway demanded Mr Ridley's PIN number and told him that if he was lying he would stab him. He required to know how much money was in the account. Mr Ridley was put into the back seat, blindfolded by Mr Mitchell and told to lie down. They drove to an ATM where Mr Ridgeway took out $80 in cash. Those transactions were recorded at just after 6.15am. 

16Still not satisfied, Mr Ridgeway drove the car from Newcastle to bushland at Medowie. Mr Ridgeway took Mr Ridley out of the car and walked him about 100 metres along a bush track. They went further into the bush. He then told Mr Ridley to take his clothes off. He told Mr Ridley he would throw his clothes out along the track as they drove off. He was told not to turn around until they had driven off. Mr Ridley complied. Mr Ridgeway drove off with the clothes. 

17Mr Ridley started walking back along the bush track. He had no idea where he was. He came upon a woman who was walking her dog. She directed him to a council worker. Mr Ridley found the worker who gave him some overalls and a phone. Mr Ridley phoned his wife and she came to collect him. She collected him at about 9.30am that morning. Mr Ridley's car which Mr Ridgeway had driven off with was later found burnt out at Broadmeadow. 

18Still not satisfied, Mr Ridgeway turned up at Mr Ridley's house the following morning. Mr Ridgeway had the keys to another car which was owned by Mr Ridley and his wife, a Hyundai. They got into that car and Mr Ridgeway drove off. They drove to Jesmond where Mr Ridley was dropped off and Mr Ridgeway drove off but did not come back.

19As a result of that criminal activity by Mr Ridgeway, he was charged with the kidnapping offence and with the robbery because he stole from Mr Ridley the phone, cash, a key card, keys and clothing. The robbery was an aggravated form of robbery because at the time Mr Ridley was being held captive. The theft of the Hyundai the following morning is the charge which I am to take into account under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act when I am sentencing Mr Ridgeway for the two primary crimes. 
20The offence was committed, as I have said, on 2 September 2010. Mr Ridgeway was formally arrested some months later on 16 March 2011. When he was arrested he was in fact in custody in respect of other matters. He was committed for trial on 6 July 2011. When he was arraigned in the District Court here in Newcastle on 11 August, he pleaded not guilty, so the trial was listed for 7 November last year. However in the meantime, on 20 October 2011, Mr Ridgeway pleaded guilty to the two counts which I am sentencing him for and to the theft of the car which I am asked to take into account. 

21It is important for a judge also to have and refer to information which is personal to an offender whom the judge is sentencing. One of the most important pieces of information is an offender's previous criminal record. Mr Ridgeway has quite an extensive criminal record. He committed his first offence when he was aged 17. Before he turned 18 he committed other offences which were mostly driving offences and other petty crimes. However he committed further crimes once he became an adult the following year. Once again it was a car theft and he served his first time in prison aged 18 when he received a 4 month prison sentence. Since then he has committed more serious offences including robbery, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, a theft and break, enter and steal. 

22It is obvious, given that he first went to gaol aged 18 and is now 30, that he has spent a significant period of his adult life in prison. 

23Another factor which is important for a judge to take into account is any sentence imposed upon a co-offender. In this case the co-offender, Mr Mitchell, was sentenced by the Chief Judge, Blanch J, on 19 September 2011. Mr Mitchell was sentenced for four crimes, only one of which was a crime corresponding to the crime which I am sentencing Mr Ridgeway for. The crime that did correspond is the kidnapping and his Honour imposed a fixed term of 4 years imprisonment on Mr Mitchell for that kidnapping, which was the same kidnapping that I am sentencing Mr Ridgeway for. It is important to note that Mr Mitchell had no prior criminal history at all and was also diagnosed with a psychiatric condition which his Honour took into account.

24Mr Malcolm, who appeared for Mr Ridgeway, called his client to give evidence. His evidence was consistent with his criminal record showing nothing serious occurring until he was just under 18. He said that he was adopted at the age of about 3 months. Mr Ridgeway himself is aboriginal and he was adopted by a non-aboriginal family and received what he described as a normal upbringing in a great home. Indeed, he said he ""had it all"" as he was growing up. There were some complications with the adopting procedure because of his ethnic background and the ethnic background of the adopting parents. 

25He was adopted into a family where he had a sister already in the family who was 13 or 14 years older, who was also adopted. As he grew up he experienced some racism in the local community and moved around with some boys who were in the same situation as he was. When he was 16 he moved out of home and moved in with his sister. He had been to school at Newcastle High School and dropped out in Year 9 because of some trouble which he said he had brought about at the school. 

26At one stage a doctor had diagnosed him with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and prescribed some strong medication for him. However, in the meantime Mr Ridgeway started drinking a fair amount of alcohol, although he did not get involved very much in drugs at that stage. His relationship with his sister understandably began to change when he engaged in this behaviour and he was testing his limits and as he described it, he ""bucked it"". It was a question of survival so far as he was concerned. He did a bit of work in security in licensed premises. He also joined the Rebels motorcycle gang, but left 18 months ago and, as he said, his departure from the Rebels was ""not well received"". 

27When he committed these crimes that I am sentencing him for, he had been out of custody for a period of time. He had been alcohol and drug free in custody and remained off alcohol and drugs and developed a relationship with Stacey Boyce in about July 2010. That relationship gave him what he described as a whole different outlook. Stacey Boyce had daughters who are presently aged about seven and five and she showed him a side of life which he had not experienced before. 

28He explained his behaviour towards the unfortunate Mr Ridley as being prompted by feeling disturbed at Mr Ridley being involved in these teenage girls and he, Mr Ridgeway, wanted to put a stop to it. 

29Since he has been in custody he has had to be segregated very strictly because the custodial centre where he is being held also holds a number of members of the Rebels motorcycle gang, so he finds that he is only able to get out for about 10 minutes a day. 

30His own biological father he knew and that man stayed in touch with him. He knew him as an uncle - or as visiting him as an uncle - and described him as always working but also ""a pisshead"". He chose not to find his birth mother. 

31Cross-examined by Ms Gomez who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Ridgeway said that he had met the girls whose interests he was protecting only on that same day. His attention was drawn to them because one of them was crying and they told him that a grown man was following them around. Mr Ridgeway felt that he should do something about it. It was, as he said, all pretty much on the spur of the moment that he did it and he did not think very much about it, but Mr Ridgeway in his own words wanted to ""scare the hell out of him"" so that he would not chase girls again.

32I was assisted by both Ms Gomez and Mr Malcolm in their submissions. Mr Malcolm argued that I should take into account, or think carefully about, when I should commence the sentence. The sentence on one view could be commenced on 16 March - from 16 March last year when Mr Ridgeway was arrested - but Mr Malcolm pointed out that his client could have been charged as early as 22 December 2010 when the police had received evidence of positive photographic identification of Mr Ridgeway. In addition he came before the Local Court on another matter on 17 January 2011 when he was sentenced for another matter.

33I have decided to commence the sentence from 17 January 2011. Mr Ridgeway was after all serving custody before then, related to another matter. I could date the sentence much later than that, but I have decided to accept as reasonable Mr Malcolm's submission and I will commence the sentence from 17 January 2011.

34I have to be careful, Mr Malcolm said, that the aggravating factor in the robbery was the fact that it was committed whilst Mr Ridley was being held captive and I have to be careful not to double count. 

35Mr Malcolm referred to s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and acknowledged that his client had a record of previous convictions, but submitted that this was a particular kind of offence given the motivation that drove it. He acknowledged that there was some degree of planning, but that it was on the spur of the moment with a very limited degree of planning that both crimes were committed. He referred to the sentence imposed upon the co-offender, but acknowledged the two factors which I have mentioned about the co-offender having no criminal record and having a mental health issue.

36I accept all of those submissions which I have referred to so far. 

37Mr Malcolm frankly acknowledged that he could not point to any evidence of remorse as s 21A(3)(i) requires, but asked me to take into account the fact that his client had pleaded guilty. 

38His upbringing was solid and reliable but, as Mr Malcolm said, it was not by his own biological family. Mr Malcolm realistically acknowledged that the plea of guilty was not entered at the earliest available opportunity, but was between the call over and the trial date and after legal advice. The trial might have lasted some time and Mr Malcolm urged me to provide his client with a discount for pleading guilty of 15 per cent. 

39Mr Malcolm pointed out that in the sentence the normal ratio of 75 per cent between a non-parole period and the total sentence could be adjusted downwards because of the circumstances in which his client was serving his sentence being fairly isolated. 
40Ms Gomez acknowledged that aspect, which I have just referred to. She submitted that Mr Ridgeway's prospects of rehabilitation must be guarded. 

41Mr Malcolm, I should have mentioned earlier, suggested that his client may have changed his ways and Ms Boyce had obviously had stabilising influence on his life. As he said, if he had not had the conversation with the girls, he would not be in the position where he is now. 

42But, as Ms Gomez pointed out, the offences which Mr Ridgeway committed were serious and the kidnapping was a long, drawn out incident which must have been very frightening for Mr Ridley. Ms Gomez fairly acknowledged that a discount of 10 to 15 per cent was not inappropriate. She emphasised the importance of stopping others from robbing other people and specifically the importance of stopping what might be described as vigilante behaviour, which is the kind of behaviour that Mr Ridgeway engaged in in this case. It is important that people do not, as she said, dish out their own retribution.

43There were two aggravating factors which Ms Gomez referred to. There was obviously the threatened use of violence and the threatened use of a weapon. In a sense they were both the same aggravating feature and was brought about by Mr Ridgeway threatening to stab Mr Ridley. 

44Ms Gomez reminded me of what the Court of Criminal Appeal had said about the offence of armed robbery in the guideline judgment in Regina v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. Most of the common elements taken into account by the Court of Criminal Appeal in that case were present in this, except that Mr Ridley was not in the kind of vulnerable position described in that case, like a shopkeeper or a taxi driver. Nor was Mr Ridley a young offender with no or little criminal history. He was aged 29 at the time and had a significant criminal history. Ms Gomez pointed out the significance of the factors I have already referred to so far as the sentencing of the co-offender was concerned.

45In turning to the sentences which I propose to impose, the kidnapping was the more serious offence. As I said, in a vigilante fashion, Mr Ridgeway decided to take the law into his own hands and to effectively become judge, jury and executioner in respect of what he regarded as Mr Ridley's inappropriate behaviour. 

46There were aspects to the kidnapping which, to my mind, should be referred to. It seems as though the episode lasted for about three or four hours. There were threats by Mr Ridgeway, at least on three occasions during that time, to stab Mr Ridley. There was a threat to take him back to a motor cycle gang's headquarters. Mr Ridley was blindfolded. He was taken out to the bush along a track. He was humiliated by having his clothes removed. It was, to my mind, a serious offence of kidnapping. It had the aggravating features which I have already referred to. 

47The robbery is one which, to my mind, falls a little bit above the range which the Court of Criminal Appeal has indicated is appropriate for the offence of armed robbery which it has referred to.

48I would regard an appropriate initial sentence for the kidnapping offence as 8 years imprisonment. Because Mr Ridgeway has pleaded guilty, I propose to discount that 8 years imprisonment by slightly under 15 per cent and to reduce the sentence of 8 years for kidnapping to one of 6 ½ years. 

49I regard an appropriate sentence for the robbery in company as one of 5 ½ years. I have already taken into account that that is a sentence which is a little above the guideline and I also take into account that the guideline itself was decided before the guideline concerning a recommended 25 per cent for the earliest available plea. I have taken those factors into account. 

50I propose to allow for special circumstances in adjusting slightly what the normal non-parole period would be in respect of the sentence which I am about to impose.

51All right Mr Ridgeway, I am going to sentence you now, if you would stand up. 

52For the offence of robbery in company, I sentence you to 5 ½ years imprisonment. That will commence on 17 January 2011 and expire on 16 July 2016.

53For the offence of kidnapping, I sentence you to 6 ½ years imprisonment. That will commence one year later on 17 January 2012 and that will expire on 16 July 2018. 

54The total sentence is 7 ½ years, commencing 17 January 2011 and expiring 16 July 2018. I fix one single non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months, commencing 17 January 2011 and expiring on 16 April 2017. The balance of the sentence is 1 year and 3 months commencing 17 April 2017 and expiring on 16 July 2018. The earliest date on which it seems that you will be eligible for release is 16 April 2017 and your release will depend upon the Parole Authority.

HIS HONOUR: Now have a seat Mr Ridgeway. First the figures.

MALCOLM: Yes your Honour, two matters, just a matter of factual correctness.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, please.

MALCOLM: As at paragraph 5 of the facts referred to specifically, the girls were under 16.

HIS HONOUR: Oh thank you. Did I say they were 16?

MALCOLM: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you, I note that. 

55I correct the remarks I made that the girls were in fact under 16, thank you.

MALCOLM: And secondly, your Honour not formally indicated taking the Form 1 offence into account.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you, no, you are quite right about that. I referred to it and at the time that I signed it and in fixing the sentence which I did for the kidnapping.

56I have taken into account the offence of stealing the motor car, which is the subject of the form under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

HIS HONOUR: Thanks Mr Malcolm. Now any factual or legal matters Mr-

OUTRAM: Only this your Honour. Your Honour found special circumstances.

HIS HONOUR: I did.

OUTRAM: I take it the reason was his harsh conditions.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I accepted Mr Malcolm's submission that he is doing the time harder, so to speak, because of the isolation.

OUTRAM: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

OUTRAM: And the 166 certificate.

HIS HONOUR: Thanks, we will come to that. Now the figures, I think they are right, but.

MALCOLM: I would respectfully disagree your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

MALCOLM: In relation to the kidnap offence, your Honour fixed a total sentence of 6 ½ years. Commencement date was expressed to be 17 January 2012.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

MALCOLM: And the expiry date would appear to be incorrect.

HIS HONOUR: 16 July 2018 was the expiry date. Commence 17 January 2012 expired 16 July 2018.

MALCOLM: I'm sorry, I had that as July - January.

HIS HONOUR: 17 January 2012 expired 16 July 2018.

MALCOLM: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Anything else? No. Any other factual or legal matters apart from the certificate? Mr Outram?

OUTRAM: I'll just confirm this if I might your Honour?

HIS HONOUR: Yes, go ahead.

OUTRAM: The non-parole in respect of count 1 is 6 years 3 months with a 1 year 3 month balance of term.

HIS HONOUR: There is a single non-parole period of both, so in fact the--

OUTRAM: The first one is a 5 ½ year--

HIS HONOUR: Fixed term, so to speak, yes.

MALCOLM: That's all I wanted to confirm your Honour, is a fixed term.

HIS HONOUR: All right, now the certificate Mr Outram.

OUTRAM: Yes your Honour, perhaps if we deal with it this way. I understand that my friend would like or ask that sequence eight on that certificate be remitted back to the Local Court to be dealt with in that jurisdiction. I would anticipate a mention date in four weeks time would be appropriate. 

HIS HONOUR: At some stage give me a date.

OUTRAM: I will.

HIS HONOUR: What about charge 3, 4, 6 and 7.

OUTRAM: The 29th of this month would be appropriate your Honour for number 8.

HIS HONOUR: Sure, now is it a leap year?

MALCOLM: It is.

HIS HONOUR: 29 February. Okay, and what about 3, 4, 6 and 7. What do you want me to do with those?

OUTRAM: I understand that there will be pleas of guilty entered in respect of each of those your Honour.

MALCOLM: That's correct your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

OUTRAM: And in relation to each of those matters, it would be my submission that a sentence for each that is wholly subsumed within the non-parole period in respect of count 2 would be appropriate for each your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: That is the--

OUTRAM: No your Honour, that is the s 95.

HIS HONOUR: Oh the robbery, yes, I sentenced him on the robbery first, yes.

OUTRAM: It expires within the - I would have thought your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I do not really know anything about these, or do I?

OUTRAM: Well they arise out of the - the dishonestly obtain financial advantage--

HIS HONOUR: I see. I see.

OUTRAM: They arise out of the circumstances your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I could give him a 1 month sentence for each of them.

OUTRAM: I wouldn't argue against that your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: What do you say Mr Malcolm?

OUTRAM: There would be some disqualifications in respect of--

HIS HONOUR: Well let us just do one thing at a time.

OUTRAM: Okay.

57In respect of the matters referred to on the certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and the related matters referred to on that certificate, in respect of charges 3, 4, 6 and 7, I sentence Mr Ridgeway to 1 month imprisonment for each of the offences. They are to be concurrent and all to commence on 17 January 2011 so that they all have expired - yes? And in respect of charge number 8, police pursuit, I remit that to the Local Court at Newcastle for mention on 29 February 2012.

MALCOLM: And would your Honour make an order under s 77 that he appear by audio visual link?

HIS HONOUR: On that day?

MALCOLM: By audio visual link on that day.

58Under s 77 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 I direct the Commissioner for Corrective Services to produce Mr Ridgeway by audio visual link at the Local Court at Newcastle on 29 February 2012, yes.

HIS HONOUR: Now disqualifications, are they anything that I - are they automatic or?

OUTRAM: Perhaps if your Honour - if your Honour were to impose the automatic disqualification for each--

HIS HONOUR: I do not have to impose those, do I? They are statutory.

MALCOLM: They are. But you still have to--

OUTRAM: Well if your Honour makes the order they are. That's so your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I only interfere if you want them altered.

OUTRAM: I don't want them altered your Honour, it's an automatic minimum of two years.

HIS HONOUR: Without saying anything.

OUTRAM: Without saying anything, with this caveat your Honour, they accumulate on any existing disqualification.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

OUTRAM: Would your Honour make it abundantly clear that the two disqualifications - the two automatic disqualifications ought be concurrent with each other?

HIS HONOUR: That is for the drive whilst disqualified.

OUTRAM: Yes, it's sequences 6 and 7 your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. 

59In so far as a statute provides for an automatic period of disqualification for charges 6 and 7 on the s 166 certificate, I direct that those periods are to run concurrently. 

HIS HONOUR: Anything else? I do not think so.

OUTRAM: That covers it.

HIS HONOUR: The certificate itself I will ask my Associate to mark for identification 2, I think, and - no 3, the draft indictment was 2. She will mark that for identification 3 and that plus exhibit A, will go on the court file. So Mr Ridgeway your first date that you will be eligible for release is 16 April 2017. All right. Yes Mr Ridgeway can be taken down.

		01 May 2012",2012-01-31 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758550,"AII v Director General, Transport NSW [2012] NSWADT 10","REasons for decision 

1GENERAL DIVISION (S MONTGOMERY, (JUDICIAL MEMBER)): The Applicant holds an authority to drive a public passenger vehicle (bus) under the Passenger Transport Act 1990 (""the Act""). 

2On 22 August 2011 the Applicant was charged by NSW Police with the following offences:- 

14 counts of Aggravated Sexual Assault - Victim under authority of offender, 

10 counts of Sexual Intercourse with person under care >=17 & <18yrs 

3 counts of Sexual intercourse with person under care >=16 & <17yrs 

2 counts of Aggravated Indecent Assault - Victim under the authority of offender. 



3The charges relate to events alleged to have occurred between May 2009 and June 2011. 

4The Respondent was made aware of those charges on 24 August 2011 and a delegate of the Director General made the decision to suspend the Applicant's driver authority until such time as the criminal matters were dealt with by the Court. There is no evidence before me as to when the charges will be heard. 

5The delegate of the Director General of Transport stated: 

""The fact that you have been charged with such serious criminal offences of a sexual and violent nature indicates that you may not be a person of good repute and, in all respects, a fit and proper person to drive a public passenger vehicle. Therefore, I cannot attest that you are a fit and proper person to hold a public passenger authority in accordance with section 11(2) of the Passenger Transport Act 1990. 

Having regard to all matters raised, and considering the interests and the safety of the travelling public and the general public, I am not of the opinion that you are a fit and proper person to be the driver of a public passenger vehicle. Therefore, you do not meet the required standards for authorisation as the driver of a public passenger vehicle. 

Accordingly, the determination has been made to suspend your public passenger driver vehicle authority."" 

6The determination to suspend the Applicant's driver authority was affirmed on internal review. 

7The Applicant applied to the Tribunal for external review of the determination. 

Applicable legislation 

8Section 63 of the Administrative Decision Tribunal Act 1997 (""the ADT Act"") provides that in determining an application for review the Tribunal is to make the correct and preferable decision having regard to the material before it, and any applicable written or unwritten law. It is well established that in considering an application for review the Tribunal is not restricted to a consideration of the material that was before the Respondent, but may have regard to any relevant material before it at the time of the review: Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1979] AATA 179; (1979) 46 FLR 409. 

9A frequently used phrase is that, when conducting a review, the Tribunal 'stands in the shoes of the decision maker' and exercises the same functions and powers. The Tribunal is therefore constrained in its powers to those held by the decision maker. 

10Section 63(3) of the ADT Act provides that in determining an application for the review of a reviewable decision, the Tribunal may decide: 

(a) to affirm the reviewable decision, or 

(b) to vary the reviewable decision, or 

(c) to set aside the reviewable decision and make a decision in substitution for the reviewable decision it set aside, or 

(d) to set aside the reviewable decision and remit the matter for reconsideration by the administrator in accordance with any directions or recommendations of the Tribunal. 

11Section 11 of the Act provides that a person who drives a public passenger vehicle is guilty of an offence unless the person is the holder of an appropriate authority. The purposes of an authority are set out in section 11(2) which provides: 

11 Authorities 

... 

(2) The purpose of an authority under this Division is to attest: 

(a) that the authorised person is considered to be of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be the driver of a public passenger vehicle, and 

(b) that the authorised person is considered to have sufficient responsibility and aptitude to drive the vehicle or vehicles to which the authority relates: 

(i) in accordance with the conditions under which a public passenger service is operated, and 

(ii) in accordance with law and custom. 

... 

12The power to suspend the Applicant's authority is under section 14 of the Act which provides that having regard to the purpose of an authority, the Respondent may at any time vary, suspend or cancel any person's authority. 

Relevant decisions 

13The objective seriousness of the charges brought against the Applicant is the reason for the Respondent's decision to suspend his authority. In considering a review of a decision to suspend a driver authority, the Tribunal is not to examine the strengths or weaknesses of the prosecution case against an authority holder: Farquharson -v- Director General, Department of Transport [1999] NSWADT 53 at [22]. 

14The approach to be adopted by the Tribunal in considering a review of a decision to suspend a driver authority was considered most recently by the Appeal Panel in Director General, Transport NSW v AIC (GD) [2011] NSWADTAP 65 ("" AIC ""). In that matter the Director General had suspended AIC's taxi driver authority after being informed that he had been charged with two counts of indecent assault of a child under the age of ten. The conduct was said to have occurred in 1999. At hearing the Tribunal set aside the suspension decision. The Director General successfully appealed the Tribunal's decision. 

15The Appeal Panel in AIC considered the provisions of section 33 of the Act. Section 33 is applicable to authorities to drive taxi-cabs but is otherwise in similar terms to section 11 of the Act. Section 33 of the Act provides: 

""33 Authorities 



... 

(2) A person who drives a taxi-cab is guilty of an offence unless the person is an authorised taxi-cab driver. 



Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units. 



(3) The purpose of an authority under this Division is to attest: 

(a) that the authorised person is considered to be of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be the driver of a taxi-cab, and 

(b) that the authorised person is considered to have sufficient responsibility and aptitude to drive a taxi-cab: 

(i) in accordance with the conditions under which the taxi-cab service concerned is operated, and 

(ii) in accordance with law and custom."" 



16In regard to the construction of section 33(3) of the Act the Appeal Panel stated: 

""12 The first point to n ote is the use of the word 'attest'. The primary meaning of this word is 'to bear witness to; certify; declare to be correct, true or genuine; declare to the truth of, in words or writing: especially in an official capacity' ( Macquarie Dictionary, 4th ed. 2005). The Parliament, in using this word, seeks, we consider, to emphasise the idea that the conferral of an authority involves a declaration of public trust. While this is true of all licensing, the word gives special emphasis to it in the present conte xt. 

13 As we see it paragraph (a) focuses on general characteristics of the driver relevant to the regulated function, paragraph (b) focuses on maturity and technical competence. The expression 'good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person' is meant, we think, to be expansive in scope allowing for a broad range of personal attributes to be assessed, and for consideration to be given to the person's general standing in the community, especially among those who know the person well and are fully informed as to any matters of concern. It gives greatest weight to 'good repute'. For a recent discussion of the matters to which the terms 'good repute' and 'fit and proper' are addressed see Real Estate and Business Agents Supervisory Board v LJW [2011] WASCA 35 per Newnes JA (Pullin, Buss JJA agreeing). 'Fit and proper' goes to such matters of character as to whether the applicant is possessed of sufficient moral integrity and rectitude of character as to permit him or her to be safely accredited to the public without further inquiry (per Newnes JA at [27] citing with approval remarks of Walters J in Sobey v Commercial and Private Agents Board (1979) 22 SASR 70); and 'repute' goes to the public estimation of the person (at [28]­[29]). 

14 Different l icensing schemes use variations on this language, for example 'good fame and character'; sometimes the term 'fit and proper' only is used. Sometimes there are specific references to such matters as 'honesty', 'integrity' and 'competence'. 

15 As we see it, the purpose of threshold requirements cast in broad terms of these kinds is to give 'the widest scope for judgement and indeed for rejection' (see Hughes and Vale Pty Ltd v NSW (No 2) (1955) 93 CLR 127 at 156). The various broad expressions invite the administrator to look broadly at the character and reputation of the individual and they have at the heart the conferral of public trust. The review tribunal is engaged in the determination of a question of fact. It has wide scope, therefore, for judgement, and its decision can not easily be set aside on error of law grounds. 

16 In the regulatory context, the exercise of the power of suspension is in fact intended to have a temporary effect. Meaning no 3 in the Macquarie Dictionary (4th ed. 2005) reflects this understanding, i.e. 'temporary abrogation of a law or privilege'; similarly the Australian Concise Oxford Dictionary (3rd ed. 1997) 'suspend' ­ 'debar temporarily from a function, office or privilege'. 

17 The power is a usual part of accreditation and licensing schemes. It is a disciplinary power. Disciplina ry powers have as their object protection of the public. 

18 The power to suspend an occupational accreditation, licence or authority is used by regulators in, at least, two contexts. One is as a disciplinary sanction for misconduct that lies at a level of seriousness that warrants a more severe penalty than, say, a fine or imposition of conditions. Used in this way, it is often imposed for a relatively short period, say 3 months. It is a form of final order. 

19 The other is where information comes to light about a licensee's conduct that is seen as throwing into question their suitability to continue to use the licence pending further inquiry or investigation of the matters of concern. This is the use made of it in the present case. In these circumstances it is being used for the protection of the public until more is known. 

20 In either case, the effect of a suspension may be very harmful to the individual financially. There is also the humiliation and damage to public reputation that may follow."" 

17The Appeal Panel in AIC revisited the question of the extent to which the Tribunal is to take account of the likely perceptions of the travelling public as one of the relevant factors in deciding whether an applicant is a fit and proper person and of good repute. In doing so it considered a number of relevant decisions including Department of Transport and Infrastructure v Murray (GD) [2011] NSWADTAP 16 ("" Murray "") and Nasour v Director­General, Transport NSW [2011] NSWADT 9 ("" Nasour ""). 

18In Murray the Appeal Panel reviewed various authorities and concluded: 

""When deciding whether a person is a 'fit and proper person', the question of whether the community would have confidence that any improper conduct will not re-occur is relevant: Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321; 94 ALR 11. Otherwise, the determination of fitness and propriety is a question of fact for the decision maker to determine objectively on the basis of the all evidence. That question is not to be determined through the eyes of a reasonable member of the travelling public. Nor is it correct, as was suggested in Farquharson , to take account of the likely perceptions of the travelling public as one of the relevant factors in deciding whether an applicant is a fit and proper person. The Tribunal decided that Mr Murray is a fit and proper person to be the driver of a hire car taking into account relevant factors. It did not err by failing to determine Mr Murray's fitness and propriety through the eyes of a reasonable member of the travelling public"". 

19Murray was the subject of comment by the Tribunal's President in Nasour. The President stated at paragraphs [30] - [34]: 

30 In [ Farquharson ] I went on to look at the question of how then might the administrator go about forming a view as to 'repute and character'. The reasons referred to taking into account the views that might be formed by a reasonable member of the travelling public; and have been read as allowing the views of the travelling public to be used in the assessment of character. The Appeal Panel recently held in Department of Transport and Infrastructure v Murray [2011] NSWADTAP 16 (8 April 2011) that the views of the travelling public are not a relevant consideration when assessing character. What is involved in the assessment of character is an objective evaluation of the person's fitness to continue to undertake the regulated occupation having regard to the relevant material. 

31 The Appeal Panel's approach is similar to the one I expressed at para [29] of Farquharson , as extracted above. The preferable approach in dealing with the character question (often expressed in statutes as whether the person is a 'fit and proper' person to undertake the regulated activity), therefore, where one event is substantially relied upon - the laying of serious criminal charges - is to reserve judgment on intrinsic character until more is known. 

32 However, 'repute' is a concept very much about what members of the public, and importantly the passenger community, might think (fairly or unfairly). The Act itself, not surprisingly, gives weight to passenger thinking. One of the objects of the Act is to 'encourage public passenger services that meet the reasonable expectations of the community for safe ... passenger transport services' (s 4(e)). 

33 A person's reputation is a function of public perception. See for example Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 380 at [36] per Toohey and Gaudron JJ. The full passage appears in Murray at [16]. The same point is made in the Supreme Court and ACT Supreme Court decisions to which the Appeal Panel refers at [13]. 

34 A judgement as to the perception of reasonably-minded members of the travelling public remains, in my view, a relevant consideration for an administrator, when considering the 'repute' of a driver, or the driver's 'aptitude and responsibility'. 

20In an earlier Appeal Panel decision in Director General, Department of Transport v Z (No.2) (GD) [2002] NSWADTAP 37 the Appeal Panel observed at paragraph [38]: 

38 Good Repute : The approach to be adopted in considering `good repute' is well explained by Waddell J in Re T [ Re T and the Director of Youth and Community Services [1980] 1 NSWLR 392]. ... `Good repute' refers to the way reasonably-minded people assess an individual's current reputation, with reasonably precise knowledge of those matters that put the person's reputation in doubt. The fact that the person produces evidence from witnesses who vouch in general terms for the person's reputation can not be conclusive. Equally, care must be taken, as we see it, not to use the `good repute' requirement as a way of bringing into consideration stereotypes or assumptions which offend, for example, against human rights or anti-discrimination standards. 

21The Appeal Panel in AIC noted at paragraphs [39] - [40]: 

39 The exercise of power under s 33F forms part of a statutory scheme in which the reasonable expectations of the community for safe transport services has a central place. The power of suspension can not, as we see it, be divorced in the administration of the NSW Act from the underlying goals of passenger transport regulation, in particular, the object found in s 3 of the Act: 

(e) to encourage public passenger services that meet the reasonable expectations of the community for safe, reliable and efficient passenger transport services, 

40 Objective (e) refers, as we see it, to the perspective reflected in the approach adopted in Farquharson . In our view, the public safety objective of passenger transport regulation remains one of relevance to the exercise of suspension powers. Protection of the public and the broader public interest may justify the exercise of the power of suspension. 

22The Appeal Panel in AIC contrasted the provisions of the Act with those considered in the recent Victorian Court of Appeal decision, Director of Public Transport v XFJ [2011] VSCA 302 ("" XFJ ""). There the administrator of taxi driver licensing refused a licence application from a person who in all respects satisfied the eligibility criteria on the ground that the fact that he once killed a person (he was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity) meant that he should not be granted a licence. The Court of Appeal upheld the review tribunal's decision to overturn the administrator's decision and grant the licence. The Appeal Panel observed: 

35 We note that the Victorian taxi driver accreditation scheme is more variegated and complex than the NSW scheme: see Part VI of the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983 (Vic). It deals in greater detail with eligibility matters, and importantly it has mandatory interim suspension provisions in relation to certain categories of charges for serious offences: see paragraph 169K(2)(a) of the Victorian Act. The decision in XFJ must therefore be approached and applied with care in considering the operation of the NSW scheme. 

23The Appeal Panel also considered that a clear distinction must be drawn between the exercise of the power of suspension and the exercise of final powers such as refusals of applications or cancellations. It observed at paragraphs [41] - [49]: 

""41 In this case the alleged offences were ones that, if made out, involved a fundamental violation of the trust of a child. Even though the fact sheets placed the events in a domestic context unrelated to taxi driving, clearly they went to circumstances involving mutual trust, and to a situation that drivers will sometimes be in, being alone with a vulnerable person such as a child, a person with disabilities or a frail aged person. 



42 While the person facing the charges may have an otherwise impeccable life history, charges of this kind will ordinarily, we think, be seen as requiring immediate action to protect the public pending their resolution. 

... 

44 The reality of high volume licensing schemes is that an application for a licence is normally processed favourably if the relevant particulars are in order and nothing is revealed by criminal record checks. The approach is a beneficial one from the point of view of applicants. If the applicant meets the skills and competency requirements, the only issue that remains is that of his intrinsic personal and moral characteristics as relevant to the licence. The truth is that nothing is usually known to the administrator in any meaningful sense about the person's probity and character. 

45 The laying of a serious criminal charge, especially one suggesting exploitation of an immediate relationship with a vulnerable person, will therefore frequently be the first time anything adverse of relevance becomes known about a driver. In these circumstances it would be normal, we think, for a conscientious administrator to have regard to the function of public protection served by the power of suspension. The administrator would ordinarily give the licensee an opportunity to be heard before acting. But in cases such as the present the position is more difficult. The duty to advise of the criminal charge was not carried out. Had that occurred there may have been an opportunity to be heard. If there is no report and the administrator learns of the charge from another source (such as from data matching outputs), he or she may decide to act peremptorily. In cases like this, often the first interchange takes place at the steps of the Tribunal. 

... 

48 In cases where a suspension is being considered pending finalisation of charges the administrator, and the Tribunal, should, we think, have regard to all that is known to date about the applicant's repute, fitness and propriety, take into account the view it might form on that matter if the charges are proven, and assess the degree of risk to the public that is involved in leaving the driver on the road pending disposal of the charges. It should also take note of the personal hardship that might be caused to the driver. But the ultimate determinant is the public interest. 

49 It is noteworthy that in the case of Commissioner for Motor Transport v Leo , BC 8600704 (10 September 1986, McInerney J), upon which the decision in Farquharson drew, the passenger transport law of the time squarely referred to the public interest as a criterion for the exercise of the power of suspension (see Transport (Public Vehicles) Regulations 1930, cl 19(1)(5)(b) ­ 'The Commissioner may suspend for such period as he thinks fit any licence held by any person ... (b) if, having regard to any of the matters referred to in CL(1), the Commissioner considers such action desirable in the public interest'.) The Tribunal's interim order power does the same (ADT Act s 60(3)). In our view, the omission of an express reference to the public interest in s 33F does not preclude the administrator from taking the public interest into account. In our view the public interest is relevant to any exercise of a power of suspension of a general kind in a licensing scheme."" 

Material before Tribunal 

24The Applicant relies on an affidavit in which he sets out his background and financial circumstances and also annexes number of testimonials going to his fame and character. The Applicant also relies on an affidavit of Mr Scott Hanna. 

25As required by section 58 of the ADT Act, the Respondent has lodged all relevant material in its possession. It is made up of the Department's file, as well as the Police facts sheet and associated material in relation to the charges. The Department's file includes records of the Applicant's traffic offence history. 

26Each of the parties made oral submissions at the hearing on 18 October 2011. On that occasion I invited the parties to make further submission in relation to the relevance, if any, of the Victorian Court of Appeal decision in Director of Public Transport v XFJ . I set a timetable for the filing of those submissions. The timetable required submissions by the Respondent to be filed by 25 October 2011 and submissions by the Applicant to be filed and served by 1 November 2011. The Respondent complied with that timetable however submissions by the Applicant were not served until 23 December 2011. Those submissions also deal with issues other than the relevance of the decision in Director of Public Transport v XFJ . The Respondent has objected to the consideration of those submissions by the Tribunal. The Respondent requested the opportunity to make further submissions if the Tribunal proposes to take the Applicant's submissions into account. 

27While I note the Respondent's concerns in regard to the late service and the nature of the Applicant's submissions, it is my view that the submissions do not take the Applicant's case further than the oral submissions made on 18 October 2011. In the circumstances I do consider that taking the Applicant's submissions into account will prejudice the Respondent. Nor do I consider that further submissions from the Respondent are warranted. 

Outline of Circumstances Giving Rise to Charges 

28The incidents that gave rise to the charges did not arise in connection with the Applicant's work as a bus driver. The alleged offences involved the Applicant's stepdaughters. At the time of the alleged offences, the Applicant was living with both of the alleged victims. The alleged victims were aged between 16 and 18 years of age and were in the Applicant's care. The Applicant had been in a relationship with the mother of both alleged victims for about fifteen years. 

The Respondent's Submissions 

29The Respondent referred to the fact of the laying of the criminal charges and their seriousness. It is not in dispute that the charges are serious ones and that, if convicted, a term of imprisonment is to be expected. The Applicant has been charged with 29 offences extending between May 2009 and June 20011. 

30The Respondent's submission is that the charges demonstrate that the Applicant can not, for the time being, be regarded as a person of 'good repute' or as generally 'fit and proper' to drive a public passenger vehicle. 

31The Respondent contends that the fact that the charges have been laid casts doubt about the Applicant's fitness and propriety and that in light of those charges the Tribunal is unable to make the positive attestation referred to in section 11(2) of the Act. 

32Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the decision in Director of Public Transport v XFJ is entirely distinguishable and should not be applied by the Tribunal in the present case to the matters that the Tribunal has to decide. It is argued that this is so for the following reasons: 


The facts of the Victorian case are unique and they are wholly distinguishable from the Applicant's case in these proceedings. 

The legislation considered and applied in the Victorian case is completely different from the applicable legislation and regulation in New South Wales. The Victorian Transport Act as recently enacted in July 2007 in respect of taxi licensing has a very different central focus from the New South Wales Act. It also has a different structure. 

The New South Wales Act focuses on traditional notions of ""good repute"" and, ""in all other respects aft and proper person"". In addition to this, the licence attests ""sufficient responsibility and aptitude to drive the vehicle"" and other notions concerning the conditions set out in the regulations and in accordance with ""law and custom"". 

These notions are very different from the complicated, structured, and multilayered design of the Victorian Act. 

The Victorian Act contains many more concepts under the rubric of a unifying principle known as the ""public care objective"" which is defined in section 164(1) (judgment at [22]). This contains numerous notions concerning safety, amenity and convenience and ""comfort"". The word ""comfort"" was given significant attention by the Court of Appeal (judgment at [30 to [32]). 

The public care objective has no counterpart in the New South Wales legislation. 

Similarly, the list of discretions in section 169(3) and (4A) of the Victorian Act do not appear in the New South Wales Act at all. These discretions were significant to the Court of Appeal's decision (judgment at [47] to [51]). They are irrelevant to be present case. 
Neither the Act nor the Passenger Transport Regulation 2007 (NSW) contains any provision comparable to the Victorian accreditation scheme. 

33The Respondent contends that the Applicant's application should be dismissed for the following reasons: 


The criminal charges are significant, they are serious, there are many of them, and they relate to very recent and disturbing alleged conduct; 

Even the Applicant's legal representatives concede that were the charges to be proven, the Applicant would be imprisoned for a substantial term; 

The Tribunal does not have to determine the Applicant's guilt or innocence on the criminal charges but it must consider whether the fact of the charges justifies the suspension of his licence - Commissioner for Motor Transport v Darcy Francis Leo , NSW Supreme Court (McInerney J), 10 September 1986, unreported; and Farquharson -v- Director General, Department of Transport [1999] NSWADT 53 at [17] and [20] and [22] and [29] - [31]; 

Contrary to the submissions of the Applicant's legal representatives, for which no evidence was adduced, the Tribunal is not in a position to determine whether or not the Applicant will be employable during the period of his suspension. Simply no evidence was led on this point. The Applicant's affidavit dated 22 September 2011 sets out at [10] to [14] the previous work of the Applicant as an owner and operator of a bakery for eight years. There is simply no evidence about why he cannot work as a baker in that industry again. 

The determination made by the Director-General was that of suspension and not of cancellation. That fact is significant. It takes into account that things might change after subsequent events occur. This is not necessarily the case with a cancellation. The authorities have accepted and adopted the difference, see, for example: Farquharson at [31]. 

The suspension of an authority is justified where a person's reputation or fitness to drive a taxi is sufficiently compromised by allegations or findings of impropriety for it to be in the public interest that the person not drive until those issues are addressed or resolved - Williamson v Director General, Department of Transport [2001] NSWADT 3 at [21]. 

Most relevant factors in cases such as the present include the ""seriousness of the allegations"" and ""the effect they have on [the driver's] reputation and the public's perception of [the driver's] fitness to drive taxis or hire cars"" Williamson [2001] at [23]. 

The ultimate decision sought to be made by the Respondent is ""the correct and preferable"" decision in the circumstances (section 63(1) of the ADT Act). 

Applicant's Submissions 

34The Applicant's solicitor submits that the attempt by the Respondent to distinguish the decision in Director of Public Transport v XFJ is artificial. 

35The Applicant filed an affidavit as to his personal circumstances. He referred to his financial commitments and asserts that he will suffer a significant financial detriment if he cannot resume using his authority pending the hearing of the charges. 

36The Applicant filed a number of positive testimonials. The makers of the statements stated that they were aware of the laying of the charges. 

37The Applicant also relies on an affidavit of Mr Scott Hanna. Mr Hanna has been employed as a bus driver with State Transit since 1994. His evidence concerns his daily routine as a bus driver and the presence of CCTV cameras on buses. His evidence is that the coverage provided by the cameras is such that all areas of the bus can be observed. 

38It is submitted for the Applicant that driving a public passenger vehicle is a public activity, involving constant observation, by passengers, as well as Revenue Protection Officers, and the possibility of observation by CCTV footage. There is no real possibility of misconduct that would go undetected, and there has never been any suggestion of misconduct by the Applicant since he commenced driving a bus in August 2007. Accordingly, it is submitted that it is hard to see how anyone would be put at risk by allowing the Applicant to continue to drive a bus. 

39As to the Applicant's good reputation, it is submitted that there is no prior complaint in respect of his conduct. He has been charged with criminal offences, but is entitled to the presumption of innocence. It is further submitted that the Applicant does not cease to be of good repute, and a fit and proper person to drive a public passenger vehicle, by reason of the charges brought, without more. He remains a fit and proper person to be the driver of a public passenger vehicle. It is submitted that his application should be upheld. 

Consideration 

40In reviewing the Respondent's decision to cancel the Applicant's authority the existence of the criminal charges is a matter that may be considered, however, it is not the Tribunal's function to weigh and assess evidence that has yet to go before the court. 

41In this application, I have considered all of the evidence presented before the Tribunal. In particular I have had regard to the following issues: 


the preliminary nature of the allegations and the fact that while charges have been laid in relation to the allegations, no determination has been made in regard to those charges; 
the seriousness of the conduct to which the allegations relate; 
the fact that there is no suggestion that the alleged conduct occurred in the performance of the Applicant's duties as a bus driver; 
the responsibility of the Respondent under section 11 of the Act and the Act's objects; 
the interim nature of the decision to suspend; 
The Applicant's previous good character and the references provided on his behalf; 
the limited role the Tribunal has in reviewing the decision to suspend. 
42There is no dispute that - 


The charges brought against the Applicant are serious criminal charges. 
If convicted, the Applicant is likely to be imprisoned. 
The Applicant does not have a criminal record. 
The Applicant has worked as a bus driver since 2007. 

43The Respondent has generally relied on the submission that because of the serious criminal charges laid against him the Applicant can no longer be regarded as a person of 'good repute' or as having the character (i.e. not 'fit and proper') to be a bus driver. The Respondent contends that the Tribunal must be able to make the positive attestation that the Applicant is considered to be of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be the driver of a public passenger vehicle. 

44This approach urged by the Respondent is consistent with that espoused by the Appeal Panel in AIC . The Respondent's submission in regard to the relevance of the decision in Director of Public Transport v XFJ is also consistent with that espoused by the Appeal Panel in AIC . I accept that submission. 

45I find that the Applicant has been charged with a number of serious criminal offences. These offences are alleged to have occurred over more than two years and the most recent alleged event was in June 2011. 

46There is no evidence that the Applicant has been charged with any other similar offences, nor is there any other suggestion of improper behaviour towards children or women. There is no evidence of any complaints made against the Applicant in regard to his duties as a bus driver. 

47However, the criminal charges are most serious, involving abuse of trust, in that the facts alleged are that the Applicant sexually assaulted his stepchildren. The charges involve allegations of more than one incident of sexual assault on the children. 

48As noted in AIC, the Tribunal's task is to decide whether, in the circumstances, the Applicant should be stood aside from the licensed occupation while those allegations remain unresolved. Protection of the public and the broader public interest may justify the exercise of the power of suspension. 

49As was the case in AIC , the alleged offences in this matter are ones that, if made out, involved a fundamental violation of the trust of a child. The alleged facts relate to circumstances involving mutual trust. 

50It is conceded by the Respondent that the charges did not arise from alleged conduct by the Applicant in the course of his occupation as a bus driver. However, the allegations against the Applicant go to the public trust that has been reposed in the licensee, and particularly the 'mutual trust' that must exist between licensees and their customers: see AIC at paragraph [21]. 

51Notwithstanding the Respondent's concession, and contrary to the Applicant's evidence, it is conceivable that bus drivers will sometimes be alone with a vulnerable person. Mr Hanna's evidence regarding the existence of tight rostering and security cameras does not alter this fact. The existence of security cameras on buses would not prevent the occurrence of an incident. It would merely provide evidence of what had occurred. I do not consider that this is sufficient to meet the reasonable expectations of the community referred to in section 4(e) of the Act. 

52The Appeal Panel decision in AIC clearly anticipates that an administrator, and the Tribunal, will have regard to the function of public protection served by the power of suspension in circumstances where serious criminal charges laid against a licensee suggest exploitation of an immediate relationship with a vulnerable person. 

53In doing so it is necessary to have regard to all that is known to date about the Applicant's repute, fitness and propriety, take into account the view it might form on that matter if the charges are proven, and assess the degree of risk to the public that is involved in leaving the driver on the road pending disposal of the charges. It should also take note of the personal hardship that might be caused to the driver. But the ultimate determinant is the public interest: see AIC at paragraph [48]. 

54In my view, the circumstances of this matter are within the scope of those contemplated by the Appeal Panel in AIC at paragraphs [39] - [40] i.e. circumstances in which protection of the public and the broader public interest may justify the exercise of the power of suspension. The testimonials from witnesses who vouch in general terms for the Applicant's reputation cannot be conclusive of the outcome. 

55When all of the relevant factors are weighed, I am unable to attest that the Applicant is considered to be of good repute and in all other respects a fit and proper person to be the driver of a public passenger vehicle. In the circumstances of this matter, it is my view that the public interest weighs against the Applicant being permitted to continue to drive a public passenger vehicle while the charges remain unresolved. 

56It follows that the decision to suspend the Applicant's driver authority should be affirmed. 

Order 

The decision to suspend the Applicant's driver authority is affirmed.

		01 February 2012",2012-01-31 00:00:00,NSW Administrative Decisions Tribunal (Trial)
2758551,Mark McKey v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 1,"Judgment  1WHEALY JA : I agree with Latham J.  2HISLOP J : I agree with Latham J.  3LATHAM J : The appellant appeals against his conviction after trial by jury on one count of sexual intercourse with a child above the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years (s 66C, Crimes Act 1900).  The offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.  The appellant received a sentence of 3 years imprisonment, but there is no appeal against sentence.  4The offence was charged in the alternative to an offence of sexual intercourse without consent.  It was alleged that the appellant digitally penetrated the complainant, whilst both were staying at the home of the complainant's sister (KN) in preparation for KN's wedding that weekend in Moree.  The appellant was the groom's best man at the wedding. The appellant, who gave evidence at trial, disputed that any sexual activity had taken place between himself and the complainant.  The jury's verdict reflects an acceptance of the complainant's evidence, albeit a failure to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent or that the appellant knew that she was not consenting.  5All three grounds of the appeal complain of alleged errors in the directions of the trial judge relating to the appellant's behaviour at the time of, and following, the communication to the appellant by the complainant's sister and her husband of the allegation of sexual impropriety.  Evidence on this topic was adduced in the Crown case and the appellant was cross examined upon it.  6The grounds of the appeal are :-  Ground 1 : the trial judge erred in failing to adequately direct the jury in relation to the appellant ' s silence or inaction in response to the allegations put to him by KN and N and as a consequence the trial miscarried.  Ground 2 : the trial judge erred in failing to adequately direct the jury regarding the circumstances in which the appellant ' s silence or inaction could be used as evidence of consciousness of guilt and as a consequence the trial miscarried.  Ground 3 : the trial judge erred by failing to adequately direct the jury in relation to the submission to the jury by the prosecutor to discount the whole of the appellant ' s evidence due to his silence or inaction in response to the allegation put to him and as a consequence the trial miscarried.   7The appellant contends that the prosecution relied upon the appellant's conduct in response to the allegations as evincing a consciousness of guilt.  It is submitted that the cross examination of the appellant and the prosecutor's closing address conveyed as much to the jury, and that the trial judge was therefore obliged to direct accordingly.  8The Crown takes issue with this characterisation of the use of that evidence.  It is submitted that the evidence of the appellant's post-offence conduct was relied upon solely for the purposes of submissions to the jury relating to the credibility of the appellant.  It is further submitted that the closing address of the appellant's counsel at trial dealt with the matter in the same vein and that, accordingly, the trial judge's directions were appropriate.  9Given the narrow scope of the issue on the appeal, it is unnecessary to relate the evidence at trial, save for the material that touches directly or indirectly upon the appellant's conduct in the relevant respect.  The Evidence Relating to Post Offence Conduct  10The complainant's sister, KN, gave evidence of a disclosure by the complainant to her shortly prior to Christmas 2007.  The disclosure was repeated by KN to her husband, N, the same night.  That same night, KN attempted to call the appellant but was unsuccessful.  On Boxing Day, they received a telephone call from the appellant, who spoke to N in the presence of KN.  N said to the appellant ""we've been given some information about a few days before our wedding that involved [the complainant].  Can you tell me more?""  The appellant replied ""I'm travelling back from Sydney.  I can't talk right now.  I'll call you when I've returned to Moree "".  11In the days following that conversation, KN sent a number of text messages to the appellant.  It was not until January that the appellant replied by text in the following terms, namely, ""you won't believe me anyhow.  You will only believe what your sister tells you"".  There was no further contact from the appellant.  12The complainant's brother-in-law, N, gave evidence of a text message sent to the appellant to the following effect ""I want to know both sides of the story.""  N also gave evidence that he attempted to contact the appellant by telephoning the appellant's then flatmate.  N's evidence was otherwise consistent with that given by his wife set out above.  13In cross-examination, N acknowledged that when he spoke to the appellant about the allegation he was ""fairly well upset about it"" and that he would ""like to have known his side of it"".  N said that he had tried to ring the appellant a number of times.  The cross examination of N was critical of N's failure to make personal contact with the appellant and discuss the allegation calmly with him.  14The appellant gave evidence under cross examination that he became aware of the allegation at Christmas time in 2007 when he received a phone call from KN.  The appellant said that he had a conversation with N wherein he said ""I don't know what you're talking about"" and then his phone dropped out of service.  The appellant agreed that he did not make any further attempt to contact N and speak to him about the allegation.  He acknowledged receiving text messages which were unpleasant and that he was ""shocked"".  The appellant said he responded to one text message in late January saying ""I'm not explaining, I've got nothing to explain to you, you're going to believe your sister anyway.""  The appellant agreed that he had made no further attempt to contact N and talk to him about the allegation.  15The appellant said that he was concerned that the allegations were being repeated within the community and that his ex-wife had become aware of them.  The appellant said he had talked to a friend and to his sister and that the mutual decision was that he should not respond to the allegations or do anything about the damage to his reputation.  16The critical passage in the cross-examination relied upon by the appellant for the purposes of this appeal is :-  Q.  Your name is being muddied, your reputation is being tarnished by the allegations being out there in the community.  Isn't that the case?  A.  It probably is the case, yes.  Q.  Well didn't you feel that way?  A. Well I didn't feel, what's the best way to put it, well I definitely wasn't happy about it, no.  Q. But you didn't see fit to do anything about it?  A. No I never.  Q. And your long-standing friendship, your great mateship with N, you were prepared just to let go?  A. Yes I was.  Q. Sir, these allegations were false in your mind?  A. These allegations are false, yes.  Q. Allegations of sexual assault by a 14-year-old against you are a terrible thing?  A. Yes.  Q. Especially if they are false?  A. Yes.  Q. You would want to protest your innocence long and loud, would you not?  A. People close to me that knew, they believed me.  That was the main thing to me.  If people who don't know me that well didn't believe me then there is nothing I can do about that.  Q. Could have picked up the phone, rung N and said hold the bus, none of this, stop spreading this around it's false?  A. I could have picked up the phone and done that, yes but in my mind it wouldn't have solved their problem.  Q. Time goes on and then the police come and see you ultimately?  A. Yes.  Q. And in all that time up until when the police come and see you and I think that was around September, was it not September 2008?  A. Around that, July, September, something like that, yes.  Q. You hadn't made contact with N, KN or even [the complainant]?  A. No.  Q. You did nothing about it sir because the allegations are true?  A. The allegations are false.  17In re-examination, the appellant said that he had spoken to his ex-partner on 27 December about the allegations and had denied them to her.  The appellant also explained that his sister, to whom he spoke shortly after the allegations came to his attention, was a police woman and that her advice not to do anything further was considered trustworthy by him.  The appellant said that he was ""a bit stunned by it all"" and that he accepted the advice that he received.  18Thus, at the close of the evidence in the trial, there was a relatively minor factual dispute concerning what the appellant had said, if anything, to N when he was first informed of the allegation.  According to the Crown witnesses, the appellant said nothing responsive beyond telling them that he would ring them back.  According to the appellant, he arguably denied the allegation before the phone dropped out.  19The Crown Prosecutor appears to have put this factual dispute to one side, since it is reasonably clear from the cross examination set out above that the Crown Prosecutor was inviting the jury to conclude that the appellant's failure to ""protest his innocence long and loud"" and make personal contact with N and KN to discuss the allegation was because he knew he was guilty of the offence.  The resolution of the factual dispute concerning what the appellant had said when he was first contacted by N was not integral to the jury's acceptance of the Crown's suggestion.  The Submissions by Counsel at Trial.  20The Crown Prosecutor's closing address commenced with a concession that proof of the Crown case rested upon the complainant's evidence.  It was acknowledged that there was an absence of support for her evidence, but for an account of some injury and vaginal bleeding, which was witnessed by a guest at the wedding who assisted the complainant to dress.  21The Crown's comment in relation to the evidence of the appellant set out above at [15] appears in the following context :-  You will assess all the witnesses.  Mr McKey is a witness the same as those that were called by the Crown.  He didn't have to subject himself to giving evidence in the witness box, but as soon as he does he just becomes another witness and you make your assessment of him the same as you make your assessment of the others that were called by the Crown.  ...........................................................................  You would have, I would suggest to you, real doubts about the evidence that's been given to you by the accused.  I suggest to you, as I suggested to him, he has tailored his evidence of that night to fit around what has been said by the others.  You might find it very difficult to accept going back five years plus that a man can remember going to the toilet, washing face and hands.  Do you accept, faced with terrible false allegations coming from a long-standing very close mate, that Mr McKey didn't seek some further information, didn't seek to tell them that it was false, stop saying anything about it, it just didn't happen?  You might think he'd be protesting his innocence from the rooftops.  No, he doesn't.  It's a matter for you, if you would reject the evidence of the accused entirely.  22The appellant's counsel at trial relied upon the concession by the Crown Prosecutor that the only evidence of the offences came from the complainant.  Later in his address to the jury, counsel said :-  My learned friend says that Mr McKey didn't seek to tell them it was false, that is KN and N.  Now the first conversation Mr McKey says, ""I don't know what you're talking about.""  The first conversation.  Virtually the first thing out, ""I don't know what you're talking.  What are you talking about?""  What more does my learned friend want from Mr McKey, in circumstances where his best man says he was abusing him down the telephone with this abhorrent act and then sending accusatory text messages?  He seeks solace from his sister, a police officer, on his advice, you've heard the evidence, ""well just leave it.  Something is going on here with this family.  Just leave it.""  A rational explanation you might think of Mr McKey, whoever is close to me I discuss it with them.  What else can I do?  What else could he do?  Sue them for defamation?  Well really.  The Directions from the Judge  23Early in the summing up, the trial judge told the jury that the Crown case depended entirely upon the evidence of the complainant.  When dealing with the evidence of complaint, the trial judge restricted the use of that evidence to an assessment by the jury of the consistency of the complainant's conduct.  The jury was told that the evidence of complaint could not be used by them as to the truth of the allegation that the appellant sexually assaulted the complainant.  Once again, the jury were told that the only evidence that was capable of proving the allegation was the evidence of the complainant of the events in April 2004.  24The judge then summarised the arguments of counsel.  After dealing with the Crown's submissions in relation to the credibility of the complainant, and the competing submissions of the appellant's counsel at trial, the judge went on to say :-  The Crown said, on the other hand, having described her as a witness whom you would accept as honest and reliable, the accused when he gave evidence was somebody whom you would not accept, because he has got this unnatural memory of going to the toilet, as distinct from saying ""I would have gone to the toilet"", he claims to actually remember going on this occasion and remember the details of washing his face and hands and so on.  He has had, the Crown suggests, a long time, 18 months or more following becoming aware of these allegations, to look at the statements made by various people, and the Crown suggested to him in cross-examination, and to you in address, that the accused had in fact tailored his statement of what occurred, or rather, what did not occur on this night, to take account of the details which he knew would be forthcoming from everybody else, all the other witnesses.  Of course, there is a lot of other evidence upon which counsel raised some arguments, about for example, the contact between N and KN on the one hand and the accused on the other immediately or soon after the revelation made by the complainant in December 2007.  The accused gave evidence that he had said ""what are you talking about"" and the phone dropped out.  The evidence of N and KN was that he had said ""I can't talk to you now, I'll ring you when I get home"" and hung up.  Now, this is not something which the Crown - this is an indication of something which the Crown does not have to prove beyond reasonable doubt, but you may find it, depending on how you reason these things out, significant to work out whether you accept the evidence that it was not a flat denial and that he thereafter made himself unavailable to exchange.  The accused said that there was only the one call and thereafter there were text messages.  I understood N to say that thereafter, he could not get hold of the accused by phone, although he tried, and KN to say that he would not answer his phone. Well now, whether that is an appropriate piece of terminology to use when talking about text messages or not is a matter for you.  These are matters that you will bear in mind, depending on what weight you give the arguments of counsel about the reactions of the accused and so on. Mr Taylor says he did what you would expect him to do, denied it, and thereafter, on the advice of his sister, sought to let matters lie.  The Crown suggested to you that this is not the sort of conduct that you would expect of somebody who was being vilified, defamed around Moree and so on, you would expect him at least to go on to establish further contact with his best mate and say ""that's not how it happened at all"" or words to that effect.  But those are arguments that you will evaluate yourself.  25These directions referred to the factual dispute concerning what was said at the time of the first phone call but otherwise left it to the jury to determine whether they accepted that, whatever was said by the appellant, his conduct constituted less than a ""flat denial"" of the offence.  The arguments of counsel, as to the inferences that the jury would draw from the appellant's admitted failure to contact N in order to comprehensively deny the offence, were encapsulated for the jury's evaluation.  Consciousness of Guilt and Implied Admissions  26The law has always recognized the legitimacy of reliance upon post-offence conduct in support of a prosecution case.  The most common example of such post-offence conduct is lies told by an accused ( Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193), although an accused's silence in response to an allegation which he/she might reasonably be expected to deny ( R v MMJ [2006] VSCA 226), the destruction of evidence ( R v Nguyen [2001] VSCA 1) and attempts to influence the evidence of witnesses ( R v Smit & Ors . [2004] NSWCCA 409) all fall into the same category.   Similarly,  Flight from justice, and its analogous conduct, have always been deemed indicative of a consciousness of guilt. ...... It is universally conceded today that the fact of an accused's flight, escape from custody, resistance to arrest, concealment, assumption of a false name, and related conduct, are admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt, and thus of guilt itself :..  Wigmore on Evidence, Vol 2, (1979) par 276(4)  27In R v Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234, this Court reviewed the circumstances under which it was permissible to leave a lie told by an accused as corroboration of a witness' evidence.  Allowing for the fact that corroboration no longer exists as a requirement in criminal proceedings, the following passage at 242 from the judgment of Clarke JA (Gleeson CJ and Studdert J agreeing) is apposite :-  [Support for] the evidence of a witness for the prosecution may be provided in a number of ways.  It may be found in the admissions of an accused.  It may also be found in inferences drawn from certain aspects of the conduct of the accused.  That conduct may extend to, or include, a lie .... A lie could, however, only provide [support] if, broadly speaking, it was capable of supporting an inference that the evidence of the relevant prosecution witness on a material point was probably correct.  This, it has been held, will occur only where it is open to the jury to infer that the lie was told because of a fear of the truth or a consciousness of guilt.  28Later, at 244, Clarke JA observed that, provided that it is open to the jury to rationally draw an inference that consciousness of guilt motivated the relevant conduct on the part of the accused, the jury should be directed that such an inference cannot be drawn unless other reasonable explanations for the conduct inconsistent with a consciousness of guilt have been excluded.  29The Dictionary to the Evidence Act 1995 provides that an admission is :-  a previous representation that is:  (a) made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including a defendant in a criminal proceeding), and  (b) adverse to the person's interest in the outcome of the proceeding.  "" previous representation "" means a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which evidence of the representation is sought to be adduced.  "" representation "" includes:  (a) ......................... or  (b) a representation to be inferred from conduct,  30This definition simply reflects the common law position, namely that guilt may be inferred from an accused's conduct. The thrust of the cross examination in the instant case was that the jury could infer from the appellant's conduct (not robustly denying the allegation to N) that he effectively admitted the offence.  31As I have already noted, the appellant focused upon the effect on the jury of the Crown Prosecutor's cross examination and emphasized that, regardless of the attempt to present the appellant's conduct as a matter going to his credibility, the substance of the submission invited consciousness of guilt reasoning.  The appellant did not argue that it was not open to the jury to draw the relevant inference.  32The Crown maintained that there was no such reliance and that the determining factor was the acceptance by the Crown Prosecutor in his closing address that proof of the Crown case depended entirely upon the complainant.  In other words, the Crown did not ultimately seek to use the evidence of the appellant's conduct in support of the complainant's evidence.  33The majority judgment in Zoneff v R [2000] HCA 28 ; 200 CLR 234 makes it clear that the critical issue in determining the necessity for and scope of a direction to the jury concerning their use of implied admissions is the risk of misunderstanding on their part :-  16 There may be cases in which the risk of misunderstanding on the part of a jury as to the use to which they may put lies might be such that a judge should give an Edwards -type direction notwithstanding that the prosecutor has not put that a lie has been told out of consciousness of guilt. As a general rule, however, an Edwards -type direction should only be given if the prosecution contends that a lie is evidence of guilt, in the sense that it was told because, in the language of Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Edwards , ""the accused knew that the truth ... would implicate him in [ the commission of ] the offence"" and if, in fact, the lie in question is capable of bearing that character. (The words in italics are ours and, for the sake of clarity, should be included in the statement of principle.)  17 Moreover, if there is a risk of confusion or doubt as to the way in which the prosecution puts its case, the trial judge should inquire of the prosecution whether it contends that lies may constitute evidence of consciousness of guilt and, if so, he or she should require identification of the lie or lies in issue and the basis on which they are said to be capable of implicating the accused in the commission of the offence charged.  34To similar effect is the following observation by Kirby J at [71] :-  The first problem is that it cannot ultimately depend upon the intention or subjective purpose of the prosecutor as to whether or not a judicial direction to a jury about that subject of lies must be given. The criterion must be the way the jury might use the evidence not the subjective purpose of the prosecutor in eliciting the evidence or relying upon it. That is why, in Edwards , the majority judges referred to ""where a lie is relied upon to prove guilt"". That expression must be given meaning according to objective standards. There is a lot of loose talk in the cases about the prosecutor's intention. I regard that as irrelevant except so far as it helps to identify what the jury might have made of the questioning or evidence.  35What was conveyed to the jury on the subject of the appellant's conduct in response to the allegation ?  Contrary to the Crown's submissions, I am not persuaded that the answer to that question resides solely in the respective closing addresses.  If the cross examination of the appellant gave rise to the risk of consciousness of guilt reasoning in the minds of the jury, it was incumbent on the judge to seek clarification from the Crown Prosecutor and to direct the jury accordingly.  36The Crown Prosecutor's attempt in his closing address to the jury to characterise the appellant's conduct as somehow relevant to his credibility did not remove the sting inherent in the cross examination.  The italicised passage at [20] above repeated the theme that the appellant's conduct in not ""protesting his innocence from the rooftops"" was consistent with a guilty mind.  37That submission had very little to do with the appellant's credibility as a witness in the trial.  It was not suggested by the Crown Prosecutor that the appellant's account in his evidence of his response to the allegation was materially different from the account given by other witnesses.  The submission was framed in terms of his failure to ""protest his innocence from the rooftops"" as a relevant factor in the jury's assessment of his veracity as a witness.  The jury were invited to reject his evidence in the trial (including his denial of the offence in his evidence) partly because his conduct was inconsistent with that of an innocent man.  When the submission is properly analysed, it is not far removed from reliance upon consciousness of guilt.  38This case is to be contrasted with Elmasri v R [2010] NSWCCA 11.  In that decision, R A Hulme J (McClellan CJ at CL and Price J agreeing) was at pains to point out that an ""unprompted denial"" by the appellant was plainly dealt with as a credibility factor, given that the Crown Prosecutor in his closing address had submitted that the explanation by the appellant at trial for the ""unprompted denial"", namely the erroneous omission in the notes by the police of a question that elicited that response, was not credible in the face of the appellant's correction of another aspect of the police interview on an earlier occasion : Elmasri [51] and [54] - [55].  39Moreover, the peripheral significance of the ""unprompted denial"" in the prosecution case in Elmasri persuaded the Court that there was no risk that the jury would have adopted consciousness of guilt reasoning.  The prosecution case in Elmasri consisted of a number of pieces of circumstantial evidence, excluding the ""unprompted denial"", in addition to the direct evidence of a co-offender.  40In the instant case, the appellant's conduct assumed considerable significance in the trial, particularly when the trial was conducted, and the jury were instructed, on the basis that the only evidence of the offence came from the complainant.  It was a ""word against word"" case, which rendered it more likely that the jury would cast around for evidence tending to support the allegation.  The Crown Prosecutor's cross examination, and to a marginally lesser extent, his closing address presented the appellant's post offence conduct as potentially supportive of the prosecution case.  41In so far as consciousness of guilt reasoning involves the drawing of an inference from the relevant conduct in favour of guilt, the trial judge in Elmasri gave a number of directions concerning the drawing of inferences, and, at one point, went so far as to direct the jury that an inference unfavourable to the accused required satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt.  No direction on the drawing of inferences was given in the appellant's trial.  42In the circumstances of this case, I have come to the view that it was necessary for the trial judge to give a direction to the jury which would guard against the unjustified drawing of an inference adverse to the appellant.  The cross examination of the appellant unequivocally suggested that the appellant's conduct constituted an implied admission.  At the very least, the jury should have been directed that, before they could infer that the appellant behaved as he did because he was conscious of his guilt of the offence, they were required to examine that inference to determine whether it was a reasonable and justifiable one and they were required to exclude any alternative inference that was inconsistent with guilt.  The most obvious alternative inference that called for exclusion was that the appellant acted in accordance with his sister's advice, namely, to say nothing about the allegation to anyone, including N, his wife and the complainant.  43If one were to go further and consider adapting the recommended directions relating to the use of lies as consciousness of guilt, discussed by the majority in Edwards , the tenuous nature of the proposition sought to be established by the Crown Prosecutor in cross examination is more apparent.  According to Edwards (at 210 - 211), the conduct should be precisely identified, together with the circumstances and events that are said to indicate that the conduct constitutes an implied admission.  The conduct was not precisely identified ; was it the appellant's failure to make further enquiry of N and/or his failure to protest his innocence, beyond the constructive denial in the text message to N ?  What were the circumstances and events that indicated that the appellant's conduct constituted an implied admission ?  How did the appellant's conduct in failing to categorically deny the offence to N, in particular, reveal his knowledge of the offence or some aspect of it ?  44The appellant has succeeded in respect of grounds 1 and 2.  It is not necessary to deal with ground 3 in the light of my conclusions on the first two grounds.  45Notwithstanding the application of Rule 4, the appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.  There is a reasonable possibility that, in the absence of appropriate directions, the jury's verdict was affected by its use of the appellant's conduct in order to support the complainant's allegation.  The appellant has served the non parole period of the sentence imposed in respect of this offence.  There is therefore no utility in ordering a new trial.  46I propose the following orders :-  (1)Appeal against conviction allowed.  (2)The conviction is quashed and the sentence imposed on 8 October 2009 is set aside.  (3)Enter a verdict of acquittal.  **********

2758559,R v Andy William SOARS [2012] NSWDC 51,"SENTENCE

1I am sentencing a young man who was involved in a very nasty robbery with wounding in a public park in Newcastle. He is only 22, but has spent a good deal of time over the last 4 years since he became an adult in gaol.

2He has been charged with a very serious crime. It is called robbery in company with wounding. It is an offence against s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament regards it as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of 25 years imprisonment to that offence. Not only that, Parliament has also fixed a standard non-parole period of 7 years to that offence.

3When I am sentencing Mr Soars, he has asked me to take into account another offence which was committed at the same time of robbery in company. He has signed a form under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and I will take that offence into account when I am sentencing him, and I sign the same form to the same effect.

4It is important for a judge to briefly say what happened which gave rise to the charge that the judge is sentencing someone for. 

5It was about 10.30pm on a summer's night, 3 December 2010. Two people were in Islington Park, sharing a drink. They were John Emmerson and Kerrie Merrett. Mr Soars came through the park with a young teenaged man and a young teenaged girl. They had a brief conversation with Mr Emmerson and Ms Merrett and then moved on. 

6But about 10 or 15 minutes later, they came back to the park. Mr Soars and the young man spoke about robbing Mr Emmerson and Ms Merrett. The young woman did not wish to be involved. So what the two men did was to go back to where Mr Emmerson and Ms Merrett were sitting, and one of them picked up a glass bottle which Mr Emmerson and Ms Merrett were sharing. That bottle was used to strike Mr Emmerson over the head. The neck broke off, the rest of the bottle shattered. Mr Emmerson got lacerations to his forehead and below his right eye. A fragment also struck Ms Merrett.

7Despite Mr Emmerson holding his hands up over his bleeding face, Mr Soars pushed him to the ground, then punched and kicked him a number of times before taking his wallet, which contained $50 in cash. Mr Emmerson took himself off to hospital, where his lacerations were sutured and it is noted the injuries were considered ""minor"" by the treating physician.

8While Mr Emmerson was being robbed, his teenaged companion took Ms Merrett's handbag and stole some cigarettes and money from the purse.

9Mr Soars and his young co-offender ran away but, as it happened, the police were in the area and the two men were arrested. Mr Soars was charged that night. The young person admitted to being the one who had used the bottle.

10Some weeks later, Ms Merrett selected Mr Soars' photograph from an array. About four months after the offence the young person entered a plea of guilty. About seven months after the offence, a DNA analysis confirmed that some blood spots on Mr Soars' clothing were consistent with Mr Emmerson's blood.

11Mr Soars has remained in custody since his arrest on 3 December 2010. He was committed for trial on 13 April 2011 and his trial was listed for 15 August 2011. There were negotiations between his legal representative and the prosecutor during the week before the trial, and he agreed to plead guilty to the offence that I am sentencing him for and for the other offence to be put on a form to be taken into account.

12Both Mr Coles, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, and Mr Ramsland, who appears for Mr Soars, agree that the appropriate discount to allow for Mr Soars' plea of guilty is in the region of 15 per cent, and I propose to apply a discount in due course of 15 per cent.

13The sentence which I impose will date from when Mr Soars was arrested on 3 December 2010.

14It is obviously also important for a judge to take into account in sentencing a person information which is personal to the offender. One of the main pieces of important information is the offender's criminal record. Sometimes an offender will come before a court for sentencing without any prior criminal record at all. That is not the case with Mr Soars. He has a criminal record which dates back well before he turned 18. He is now 22.

15As a child he was dealt with by the Children's Court for offences which included indecent assault and shoplifting and breaking and entering. He found himself in adult prison at the age of 18. That was for a dangerous driving offence. He served another prison sentence for a PCA offence and then, when he was 19, he went back to prison for an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He did further time in prison for assaulting a police officer. He has also been sentenced for common assault, but those sentences were served after his arrest on the current charge.

16As Mr Coles pointed out, the offence that I am sentencing him for was committed only about a month after he was released from prison for assaulting a police officer.

17An offender's personal history also relates to his background and personal circumstances. In this case there are two helpful pre-sentence reports prepared by the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service.

18Mr Soars has been supervised by that service in the past, and his response early was regarded as being unsatisfactory. He left home when he was 12 and kept what the report called a transient existence for some years. He went into a relationship with a woman and they share a 14 month old daughter. That relationship has now ended. Since leaving school at the age of 14 he has kept steady employment and there will be some employment available to him when he is released from custody.

19He said that he was experiencing some emotional distress at the time of offending. He has been drinking alcohol since he was 12 years old. He has tried various prohibited drugs but claims to have been drug free since early 2010. He went into a residential rehabilitation program in mid-2010 to address his alcohol misuse, but left after 2 months because that coincided with the birth of his daughter.

20Since being in custody there are two institutional misconducts recorded against him. 

21The report noted that he tended to minimise his current substance misuse issues.

22There is a later report which was dated yesterday, which indicated that he had not incurred any further institutional misconducts and that he had not been able to participate in any programs because he is presently bail refused, but had completed a Health, Survival and Core Skills Assessment.

23He has been visited a number of times by his mother. His mother, who is here in court, is prepared to offer him accommodation when he leaves prison.

24He has acknowledged the stupidity of his behaviour and the role which alcohol had in that behaviour. He acknowledged that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time.

25The report noted that the ""time in custody has afforded him time to reflect upon his life and to effect an attitudinal change so that, when released, he will return to work, either as a labourer or, further, the possibility of re-engaging in boilermaking/belt splicing in the local mining industry."" The author noted that he was forthright in his interview.

26I have been given the assistance by Mr Coles of statistical information maintained by the Judicial Commission sentencing database.

27Mr Ramsland helpfully provided some written submissions. He argued that the objective seriousness of the offence fell below the mid range for such offences, and Mr Coles agreed with that submission. I, too, will find that the objective seriousness of the offence fell below the mid range, but not far below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.

28One of the factors which I take into account is the finding by the doctors that, fortunately for the victim, his lacerations were described as minor.

29I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was Mr Soars who wielded the bottle which injured Mr Emmerson.

30I find, as Mr Coles urged me, that there was some degree of planning or, as he put it, some deliberation involved. It involved a matter of 10 minutes or so, I expect, so it was not an offence planned for an extended period of time, but nor, on the other hand, was it completely spontaneous.

31Mr Ramsland acknowledged, as he had to, that his client had a record of previous convictions, which I have referred to. They are an aggravating factor in my sentencing, which I take into account under section 21A(2)(d) in this case. In particular, the record of previous convictions includes assaults and at least one assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

32Mr Ramsland, in his written submissions, urged me to find that his client has good prospects of rehabilitation. As I indicated during submissions, I do not find that his prospects of rehabilitation are good. That must be a finding which I make because Mr Soars has been called up a number of times in the past for a breach of his bond, and the Probation and Parole reports were somewhat guarded about his response to supervision. On the other hand, as Mr Ramsland submitted, his client's attitude seems to have changed in the last few months, so I would regard his prospects of rehabilitation as guarded.

33He has pleaded guilty to the offence. That is an important factor to take into account. It is relevant in this case because of its value in saving court time and the sentence which I propose to impose will be 15 per cent shorter than what I might have otherwise imposed.

34I take into account that Mr Ramsland's client is still very young and has a good work history, and has substance abuse problems to deal with.

35I propose to adjust, in due course, the ratio between the non-parole period of the sentence and the balance of the term. Normally, a non-parole period is 75 per cent of the sentence which a judge would impose, but I propose to reduce that because of the special circumstances which Mr Ramsland has referred to in his submissions. They are the need for his client to get support and guidance for some period after his release, as well as his client's relatively young age. It is also his client's first substantial period of time in custody.

36Mr Coles correctly emphasised the importance in this case, in sentencing this offender, of the protection of the community. Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act includes amongst the purposes for which a judge may impose sentence the protection of the community from the offender. That is very important in this case, because Mr Soars has taken it upon himself to assault other people within the community, including a law enforcement officer, and in this case, as Mr Coles said, to pick on two innocent people who were enjoying a quiet drink one summer's evening in the park. He left one of them with his head in his hands and bleeding from his face and head and stole money and a wallet from him, as well as participating in robbery from the other victim.

37I mentioned his co-offender. I also mentioned that he pleaded guilty. He was sentenced for two counts of robbery. He was sentenced in the Children's Court nearly a year ago. He received a control order of 12 months with a non-parole period of 5 months. I must bear in mind, of course, that I know nothing about that young person's criminal history but, more importantly, the sentence given to a juvenile does not assist with parity for an adult because of the large number of special factors which have to be taken into account in sentencing a juvenile.

38I need to take into account the robbery in company which Mr Soars has asked me to take into account when I am sentencing him for the robbery with wounding. 

39I have determined that an appropriate overall sentence, taking into account that other offence, would be 7½ years imprisonment. However, I propose to discount that sentence by 15 per cent because of Mr Soars' plea of guilty. I propose to fix a sentence of 6 years imprisonment for the offence that I am sentencing Mr Soars for.

40I propose to fix a non-parole period of 3 ½ years for that 6 year sentence. That 3 ½ years is about 60 per cent of the overall sentence. It is less than the 75 per cent envisaged by the sentencing law, because of the special circumstances which I have referred to.

41The non-parole period is obviously substantially less than the standard non-parole period of 7 years provided for by Parliament. The reason for that is that the offence does not fall within the middle of the range of objective seriousness in my opinion. In addition, Mr Soars has pleaded guilty to the offence, and I take those factors into account in not fixing the standard non-parole period.

42The balance of the term will be 2½ years after the non-parole period.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Soars, I am going to formally sentence you now, if you would stand up.

43I formally convict you of the offence of robbery in company with wounding. I take into account in sentencing you the offence of robbery in company. I set a non-parole period of 3½ years to commence on 3 December 2010 and to expire on 2 June 2014. The balance of the term is 2½ years commencing on 3 June 2014 and expiring on 2 December 2016. 

44The overall sentence is 6 years. The first date that it appears to me you will be eligible for parole is 2 June 2014. Whether you get parole will depend upon the Parole Authority.

HIS HONOUR: Have a seat, Mr Soars. Now, Mr Coles, Mr Ramsland, the mathematics is one factor and another factor is whether I have overlooked any factual or legal matter which could be dealt with straight away.

COLES: No, your Honour, I think the mathematics is correct, and I don't think your Honour has overlooked anything.

RAMSLAND: Yes, your Honour, nothing.

45Mr Soars, you have a 6 year prison sentence. I have backdated it to when you were arrested. It commenced on 3 December 2010. It expires on 2 December 2016. It takes into account the other robbery on the woman. You have a non-parole period of 3 ½ years. Normally the non-parole period would be 75 per cent. I have reduced that in your case. It also started when you were arrested. It will expire on 2 June 2014 and you are eligible for release then. The balance of the term starts then and expires on 2 December 2016. Because the sentence is over 3 years, I do not fix any conditions of parole.

2758566,R v HAMILTON [2012] NSWDC 102,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: The community is rightfully concerned about the possession and use of firearms. So concerned is Parliament that one of the offences that carries with it a standard non parole period is possessing a prohibited firearm and another is using a prohibited firearm. Not only are members of the community constantly learning of the dangers that the use and possession of firearms present but, Parliament has responded to those concerns by creating offences and providing maximum penalties and standard non parole period suggesting the seriousness with which the court should treat these offences. 

2The offender, John Evan Hamilton, came into possession of a shortened single barrel 12 gauge shotgun. At the time he was renting a room from a Lin Young, who also resided in the house with her family. Another young man, Brannon Shirley, who was seventeen years of age, rented another room as well. The offender maintains that he obtained possession of this shortened shotgun so that it could be used on rural premises. There is no legitimate reason that a person would obtain a shortened shotgun to use on rural premises. The shortening of a shotgun provides no advantage unless the shotgun is to be concealed. If the offender was telling the truth and wanted to use a shotgun on rural premises, it would not have been a shortened one. So I reject completely his fanciful suggestion that he had a legitimate purpose in possessing the shotgun.

3We do not know when he came into the possession of it but he was certainly in possession of it on 14 January 2011. He went into the house where he was renting a room and was seen by the owner. He was carrying not only the shotgun but a plastic bag containing ammunition. Not surprisingly the owner of the house expressed some concern. She told him that she did not want a firearm in the house and he should get rid of it. Mr Hamilton agreed, but instead of doing what he had just been requested to do, he walked into the rear yard with the young man named David Young and fired the shotgun two or three times aiming at a tree. The owner, Lin Young, went into the backyard, she told him not to shoot anymore and to give her the gun. The offender refused, he said he would hide it and he put it in his room. He did not put it anywhere securely, he simply put it in a bag under his bed. 

4That evening an event occurred which would later lead to an argument between other members of the household not involving the offender. The argument escalated. It had nothing to do with the offender but for reasons which are difficult to understand he not only got involved, he got involved whilst armed with the shotgun. 

5Ms Young and her daughter Leanne had previously recovered the shotgun from underneath the offender's bed and hid it in the lounge room. After the argument that I spoke about began the offender approached Leanne and said aggressively ""give it to me"". She told him where it was and he went and retrieved it. He came back to the front yard where the argument was being carried on. Ms Young heard a click and saw the offender with the shotgun in his hands. She yelled out ""he has a gun"". The offender then briefly pointed the firearm directly at Mr Shirley. Not surprisingly Mr Shirley believed that the offender was going to shoot him. Mr Shirley's brother, who had arrived earlier, got a screwdriver and ran screaming at the offender saying ""point the gun at me you fucking cunt, I'll get you, you gutless dog"". The offender then pointed the firearm at Mr Robin who turned and ran back to the car. Mr Shirley started running away. People were pleading with the offender to put the gun away. He went inside the house and a gunshot was heard. Police were then called. When they went inside the house they discovered the shotgun concealed in a manhole in the roof of the house. There was also a bag containing eight unused cartridges and four used cartridges, two more spent cartridges were located in a bin in the offender's bedroom. 

6It is apparent that the offender had discharged the shotgun whilst standing at the window in his bedroom. A spray pattern of pellets was located beneath the windowsill, the pellets appeared to have fallen into the wall cavity without penetrating the outer wall of the house. The police also discovered of course evidence that the shotgun had been fired at the tree in the backyard. The offender was given the opportunity of explaining to the police what really happened, and he told them a pack of lies, although by the time the matter came to Court he did plead guilty at the earliest opportunity available to him, thus entitling him to a sentence which is 25% less than it would otherwise have been.

7The offender is now twenty-nine years of age. He has spent a great deal of his adult life and some part of his life as a child in custody. He has priors on his criminal history including some for very serious offences indeed. In 2002 he was dealt with for an offence of assault with intent to rob whilst armed with an offensive weapon and wounding and received a sentence of imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of three and a half years. There are offences of robbery committed by the offender as a child as well and so the circumstance that this man was armed with a shortened sawn-off firearm is very concerning indeed. 

8The offender comes from a good and stable family. His mother, who clearly loves and supports him, gave evidence on his behalf in Court today. She explained that as her son was growing up, difficulties in his behaviour became apparent and although he commenced at the local high school, teachers there suggested that he might do better at special schools. He went to a school which had significantly lower class sizes, he received counselling and eventually commenced school at Boys Town. He did a number of years there and as Mrs Hamilton says, he did well with the guidance of people who were teaching him there. He has been diagnosed on occasions with ADHD and then later Oppositional Defiance Disorder. 

9No doubt part of Mr Hamilton's problems arise from his use of drugs. He has told a psychologist who interviewed him for the purposes of sentence that he commenced using alcohol and cannabis at around twelve or thirteen and at times has used cannabis greatly to excess. Although he may have reduced his cannabis consumption, he has also at times abused other drugs. In particular at about the time he committed these offences he was apparently taking prescription medication, prescribed to him for depression, to excess. 

10The circumstances in which these offences occurred were that the offender had been asked to leave home by his parents. His behaviour was causing a great deal of stress in the family and his father was suffering from a number of medical conditions which were only exacerbated by the offender's behaviour. 

11He has previously had a relationship with a young woman and indeed they have a child but this relationship began to break up in 2010 causing Mr Hamilton a great deal of heartache which led to him being prescribed antidepressant tablets which were the ones that he was abusing at about the time of this offence. Of course as is usually the case there is a cascading series of events which commence when a person abuses drugs. One of those involved the offender in this case losing his job which only added to the problems that he was facing. 

12The offender has expressed his remorse to the psychologist and also to his mother. Both his mother and the psychologist suggest that the offender is growing up and finally recognising that he is simply wasting his life in gaol. The time will come, it is perhaps hoped that it has already come, where Mr Hamilton will realise the futility of spending time in gaol when there are many enjoyable opportunities waiting for him outside as a free man. His mother and father want him to return home upon his release from custody and both he and the family understand the need for him to be appropriately counselled, in particular as regards his alcohol and drug use both within custody and upon his release from it.

13These were terribly serious offences. The offender because of his conduct is to be sentenced for an offence of possessing the prohibited firearm, and using it, and when I sentence him for using the firearm he asks me to take into account another offence of using a prohibited firearm the day earlier and possessing ammunition for it and not keeping it safely. 

14It is as well to record that the seriousness of the offender's conduct can be demonstrated by the various levels of misconduct in relation to firearms. The offender not only possessed this dangerous weapon, he had ammunition for it and indeed he loaded the firearm with that ammunition and pulled the trigger on a number of occasions, and on top of all that he actually pointed it at someone. The risk of injury is obvious, the risk that the firearm would be used on other occasions is obvious and it is fortunate indeed that no one was physically harmed by the offender's conduct, but for serious offending such as this, serious sentences are required. 

15I have taken into account, as I think I have explained, both the standard non-parole period and the maximum penalty for these two offences for which the offender must be specifically sentenced. For reasons that I will not impose the standard non-parole period is to be found in these remarks on sentence. 

16Although the offender went into custody on 15 January 2011 and has not been released since then, not all of his pre-sentence custody is referable only to these matters. He was sentenced for some driving matters in the local court and received a six months sentence to date from 15 January 2011. It would be wrong therefore for me to commence the sentences I am about to impose upon Mr Hamilton from that date. On the other hand the principle of totality applies and so I propose to date the sentences from 15 April 2011. I also propose to impose wholly concurrent sentences on these matters. That is, I fully accept, a lenient decision. Ordinarily the offender might expect that he would receive partially cumulative sentences for possessing a prohibited firearm and then using it particularly when the using offence has matters on the Form 1. But I repeat as a measure of leniency towards the offender, I will not impose a cumulative or even partially cumulative sentences in this case. 

17The result is that for each of these offences the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period in each case of two years to date from 15 April 2011 and a head sentence of four years. The offender will thus be eligible to be released to parole on 14 April 2013.

		23 July 2012",2012-02-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758580,Lawrence v Mills [2012] NSWDC 4,"REASONS FOR Judgment 

1The plaintiff was injured in a motor accident on 29 September 2004 when the vehicle being driven by the defendant collided with the vehicle he was driving. He commenced these proceedings for damages on 4 May 2011 alleging that the accident was caused by the defendant's negligence. 

2The defendant filed a motion seeking dismissal the plaintiff's proceedings, contending that the plaintiff was not entitled to commence or maintain the proceedings due to delay, being the late claim and the late commencement of proceedings. The plaintiff filed a counter motion seeking the court's leave to proceed. 

3The defendant contends that the plaintiff did not lodge his claim form until 20 June 2006, some 21 months after the accident. A claim in respect of injury received in a motor accident must be made within 6 months of the accident: s 72(1) of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (the MAC Act) . If court proceedings are commenced on a late claim, an application may be made to have the proceedings dismissed, and the court must dismiss the proceedings unless satisfied that the claimant has a full and satisfactory explanation for the delay: s 73(5) and s 73(7) of the MAC Act . 

4The plaintiff did not commence these proceedings until over 6 years after the accident. A claimant is not entitled to commence proceedings in respect of a claim more than 3 years after a motor accident, except with the leave of the court, which must not grant leave unless the claimant: 

(a) provides a full and satisfactory explanation for the delay: s 109(3)(a) of the MAC Act ; and 

(b) demonstrates that the total damages of all kinds likely to be awarded are not less than 25% of the maximum amount that may be awarded for non-economic loss under s 134 as at the date of the motor accident: s 109(3)(b) of the MAC Act . 

5A reference to a ""full and satisfactory explanation"" is dealt with in s 66(2) of the MAC Act , which provides: 

""In this Chapter, a reference to a full and satisfactory explanation by a claimant for non-compliance with a duty or for delay is a reference to a full account of the conduct, including the actions, knowledge and belief of the claimant, from the date of the accident until the providing of the explanation. The explanation is not a satisfactory explanation unless a reasonable person in the position of the claimant would have failed to have complied with the duty or would have been justified in experiencing the same delay."" 

6The full account required by s 66(2) of the MAC Act is not limited to the claimant personally, without regard to those who acted on his behalf, in so far as that conduct was relevant to the delay: Walker v Howard [2009] NSWCA 408 at [72] and [106]. Nor is it limited to actions and it must include the knowledge and belief of the claimant: at [77]. 

7The word ""full"" has been held to be a word that must be given its semantic significance, and it means that the explanation must be set out and it is not sufficient that the court should be asked to draw inferences from correspondence, et cetera, at least where that is not obvious: Ellis v Reko Pty Limited [2010] NSWCA 319 at [19]. The explanation must address acts and omissions relevant to the delay, so as to enable the court to evaluate the reasons for the delay. 

8The defendant says that the explanation provided for the plaintiff's delay is neither full nor satisfactory. He also says that the plaintiff has not demonstrated that the total damages likely to be awarded are not less than 25% of the maximum amount that may be awarded for non-economic loss under s 134 as at the date of the motor accident: s 109(3)(b) of the MAC Act . It was common ground that in this case 25% of the maximum amount that may be awarded for non-economic loss is $82,250.00 
($329,000.00 ÷ 4). 

Likely total damages 
9I will first consider whether the plaintiff has demonstrated that the total damages likely to be awarded are not less than $82,250.00. 

10The heads of damage available to the plaintiff are past out-of-pocket expenses, future expenses, past and future domestic care and assistance, past loss of earnings, and future economic loss. Damages for non-economic loss are not awardable because the plaintiff has not satisfied the statutory threshold required before such damages may be awarded: s 128 of the MAC Act . 

11The case made for the plaintiff on this issue was, in summary, as follows: It was agreed that the plaintiff is entitled to recover out-of-pocket expenses of $20,472.00. So far as the future is concerned it was submitted that there will be a need for ongoing medication and massage. It was conceded that the past loss of earnings sustained are not major, but that the plaintiff lost the opportunity to earn bonuses, and for promotion. For the future, it is alleged that the plaintiff is losing in the order of $10,000.00 nett per annum, and will be forced to retire sooner than he would otherwise have done, such that he is likely to be awarded a cushion of some $50,000.00 for future economic loss. Taken together, these various heads of damage will in total exceed the threshold amount of $82, 250.00. 

12The defendant, on the other hand, submits that the medical evidence does not support any award of damages for economic loss, either for the past or for the future. Similarly, there is no appropriate basis for an award for domestic care. 

13For his position, the defendant relies on the medical specialists qualified by his solicitors, who consider that the plaintiff suffered minor musculo-ligamentous injuries in the motor accident, the effects of which have substantially resolved. This opinion is supported by the Medical Assessor from the Medical Assessment Service (MAS), Dr Clive Kenna. Absent any ongoing disability, the plaintiff has suffered no diminution in earning capacity. 

14The plaintiff relies upon the doctors who have treated him, and the specialist medical opinion of Dr Max Ellis, whose most recent report is dated 1 November 2010. In the opinion of Dr Ellis, the plaintiff suffered musculo-ligamentous contusion and aggravation of degenerative change in the neck and back. Consequent upon the back injury there are secondary effects in the plaintiff's lower limbs, referred pain and neurological deficits. Radiologically, there is a small disc protrusion at C6/7 in the cervical spine, desiccation or internal disc disruption in the lumbar spine at L3/4 and probably an inferior plate fracture at this level. 

15Dr Ellis attributes these findings and the plaintiff's ongoing problems to the motor accident, noting that there had been no other relevant accident or injury and in particular no previous disability in the back or neck. 

16As counsel acknowledged at the hearing, the determination of the extent of the plaintiff's ongoing disabilities and the causative role played by the accident fall to be determined on the medical reports. I did not have the benefit of cross-examination of any of the doctors, or any other detailed opinion on the question of causation. 

17The assessment of the total damages likely to be awarded requires the plaintiff to demonstrate something more than an arguable case. On the other hand, he is not required to show that the damages will ""more likely than not"", exceed the relevant threshold. What he is required to prove is that that there is a ""real chance"" or a ""real prospect"" or that such may well be the situation: Sinclair v Darwich [2010] NSWCA 195 at [36]. 

18The issue in this case, as presented to me on the medical reports, is whether there is a real chance the court will find that the plaintiff's ongoing complaints of pain and discomfort in the back and neck are, firstly, genuine, and secondly, a result of the motor accident. 

19On the first question, there was nothing before me to suggest the plaintiff's complaints were other than genuine. 

20On the second question, of causation, on the evidence before me and having regard in particular to the absence of any evidence of the plaintiff experiencing any significant prior problems in his spine, the issue is to be decided in the plaintiff's favour, the opinion of Dr Ellis being preferred to that of the other medical opinion. 

21The extent of the plaintiff's complaints and their combined effect on his earning capacity since the accident and into the future, together with future medical treatment and domestic assistance he has required and will require, are clearly sufficient to warrant an award of damages in excess of $82, 250.00. 

22I find, therefore that there is a real prospect that the total damages to be awarded to this plaintiff are not less than 25% of the maximum amount that may be awarded for non-economic loss, and the plaintiff has satisfied this requirement for a grant of leave to commence proceedings out of time. 

Full and satisfactory explanation 
23I now turn to consider whether the explanation provided for the delay was full and satisfactory. 

24It was conceded on behalf of the plaintiff that, having regard to the wording of s 66(2) of the MAC Act , the period for which a full and satisfactory explanation is required is the whole of the time from the date of the motor accident to the date of giving an explanation that is both full and satisfactory: McNamara v Fitzgibbon [2005] 274 at [31] - [43]; Hickey Transport Pty Ltd v Gordon [2008] NSWCA 167 at [8]. 

25I will consider firstly whether the explanation for the delay in making the claim was full and satisfactory. 

26I will then consider whether the explanation for the delay in the commencement of the proceedings in this court was full and satisfactory. 

The delay in lodging the claim form 
27A claim form was only forwarded to the CTP insurer, AAMI Insurance (AAMI), on 18 January 2006. The insurer contended that the claim was incomplete in that it did not include a CTP Medical Certificate and the certificate was not provided until 20 June 2006. It seems that it was conceded, therefore, that notice of the plaintiff's claim was not given on 18 January 2006, but was only given when the relevant medical certificate was provided, on 20 June 2006. 

28By a Certificate dated 28 September 2009, an Assessor from the Claims Assessment and Resolution Service (CARS) certified that the plaintiff could make a late claim in accordance with s 73 of the MAC Act . In his reasons the CARS Assessor concluded that he was satisfied the plaintiff had provided a full and satisfactory explanation for the delay in lodging his claim form. The assessment of the dispute by the CARS Assessor was, however, made pursuant to s 96(1)(a) of the MAC Act , and is not binding on the parties: Hayek v Trujillo [2007] NSWCA 139 at [47] - [50]. The plaintiff acknowledges that I am bound by that decision, such that the defendant's insurer is entitled to re-agitate the issue the issue before me. 

29The accident in which the plaintiff's injuries were sustained occurred during a journey that entitled him to receive workers' compensation benefits. He made a workers' compensation claim, which he assumed ""took care of everything"". He did not seek legal advice until 18 October 2005 when he consulted his present solicitors, Brydens Law Office (Brydens). 

30On that day he had a conference with a solicitor employed by Brydens, Ms Kha, when he learned, for the first time, that he was under a separate obligation to give notice of a claim to the CTP insurer of the other vehicle involved in his accident, in addition to his claim for workers compensation, and that notice was required to have been given within 6 months of the accident, namely by 30 March 2005. He would, therefore, have to make a ""late"" claim and provide a full and satisfactory explanation for the delay in making the claim. 

31Ms Kha gave the plaintiff a claim form to complete ""as best he can"" and asked him to return it to Brydens. 

32Subsequently, another solicitor at Brydens, Ms Mary Nguyen, took over the file. She noted that the plaintiff had not returned the claim form, and telephoned him on 6 January 2006. She explained to the plaintiff the urgency, and that the claim form needed to be lodged as soon as possible. He said he had 90% completed it and would send it back next week. She then wrote to the plaintiff on 9 January 2006, asking him to return the completed form urgently. 

33On 17 January 2006 the plaintiff attended at Brydens and completed the claim form. The claim form was forwarded by Brydens to the CTP insurer, AAMI Insurance (AAMI), by letter dated 18 January 2006. 

34In reply, AAMI advised Brydens, by letter dated 27 January 2006, that the claim form was incomplete, and asked for a CTP Medical Certificate. AAMI also noted that the claim form had been lodged after the 6-month period allowed by the MAC Act , and requested a full and satisfactory explanation for the delay in lodging the claim. 

35The essence of the explanation proffered in respect of the period up until the end of January 2006 is that the plaintiff was unaware of his legal obligation to give notice of the claim within 6 months of the accident, and thereafter took steps to lodge the claim form. Ultimately, no submission was made on behalf of the defendant that the explanation in respect of this period was not full or satisfactory. 

36It then took some 5 months to obtain and lodge the CTP Medical Certificate. 

37The evidence establishes that during this period the plaintiff experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining the relevant certificate, due to the non-cooperation of his general practitioner, Dr Nicolau. It wasn't until 12 May 2006 when he telephoned Brydens and was told that he could obtain the certificate from another doctor. 

38The plaintiff then changed doctors, and obtained a certificate from Dr Amjad on 17 May 2006. In the meantime, he was also chasing up an earnings certificate, and once he had received this, both certificates were forwarded by facsimile to Brydens on 19 June 2006. The original certificates were received by Brydens on 30 June 2006 and immediately forwarded to the insurer. 

39The delay between the lodging of the claim form on 18 January 2006 and the supply of the CTP Medical Certificate on 30 June 2006 has, in my view, been fully explained by these events. 

40It is clear that the focus during this period was in getting the CTP Medical Certificate , and I am satisfied that a reasonable person in the position of the claimant would have been justified in experiencing the same delay. 

41Unfortunately, it then took Brydens a further 15 months to provide the insurer with any sort of explanation for the delay in lodging the claim form. It is necessary, therefore, to examine what happened in that period, and the period after that leading up to the CARS determination of the special assessment in respect of the late claim made on 28 September 2009. 

42Some time after the provision of the CTP Medical Certificate conduct of the file was assumed by a principal of Brydens, Mr Robert Bryden. By letter dated 4 July 2006 Mr Bryden wrote to the plaintiff confirming lodgement of the claim form and reminding the plaintiff of the need to provide the insurer with a full and satisfactory explanation on why his claim form was lodged outside the required six-month period. He told the plaintiff Brydens would need to prepare an explanation for his signature. In order to prepare the explanation, Brydens required details relating to his treatment since the accident, and enclosed various medical authorities for signature and return by the plaintiff. The letter went on to stress that it was ""essential that we proceed without any further delays."" 

430n 28 July 2006 Mr Bryden wrote to the plaintiff requesting him to sign and return medical authorities, urgently, by 4 August 2006. 

44The plaintiff returned the signed medical authorities on or around 10 August 2006. Brydens then wrote to Medicare requesting a Claims History Statement. On 31 August Brydens wrote to the workers compensation insurer and to AAMI, advising that they would be in a position to forward the explanation for the delay once the Medicare statement was obtained. 

45It was not until December, however, that Brydens made any effort to follow up Medicare, and on 18 December 2006 a further, up to date Claims History Statement was requested. On 8 January 2008 a follow up phone call was made to Medicare, when Medicare advised the statement would be forwarded next week. 

46But nothing further happened until 14 April 2007 when AAMI wrote again requesting the explanation for the delay. Soon after that letter, another solicitor at Brydens, Ms Frances Smith, reviewed the file and on 27 March 2007 wrote to AAMI advising that some difficulty had been experienced in obtaining the HIC documentation ""necessary to provide a full chronology of treatment"". The explanation would be provided as soon as possible. Ms Smith gave instructions to a paralegal to take steps to obtain various pieces of information she considered were required for the completion of the explanation. 

47According to the unchallenged evidence of Ms Smith: 

""It [was] my task to prepare the explanations for delay in lodgement of claim forms in matters conducted by Mr Bryden. It [was] the usual practice of the firm to require an HIC list of payments and if applicable a schedule of workers compensation payments in order that a full chronology of treatment can be provided in such explanations for delay."" 

48What followed then was a period of relative confusion concerning the information required for the explanation. There were two factors at play that contributed to the confusion, and further delay. First, correspondence from Brydens and Medicare was being sent to the plaintiff's old address. This situation did not become apparent until the plaintiff contacted Brydens on 7 August 2007. On 8 August Brydens wrote again to Medicare requesting that the Claims History Statement be sent to the plaintiff. Second, some of the documentation requested went to the workers compensation section of Brydens and there was a delay in the information being passed on to Mr Bryden's section, where the motor accident claim was being handled. 

49Finally, however, on 28 August 2007, Ms Smith drafted a statutory declaration for the plaintiff to execute, with a view to explaining the late lodgement of his claim form. This was subscribed and declared on 13 September 2007 and forwarded to AAMI on 17 September 2007. 

50The plaintiff's first statutory declaration of 13 September 2007 describes the post-accident history and sets out treatment dates and payments, including HIC payments. It goes on to recount that the plaintiff first obtained legal advice in October 2005, following which steps were taken to lodge the claim form. He stated: 


""...I did not know that a motor accident claim form needed to be lodged. It was my understanding that the workers compensation insurer took care of everything..."" 

51Brydens then prepared an Application to CARS for General Assessment, which was lodged on 28 September 2007. 

52On 3 October 2007, AAMI wrote to Brydens rejecting the plaintiff's explanation because no details were provided as to why the plaintiff did not seek legal advice earlier, or as to the delay between the initial conference with Brydens and the lodging of the claim form. 

53Accordingly, Ms Smith set about preparing a further statutory declaration for the plaintiff to execute. She also prepared a statutory declaration for her own execution, setting out the history of the conduct of the matter by Brydens. 

54The plaintiff collected his second statutory declaration in January 2008. He returned it 2 days later, but Ms Smith did not receive it. She blamed the paralegal, Ms Singh, for not making a diary entry to follow up the plaintiff, when in fact, the document had already been returned. It was not until further correspondence was received from AAMI that the missing statutory declaration was followed up. Ms Smith declared in her statutory declaration: 

""On 7 April 2008 three letters dated 22 November 2007, 23 January 2008 and 1 April 2008 from the Motor Accident Authority were brought to my attention. The first two letters requested among other things that an Application for Special Assessment be lodged with CARS in respect of the dispute between the parties as to whether the Claimant could make a late claim. The third letter advised that the CARS Application for General Assessment had been dismissed because neither a MAS Application for Assessment of Permanent Impairment nor a CARS Application for Special Assessment had been lodged. I did not see these letters prior to 7 April 2008."" 

55Following this, the plaintiff attended at Brydens to execute his second statutory declaration on 21 April 2008, following his return from a holiday, and Ms Smith executed her statutory declaration on 24 April 2008. The plaintiff's second statutory declaration dated 21 April 2008 was short: 

""Shortly before consulting Brydens Law Office I had a conversation with Mr Charlie Pitcock who was my supervisor at work. I was expressing my dissatisfaction to him in relation to matters which had arisen with the workers compensation insurer. This included difficulty in obtaining approval for payment of an MRI scan. He said to me words to the effect, ""you should take legal action."" Within days I contacted Brydens Law Office and made an appointment for consultation with Brydens Law Office"". 

56The plaintiff's second statutory declaration of 21 April 2008 was not sent to the insurer. Nor was Ms Smith's statutory declaration of 24 April 2008. 

57Conduct of the plaintiff's motor accident claim was then removed from Ms Smith. In May 2008 there was an internal restructure at Brydens involving Mr Bryden's common law division. Day to day carriage of the plaintiff's claim was assumed by another solicitor, Mr Wes Ranson. He undertook a review of the file on 15 May 2008. 

58An appointment was made with Ms Welsh of counsel to review the material for the Special Assessment Application. A conference with Ms Welsh took place on 26 May 2008, following which the plaintiff attended at Brydens on 4 June 2008 when he swore his third statutory declaration. 

59The plaintiff's third statutory declaration of 4 June 2008 set out more detail concerning the late lodgement of his claim form, including the problems he had had obtaining a medical certificate from Dr Nicolau. It also set out some detail concerning his second statutory declaration: 

""I didn't know that my solicitors didn't receive that document until they contacted me in April. As soon as I knew that the document had gone astray I attended their office in order to declare a further copy."" 

60The plaintiff's third affidavit was then forwarded to Lee & Lyons Lawyers, which firm was by this time retained by AAMI to act for the defendant. Lee & Lyons wrote to Brydens telling them they had not received the plaintiff's second statutory declaration of 21 April 2008. Brydens sent this statutory declaration on 20 June 2008. 

61By letter dated 1 August 2008, Lee & Lyons wrote to Brydens advising that AAMI had rejected the plaintiff's further explanation for the delay in lodging the claim form. Arrangements were made for a further conference with counsel on 8 September 2008, but this had to be cancelled. 

62Eventually, a further conference was scheduled with Ms Welsh of counsel on 24 October 2008, which was attended by Ms Smith, for the purposes of preparing a second statutory declaration to be executed by Ms Smith in connection with a proposed Special Assessment Application. 

63On 29 October 2008 Brydens wrote to Ms Welsh requesting advice concerning the draft second statutory declaration and asking if further evidence would be required in support of the Special Assessment Application. 

64Ms Welsh did not respond until 12 December 2008 when she rang Mr Ranson advising him to serve Ms Smith's second statutory declaration. Ms Smith then executed her second statutory declaration on 17 December 2008 and Mr Ranson took steps to serve it on Lee & Lyons. 

65In her second statutory declaration Ms Smith referred to her earlier affidavit of 21 April 2008, a mistaken reference to 24 April 2008. Lee & Lyons then wrote to Brydens on 13 January 2009 asking for Ms Smith's first statutory declaration. This was forwarded by Brydens on 9 February 2009. 

66By letter dated 12 March 2009 Lee & Lyons advised Brydens that AAMI still considered that a full and satisfactory explanation had not been provided for the delay in lodging a claim form: 

""In particular your Client's explanation is not satisfactory in that a reasonable person in the position of your Client would not have been justified in experiencing the same delay."" 

67Mr Ranson then arranged a further conference with Ms Welsh of counsel, which did not take place till 2 April 2009. A week later Ms Welsh provided an advice with Submissions in support of the proposed Special Assessment Application. 

68The Special Assessment Application was lodged and served on 28 April 2009. 

69The Special Assessment Application took its course. The insurer's reply was lodged on 29 May 2009 and a preliminary conference took place on 30 June 2009. 

70In support of the application a fourth statutory declaration was executed by the plaintiff on 20 August 2009 and served on Lee & Lyons, with more detail of some of the events. 

71In due course, the CARS Assessor determined the application and issued his Certificate of 28 September, to which I have already referred. The Assessor determined the application in favour of the plaintiff, and gave reasons. 

72The insurer does not accept the determination and I am required to consider the issue of a full and satisfactory explanation afresh. 

73I have examined the events between 30 June 2006 and 28 September 2009 in some considerable detail, in order that it might be understood why things happened as they did, or more correctly, why things did not happen until they did; to put them in context: Russo v Aiello [2003] HCA 53 at [4]. 

74In my view, these events, viewed in their sequence, amounted to a full account of the conduct, including the actions of the plaintiff and his solicitors, and of their knowledge and belief. I am satisfied that details of all the acts and omissions relevant to the delay were provided to the CARS Assessor, so as to enable an evaluation of the reasons for the delay. 

75Much could be said about the ineptitude of the lawyers involved in prosecuting the plaintiff's motor accident claim. There is an almost surreal aura of casualness surrounding the matter. Words such as neglect, incompetence, ineptitude and inefficiency spring to mind. The attention paid to this matter by those concerned was dilatory and desultory. Criticism, if it were relevant, is to be levelled at the participants I have mentioned, and also at the firm and its principals for the seemingly total absence of any systems and supervision. 

76But the focus of the legislation is not about apportioning blame. It is about justifying the delay rather than excusing it: Russo v Aiello [2003] HCA 53 at [7]. 

77I find, therefore, that the explanation for the delay was full. The next question is whether it was satisfactory, that is, would a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff have been justified in experiencing the same delay? 

78What constitutes justifiable delay on the part of a reasonable person in making a claim is to be considered in the light of the legislative purpose explained in the Act: Russo v Aiello [2003] HCA 53 at [5]. What the Act requires is justification for the delay; not demonstration that the delay did not cause harm: Russo v Aiello [2003] HCA 53 at [7]. In this case the insurer has known about the plaintiff's intention to claim since at least 18 January 2006. 

79The essence of the plaintiff's explanation is that he relied upon his lawyers to do all the things necessary to prosecute his claim. In my view, there was nothing particular in the sequence of events that I have set out that indicates the plaintiff was aware there was a particular problem with the provision of the explanation. There are some instances of his being slow to attend to matters, but none of these were extreme, and the evidence establishes that once given a specific deadline in which to do something, he invariably complied. 

80It was submitted on behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff is an educated man, employed in a senior management role. The need for urgency was pressed upon him on numerous occasions. He was not entitled to ""sit in silence"" but has to take some responsibility for periods of considerable inaction on the part of his lawyers. He never made an enquiry as to progress of his claim, or the outcome of any of the events, or why things were required, such as four separate affidavits. This is not the conduct of a reasonable person. 

81This is the hindsight, legal counsel of perfection. The fact is that everyday, lay clients trust their lawyers. That's why they engage them. They assume that their lawyers are competent, and are diligently attending to the client's matter. 

82Sadly, it is not always the case. But in the present matter, there was, as I have said, nothing in particular to alert the plaintiff to any problem and in my view, a reasonable person in his position would not have acted differently. 

83I am satisfied, therefore, that a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff would have been justified in experiencing the same delay. I find therefore that a full and satisfactory explanation was provided to the CARS Assessor for the delay in giving notice to the insurer of the plaintiff's claim. 

The delay in commencing proceedings 

84I now turn to consider whether the explanation for the delay in the commencement of the proceedings in this court was full and satisfactory. 

85In her letter dated 7 November 2005, Ms Kha wrote to the plaintiff formally advised him as to the time limit for the commencement of proceedings: 

""We advise that you have three years from the date of injury in which to commence proceedings under the Motor Accidents Legislation."" 

86On 6 January 2006, when the plaintiff had not returned the claim form, and Ms Nguyen telephoned him. In making a note of the call she wrote that the ""limitation date"" had been diarised, and put into the ""Master Diary"" six months before the expiry of the limitation period. A review was also diarised for one year from that date. 

87Clearly, none of these follow ups were ever actioned. 

88In the letter from Brydens of 30 May 2006, the plaintiff was again told that proceedings must be lodged within 3 years. In the letter dated 23 July 2007 he was again told that the 3-year limitation period would expire on 29 September 2007. 

89It is undoubtedly clear that the plaintiff knew there was a three years time limit. It is not clear, however, that he was told what had to be done in that time frame. It was not explored, for example, whether he understood the Application to CARS for General Assessment, which was lodged on 28 September 2007, was a sufficient compliance. Nor were the consequences of a failure to comply ever explained to him, such that he assumed the need for a full and satisfactory explanation in respect of the statutory declarations he was providing, were also intended to deal with that situation. Like everything else in this matter, the conduct of the plaintiff's claim was marked by the ineptitude to which I have already referred. 

90It is clear that Mr Ranson gave no advice to the plaintiff about the 3-year time limit. Mr Ranson was cross-examined on 25 November 2011 in respect of his first affidavit affirmed on 19 October 2011. He gave the following evidence (from T 44.14): 

"" HIS HONOUR: Right. So this is the question for Mr Ranson. 

Q, When you did a review of the file in May 2008 did you review whatever was required to be done in relation to meeting the three year time limit? 
A. By that stage the three year time limit had been - elapsed. 

Q. So you did notice that? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What did you decide to do and what did you advise your client in that regard? 
A. It is my understanding that-- 

Q. No, what did you do, I don't want to know what you understood, what did you do? 
A. Made arrangements for the conferences to be arranged to enable the documents to be prepared. 

Q. So you, having reviewed the file, you saw that the three year period was over, you realised that you needed to provide a full and satisfactory explanation, did you tell your client? 
A. I can't recall your Honour, I don't think so. 

Q. Well not in any letter anyway? 
A. That's right not in any letter. 

Q. So is it probable that you didn't? 
A. Not myself personally no, it is probable. 

Q. So since 2008, May 2008 you've known that this plaintiff was out of time, what have you done about it, apart from not telling your client? 
A. I sought to cure the defects of the CARS assessment application. 

Q. Would that have cured the three year period? 
A. No, the three year period had already lapsed. 

Q. What did you do to fix up the problem that you were out of time? 
A. I sought to-"" 

91At this point I called the hearing to a halt and stood it over to enable Mr Ranson to review the file and put on any further evidence that might be appropriate. Mr Ranson executed a second affidavit on 1 December 2011, which was read without objection when the hearing resumed on 6 December 2011, in relation to which he was cross-examined. 

92It is clear that Mr Ranson, with the benefit of hindsight and experience, would now do things differently when confronted with a similar situation. The steps that he took at the time, he freely acknowledged, were wrong, a result of his inexperience and lack of a full appreciation and understanding of the operation of the MAC Act and the CARS system. 

93He stated in his second affidavit: 

"" As outlined in my earlier affidavit, I prepared and caused the plaintiff's MAS Application to be lodged with the Motor Accidents Authority on 15 September 2009. By lodging the plaintiff's MAS Application, I was aware that the two issues which made the plaintiff's earlier General Assessment Application defective had been addressed which meant that a further General Assessment Application could then be lodged. 

At that time, being September 2009, I was aware that the insurer had not yet issued a section 81 notice in respect to liability. As outlined in paragraph 44 of my earlier Affidavit I wrote to Lee & Lyons on 6 October 2009 requesting the insurer's determination on liability. As noted in that paragraph, it was my understanding that such a determination was necessary to determine which jurisdiction to pursue the claim in on behalf of the plaintiff in the CARS system or at court. At that time I understood that it would be of no benefit to lodge a further General Assessment Application if the insurer was going to subsequently issue a section 81 notice denying liability which would have had the effect of forcing the plaintiff to commence Court proceedings. 

As outlined in paragraphs 46 and 47 of my earlier affidavit, it was my understanding, at that time, that the MAS determination was required to assist Counsel to prepare draft submissions addressing all heads of damage in support of the plaintiff's further General Assessment Application. 

In regards to this issue, my practice has changed since October 2009. Now, if I am confronted with a situation where the 3 year limitation period has expired and the MAS determination is till outstanding, I would now make arrangements for the plaintiff to confer with counsel to prepare Statements and Submissions in support of a General assessment Application in the absence of a final MAS determination... My current practice would be lodge the General Assessment Application in the absence of the outstanding MAS determination."" 

94It was not put to Mr Ranson that his current practice was inappropriate or inadequate. 

95I am satisfied that in the light of the frank concessions by Mr Ranson as to the errors made in respect of the commencement of the court proceedings out of time, that there has been a full account of the conduct, including the actions, knowledge and belief of those acting on behalf of the plaintiff at all relevant times. As for the plaintiff himself, none of these matters was ever revealed to him, and the state of his knowledge and belief remained one of ignorance. 

96Counsel for the defendant did not, in the final result, make any submission that the explanation as to the delay in commencing proceedings was other than the result of Mr Ranson's errors. That being the case, I am satisfied that the explanation for the delay was full. 

97Nor did counsel for the defendant press me to the effect that the explanation was not satisfactory. Logically, if the solicitor was in error, and gave no relevant advice to his client, it follows that a reasonable person in his position would not have done anything different. 

98For similar reasons to those given above as to the delay in giving notice of the claim, I am satisfied that a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff would have been justified in experiencing the same delay in respect of the late commencement of proceedings. There was nothing in particular to alert the plaintiff to any problem and he was entitled to assume, as he did, that his lawyers were diligently and appropriately attending to the necessary steps in the proper prosecution of his claim. 

99I am satisfied, therefore, that a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff would have been justified in experiencing the same delay. I find therefore that a full and satisfactory explanation has been provided for the delay in commencing proceedings. 

Costs 
100The costs of the motions should not follow the event. 

101Up until the second day of the hearing the explanation for the delay in commencing proceedings was in my view less than full. It was not until the reading of Mr Ranson's second affidavit that a full explanation was provided, such that an evaluation as to whether or not it was satisfactory could be made. 

102In those circumstances, I consider, in the exercise of my discretion as to costs, that the plaintiff should pay the costs of the defendant in respect of both motions. 

Disposition 

103The plaintiff has satisfied the court as to the various matters such as to justify an order giving him leave to proceed and to prosecute the proceedings brought. 

104The plaintiff's motion therefore succeeds and the motion filed for the defendant is dismissed. 

105I order that the plaintiff be given leave to proceed on the Statement of Claim already filed. 

106I order the plaintiff to pay the costs of the defendant in respect of both motions.

		06 February 2012",2012-02-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758582,Lawton v R [2012] NSWCCA 16,"Judgment 

1BASTEN JA : On 6 February 2012 this Court granted leave to appeal, to the extent that was necessary, allowed the appeal, granted leave to the applicant to withdraw his plea of guilty, set aside the conviction and sentence imposed in the District Court and remitted the matter for further hearing according to law. That occurred in circumstances where counsel for the Director conceded that the applicant did not appreciate the nature of the charge and did not intend to admit guilt of the charge in pleading guilty to an offence under s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). I joined in those orders of the Court, though in circumstances which, for the reasons set out below, were far from satisfactory. 

2On 17 March 2011 the Director of Public Prosecutions charged the applicant that he ""did recklessly cause grievous bodily harm to Thomas Biviano"", contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act . The charge reflected the words of the section. 

3The alleged offence arose out of an incident which occurred at the rear of the Bi-Lo supermarket at Maitland, in the early hours of 31 October 2009. The applicant was engaged in a fight with another man when Mr Biviano stepped between them and told them to desist. (Where there was conflicting evidence, neutral language will be used, to avoid suggesting an unintended preference in these reasons.) The following statement appears in the judgment of Hock DCJ in sentencing the applicant on 22 March 2011 (pp 1-2): 

""As is often the case with incidents of this kind, there are different versions of what happened next. However, the weight of the evidence is that the offender delivered a right-handed punch to the left side of Mr Biviano's face with such force that Mr Biviano fell to the ground without being able to break his fall. Mr Solbrandt's evidence is that the victim was not looking at or facing the offender at the time. Mr Biviano's head hit the concrete path with a loud thud. Mr Solbrandt went to his aid and could not get a response from him. Mr Biviano had blood coming out of his nose and mouth. There was a bleeding wound at the back of his head. He was making snoring noises and convulsing."" 

4On 17 March 2011, the applicant pleaded guilty to the count set out above and asked that a further offence of affray be taken into account. The applicant was convicted on his plea and sentenced to a non-parole period of three years nine months, with an additional term of two years and six months, to date from 22 March 2011. 

5The history of the matter prior to the sentencing appears from a description given by the prosecutor during the hearing on 17 March 2011 (Tcpt, p 2(40)): 

""The offender ... was charged on 2 November 2009 with this offence and the matter was committed for trial on 4 August 2010. He was arraigned on 2 September last year with a trial date being set, being 8 November. That was vacated subsequently for the offender to raise funds to instruct counsel. And then a new trial date of 14 February 2011 was set and a plea was entered on 3 February 2011 at the Newcastle District Court and that was ... to the wrong section, however, he was committed for trial in relation to the correct section."" 

6The document headed notice of appeal and application for leave to appeal was filed on 12 September 2011. In circumstances which will be outlined below, the prosecution responded to the application for leave to appeal expeditiously and, on 21 October 2011, the Director's attitude having been indicated to the Court, the applicant was granted bail. 

7The basis of the appeal was that the plea was entered ""on the misapprehension that the conduct amounted to an offence under s 35(2) of the Crimes Act""; that the applicant ""never intended to signify guilt under s 35(2) of the Crimes Act "" , and that the conviction is ""a miscarriage of justice"". 

8Although the applicant was described in the notice of appeal as ""appellant"", that was not strictly correct. What in effect the applicant sought to do was to withdraw his plea of guilty on the basis that it had been entered under a misapprehension. That required, in part, a factual inquiry as to the circumstances under which the plea was entered. Accordingly, the challenge to the conviction not being based on a ground ""which involves a question of law alone"", leave is required pursuant to s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). 

9The factual circumstances on which the applicant relied are revealed with a brevity which can best be described as contemptuous. First, his affidavit dated 13 September 2011 stated: 

""1. On the 17 th of March 2011, I received advices from Christopher O'Brien to offer a plea of guilty to the indictment on evidence that I was to give that I impulsively struck the victim to the head on one occasion. 

2. To my mind, I accept that it was an impulsive punch of a person entering my field of vision whilst fighting with another person. 

3. At no time did I contemplate or foresee that that one punch would cause any really serious injury."" 

10The affidavit was sworn before Christopher O'Brien, solicitor. On the same date, Christopher O'Brien of Maitland Road, Mayfield, swore an affidavit which, as read before this Court, stated: 

""On the 17 th of March 2011, I provided Beau Lawton with advices that on his evidence and on his instructions as stated in his affidavit of the 13 th of September 2011 that the offence of Recklessly Inflict Grievous Bodily Harm could be found proved at law."" 

11Mr O'Brien did not condescend in his affidavit to set out his involvement with the case, his experience with criminal law, his instructions, nor when he ceased to act. (Indeed, remarkably, he lodged the appeal on behalf of the applicant.) He did not state whether he had read the whole of the transcript of the interview with the applicant undertaken on 2 November 2009. There was no attempt to explain what he understood to be the elements of the offence and what precise advice had been given to the applicant. The fact that he witnessed the applicant's affidavit and the common language in both, bearing the flavour of legal drafting, suggest that the applicant obtained no independent legal advice before seeking to withdraw his plea. The applicant did not state what other legal advice he may have obtained, prior to or after his committal, nor whether he ever spoke to counsel, as appears to have been his intention at the time of the adjournment application in late 2010. 

12Mr O'Brien appeared for the applicant before the sentencing judge on 17 March 2011. He led the applicant through some brief evidence, none of which was controversial. The only part which was relevant for present purposes was the following (Tcpt, p 11): 

""Q. Is it your evidence that up until today you did not know the extent of the injuries that were [sic] caused? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Do you accept that within the fight it was one of your punches that connected with this victim? 
A. I do now realise that it was one of my punches."" 

13The applicant was later recalled to repeat his acceptance that the critical punch was his. The following exchange also occurred with the sentencing judge (Tcpt, p 14): 

""O'BRIEN: ... This good Samaritan has been struck by a loose punch and the result is shocking; that is to say, your Honour, that the effect was the grievous bodily harm which has been identified. This was not an intentional act towards this victim. It was a reckless act. 

It is in the context of what happened, your Honour, the Crown could not properly say that it was the punch that caused that injury. It's a possibility that it was the ground that caused that injury. 

HER HONOUR: He only hit the ground because he was punched. That's unfortunately the almost inevitable consequence of a strong punch from a young man and the courts see it all the time. 

O'BRIEN: Yes, your Honour. I will leave that as it is, your Honour. 

It is within a long authority of decisions, your Honour, that supports the contention that he is involved in an unlawful act and anything that happens as a consequence, your Honour, he is guilty of. He is guilty of that act, your Honour, and he has pled to that today."" 

14On the basis of the view expressed by the sentencing judge, in the course of her interjection set out above, it would have been open to a court to convict. The view expressed by the solicitor for the applicant in the following passage, after accepting her Honour's interjection, was so imprecise as to be misleading. One question raised by this application might have been whether there would have been a miscarriage of justice if the plea was given on the basis of legally inaccurate advice, but in circumstances where legally accurate advice could well have supported the same conclusion. The issue was not raised. Whether the applicant was advised (or has since been advised) as to the risk of a more severe sentence if he pleaded not guilty and was convicted was also not explored. 

15It appears to be accepted by the parties that the trigger for this application was the delivery of judgment by this Court, some three weeks after the applicant was sentenced, in Blackwell v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 93. In that case, the Court (Beazley JA, James and Hall JJ agreeing) upheld a challenge to a conviction for an offence under s 33 of the Crimes Act where the jury had been directed in relation to the alternative charge under s 35 that the relevant intention was ""to cause some physical injury"": at [39] and [40]. Beazley JA stated at [66]: 

""At this point, it is necessary to return to the directions which the trial judge gave as compared to the elements of the offence under s 35(2) as amended. Her Honour directed the jury that ' maliciously' meant ' intending to cause some physical harm' , which was one of the mental states that fell within the meaning of ' maliciously' in the Crimes Act, s 5. 'Recklessness' was another mental state which fell within the statutory meaning of 'maliciously'."" 

16Beazley JA then noted at [76], that ""where the mental element of an offence is recklessness, the Crown must establish foresight of the possibility of the relevant consequence"". The question as whether what was required was foresight of the possibility ""of some physical harm"" or of ""grievous bodily harm"": at [80]. Her Honour concluded at [82]: 

""There is a requirement of recklessness, which I have addressed. That is, there must be a foresight of the possibility of something. The recklessness must cause something. That which it must cause is grievous bodily harm. In my opinion, there is no basis upon which that term can be read down to mean ' some physical injury' ."" 

17If Mr O'Brien had taken a different view of the meaning of s 35(2), he did not say so. Indeed, his affidavit was entirely silent as to what view he took. 

18There may have been some support for the view that the trial judge in this case had misdirected herself in a manner which might have caused her to impose an inappropriate sentence. In her reasons on sentence she described the outcome in terms which bear some resemblance to her instruction to the jury in Blackwell : at p 6. However, while that material might support a challenge to the sentence, it could not support a challenge to the plea. 

19It is well established that the basis upon which an applicant can seek to appeal against a conviction based on a plea of guilty depends upon establishing that there has been a miscarriage of justice for the purposes of the Criminal Appeal Act , s 6(1). Even where an appellate court is satisfied that the defence lawyer at trial has acted incompetently, the court should not intervene unless satisfied that the outcome, namely conviction, was unjust: Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614. In the judgment of Gleeson CJ in Nudd , there is a clear articulation of the reasons why care must be taken in dealing with an invitation to examine the competence of counsel and the steps taken in the course of the trial. Where, as in the present case, there is only one step which admits of objective assessment, namely the entry of a plea, different considerations may apply. Nevertheless, two points of caution may be noted. 

20First, in similar circumstances to the present case in R v Hawker [2005] NSWCCA 118, Howie J (with whom Grove and Hall JJ agreed) undertook a careful assesment of the evidence and the specific elements of the charge, in order to form a view as to whether a miscarriage of justice had occurred. Similarly, in R v Wilkes [2001] NSWCCA 97; 122 A Crim R 310, Wood CJ at CL (with whom Giles JA and Simpson J agreed) also undertook a careful analysis of the circumstances in which the plea was given; the nature of the evidence and cross-examination which may have been available; criticisms which might have been made of the prosecution case as it unfolded and the absence of weighty evidence favouring guilt, such as that which might have been expected from DNA testing of the appellant's clothing. However, the Court was assisted in that regard by an analysis provided by counsel as to the reason why he considered that his advice to the applicant to plead guilty had been erroneous, being the advice described by Wood CJ at CL as coming from ""an experienced public defender"": at [47]. 

21The circumstances of such cases illustrate the hollowness of the claims upon which the present application was made. It is in the public interest that any such application be tested carefully by the Director of Public Prosecutions before it is accepted and the appeal effectively conceded. 

22One element of the public interest in such circumstances must be a belief in the unfairness of the conviction of the accused. In the present case, there can be limited confidence in the conviction once the Director has made the concession referred to at the beginning of these reasons. Given the concession, it would require an overwhelming case supporting guilt for this Court to refuse to act upon the joint position of the parties. That is not this case. Accordingly, it was appropriate to make the orders referred to above. 

23RS HULME J : I agree with Schmidt J. 

24SCHMIDT J : Basten JA has explained the circumstances in which the Court made orders in the applicant's favour on 6 February. These are my reasons for joining in that decision. 

25At the hearing the Crown explained that its concession was that the applicant did not appreciate the nature of the charge and did not intend to admit he was guilty of the charge, with the result, as a matter of law, that his misunderstanding of the charge was a sufficient ground for withdrawing his plea and setting aside the conviction. For my part, that concession was understandable in the circumstances which had arisen, with the result, in my view, that the orders made in favour of the applicant had to follow. 

26In Blackwell it was explained that in the case of a charge of recklessly cause grievous bodily harm, the offender must have foresight that his or her recklessness might cause the victim grievous bodily harm (see at [80]). 

27In evidence below was a statement of facts, which was not agreed, in which various accounts of how the victim came to be injured were referred to. Reference was also there made to statements made by the applicant, who claimed not to be sure if it was he who had hit the victim, who had stepped in to stop a fight in which the applicant was involved. There was also a long ERISP given by the applicant, in which various witness statements were put to him and he came to accept that it might have been his punch, which injured the victim. The applicant also gave evidence at the hearing, to which Basten JA has referred, explaining how he had come to realise that it was one of his punches which had connected with the victim. 

28The case which was put for the applicant below was that the injuries which the victim had suffered were not the result of an intentional act on his part, but a reckless one and that because he had been involved in an unlawful act, 'anything that happens as a consequence ... he is guilty of'. 

29The applicant was recalled to give further evidence after the Crown submitted that the offence fell within the mid-range of seriousness, having regard to the nature of the injuries, the degree of violence and the mental element. 

30This was after her Honour raised with the Crown the question of which of the various versions of the events in question in evidence ought to be accepted. That resulted in the applicant being recalled. He then agreed that when initially interviewed, he had denied hitting the victim; that during the course of the lengthy police interview in which he had participated, when statements made by other witnesses were put to him, he had come to accept that it could have been him who hit the victim; and that it was after several months of consideration, that he had told the police that he accepted that it could have been him. 

31The Crown then submitted: 

""Now, the mental element for the plea or for recklessness in relation to this charge is that the offender would realise the particular kind of harm in fact done to the victim might be inflicted yet he went ahead and acted. So, the Crown says the plea should be accepted on the basis that he did intentionally punch the victim, he may not have realised the degree of harm that would be in fact inflicted."" 

32That submission did not accord with the view expressed in Blackwell at [82]. Further, on the submissions advanced for the applicant, it was because he had been involved in an unlawful act, that 'anything that happens as a consequence ... he is guilty of'. This submission suggested that the legal advice which the applicant was given, which resulted in his plea, was not consistent with the conclusion in Blackwell at [82], that there must be foresight that the offender's recklessness might cause the victim grievous bodily harm. 

33Basten JA has criticised the brevity and terms of Mr O'Brien's affidavit as to the advice which he gave the applicant and the instructions which he received, a criticism which I agree is warranted. Nevertheless, it could not be overlooked that Mr O'Brien was not required for cross-examination and that he had explained in his affidavit that he accepted that the advice which he had given the applicant was in error, given the judgment in Blackwell . Given the case advanced below, it could not, in my view, be doubted that this explanation had to be accepted. 

34For his part, in his affidavit the applicant explained that he had impulsively hit someone who had entered his field of vision, while he was fighting with another person, but that he did not contemplate or foresee that one punch would cause any really serious injury. As the Crown accepted, whatever view be taken of this explanation, that the applicant would have entered a plea, had he been accurately advised before entering the plea as to the mental element of the offence with which he had been charged, does not follow. 

35That the applicant did have foresight at the time of the alleged offence, that his recklessness might cause the victim grievous bodily harm, is disputed in his affidavit. It is also clear that the advice which he received in relation to his guilt of the offence charged, was erroneous, as was the submission advanced for the Crown as to the mental element of the offence. 

36As discussed in R v Hawker [2005] NSWCCA 118 , the question on an appeal such as this is whether the conviction of the applicant consequent to his plea of guilty gave rise to a miscarriage of justice (see at [16]). Like in Hawker , in this case it is also clear that the applicant's plea of guilty was not made with full understanding of the nature of the charge and with the intention of admitting all of the elements of the offence, including the necessary intent in relation to the infliction of grievous bodily harm. In those circumstances it was apparent that a miscarriage of justice arose when the trial judge acted upon the plea, in order to convict the applicant. The result was that orders sought had to be made in the applicant's favour.

		23 February 2012",2012-02-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758584,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Elskaf [2012] NSWSC 21,"Judgment 

1On 14 November 2010 at 2.15am, the respondent, Ali Elskaf, was stopped by police officers in Macleay Street, Kings Cross. He was, at that time, driving a black Ferrari, registered number BEA 26R. The police officers informed him that he had turned left from Greenknowe Avenue into Macleay Street, Kings Cross, contrary to a red traffic signal. 

2He was issued with a penalty notice for a fine of $344 for proceeding through a red traffic signal in breach of Rule 60 of the Road Rules 2008. 

3Mr Elskaf declined to pay the fine and elected to defend the proceedings. 

4On Friday 5 August 2011, the matter was heard by Magistrate O'Shane sitting in the Local Court in the Downing Centre. 

5Having heard two police officers, whose evidence she declined to accept, the Magistrate declared herself to be satisfied that there was no prima facie case and dismissed the proceedings. She then found that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith and pursuant to the provisions of s 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 , awarded costs in the sum of $1,650, inclusive of GST, against the prosecution. 

6On 1 September 2011, the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), having given notice that he would conduct the proceedings on behalf of the prosecution, filed a summons in the Supreme Court seeking an order, pursuant to s 59(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, setting aside the decision and order of Magistrate O'Shane to dismiss the proceedings. 

7By way of alternative relief, the Director relied upon the supervisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970. 

8The Director sought orders that the matter be remitted to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law, but by a different magistrate, and other consequential relief. 

9Mr Elskaf, as first defendant, opposed the Director's claim for relief. The Local Court, the second defendant, filed a submitting appearance and did not take any part in the proceedings. 

A Statutory Right of Appeal 

10Section 56 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act provides that a prosecutor may appeal as of right to the Supreme Court against an order made by the Local Court dismissing a matter, the subject of any summary proceedings, and as well, against any order for costs made by the Local Court against a prosecutor in a summary proceeding. 

11Appeals pursuant to s 56 can only be made as of right on a ground 

""...that involves a question of law alone."" 

12Section 59 provides for the determination of such an appeal. Section 59(2) is in the following form: 

""(2) The Supreme Court may determine an appeal against an order referred to in s 56(1)(b), (c) or (d) or ...: 

(a) by setting aside the order and making such other order as it thinks just, or 

(b) by dismissing the appeal."" 

This does not include an order for costs in a summary proceeding. 

13The Director complains that the errors of law committed by Magistrate O'Shane were: 

(a)a denial of procedural fairness in that Magistrate O'Shane did not permit the prosecution to call such witnesses as the prosecution wished; 

(b)the ruling by Magistrate O'Shane that the prosecution had not established a prima facie case was erroneous as a matter of law; and 

(c)that Magistrate O'Shane failed to give adequate reasons for her ruling that no prima facie case had been established. 

The hearing before the Magistrate 

14When the hearing of proceedings commenced, the issue was described to the Magistrate by Mr Brewer, the counsel for Mr Elskaf, in the following terms: 

""...the issue is that the defendant denies making the left hand turn alleged. There is no dispute that there was an appropriate sign preventing a left hand turn at that location at that hour, but the defendant denies approaching in that direction and turning left."" 

15In the course of the discussion about what the case involved, and before the prosecution was able to call its first witness, the Magistrate enquired as to the nature of the evidence to be given by the four witnesses that the prosecutor intended to call. The prosecutor said "" it's only two police that saw the alleged offence "". At that point, the Magistrate said: 

""Well, in that case those are the only officers I want to hear from. How could the evidence of any others be relevant?"" 

16The discussion about the nature of the evidence that these witnesses could give and the relevance of it continued. The prosecutor continued to submit to the Magistrate that so far as he was concerned, the evidence of all of the officers was relevant. 

17The discussion concluded with this exchange between counsel for Mr Elskaf and the Magistrate: 

""Brewer: What happened your Honour was that the two police officers to whom the phone call was made were requested to stop a car. They did that and then the other police car caught up with them and then they conducted the infringement as I understand it. 

Her Honour: I still only need to hear from those first two police 
officers. 

Brewer: I agree your Honour. 

Her Honour: Thank you. Thank you sergeant. That's all I 
need. That's all the evidence I need."" 

18The first witness, Detective Senior Constable Mark Spice, was called. In chief, he gave evidence that together with Plain Clothes Constable Stuart he was travelling along Ward Avenue at Darlinghurst in a southerly direction when he saw a black Ferrari motor vehicle bearing registration BEA 26R, which was travelling in a northerly direction along Ward Avenue. He was concerned about the speed at which it was then travelling - being, he thought, faster than the speed limit of 50km/h. He undertook a U-turn and then followed, with another car between them, the black Ferrari along Ward Avenue to the intersection of Greenknowe Avenue. The black Ferrari continued whilst under his observation to travel along Greenknowe Avenue and when it came to the intersection with Macleay Street, he observed it turning left into Macleay Street. 

19He gave evidence that, at that time of the evening, the red traffic light prohibited a left turn into Macleay Street and that there were a number of barriers on the road that made it plain that a left hand turn was not permitted. 

20Detective Senior Constable Spice told the Court that after the black Ferrari turned left, he waited at the traffic lights and then turned left when he was permitted to do so. He said that there was very heavy traffic in Macleay Street and that it was not necessary for him to activate his lights and siren. 

21He gave evidence that when his fellow officers pulled up the Ferrari, it was directed into Roslyn Street, a side street off Macleay Street. He said he approached Mr Elskaf and outlined what he had seen to him. He said that Mr Elskaf told him "" you must've got the wrong Ferrari "". 

22Detective Senior Constable Spice was cross-examined by Mr Brewer. Mr Brewer established that there were certain parts of the oral evidence which were not included in the officer's statement. Detective Senior Constable Spice said that he had not included those matters because they did not seem to be relevant at the time he prepared his statement. 

23When challenged about why he did not pull the black Ferrari up after it first turned into Macleay Street and before it reached Roslyn Street, the officer replied that if he had done so it would have blocked the traffic in Macleay Street. 

24The cross-examination concluded with this suggestion: 

""Q. I suggest you've been mistaken and that you've seen another black Ferrari. What do you say about that? 

A. Totally incorrect. 

... 

Q. So your evidence is that the Ferrari turned left? 

A. From the right hand turning lane on a red arrow. 

Q. I suggest it wasn't a Ferrari bearing the plates BEA 26R? 

A. Incorrect sir. It was."" 

25It was also put to the officer that had he been at all concerned with the speed of the Ferrari when he first commenced to follow it, he would have pulled it up well before the intersection of Greenknowe Avenue and Macleay Street, which was about 2km from where the officer carried out his U-turn. He rejected this proposition. 

26The second officer to give evidence was Plain Clothes Constable Stuart. She gave evidence substantially similar to that of Detective Senior Constable Spice. On cross-examination, she was confronted with these questions and gave these answers: 

""Q. I want to suggest that the Ferrari that my client got out of was not the Ferrari that turned left at the intersection of Greenknowe and Macleay Streets. What do you say about that? 

A. No, that's not correct. 

Q. Ma'am, you told the Court that you first saw this black Ferrari when the police vehicle was heading towards Lincoln Hotel, on what street was that? 

A. Ward Avenue. 

Q. That was at a time when you were travelling in the opposite direction to the Ferrari. 

A. Yes. 

Q. So you did a U-turn and following the Ferrari for what distance? 

A. ... 

Q. So you're saying the distance travelled in following this Ferrari was over 2km? 

A. Yes, approximately."" 

27At no time was it suggested to either Detective Senior Constable Spice or Plain Clothes Constable Stuart that there was no black Ferrari on Ward Avenue or Greenknowe Avenue, nor was it directly suggested to either of them that there were two black Ferraris on Macleay Street in close proximity, one to the other, at the time that Mr Elskaf was stopped by police at Roslyn Street. 

28It is readily apparent from the cross-examination conducted by counsel for Mr Elskaf, that: 

(a)he did not challenge the evidence that there was a black Ferrari, which the police officer commenced to follow from Ward Avenue, and which turned left into Macleay Street from Greenknowe Avenue, rather he challenged the identification of the vehicle as being his client's; 

(b)he did not challenge the fact that his client's vehicle was on Macleay Street and had been directed into Roslyn Street. 

29The logical inference to be drawn from the absence of any challenge to the accuracy of the officers' evidence on these issues was that there were two black Ferraris on Macleay Street at the relevant time. One being that driven by Mr Elskaf, and the other being the vehicle followed by the police from Ward Avenue. It also necessarily followed that those two black Ferraris must have been in close proximity to each other whilst on Macleay Street. 

30The evidence of the two police officers, whom the prosecution was not permitted to call, would have been highly relevant to establish whether there was one, or more than one, black Ferrari motor vehicle on Macleay Street in the early hours of that morning. 

31However, at the end of Plain Clothes Constable Stuart's evidence, the following exchange occurred: 

""Prosecutor: Your Honour, I call Senior Constable Rossiter. 

Her Honour: No, you are not. I said to you I am not hearing from your further witnesses. 

Prosecutor: Your Honour, my friend has raised issues with the identity of the vehicle. He has put to my witnesses that this Ferrari is not the Ferrari that the first officers have seen. The first officer gave evidence that ... 

Her Honour: Well, how is this officer going to assist you? 

Prosecutor: Well, your Honour he can confirm that the evidence of Senior Constable Spice that he rang him and gave the information of the registration of the vehicle to Senior Constable Rossiter and Senior Constable Rossiter pulled that vehicle with the same registration over. 

Her Honour: I don't think there is any cause for you to call this officer at all. I indicated that to you initially and in fact, Mr Brewer, bless him, indicated that that officer's statement could go into evidence. I don't even see the need for it to come into evidence, but however - 

Prosecutor: Well, I seek to tender it on that basis your Honour. 

Her Honour: I can indicate to you immediately Sergeant that it won't assist you in the least. And I'll indicate to both..... 

Prosecutor: I beg your pardon your Honour ... 

Her Honour: I said I can indicate to you immediately that it will not assist you in the least. 

Prosecutor: Yes, your Honour. 

32Some features from this, and the earlier exchange, can be noted: 

(a)the prosecutor indicated that he proposed to put evidence from all four police witnesses before the Court, either orally, or else by statement; 

(b)the Magistrate did not permit the prosecutor to adduce some of that evidence (that is, two further police officers) at a time: 

(i)before the witnesses had been called to give evidence; 

(ii)before the statement of those witnesses had been tendered; and 

(iii)before reading the statements to ascertain the nature and content of the proposed evidence. 

(c)The Magistrate, having been briefly addressed on the relevance of the evidence, was aware: 

(i)that the prosecutor regarded the evidence as relevant in light, inter alia, of the issues which had been raised during cross-examination; and 

(ii)counsel for the defendant did not oppose the admission of the statement of Senior Constable Rossiter into evidence. 

(d)The Magistrate had already formed a view about her decision in the case, because she was able to say that the proposed evidence would not assist the prosecution even though: 

(i)the prosecutor had not closed his case; 

(ii)the prosecutor had not had any opportunity to make any submissions at all as to whether the charges had been proved, either on a prima facie case, or on the basis of final submissions; and 

(iii)counsel for the defendant had not given any indication whatever as to what course, either with respect to any application, or alternatively the calling of any evidence, he intended to follow. 

33The consequences of these features which I have noted will be considered later in this judgment. 

34It is convenient that I continue to set out the exchange which occurred: 

""Her Honour: In fact let me say very clearly I have serious difficulties - I have grave misgivings about the accuracy and reliability of the evidence given by these two police officers ... I have to tell you Sergeant on the evidence as I have heard it, I simply don't believe it. I'm actually not satisfied that a prima facie case has been established. It has to be believed. A lot of people think that if it contains any element of the offence, then the Court has to accept it. That's not the case. 

Prosecutor: Your Honour, the ... 

Her Honour: If the proposition is if the Court accepts the evidence then the rest flows. I don't accept the evidence because I have formed the opinion that your witnesses are unreliable. 

... 

Her Honour: Sergeant, I wish you to be very, very clear about this. If the Court forms the opinion that prosecution witnesses or witnesses for a plaintiff are unreliable witnesses, then the Court does not have to accept their evidence at all and it doesn't matter whether its going to - it won't form - it won't be enough to establish a prima facie case just for that reason. 

Prosecutor: Am I to understand that - 

Her Honour: The Court doesn't just accept any evidence that's given its way. 

Prosecutor: Is your Honour indicating that - 

Her Honour: It has to be reliable and it has to be accepted by the Court. I am saying to you that I find your witnesses are thoroughly unreliable. 

Prosecutor: So for the - 

Her Honour: And I am saying to you that I don't accept their evidence. It follows as night follows day that there is no prima facie case and the information is dismissed. 

Prosecutor: Your Honour is required to take the prosecution case at its highest prima facie, your Honour. 

Her Honour: Now that bit I do know. Your (sic) dead right about that Sergeant, but it has to be acceptable, reliable evidence in the first place which the Court does not find. Do you understand? 

Prosecutor: I do, as the Court pleases. 

Her Honour: The Court doesn't just accept a bag of lies and say that's enough to establish a prima facie case. In this case, that's exactly what I've received. 

Prosecutor: Your Honour, it's my submission that the Court can't find that the police officers lied. 

Her Honour: Sergeant, I don't want to have to really dot very ""i"" and cross ever ""t"" for your benefit and I didn't imagine this particular scenario. Your witness told the Court that these police officers followed this driver for more than two kilometres because they were concerned about his speed. Frankly, that is claptrap. It is simply not to be believed. 

... 

Her Honour: I sit in this Court every day. I'm telling you their evidence is inherently unreliable and if the Court does not accept their evidence as reliable evidence, then it doesn't matter whether the Court has to take the prosecution evidence at its highest or not. The Court does not have to believe what are patently incredible accounts and this is an incredible meaning; not credible, not to be believed, is that clear? 

Prosecutor: Yes your Honour. 

Her Honour: Fine. That's the point at which I say to you you have not established a prima facie case and the information is dismissed."" 

35Her Honour then went on to make an order for costs. 

36Some features of the exchange set out above can be noted: 

(a)the Magistrate expressed the view that she did not believe the evidence which she had heard because she had formed the view that the witnesses were ""unreliable"" or ""thoroughly unreliable""; 

(b)the Magistrate did not invite, let alone indicate, a willingness to receive, any submissions from the prosecution as to whether the evidence which had been given was sufficient to support the charge; 

(c)the Magistrate dealt with the prosecutor in a high-handed and most peremptory way and in a manner entirely inconsistent with allowing the prosecutor to make any submission which he wished to. He was treated rather like an errant school student; 

(d)it seems quite clear, that her Honour had formed a fixed view about the matter before hearing from the prosecution, and that she did not believe that it was her role to have to articulate any more fully than she did, the basis of, or reasons for, her opinion; and 

(e)she had taken a view about the reliability of the witnesses (or their lack of it) even though no such proposition had been put directly to the witnesses in cross-examination, much of their evidence was unchallenged either as to accuracy or truthfulness and there was, or else might reasonably have been expected to be, contemporaneous documents supporting their account, such as the traffic infringement notice, and notebook or other like records. 

(f)the Magistrate seemed to have no regard to the way in which the officers were cross-examined as indicating what case, if any, was being made on behalf of the defendant, and how that case reflected upon the existence of any challenge to the reliability of any part of the police officers' evidence. 

Order for Costs 

37After the information was dismissed, counsel for Mr Elskaf asked the Magistrate if she would entertain an application of costs. She said she would. 

38He reminded the Magistrate that his client, when pulled up, had denied committing any offence and then said: 

""Brewer: ...and your Honour, it's only - the offence is quite aged and its only in the last number of weeks that any statements have emerged from any of the police officers. 

Her Honour: That goes with what I have - my observations about their conduct of the matter. 

Brewer: And your Honour I note that the first witness today gave some evidence about making a registration check on the vehicle and of course that information is not contained with his statement and I note that the second corroborative - the alleged corroborative witness gave no evidence about the registration plate or registration check or any conversation to that effect and in my respectful submission your Honour this prosecution will have no absolutely prospect of being sustained and it's on that basis that I say we fall clear within the section that would allow your Honour to give cost figures to all of the Criminal Procedure Act, your Honour. 

Her Honour: I would suggest 214(1)(b) that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith and sergeant what's your response to this application? 

Prosecutor: I don't wish to be heard, your Honour. 

Her Honour: Application granted."" 

39Section 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides four possible bases for the making of an order for costs. The Magistrate herself identified s 214(1)(b) as the appropriate basis for an order although counsel for Mr Elskaf had not done so. However, she gave no reasons at all which justified the conclusion to which she came, or for the order for costs which she made. 

Proceedings in this Court 

40I recorded earlier in [13] the errors of law which the Director complains were made by the Magistrate. It is appropriate to deal with each of those grounds upon which the Director relies. 

Denial of Procedural Fairness 

41The first ground was that the Magistrate had denied the prosecution procedural fairness because she did not permit the prosecutor to call such witnesses as he wished. 

42The obligation of a judicial officer hearing a defended case is to hear it fairly and to judge it according to law, upon such evidence as either party to the proceedings might wish to adduce, and which is admitted. It is no part of a presiding judicial officer's function to take over the conduct of the case of one or other party and, in effect, summarily to prevent the calling by the prosecutor of any evidence where the prosecutor considered the evidence to be relevant to making out the charge: see Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald [2004] NSWSC 182 at [21] per Sully J. 

43Dawson J in Whitehorn v The Queen [1983] HCA 42; 152 CLR 657, said at 682: 

""A trial does not involve the pursuit of truth by any means. The adversary system is the means adopted and the judge's role in that system is to hold the balance between the contending parties without himself taking part in their disputations. It is not an inquisitorial role in which he seeks himself to remedy the deficiencies in the case on either side. ... It is no part of the function of the trial judge to ... [don] the mantle of prosecution or defence counsel. He is not equipped to do so, particularly in making a decision whether a witness should be called."" 

44It is clear that the Magistrate should have, but did not, permit the prosecution to call the witnesses who the prosecutor submitted were relevant. If the evidence of the witness was not relevant, then after the witness was called, it was a matter for the defendant's counsel to object to the evidence on the basis of a lack of relevance: s 56 Evidence Act 1995. Alternatively, if it was thought to be an appropriate course, the evidence could have been tested as to its relevance on a voir dire. Neither of these courses was adopted. Rather, the Magistrate peremptorily refused to permit the prosecutor to call one or more witnesses. 

45In that respect, her Honour's conduct of this matter fell short of the required standard of a trial judge acting properly and I conclude that there has been, as submitted by the prosecution, a denial of procedural fairness. 

Error of law ruling no prima facie case 

46The second ground which was relied upon was that the Magistrate's ruling that the prosecution had not established a prima facie case was erroneous. 

47The legal principles applicable by the Magistrate at the conclusion of the evidence called by the prosecution in a summary proceeding are well known, but is worthwhile restating them in a succinct way: 

(a)at the end of the prosecution evidence, it is open to a defendant to make a ""no case"" submission, which is determined by the Court as a matter of law: Cox v Salt (1994) 12 WAR 12 at 14; Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden [2001] NSWCA 32; 122 A Crim R 166 at [48]-[50] per Ipp AJA (Powell and Giles JJA agreeing); 

(b)the standard of proof to be applied in a no case submission is proof beyond a reasonable doubt: R v Murphy (1985) 4 NSWLR 42 at 69B; 

(c)the question to be determined is whether on the evidence, the defendant could be lawfully convicted of the offence charged: May v O'Sullivan [1955] HCA 38; 92 CLR 654 at 658; R v Serratore [1999] NSWCCA 377; (1999) 48 NSWLR 101 at [127] per Dunford J (Greg James J agreeing); 

(d)the determination of a no case submission is based upon all of the prosecution's evidence, if accepted, and 

(i)taken at its highest and strongest: DPP v Lee [2006] NSWSC 270 at [31]; Wunderwald at [28]; 

(ii)even if it is tenuous, inherently weak or vague: Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 at 214-5; 

(iii)unless the evidence is inherently incredible: Haw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor [1982] 1 AC 136 at 151; and 

(iv)unless the evidence is manifestly self-contradictory or the product of a disorderly mind: R v Bilick (1984) 36 SASR 321 at 337; Cox at 15; Marsden at [50]. 

(e)a no case submission should not be rejected even if the prosecution case is a weak one, because the finding that there is a prima facie case, calls upon the defendant to make answer to that case. There is no reason why a weakness in the prosecution case may not be eked out by something in the case for the defence: Zanetti v Hill [1962] HCA 62; 108 CLR 433 at 442-443 per Kitto J; Wunderwald at [26]; 

(f)a no case submission is to be kept distinct from any subsequent decision involving a question of fact, namely whether to accept the evidence of the prosecution witnesses or any of them, beyond a reasonable doubt. This distinction is no empty formality: DPP v Lee at [32]. 

48After proper consideration and determination of a no case submission, the hearing of any summary proceedings follows these steps: 

(a)if the determination is that there is no case to answer, then the proceedings must be dismissed; 

(b)if the determination is that there is a case to answer, then each of these steps may follow: 

(i)first, it may be open to the defendant to invite the presiding magistrate to give himself or herself, a ""Prasad"" direction: R v Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 161 at 163, and thereafter proceed in accordance with that authority: Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions v Acevedo [2009] NSWSC 653. However this is an approach which should be resorted to sparingly: Acevedo at [43]. In resorting to this approach, it is necessary that the magistrate give full and proper reasons: Acevedo at [43(d)]; 

(ii)second, the magistrate should invite a defendant to indicate whether he (or she) intends to call any witnesses to give evidence or else to tender any further evidence. This calls for a discrete decision and a process separate from the no case to answer stage; 

(iii)third, assuming that the defendant does not go into evidence or tender any evidentiary material then, assisted by appropriate submissions, the magistrate proceeds to a determination of the kind envisaged in May v O'Sullivan at 658, namely whether as a matter of fact, on the whole of the evidence before the Court, the magistrate is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the defendant. 

There is no necessary inconsistency between a court deciding that the defendant has a case to answer, and then proceeding to hold, in the absence of any further evidence, that the case for the prosecution does not warrant a conviction: May v O'Sullivan at 659; and 

(iv)fourth, assuming that the defendant does go into evidence, and once all the evidence (including evidence in reply from the prosecution, if any) is concluded and submissions have been taken, then the magistrate determines whether he (or she) has been satisfied having regard to all of the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt that a conviction ought follow. 

49Each of these steps, some of which are alternatives, are individual discrete steps which ought be attended to and not elided. That is what the dictates of procedural fairness assume. It is what the law demands. 

50The basis for the ruling that the prosecution has not established a prima facie case was expressed by the magistrate in one or other of the following ways: 

(a)""I have serious difficulties - I have grave misgivings about the accuracy and reliability of the evidence given by these two police officers ...""; 

(b)""I don't accept the evidence because I have formed the opinion that your witnesses are unreliable ...""; 

(c)""If the Court forms the opinion that prosecution witnesses ... are unreliable witnesses ... it won't be enough to establish a prima facie case just for that reason ...""; 

(d)""I am saying to you that I don't accept their evidence. It follows as night follows day that there is no prima facie case and the information is dismissed""; 

(e)""The Court doesn't just accept a bag of lies ... In this case, that's exactly what I've received""; 

(f)""Your witness told the Court ... Frankly, that is claptrap. It is simply not to be believed.""; 

(g)""I am telling you their evidence is inherently unreliable ... not credible, not to be believed. Is that clear?"". 

51Each of these remarks, which were made in the course of what seems to be an exchange between the Bench and the prosecutor, do not amount to fulfilling any of the procedural steps which I have described above, nor do they either individually, or considered together, demonstrate the application of the correct legal test for determining whether a prima facie case had been made out by the prosecution. 

52What has happened in my view, is that the Magistrate has entirely confused the differences between determining whether there was evidence which if accepted, and taken at its highest, could amount to proof of the offences charged, a question of law, with a different question, namely one of fact, that is, whether she did or did not judge the evidence which was given to be reliable and acceptable. As well, she has denied the prosecution procedural fairness. 

53The legal tests, at the prima facie case stage, refer to evidence being ""inherently incredible"" or ""self contradictory"". The phrases used by the Magistrate here deal with reliability of the evidence and its acceptability. These are questions of fact and not law. The phrases used are not the equivalent of the legal tests. 

54As well, the suggestion, initiated by the Magistrate, that the evidence of the police officers was "" a bag of lies "", in the absence of any cross-examination of the officers to suggest that they were lying, was a clear error of law, and a denial of procedural fairness: see Smith v NSW Bar Association [1992] HCA 36; 176 CLR 256 at [37] per Brennan, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ, at [9] per Deane J. 

55The Magistrate's determination to dismiss the proceedings is not one that followed a proper process, and it involved a manifest error of law. 

Inadequate Reasons 

56It is clear that the discussion, which I have earlier set out, was the totality of what the Magistrate said from which the reasons for dismissing the proceedings are to be drawn. 

57A magistrate is obliged as part of fulfilling their judicial function to give reasons which adequately explain their findings and the reasons for arriving at their findings: Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247; Director of Public Prosections (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 343; 67 NSWLR 402. 

58The mere statement that a witness' evidence was unreliable, without any analysis as to why that was so, or any analysis of, in this case, the nature and context of the challenge to the witness' evidence, is not sufficient to discharge a magistrate's judicial obligation to give reasons. 

59The exchange between the Magistrate and the prosecutor contains this statement by the Magistrate: 

""Sergeant, I don't want to have to really dot every 'i' and cross every 't' for your benefit..."" 

If this statement was intended to convey that there was no need for the Magistrate to give reasons for dismissing the proceedings, other than to say that the prosecution's evidence was not to be believed, then it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding about the obligation of a judicial officer to give reasons. 

60It is necessary for a judicial officer to explain why he or she has found the evidence of a witness to be unacceptable. The possible bases for such a finding would include (but are not limited to): 

(a)contradictory evidence of the same events or incidents from another witness; 

(b)contradictory evidence from contemporaneous documents; 

(c)inconsistencies or contradictions within a witness' own evidence; 

(d)the demeanour of a witness, including the manner of giving evidence; and 

(e)evidence of conduct or behaviour which is inconsistent with mandatory practices of police officers, or else those practices which are regularly followed by police officers. 

61A party who has called evidence from a witness, which is relevant and apparently probative, and whose evidence is not accepted is entitled to know of the basis of that non-acceptance, in order, at least, to be able to assess the prospect of a successful appeal. 

62Here the Magistrate provided no basis for disbelieving the police officers, and did not fulfil her obligations to give reasons. 

Conclusion 

63Each of the grounds of appeal has merit. Each has identified, for the reasons that I have described, that there has been an error of law. 

64The order of Magistrate O'Shane dismissing the proceedings must be set aside, and a new hearing must be ordered. 

65That a new hearing must be ordered is regrettable. It involves further judicial time and further costs and expense to the parties. Counsel for Mr Elskaf submitted that the further judicial time and additional expense could be minimised if the matter was returned to be heard by Magistrate O'Shane in accordance with the law in this judgment. 

66The Director opposed such a course. 

67I have decided that the appropriate order must be that the proceedings are to be remitted to the Local Court to be heard by another magistrate. 

68There are two principal reasons for this. 

69The first is that it is difficult to understand how the Magistrate has fallen into errors of the kind which I have found, since this judgment is not the first occasion upon which the proper procedure has been described, and the correct procedure pointed out to the Magistrate by this Court. 

70Her Honour has had the correct process drawn to her attention in a number of decisions of this Court, on appeal from her determinations in summary proceedings. These include: 

(a)DPP v Wunderwald [2004] NSWSC 182 (Sully J); 

(b)DPP v Lee [2006] NSWSC 270 (Howie J); 

(c)DPP (Cth) v Neamati [2007] NSWSC 746 (Howie J); 

(d)Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions v Acevedo [2009] NSWSC 653 (Davies J). 

71If I may say, with respect, the judgment of Sully J in Wunderwald sets out in a model of clarity, the Magistrate's obligations when considering whether a prima facie case had been established. His Honour's judgment was not followed in this case, but rather seems to have been entirely ignored. 

72In light of this history of decisions by this Court, and the failures identified in this case, I can have no confidence that Magistrate O'Shane would, if the matter was returned to her to complete, undertake the further hearing of it in accordance with the law. 

73The second is that having regarding to the strength of the views expressed by the Magistrate as to whether she believed the evidence of the two police officers, the Director would be entirely justified in asking that her Honour disqualify herself from any further hearing of the matter by reason of a reasonable apprehension of bias, and also of prejudgment. 

74Although judicial officers need to be cautious in recusing themselves from a hearing, should such an application be made to Magistrate O'Shane in this case, I have no doubt that her Honour would be obliged to grant it: see Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63; 205 CLR 337 at [6]; Livesey v New South Wales Bar Association [1983] HCA 17; 151 CLR 288; Michael Wilson & Partners Limited v Nicholls [2011] HCA 48 at [31-[33] per Gummow ACJ, Hayne, Crennan and Bell JJ. 

75In those circumstances, and for these reasons I have formed the view that the matter must be heard by a different magistrate. 

Relief 

76As I earlier pointed out, the Director brings these proceedings both under s 56 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act and also under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act . 

77Relief ought be granted with respect to the substantive decision of Magistrate O'Shane under s 59(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act . Orders will be formulated in accordance with that section. 

78However, as I have earlier pointed out at [12], s 59 makes no provision for relief to be granted if this Court is satisfied that there has been an error of law made with respect to the order for costs. 

79It seems to me that the correct procedure to be followed, when dealing with the requisite order for costs is, once an appeal is upheld under s 59 of the Crime (Appeal and Review) Act , to quash the order for costs pursuant to the powers of the Court as contained in s 69 of the Supreme Court Act . That is what will happen here. 

Orders 

80I make the following orders: 

(a)Appeal allowed. 

(b)The order made on 5 August 2011 dismissing the proceedings is set aside. 

(c)The order made on 5 August 2011 with respect to costs is quashed. 

(d)The proceedings are remitted to the Local Court to be dealt with by a magistrate, other than O'Shane LCM. 

(e)The first defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs. 

(f)The first defendant is to have a certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 if otherwise entitled.

		06 February 2012",2012-02-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758585,KG v R [2012] NSWCCA 10,"Judgment 

1BASTEN JA : The applicant is presently serving a sentence in a juvenile detention centre involving a non-parole period of two years and nine days. The sentence was imposed on 17 December 2010, but dates from the day of the applicant's arrest, namely, 16 June 2010. It will therefore expire on 24 June 2012; that is, in approximately four months time. 

2His balance of term is one year four months and six days. Sentences of such precise duration give a false impression of mathematical calculation; it would have been entirely appropriate to round down the odd days. 

3Why the matter has taken so long to come before this Court is not entirely clear on the papers available to the Court. However, the sentence was not imposed until 17 December 2010, at which stage the applicant was sentenced with one co-offender. The other two co-offenders were sentenced on 4 March 2011 by the same Judge, Colefax DCJ. 

4One of the grounds of the proposed appeal is the lack of proportionality between the applicant's sentence and that of his co-offenders. Nevertheless, the proceedings were not commenced until 21 September 2011. 

5The applicant was eight days past his seventeenth birthday at the time of the offence. Accordingly, there is a statutory prohibition on publication of his name: Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW), s 15A. The prohibition continues to apply, although the applicant is now over eighteen years of age. 

6The offence for which the applicant was charged was one of assault with intent to rob whilst in company, with wounding, contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The offence carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. It also carried a standard non-parole period of seven years imprisonment, although that did not apply to the applicant being a person under 18 years of age at the time of the offence and would not have applied in any event, as he was sentenced on a plea of guilty. 

7The offence was a serious children's indictable offence pursuant to s 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act . He was, accordingly, liable to be dealt with according to law: s 17. However, he was entitled to serve his sentence as a juvenile offender: s 19. 

Background to offence 
8The background to the offence was as follows. There were four young persons involved in the criminal conduct which led to the applicant being charged. Each of the others was over 18 years of age at the time of the offence, Emily Davis being 19 years and four months, Darren Atcheson being 24 years and eight months, and Matthew Johnson being 22 years and six months. In the late afternoon of 10 June 2010 Atcheson, Johnson and Davis drove to the victim's house, which was in Orange. Their purpose was to purchase cannabis. The car in question, which belonged to Atcheson, was driven by Davis as Atcheson was affected by alcohol. Atcheson made his purchase whilst Davis and Johnson remained in the car. Atcheson observed a quantity of amphetamines in the house and on returning to the car suggested that they should rob the victim of the amphetamines. Johnson contacted the applicant by telephone and he agreed to accompany them, although he was not at that stage told of the detail of the plan. When he was collected in the car he was informed of the detail of the proposal, including the fact that Atcheson would be armed with a gun. Atcheson loaded the gun in the car. Although his Honour made no finding in this respect, it appears that there was a discussion as to the purpose of loading the gun and the possibility of firing a warning shot. There was also acceptance by the applicant that the purpose of the robbery was to obtain the drugs for the purpose of resale. In fact it was Johnson who carried the gun and the applicant armed himself with a hunting knife, which he had found in Atcheson's car and which apparently also belonged to Atcheson. The trial judge accepted that the purpose in carrying the gun was to scare the victim. 

9Davis appears to have remained in the car whilst Johnson and the applicant entered by force. It appears that Atcheson, who was then known to the victim, also remained in the car. Johnson pointed the rifle directly at the victim and told him not to move and demanded money. The victim struggled with Johnson, grabbing the rifle by the barrel at which stage it appears that two shots were fired, one of which struck the victim, but, somewhat fortunately, caused a flesh wound only to the right side of his chest. 

10The victim then picked up two large knives of an ornamental kind, at which stage Johnson ran out through the front door. The victim closed the front door before turning and seeing the applicant standing in the lounge room armed with a hunting knife. He then chased the applicant until he too was able to escape through the front door. During the chase a further shot was fired from outside the house. The shot struck the top of the oven in the kitchen, being the room in which the victim's de facto partner had been immediately prior to the entry of Johnson and the applicant. 

11Quite properly, the trial Judge made an assessment of the seriousness of the offence, although in doing so he appeared to adapt the language of the provisions relevant to the standard non-parole period, describing the offence as ""slightly below the mid range of seriousness of offences of this kind"". He made the same assessment in respect of the offenders Johnson and Atcheson in the separate proceedings for their sentencing. It was, on one view, a lenient assessment in the circumstances given the fact that the offence took place in a residential home; it involved the use and discharge of a loaded firearm and the carrying of a hunting knife; when resistance was met the firearm was discharged on two occasions and on a third occasion to assist the escape of the applicant. 

12The trial judge described the plan as ""hastily put together"" and ""although each offender is equally culpable for the events which have occurred, it seems to be that the overall criminality of Ms Davis (because of her role of driver) and [the applicant] (because of his youth and particular vulnerability to peer group pressure) was somewhat less than the two older [offenders]"". Ms Davis obtained a discount of 35% because of her early plea and because of her assistance to the authorities. The applicant received a discount of 25% for his plea. His Honour expressly identified the starting point for his calculation as four years six months imprisonment in respect of both offenders. In relation to the co-offenders, Johnson and Atcheson, he adopted a starting point of five years. 

(1) Age of applicant 
13The first ground of appeal was that the sentencing Judge failed to have sufficient regard to the applicant's age. That complaint had two limbs. The first was that he failed to have regard to the principles stated in s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act : 

"" 6 Principles relating to exercise of functions under Act 

A person or body that has functions under this Act is to exercise those functions having regard to the following principles: 

... 

(b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance; 

... 

(d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home, 

... 

(f) that it is desirable that children who commit offences be assisted with their reintegration into the community so as to sustain family and community ties..."" 

14Even if the sentencing judge is persuaded that a sentence of imprisonment is required (a conclusion unchallenged in the present case) principle (d) no doubt requires that the minimum appropriate term be imposed; otherwise the principles have no immediate operational significance. 

15More importantly, it is clear that the sentencing Judge did take into account the age of the applicant, the fact that he had had learning problems at school, and was a quiet and withdrawn child. The sentencing Judge said that based on his evidence, ""[t]he word 'reticent' would be an understatement in describing him"": judgment on sentence, p 9. He was conscious of his demonstrated history of being easily led by others, which he took as diminishing his prospects of rehabilitation, although he found that his prospects were reasonable. He further noted that the applicant had responded well in custody and demonstrated ability as a capable student, and that he would have the support of his family upon release. 

16Although the trial judge did not refer to the principles set out in s 6, it is apparent that he took into account matters that were relevant having regard to the circumstances of the case. The failure to refer to s 6 expressly does not constitute error in the circumstances. 

17To the extent that there is a separate complaint with respect to the applicant's age, there can be no doubt, as the applicant conceded, that the trial judge was aware of his age. The suggestion that he did not take it into account in ways relevant to the sentence is fanciful. 

(2) Use of standard non-parole period 
18The second ground of appeal concerned the use by the sentencing judge of a standard non-parole period as a reference point. Since the judgment on sentence was delivered in this matter, the courts have had the benefit of the High Court's reasoning in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39. The sentencing judge expressly stated, correctly, that the standard non-parole period did not apply to the applicant. He continued, ""It is helpful nevertheless to make an assessment of the seriousness of the offence."" The latter statement is also correct and is required by the general law as reflected in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) ("" Sentencing Procedure Act ""). He then referred to where the offence fell by reference to ""the mid range of seriousness of offences of this kind"". That is not precisely the language of the Sentencing Procedure Act, s 54A(2), but it is clearly a similar test. As this Court explained in R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [19], the test does not provide unambiguous guidance to the sentencing judge. 

19Since Muldrock, it is clear that, even where the standard non-parole period is relevant, it cannot have ""determinative significance"" and it might be said, as in Muldrock itself, that it cannot have much weight at all in the circumstances of this case: see Muldrock at [32]. 

20Had the trial judge given any significant weight to the standard non-parole period, it may well be he would have erred. However, it does not appear that it had significant weight in the circumstances of the case. The standard non-parole period was seven years; the starting point for his calculation of the overall sentence was more than two years below the standard non-parole period; both the sentence and non-parole period imposed were so far below the standard non-parole period that it is not possible to infer that the standard non-parole period was given any significant weight in the exercise of sentencing. This ground is without substance. 

(3) Sentence manifestly excessive 
21Thirdly, it is said that the sentence was manifestly excessive. It is true that it was a lengthy sentence for a first offence by a young person. Nevertheless, it is necessary to bear in mind that the offence was a serious indictable offence for which he was dealt with according to law. Once it is accepted that his age was properly taken into account, this challenge must be rejected. 

22There was also reference to the fact that relatives of the victim had attempted to assault the applicant whilst in pre-sentence custody, as a result of which he was moved to a different place of detention. Although he was freed of the fear of attack, his transfer made it more difficult for his family to visit and therefore made his incarceration, it was said, more burdensome. 

23That factor was not referred to by the sentencing judge expressly, but it had limited weight in the circumstances of the case. According to the applicant's own evidence on sentencing, he was not aware of the imminent attack, which was thwarted by the prompt action of an officer of the juvenile justice centre, Orana. He made no complaint about the transfer, nor did he express the view that the circumstances of imprisonment were more burdensome in the centre at Emu Plains to which he was transferred. While the evidence of his mother, explaining the difficulties of visiting him at Emu Plains, indicated that he now received fewer visits from his family, the additional burden is not of the kind which would normally affect significantly the length of sentence for a serious indictable offence. This ground of challenge has not been made good. 

(4) Disparity 
24The fourth and arguably the most substantial ground of appeal relates to the question of alleged disparity. As the joint judgment in the High Court explained in Green v The Queen; Quin v The Queen [2011] HCA 49, ""equality before the law"" requires that those whose circumstances of offending are relevantly identical should receive the same sentence and those whose circumstances differ should receive sentences which are proportionately different: at [28] (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ). The majority held that the so called ""parity principle"" applies even where co-offenders have been charged with a different offence: at [30]. However, that was not this case, all four offenders being charged under s 98 of the Crimes Act . 

25As explained above, the co-offenders Atcheson and Johnson received somewhat longer sentences than the applicant, who in turn received a lengthier sentence than Davis. They were not all sentenced at the same time, but they were sentenced by the same judge. Further, he expressly adverted in sentencing Johnson and Atcheson on 4 March 2011 to the sentences he had imposed on the applicant and Ms Davis. 

26His Honour made a careful assessment of both the roles of each in the offending and of their individual circumstances. The argument for the applicant must be that, although there was disparity in the sentences, it was not sufficient to reflect the disparity between their ages and the roles they played in the offending. While it is possible that a greater level of disparity might have been considered, in my view the sentences provide no basis for a justifiable sense of grievance of any significance. 

Conclusion 
27For the reasons given, none of the specific challenges should be accepted. Nor has the applicant otherwise demonstrated that a lesser sentence is warranted at law. Because the applicant was under 18 years at the time of sentence, it is appropriate to grant leave to appeal. Nevertheless, in my view the appeal should be dismissed. 

28RS HULME J : In light of Basten JA's summary of the facts of the matter and of the remarks on sentence of Colefax DCJ, I need not go over those matters again. I find it necessary to only deal with one ground of appeal and that is the ground of parity. 

29I accept that the applicant in many respects conducted himself as an adult would. Furthermore, I accept that his criminality was not radically different from that of Atcheson and Johnson, albeit I would assess it at slightly less. Nevertheless, in my view, the difference of only six months between the starting points in the sentencing of Atcheson and Johnson of five years, and in the case of the applicant of four years and six months, was appellably insufficient when one has regard to the difference, indeed substantial difference, in the ages of Atcheson and Johnson, namely, about twenty-four and a half and twenty-two and a half respectively, and the age of the applicant, but one week over 17 years. 

30The matter becomes a fortiori when one has regard to the evidence, which his Honour seemed to accept, that the applicant at school had demonstrated a history of being easily led by others, that that circumstance continued after leaving school, and that the applicant had a particular vulnerability to peer group pressure. 

31His Honour erred in his starting point. The matter becomes even more apparent when one has regard to the fact that after the discounts for pleas are taken into account and the reduction to achieve the non-parole period is recognised, the difference between the non-parole periods of Atcheson and Johnson of two years and three months and on the applicant of two years and nine days is something under three months. 

32The sentence under appeal has led to the applicant's incarceration for the first time. It is a substantial sentence for a first offence. The applicant's youth and the other matters to which I have referred required that his Honour adopt a greater difference between those offenders. I also think that the difference between that used, viz, six months, and that which should have been used can only be described as substantial and, in those circumstances leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should be allowed, the sentence imposed on the applicant by Colefax DCJ quashed and the applicant should be re-sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 18 months with a balance of term of 12 months. 

33In arriving at such a sentence, I have regard to the fact that since the applicant was sentenced the evidence would suggest his prospects of rehabilitation are significantly higher than as assessed by Colefax DCJ. 

34If the view which I hold is that of a majority of the Court, it will be necessary to direct the applicant's release to parole but before any such course is embarked upon, both the Crown and counsel for the applicant should have an opportunity of considering whether any particular conditions of parole should be imposed. 

35SCHMIDT J : I agree with the observations of Hulme J. For the reasons his Honour has given, I have come also to the view that there are relevant differences between the co-offenders, differences which should have been proportionally reflected in the sentence imposed on this applicant which were not. 

36In the circumstances, I agree with his Honour as to the orders which should be made. 

37BASTEN JA: In accordance with the opinion of the majority, the Court makes the following orders: 

(1) Grant the applicant leave to appeal. 

(2) Allow the appeal and set aside the sentence imposed by Colefax DCJ on 17 December 2010. 

(3) Resentence the applicant - 

(a) to a non-parole period of 18 months to date from 16 June 2010 and expire on 15 December 2011; and 
(b) a balance of term of 12 months to date from 16 December 2011, expiring on 15 December 2012. 

(4) Direct the release of the applicant to parole forthwith. 

(5) Direct that the applicant's parole be subject to standard parole conditions, both general and in relation to supervised parole, a copy of which will be attached to the papers and provided to the applicant, and to the following additional conditions: 

(a) to report to the Office of Probation and Parole at Orange within seven days of his release and 
(b) comply with any reasonable directions given by the Probation and Parole Officer to attend counselling or to attend courses directed towards rehabilitation.

		13 February 2012",2012-02-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758590,R v Moore [2012] NSWCCA 3,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ: For the reasons given by Simpson J, I join in the order dismissing the Crown appeal in these proceedings. 

2SIMPSON J: Pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Director of Public Prosecutions (""the DPP"") appealed against the asserted manifest inadequacy of a sentence imposed on the respondent in the District Court at Wagga Wagga on 15 June 2011, following his plea of guilty to a charge, brought under s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900, of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice. That section provides a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. English DCJ sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for 18 months, commencing on 16 June 2011 and expiring on 15 December 2012, with a non-parole period of 6 months expiring on 15 December 2011. Her Honour did not make an order, under s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"") directing the release of the respondent at the expiration of the non-parole period. She did, as she was entitled to do pursuant to s 51 of the Sentencing Procedure Act , specify the conditions on which he will be released. 

3The offence was committed over a period commencing on 1 February 2011, and ending on 2 February 2011. 

4At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal on 8 December 2011, the Court made an order dismissing the appeal, but reserving reasons. These are my reasons for joining in that order. 

The facts 

5On 27 January 2011 the respondent was arrested and charged with driving whilst disqualified. That offence was committed on 25 January. Subsequently, he was charged with three additional offences of the same kind, two committed on 27 January and the last on 1 February. 

6On 28 January the respondent was released on conditional bail, ordered in the Local Court in Wagga Wagga. One of the conditions on which bail was granted required the respondent to report to the Officer in Charge of Police in Wagga Wagga, on a daily basis. 

7The matters were then listed in the Local Court for 2 February 2011 for mention. 

8The respondent wished to travel to Orange on the following weekend in order to take part in a course that would improve his employment prospects. He was not able to do that, without breach of the then current bail conditions. He accordingly sought a variation of bail, the variation being merely to allow him to report to the Officer in Charge of Police at Orange, rather than in Wagga Wagga. In support of his application, the applicant produced, through his legal representative, a letter purportedly written on behalf of his then employer, R M Watt Earthmoving Pty Limited. The letter was typewritten, and dated 1 February 2011. It contained a request for a change of the bail condition in order to allow the respondent ""to attend a vital training course in Orange, NSW."" It said that the course was important as it would enable the company and the respondent ""to move forward"". It added that no other employee had ""the skill base"" of the respondent. It contained a final paragraph complimenting the respondent on his conduct since he had recommenced medication, and described him as: 

""... a model employee ... more attentive and hardworking than ever ... an invaluable asset to my company."" 

It purported to have been signed by ""R Watts"". 

9The letter was a forgery. It had been typed on a computer by the respondent's son's girlfriend. The name of the employer (Robert Watt) was misspelled. By the time the letter was produced on 2 February, police were already aware, and had confirmed with the proprietors of the company, that neither had signed the document. The respondent withdrew the application for variation for bail. The respondent was arrested and charged on 17 February 2011. He has remained in custody since that date. 

10For this offence, English DCJ imposed the sentence I have set out above. 

11That sentence has to be seen in the context of the sentences imposed in respect of the four counts of driving whilst disqualified. They were dealt with in the Local Court on 12 April 2011. In respect of the offence of 25 January, the magistrate imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 16 February 2011, and expiring on 15 February 2012, with a non-parole period of 7 months expiring on 15 September 2011. In respect of the subsequent three counts, he/she imposed concurrent sentences of imprisonment for 15 months, commencing 15 September 2011 and expiring on 14 September 2012, with a non-parole period of 9 months, expiring on 14 June 2012. 

12The respondent appealed against those sentences. The appeal came on for hearing before English DCJ on the same day as the proceedings on sentence for the offence of perverting the course of justice. Her Honour dealt with the appeal first. She upheld the appeal and substituted the following sentences: 

Count 1: imprisonment for 12 months, commencing on 16 February 2011 and expiring on 15 February 2012, with a non-parole period of 6 months, expiring on 16 August 2012; 

Counts 2 and 3: imprisonment for 12 months, commencing on 16 February 2011 and expiring on 15 March 2012, with a non-parole period of 6 months, expiring on 15 September 2011; 

Count 4: imprisonment for 16 months, commencing on 16 April 2011 and expiring on 15 August 2012, with a non-parole period of 6 months, expiring on 15 December 2011. 

13The aggregate sentence thus imposed was of imprisonment for 18 months, commencing on 16 February 2011, and expiring on 15 August 2012, with a non-parole period of 10 months, expiring on 15 December 2011. 

14The non-parole period in respect of the present offence was therefore entirely subsumed within the non-parole period of the driving offences. The head sentence extended the previously-imposed sentence by 4 months. 



The respondent's personal circumstances 

15Evidence of the respondent's personal circumstances was put before the sentencing judge by way of a Pre-Sentence Report and documents provided by Justice Health. In addition, the respondent gave evidence. 

16The respondent was born in December 1970 and was 40 at the time he committed this offence. He has an extremely lengthy criminal history, encompassing three states and involving significant matters of dishonesty, as well as other offences. 

17The author of the Pre-Sentence Report said that the respondent had had a ""difficult"" childhood, having been adopted by a father who had significant alcohol issues and physically abused him. At about the age of seven he was diagnosed as suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder, but no treatment appears to have been provided to him. The author reported that the respondent had said that he had been diagnosed as suffering from bipolar disorder and of poor mental health. There does not appear to have been any confirmation of this diagnosis. The author also said that the respondent had been ""non-medication compliant"" at the time of the offences. He was said, at the time of the report (just before sentencing) to have been prescribed antidepressant medication. 

18The respondent had had employment, principally as a mechanic, but at the time of the offences was employed as a truck driver. 

19He has two older children from a defunct relationship, and two younger children from a current relationship, which has been in existence for about seven years and is, apparently, stable. The Justice Health document also reported that the respondent claimed to have been diagnosed as suffering bipolar disorder while in custody, but added that his medical records did not confirm that. However, the report later said he was receiving treatment by his general practitioner for that disorder. The author (a ""Clinical Nurse Consultant (Mental Health)"") reported the ""clinical impression"" that the respondent has some borderline and anti-social personality disorder traits. A letter from a general practitioner was tendered (the authenticity of which was accepted by the Crown) which recorded that the respondent was ""currently on epilim ... and avanza ... for mood disorder (bipolar affective disorder) and anger disorder. 

The respondent's evidence 

20The respondent gave evidence that he is, effectively, functionally illiterate and innumerate. That was why he had the forged letter written by an assistant. He gave evidence that, at age 18, when in custody, he had been raped. Although he reported the rape, no action was taken. He said that the rapist was currently in the same prison complex as that in which the respondent was being held. 

21He had experienced the death by overdose of a cellmate, an event by which he said he was affected painfully, and ""just not coping"". 

22Although he is not held in protection, he has some restriction of movement. This was because he had rendered some assistance to police in respect of other offences (not his own) in respect of which evidence he had received threats. 

23The respondent said that his youngest child had been born while he was incarcerated, and he had only seen her twice. 

The Remarks on Sentence 

24The sentencing judge recounted the facts of the offence in a manner that has not attracted criticism. She also recounted the evidence of the respondent's personal circumstances, making reference to the medication to which he is now subject. 

25With respect to the gravity of the offence, she said: 

""The offence for which he is facing sentence is a serious offence. It is an offence attracting a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment in recognition of the importance of protecting the integrity of our criminal justice system."" 

However, she found that the particular offence was one: 

""... falling towards the lower end of the scale constructed for like offences ... because it did not involve the threatening of a witness or the interference with a juror or judicial officer. It was an attempt by him to influence the outcome of a bail application in his favour, something which probably could have been done without the need to go to the lengths that he did. It was an act, however, which clearly involved premeditation and planning and worse still the involvement of an otherwise innocent person to produce the document for him. It is an offence warranting a penalty to reflect the need for general deterrence, not only to this offender, but to deter others who might be of a like mind."" 

26In the context of general deterrence, she considered the respondent to be: 

""... a somewhat inappropriate medium ... having regard to the bipolar affective disorder from he now suffers."" 

27She found that the respondent's time in custody would be ""more onerous"", but did not explain on what basis she made this finding. She considered that only a sentence of full time custody would satisfy the requirements of general and specific deterrence. 

28She considered that the respondent was remorseful and contrite, but nevertheless also considered his prospects of rehabilitation to be ""guarded"". This was in specific reference to his ""blatant disregard for court orders in the past"", particularly in respect of driving. (Given the respondent's history, the finding is hardly surprising.) 

29Her Honour found special circumstances, pursuant to s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act , warranting departure from the ratio there stated between the head sentence and the non-parole period. In accordance with the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383, in respect of the plea of guilty she allowed a reduction of 25% in the sentence which she otherwise would have imposed. 

30She held that there must necessarily be a partial accumulation of sentence upon the sentences imposed in respect of the driving offences. 

The grounds of the application 

31The grounds of the application were pleaded as follows: 

""Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in imposing a non-parole period for the Pervert the Course of Justice offence which is wholly concurrent with the sentences she imposed in relation to the Driving Whilst Disqualified offences. 

Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in failing to consider the principles of totality when determining the commencement date for the sentence imposed for the Pervert the Course of Justice offence. 

Ground 3: The sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate."" 

Grounds 1 and 2 

32When regard is had to the argument advanced on behalf of the DPP, it seems to me that these two grounds, at least, overlap. Indeed, it was accepted on the appeal that all grounds, in reality, are based upon the same single proposition. The DPP expressly disclaims any contention that a sentence of 18 months with a non-parole period of 6 months for this offence was in itself manifestly inadequate. The complaint is directed towards the total concurrence of the non-parole period in respect of this sentence, and the non-parole periods imposed in respect of the drive while disqualified offences. In those circumstances, the DPP argued, no real (additional) penalty was imposed in respect of a very serious offence. 

33That the offence of perverting the course of justice is serious cannot be doubted. So much is self-evident, if from nothing else, from the maximum penalty provided. 

34The need to protect the integrity of the criminal justice system is recognised. Courts are entitled to rely upon material provided to them by legal practitioners, who, in turn, are entitled to rely upon the bona fides of the material provided to them by their clients. 

35This offence was, however, at the lower end of the range of offences of its type. The purpose for which it was committed was to enable the respondent to acquire some additional vocational qualifications, presumably upon the understanding that he would, when the drive while disqualified offences were dealt with, be deprived of his driving licence for a very considerable time. The purpose was one which, in any event, (as her Honour observed) he may have been able to achieve legitimately. I do not suggest that that circumstance validates the method by which it was sought to be achieved. But when consideration is given to the other purposes for which an offence of this kind is sometimes committed - for example, unwarranted acquittal on a serious charge - this offence may be seen in its proper perspective on the scale of objective gravity. 

36I am, nevertheless, of the view that some additional penalty was called for. The offence was quite separate and distinct from the drive while disqualified offence. 

37I have concluded, however, that the argument of the DPP focuses too narrowly upon the non-parole period. In fact, the head sentence does contain within it some accumulation, of 4 months. That cannot be overlooked. 

38Because of the length of the sentences imposed, the respondent will be entitled to release at the expiration of the non-parole period: Sentencing Procedure Act, s 50. However, should he fail to comply with the strict conditions of parole specified, he will return to prison, and serve the balance of the term of the sentence, or such part thereof as the Parole Board may determine. That, in my opinion, is a significant factor in itself. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that a period of parole is in itself a sentence. It is wrong to say that the respondent was sentenced to no additional penalty in respect of the pervert the course of justice offence. 

39I accept that the sentencing judge may have imposed a sentence in which a part of the non-parole period was exclusively referrable to the pervert the course of justice offence. However, in the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that no other course was open to her. 

40I should make brief reference to the second ground of appeal, in which the issue of totality is raised. I am not satisfied that totality required any additional penalty to that which was imposed. The respondent is serving a term of imprisonment made up of a head sentence of 1 year and 10 months, with a non-parole period of 10 months. That is a significant term of imprisonment. 

41For these reasons I joined in the order dismissing the Crown appeal. 

42ADAMSON J: I agree with Simpson J.

2758592,R v Mathew John RIDGEWAY (No 2) [2012] NSWDC 54,"SENTENCE CORRECTION


1Instead of the sentence which I imposed on Mr Ridgeway on 1 February 2012 I impose the following sentences.

2For the aggravated robbery being robbery in company I sentence you to a sentence of 5 years and 6 months to date from 17 January 2011 and to expire on 16 July 2016. For that sentence I fix a non-parole period of 4 years which commenced on 17 January 2011 and which will expire on 16 January 2015. The balance of the term for that sentence is 1 year and 6 months commencing 17 January 2015 and expiring on 16 July 2016. 

3For the offence of kidnapping I sentence you to 6 ½ years imprisonment. That will date from 17 January 2012 and will ultimately expire on 16 July 2018. I fix a non-parole period for that sentence of 3 years and 10 months. That commenced on 17 January 2012 and it will expire on 16 November 2015. The balance of the term for that sentence is 2 years and 8 months which commences on 17 November 2015 and will expire on 16 July 2018.

4The overall effective sentence is 7 years and 6 months commencing 17 January 2011 and expiring on 16 July 2018. The overall effective non-parole period will be 4 years and 10 months commencing 17 January 2011 and expiring on 16 November 2015. The earliest date on which it seems that you will be eligible for release is 16 November 2015 depending upon the Parole Authority.

5In sentencing you in respect of the kidnapping I have taken into account the offence of stealing the motor car which is on the form under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Otherwise the orders I made in respect of the certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 stand as they are as is the order for an audiovisual link for 29 February 2012. 

6Now, Mr Ridgeway, your overall sentence is the same. It is still 7 years and 6 months from 17 January 2011 and it still expires on 16 July 2018, but your effective non-parole period has been reduced I think by 1 year and 5 months. You will be due for release on 16 November 2015 and not, as I said earlier, 16 April 2017. So you will be due for release 1 year and 5 months earlier. The first date on which you are eligible for release is 16 November 2015.

7Normally for a sentence of 7 years and 6 months you would be serving a longer effective non-parole period. You would normally served 75 per cent of that time, but I have reduced it to about just over 64 per cent of that time because of the fact that you are segregated in custody and the circumstances in which you are serving custody. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yeah, the majority of it.

HIS HONOUR: All right, so 16 November 2015 is the important date to remember. I apologise for this, for bringing you back. It is a salutary lesson for us lawyers.

OFFENDER: Does that mean I sit for parole when--

HIS HONOUR: I assume it would have been picked up either in the ALS or the ODPP, but somebody in the office at the court office drew my associate's attention to the issue of whether or not it was an aggregate sentence and that in turn meant that I looked at it closely and realised that there was at least one error and then when I heard from Mr Bickford and Ms Gomez this morning it emerged that there was also an error concerning the non-parole period which we have now fixed up. Now, is there anything else, Mr Bickford or Ms Gomez?

BICKFORD: No, your Honour.

GOMEZ: No, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right, thank you both for your assistance.

		03 May 2012",2012-02-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758609,R v Page [2012] NSWDC 307,"Judgment
1This is a robbery case.  The prosecution will allege that the accused, Harley Page, robbed Jordan Smith.  The prosecution wants to tender some evidence of the accused being involved in something else a short time before the alleged robbery.  The defence objects to the tender of that evidence arguing that it is propensity evidence.  
2Mr GW Coles, who is appearing as prosecutor in this case, will allege that Harley Page robbed Jordan Smith on 20 January 2011.  The prosecution case is that Harley Page engaged in threatening behaviour towards Jordan Smith.
3The alleged robbery occurred near, but not at, a service station.  Mr Coles wants to call a witness, John Rei, who was getting petrol at the service station.  He witnessed two young men who appeared to be drunk ""yelling and swearing at a young male who was on a bike"".  The cyclist rode off and one of the young men threw a bottle at the cyclist and both started to chase him.  Mr Rei then went in to pay for his petrol and as he was coming out a young girl came running towards him asking for help because her boyfriend, she said, had just been beaten up.  Mr Coles will claim that Mr Harley Page was responsible for the beating up of the young girl's boyfriend and stealing property from him.  
4Mr S Corish, of counsel, who appears for Harley Page, objects to the tender of the evidence from Mr Rei about what happened with the cyclist whom the two young men chased away.  Mr Coles relies on the principle of admissibility referred to by the High Court in O'Leary v The King [1946] HCA 44; 73 CLR 566.  He also referred me to decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal of this State in R v Adam [1999] NSWCCA 189; 106 A Crim R 510 and R v Player [2000] NSWCCA 123; 217 ALR 578.  
5In Adam at [30] the Court - comprising Spigelman CJ, James and Bell JJ - distinguished between disposition or propensity or inclination evidence of behaviour ""in the past"" on the one hand and, on the other hand, evidence of behaviour ""as being part of the same connected series of events or evidence of conduct by an accused person evincing a particular state of mind at a time so proximate"" to the time of the alleged offence ""as to permit an inference that the same state of mind continued up to the time of the offence"".  
6Smart AJ in Player - with whom Priestley JA and Foster AJA agreed - at [11] - [13] pointed to the relevance of evidence in that case as being evidence of an accused's state of mind or evidence of a transaction.  Mr Norrish poses the rhetorical question.  
CORISH:  Corish your Honour.HIS HONOUR:  What did I say?CORISH:  Mr Norrish is a judge.HIS HONOUR:  Yes you are right.  
7Mr Corish asked rhetorically how one decides if the events are part of a connected series of events which he says begs the question.  He argued that the two events are, in fact, entirely separate.  I do not need to find, at this stage, whether the events are part of a single transaction.  I am satisfied that the evidence of the behaviour towards the cyclist was evidence of conduct by the accused evincing a particular state of mind, namely aggressiveness and threatening behaviour.  
8One of the elements of the charge of robbery, which Mr Harley Page faces, is threatening behaviour or putting fear into the alleged victim.  It is clear that the events are reasonably close in time because all that occurred between Mr Rei seeing the cyclist being chased and being approached by the robbery victim's girlfriend, was that he went to pay for his petrol.  
9The evidence, in my opinion, is relevant to the state of mind of the accused and is therefore admissible.
CORISH:  Your Honour pleases.HIS HONOUR:  All right I--CORISH:  Your Honour didn't refer to it but I'm sure it was uppermost in your Honour's mind.  It wasn't just the facts before the two alleged robberies or the robbery then the assault and robbery was also the second incident--HIS HONOUR:  No I didn't know you objected to that I thought it was just paragraph--CORISH:  That's were I started my - that was where I started my objection your Honour in relation--HIS HONOUR:  I thought it was just paragraphs 4 and 5.CORISH:  I started off objecting to what happened afterwards, that is the interaction where Mr Rei arms himself with a pole, that's the second time at the service station.HIS HONOUR:  And you're objecting to that evidence on the same grounds?CORISH:  On the same grounds.HIS HONOUR:  Yes.CORISH:  And I'm sure your Honour will rule the same way.HIS HONOUR:  I'm sure as well but I should give reasons.CORISH:  Your Honour, if your Honour pleases.HIS HONOUR:  All right.CORISH:  And I would also add, and this was in my submissions when I referred to the unfair prejudice of the evidence, that's also invoking a discretion, in my submission, under 137--HIS HONOUR:  Thank you.CORISH:  --and also to the extent that it incorporates a similar discretion under 135, but 137 is specific to criminal procedure.HIS HONOUR:  Yes, yes, yes, thank you.  
10Mr Corish has indicated that he has always maintained that he objects to evidence of what happened after the young woman approached Mr Rei at the service station, as well as the evidence that I have just ruled on.  When the young girl ran up complaining that ""these two men behind me have just beaten up my boyfriend"", Mr Rei says that the two young men who were following her were the same whom he had seen before.  
11What followed then was that one of the men started throwing rocks at Mr Rei, who became fearful for his own safety, as well as the safety of the girl whom he had sent into the service station office.  He picked up a steel jack handle and frightened them away.  To my mind the evidence of the two young men, or of him seeing the two young men who were chasing the girl, is clearly admissible because I understand that evidence will show that the girl was the girlfriend of the alleged victim.  
12To my mind, evidence of the behaviour of one of the men, in the company of the other, which resulted in, as Mr Rei said, feeling that he ""was in fear for my safety"" is also relevant to the state of mind of that man and would be relevant to the state of mind of the other man who was with him at the time, which is, in turn, relevant to the question of whether or not behaviour consistent with a robbery with threatening behaviour occurred.  
13Mr Corish also argues that I should refuse to admit the evidence because its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  That objection is made under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).  The probative value, in my opinion, is high.  Mr Corish tells me that his client was nearby when the events which were said to encompass a robbery occurred but was not a participant.  To my mind evidence from Mr Rei of behaviour before and after which suggests an aggressive state of mind is of high probative value, particularly given the issue which Mr Corish outlines.  
14To my mind there is not a danger that there would be any unfair prejudice to the accused.  The evidence is obviously prejudicial in the sense that it tends to prove that he had an aggressive state of mind, but it is not unfairly so.  It is evidence of events which are closely connected both in time and place.  Its relevance is limited, at this stage, to the state of mind of the accused.  Given that its relevance is limited in that respect, I do not regard any prejudice - which may be argued to be unfair - as outweighing its high probative value.  I would not refuse to admit the evidence under s 137 of the Evidence Act.  
15For the same reasons I do not regard the probative value of the evidence as substantially outweighed by any danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial to the accused or misleading or confusing or result in an undue waist of time.  Accordingly, I would not exercise my discretion under s 135 of the Evidence Act.  
16For those reasons I will, in due course, admit the evidence.

2758610,R v Shane Gregory BLACKWELL [2012] NSWDC 179,"SENTENCE


1Mr Blackwell I am going to sentence you now. You probably know - because you have been sentenced before - that what I do is talk about your case for about 15 or 20 minutes. I usually underestimate that time. At the end I pronounce the sentence but you already know what the sentence is, so that I am giving my reasons.

2I am sentencing a young man who is not yet 30 who got himself into a drunken brawl in a hotel in the early hours of one morning and punched another man. At the time the young man I am sentencing had a glass in his hand. The result of the punch was that the other man's eye was so seriously lacerated that it had to be surgically removed. 

3The young man I am sentencing is named Shane Gregory Blackwell. He has pleaded guilty to the crime that he committed which is recklessly causing grievous bodily harm. That is made a crime by s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and Parliament has fixed a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment to that crime. Not only that, Parliament regards the crime as so serious that it has fixed a standard non-parole period of 4 years imprisonment to the crime.

4It is important when a judge is sentencing a person to set out briefly what happened in the case. I did that when, after a trial without a jury, I found Mr Blackwell not guilty of the more serious crime of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. That decision I delivered on 8 November 2011 and it is reported at R v Blackwell [2011] NSWDC 171. 

5Very briefly, what happened is that the victim Daniel Ward and his colleagues had finished work and were farewelling a workmate. (I am taking this summary from my earlier judgment.) It was Friday evening 12 October 2007. They were all police officers. Some of them kicked on to Scruffy Murphy's a hotel on the corner of Goulburn and George Streets in Sydney. It was by then late and getting on for well after midnight. 

6The offender Shane Blackwell was also at Scruffy Murphy's. He was alone and drunk. There was a dance floor and Daniel Ward and his female colleagues were dancing. Shane Blackwell started to make a real nuisance of himself. He persisted in trying to dance with one or two of the female police officers, even touching them inappropriately. He was told in clear terms that his presence was unwelcome. 

7Shane Blackwell was confronted by Daniel Ward and a couple of his colleagues. Mr Blackwell's response was to hit Daniel Ward in the face. At the time Mr Blackwell had a glass in his hand. The blow severely injured Daniel Ward - so badly, as I said, that one of his eyes had to be surgically removed. 

8Mr Blackwell was immediately arrested and charged with the crime of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent.

9After a trial without a jury I acquitted him of that crime. Mr Blackwell had indicated earlier the fact that he was prepared to plead guilty to the crime I am now sentencing him for. 

10In fact there had been an earlier trial where Mr Blackwell was charged with the more serious offence. He was found guilty by a jury of that more serious offence and her Honour Judge Hock sentenced Mr Blackwell to 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years. Mr Blackwell's appeal was successful and the new trial was before me. As a result of the sentence of Judge Hock, Mr Blackwell spent nearly 2½ years in prison. That means that in due course when I sentence Mr Blackwell I will backdate the sentence by the amount of time that he has spent in custody. By my calculations the sentence will date from 3 August 2009. That takes into account the agreed period of 2 years, 5 months and 28 days up until 3 February 2012 when I heard submissions on Mr Blackwell's sentence and at that stage bail was not applied and refused. He has continued to be bail refused until today.

11In this case a victim impact statement was provided by Daniel Ward. Needless to say the loss of an eye for anyone, including a serving police officer, will have a traumatic and long-term effect. Mr Ward says that he will never forget the night that the crime was committed. He has undergone surgery and will require surgery in the future. His face is numb and there is still swelling where the glass fragments entered his face. His tear duct in his left eye was so severely damaged that it could not be repaired. His left eye is now either constantly wet or very dry. The left eyelid still droops and he expects it will be like that for the rest of his life. Certain avenues which were available to him for advancement within the police force are no longer available. He can no longer pursue being an operational officer in the riot squad and tactical operations. He can no longer drive a police car on urgent or emergency duties. As he says, he in no longer ""able to fulfil my duties as a New South Wales police officer to my full potential as I could"" before this happened.

12He has also suffered what he describes as ""extensive psychological damage"". He sees the effects of this crime every time he looks in a mirror. He needs to explain to strangers whom he meets his appearance or what happened. His confidence is affected, both in social groups and in speaking with women. He is on edge when he is out at licensed premises enjoying a drink. He feels a lack of confidence at work because of his impression that his workmates might be wondering whether he is up to various tasks or not. He had to sell his motorcycle which he enjoyed riding. He can no longer play football or most sports that involve a ball. He has difficulty catching. He has found himself, as he described, ""psychologically as low as I could ever go"".

13He summarised the impact which it has had on him personally by saying that his ""life has been destroyed, I have lost not only the sight of one eye and suffered permanent disfigurement of my face, but also my career opportunities, and social confidence."" That is, I repeat, a description by the victim of this crime of his perception of how the crime as affected him. It is obviously not only objectively a very serious injury for anyone to sustain but, so far as the personal impact which it has had on that person is concerned, it is very significant.

14It is also important for a judge to refer to matters which are personal to an offender when sentencing someone. It is obvious that it is important for a sentence to take into account not only how serious a particular crime is but also details about the person who committed the crime. 

15Mr Blackwell has no criminal offences in New South Wales. In Tasmania, where he comes from, he has a couple of offences for disorderly conduct which were committed some 10 or more years ago and dealt with in the Magistrates' court in that State. There is a matter in Queensland but there was no conviction recorded and I do not take that into account and a number of matters in Western Australia, which are described as 'spent convictions' so that I do not take them into account either. It means that I am sentencing a young man who has had very few, in fact only a couple, of previous convictions but significantly - but without too much significance - both of those convictions were for disorderly conduct.

16In this case also there is a very helpful presentence report prepared about Mr Blackwell by the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service. The report gives a good deal of background and its summarising paragraph is as follows - 

""Presenting as a quiet and cooperative period [sic], Mr Blackwell appears to have had the benefit of a caring and stable upbringing, raised by parents who remain emotionally supportive of him. Although he is currently a resident of Tasmania, he has mainly worked interstate or overseas as a commercial diver, with inquiries indicating he has a strong work ethic and is highly skilled and respected in the work place. At the age of 23, Mr Blackwell was involved in a motorcycle crash which took the life of a close friend. That event appears to have resulted in his having some mental health issues, which may still need to be addressed. Although Mr Blackwell acknowledged that on the night of the offence he had consumed a significant amount of alcohol, those interviewed regarded that behaviour as being 'out of character'. Mr Blackwell, whilst accepting culpability, commented similarly. The continued emotional support of his family, as well as that of his girlfriend, is a positive element in his life."" 

The report recommended that he should continue to engage with a psychologist whom he is seeing in Launceston.

17Mr P A Dunn QC, who appeared for Mr Blackwell in the trial and in the sentence proceedings, tendered as exhibit S1 a large bundle of material which was relied upon by him in his submissions on sentence. It included material expressing opinions from psychiatrists and psychologists. The experienced forensic psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen, diagnosed in a report dated 1 February 2012 an alcohol abuse disorder and a depressive illness. Dr Nielssen was of the opinion that both of those were in remission. The alcohol abuse disorder diagnosis was made, as Dr Nielssen said, ""on the basis of the history of a pattern of very hazardous drinking, especially around the time of this offence."" Dr Nielssen thought that other evidence suggests ""that the episode of severe depression that followed the accident and death of this friend was associated with the change in the pattern of Mr Blackwell's drinking in a way that suggests he was drinking in response to symptoms of his psychiatric disorder at that time.""

18A psychologist who provided a report as well on Mr Blackwell, Tony Oleck, also diagnosed depression which was related to the accident involving the death of his friend. That had occurred in 2005. Mr Tony Oleck expressed the view that Mr Blackwell's ""willingness to engage in therapy and to seek help for himself, indications that he was starting to make gains in therapy, his shock and feeling appalled at the possibility of committing such a crime, as well as his empathy for the victim are good indicators of a reduced risk of committing such a crime in the future.""

19A document from the Australian Navy, in which Mr Blackwell served for some years earlier this century, indicated that he had presented with depression on 9 November 2005, which is consistent with the history of being in the bike accident with his friend earlier that year.

20Mr Blackwell has been seeing, as I said, a clinical psychologist in Launceston. That is a Mr Gary Bakker who provided a report dated 31 January 2012. With Mr Blackwell he has been working on problems which Mr Bakker described as an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood and the remmed [sic] symptoms of a post traumatic stress disorder which Mr Bakker said was diagnosed after the bike accident in 2005. Mr Bakker thought that Mr Blackwell's remorse appeared to be genuine. 

21His GP in Scottsdale, in Tasmania, a Dr McGinity confirmed that he had been attending a psychologist and noted that he himself, Dr McGinity, has been overseeing Mr Blackwell's rehabilitation. 

22There are a number of references, including from Mr Blackwell's mother and other people. They include the parents of the young friend who was killed in the bicycle accident in 2005. They described how he was affected by that accident and describe his strong work ethic. He obviously comes from a strong and supportive family background and community.

23I have been provided, as well, with material including some statistics from the database kept by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales and some authorities, including Butters v R [2010] NSWCCA 1. The statistics indicate that a person pleading guilty to this offence with prior convictions of a different type would be sent to gaol - at least 81 per cent were sent to gaol. Of the 17 cases that received gaol penalties 65 per cent of those received an overall sentence of 3 years or less. Seventy-five per cent of those received a non-parole period of 2 years or less. 

24I was assisted by the case of Butters which was an appeal by an offender to the Court of Criminal Appeal against a conviction for the same crime. In that case too the offender had been very drunk and had hit a person with a glass in his hand and the consequence of the impact was that the victim's eye had to be surgically removed. The sentencing judge, after taking into account a discount of 25 per cent for a plea of guilty, had imposed a sentence of 4½ years with a non-parole period of 3 years. Fullerton J - with whom McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum J agreed - found that that sentence was not manifestly excessive in the circumstances. The learned sentencing judge had found that the offence lay somewhere above the mid range of objective seriousness and that finding was affected by a finding made by his Honour that the offence in that case involved the actual use of a weapon. As Fullerton J pointed out, the provision of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides that an offence is aggravated where it involves the actual use of a weapon - namely s 21A(2)(c) - has been interpreted ""as requiring knowledge on the part of the offender using the glass that he had a glass when he intentionally struck the victim"". (See [25] of her Honour's judgment.)

25I myself do not make the same direct finding. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt for the reasons given in my judgment in the trial that Mr Blackwell knew that he had a glass in his hand when he was punching the victim. Also it was not specifically agitated in the submissions.

26I have been assisted by submissions made by Mr Dunn QC and by Mr L L Lungo the Crown Prosecutor who appeared in the trial and in the sentence proceedings. I have taken into account Mr Blackwell's personal background and circumstances which I have referred to but which are also set out in the written submissions which I marked for identification 1 which were made available by Mr Dunn. I accept that there has been a plea of guilty in this case. Mr Dunn QC argued the discount that one allows for a plea of guilty should be in the order of 20 per cent or more. Mr Lungo, on the other hand, argued that the plea could have been offered much earlier and that the discount should be more in the order of 10 per cent. I have determined that an appropriate discount is one of 13 per cent for Mr Blackwell's plea of guilty.

27The offence was obviously not planned or organised. It was a spontaneous gesture by a drunken man at an hotel. I am a little reluctant to find specifically that Mr Blackwell is a person of good character. I think that follows from the two convictions for disorderly conduct. He is obviously a highly regarded young man and has a lot of potential. He works very hard. I do accept, however, that he has no significant criminal history. 

28His prospects of rehabilitation, I accept, are good, if not very good. I think he is unlikely to re-offend. I make those two findings because of the evidence of a psychological and psychiatric nature, as well as the presentence report. He expressed remorse and contrition in the witness box when he gave evidence in the trial. And it is clear from the psychiatric and psychological material that that is so.

29Mr Dunn argued that there are special circumstances for adjusting the normal relationship between a non-parole period and a full sentence, which is normally 75 per cent. He said that the steps towards rehabilitation which will be needed on release, as well as the fact that Mr Blackwell's family are interstate so that he is not easily able to be visited are factors to take into account. Mr Lungo does not dispute that submission and in due course I will reduce the normal ratio of 75 per cent.

30Mr Dunn QC argued that I could reduce the sentence somewhat because of the fact that Mr Blackwell had a mental health condition at the time, namely the depression and perhaps post traumatic stress disorder. He drew my attention to the authorities which indicate that a sentence should take into account that mental health condition in various ways. I do not place very much weight on that evidence. At least on that submission, I agree that a condition has been diagnosed but it is also apparent that Mr Blackwell was medicating himself, so to speak, by alcohol in dealing with that condition. I do not regard it as appropriate to allow a significant discount - rather to make a significant allowance - for a mental health condition where a person has had it drawn to his attention and has elected to deal with it by drinking and then commits a very serious crime. I will make some allowance but it is quite different from a condition such as schizophrenia or some other form of psychosis which has been diagnosed and under which an offender is suffering when the offender commits the offence. The authorities clearly indicate that such a distinctive case is not one that carries a lot of weight so far as general deterrence is concerned. On the other hand a person who decides to drink a lot of alcohol and then to behave in the way that Mr Blackwell has in a public hotel is something that should be deterred.

31I do not propose to impose the standard non-parole period. The main reason for that is the plea of guilty but also his likelihood of not re-offending and his good prospects of rehabilitation.

32I referred earlier to the statistics produced by the Judicial Commission. I frankly would regard the sentence range which is indicated by those statistics as being relatively low for this kind of crime, or I should say for a crime such as the one that Mr Blackwell committed. The maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment for this crime and I regard this as a serious example of this sort of crime, where the grievous bodily harm is grave and has had obviously a significant impact on the victim and his life. Without the features such as Mr Blackwell's remorse and his prospects for rehabilitation and the unlikelihood of him offending again and the fact that he has very few prior convictions, I would have thought that a sentence of 6 years imprisonment would be appropriate. But after those considerations I would regard a sentence as 5 years as being the appropriate one to impose in this case. I will reduce that figure by 13 per cent to reflect Mr Blackwell's plea of guilty. 

33Accordingly the sentence which I propose to impose will be 52 months, that is 4 years and 4 months. I propose to reduce the non-parole period, as I said. Seventy-five per cent of 4 years and 4 months would produce a sentence of 3 years and 3 months. I propose to apply a ratio of 66 per cent. That is about 2/3, which happens to be the same ratio which her Honour Judge Hock applied in the first sentence. A ratio of 66 per cent produces a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months which is the non-parole period which I propose to impose.

HIS HONOUR: I am going to sentence you now Mr Blackwell. 

34I set a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months which commenced on 3 August 2009 and will expire on 2 April 2012. The balance of the term is 1 year and 8 months. It will commence on 3 April 2012 and expire on 2 December 2013. Your overall sentence is 4 years and 4 months commencing 3 August 2009 expiring on 2 December 2013. The first date that it appears to me you will be eligible for release is 2 April 2012.

HIS HONOUR: Have a seat Mr Blackwell. Now two questions Mr Outram and Mr Hunter. One is whether there are any factual or legal errors. Factual errors that could be dealt with simply by me referring to them or which may require the re-opening of proceedings under s 43 and the second thing of course is the mathematics.

OUTRAM: No and no from my point of view.

HIS HONOUR: Thanks Mr Outram.

HUDSON: No your Honour there's no--

HIS HONOUR: All right. 

35Mr Blackwell your sentence is 4 years and 4 months, as I have said. I backdated it to 3 August 2009, that takes into account the nearly 2½ years which you have already served. Your non-parole period is 2 years and 8 months, that will expire on 2 April 2012 in about a month and a half's time. And at that point you will be eligible for release. I cannot order your release because it is a sentence of more than 3 years. So it is up to the Parole Authority to decide whether you are released or not. Mr Hunter will advise you about making sure your paperwork is in for them. The balance of the term is 1 year and 8 months so that when you are released, which hopefully will be 2 April 2012, you are still under the sentence for a year and 8 months and you are on parole and, as you know, you have got to behave yourself. There will be conditions of that parole, which the Parole Authority will set and if you breach your parole you are back before me.

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Hunter--

HUDSON: Hudson your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Hudson, I am sorry, Mr Hudson I would normally, and I am not sure about this case, send with an offender into custody any psychological or psychiatric material.

HUDSON: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I am not sure whether it is needed in this case because your client had already been sentenced and he has only got a month and a half, subject to the Parole Authority, but I will if you would like me to, because he - I guess he has to be classified again.

HUDSON: Yes your Honour I think I will for abundant caution seek that course, particularly the pre-sentence report which says the main supervision would be by virtue of New South Wales to Tasmania would be by virtue of the psychologist supervision within Tasmania.

HIS HONOUR: Good, I will do that. I will make sure - I imagine they will have the presentence report but I will make a point of sending that and I will send the main psychiatric and psychological material. My associate sends it to the office in the Corrective Services which deals with classifying prisoners. Or alternatively about how long will he be here today, when does the truck go?

CORRECTIVES OFFICER: About 4 o'clock.

HIS HONOUR: Yes look we might be able to send it along with him, if that possible. Yes okay. All right Mr Blackwell, stay out of trouble and good luck. I will now adjourn.

OFFENDER: Thank you.

2758621,McGoldrick v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 7,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ : I agree with Adamson J. 

2SIMPSON J : I agree with Adamson J. 

3ADAMSON J : 
The Proceedings 

4This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon the applicant by his Honour Judge Sides QC in the District Court of New South Wales at Parramatta on 23 March 2010. The applicant was convicted of three counts of break, enter and steal contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), for which the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment. The sentencing judge was asked to take into account further offences of break, enter and steal, resist arrest, possession of car breaking implements and offensive language on a form filed in accordance with s 32 of the Act ( the Form 1 offences ). 

Sentences 

5In relation to the first count committed 31 January 2006 the sentencing judge ordered a total term of 40 months imprisonment to commence on 23 June 2009, with a non-parole period of 30 months. In relation to the second count committed on 16 November 2008 his Honour ordered a total term of 40 months imprisonment to commence on 23 September 2009, with a non-parole period of 30 months. In relation to the third count committed on 4 December 2008 the sentencing judge order a non-parole period of 33 months with a total term of 4 years imprisonment to commence on 23 June 2010. On the latter count the Form 1 offences were taken into account. 

6The sentencing judge determined that the sentence would commence at the date of arrest, 23 June 2009. 

7The total effective sentence was 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months. The sentencing judge found special circumstances within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) ( the Act ) by reason of the accumulation of sentences and reduced the non-parole period in relation to the third count so that the overall non-parole period did not exceed three-quarters of the total term. 

Facts 

8The sentencing judge recorded the following facts in respect of the three counts. 

The first count: 31 January 2006 

9At some time between 5.55am and 7.10pm on 31 January 2006, the applicant broke into the victim's premises on Railway Parade, Westmead via a balcony door and removed a safe containing a ring worth $3,000. He also stole a camera and iPod. The three items together were valued at $4,380. 

10The applicant committed the offence the subject of this count a mere week after being released to bail on 24 January 2006. 

The second count: 14-16 November 2008 

11At some time between 14 and 16 November 2008, the applicant climbed the balcony of the victim's unit in Campbell Street, Parramatta, broke in and stole a computer valued at $200 and a bottle of whiskey valued at $130. 

A Form 1 offence: 17 November 2008 

12On 17 November 2008 the applicant climbed onto the balcony of the victim's unit at Kingswood and broke in. In the process, he cut himself and bled profusely. While still bleeding, he ransacked parts of the unit and stole two cameras and an iPod. The evidence does not indicate the value of these items. 

The third count: 4 December 2008 

13At some time between 7am and 7pm on 4 December 2008, the applicant gained entry to the victim's unit by smashing a bathroom window. He ransacked three rooms and stole jewellery, a computer, and a wallet containing numerous cards. The total value of the property stolen was $2,770. 

Other relevant matters 

14The applicant was detected in connection with all four break, enter and steal matters via a DNA match with blood that he had left at the scene. 

15On 23 June 2009 police spoke to the applicant after they had seen him asking certain women about obtaining drugs. When the police searched the applicant, they found car keys and a screwdriver, thereby giving rise to a Form 1 offence of possession of car breaking implements. While waiting to be taken to the police station, the applicant swore at police, thereby giving rise to a Form 1 offence of offensive language. He then violently resisted them to the point where capsicum spray had to be used to subdue him, thereby giving rise to a further Form 1 offence of resist arrest. 

16At the time of the 2008 offences the applicant was on parole having been released from custody on 31 October 2008. The applicant was on bail at the time of the commission of the 2006 offence having been released from custody on 24 January 2006. At the time of sentencing he had served a balance of parole of 3 months and 8 days from a previous sentence which commenced on 23 June 2009. 

17The Crown has informed this Court that the applicant has subsequently been dealt with for a further two offences of break, enter and steal in the Parramatta Local Court on 30 March 2010. He was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment of two years to commence on 30 March 2010 and expire on 29 March 2012. These subsequent sentences are wholly subsumed in the sentences the subject of this appeal. 

18Accordingly, the applicant has received no additional penalty for the 2006 offence and the two offences for which he was subsequently sentenced. 

The Crown's submissions on sentence before the sentencing judge 

19The Crown on sentence submitted that the sentence should commence at the expiration of the parole period. The applicant was released on parole on 31 October 2008 with the period of parole in relation to an offence of aggravated robbery due to expire on 30 September 2009. The applicant committed an offence 16 days after his release on 16 November 2008 and a further offence less than a month after that on 4 December 2008. On 14 August 2009 the State Parole Authority revoked the parole with effect from 23 June 2009 (the date of arrest) and ordered that he serve the balance of 3 months and 8 days. 

The applicant's evidence and submissions on sentence before the sentencing judge 

20The applicant was represented by a Legal Aid solicitor at the hearing on sentence. A comprehensive report from a clinical psychologist was tendered on sentence. During the applicant's evidence in the sentence hearing proceedings, he read from a statement in which he outlined his attempts to rehabilitate himself 

Remarks on sentence 

Discount for plea of guilty 

21The sentencing judge was persuaded by the applicant's guilty pleas that he accepted responsibility for his crimes and acknowledges the damage he had done to his victims. His Honour reduced the sentence by about 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty in the Local Court. 

No additional sentence for the first count 

22The sentencing judge determined that the sentence for the offence committed on 31 January 2006, although committed while the applicant was on conditional liberty, should be subsumed in the two other sentences and the balance of parole because of considerations arising from delay. 

The relevant factors according to Ponfield 

23The sentencing judge considered the seriousness of the three offences in accordance with the guidelines set out in the guideline judgment In the matter of the Attorney General's Application (No 1) under s 26 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW); R v Ponfield & Others (1999) 48 NSWLR 327; [1999] NSWCCA 435 ( Ponfield ). His Honour noted the following: 

(1) all offences were committed in breach of either bail or parole; 

(2) some of the places were ransacked, but there was no wanton vandalism beyond that required to achieve entry; 

(3) the applicant did not return to the same victim's place to commit another offence; 

(4) none of the property has been recovered; 

(5) some of the property no doubt included property of a sentimental value; 

(6) the offences were committed with limited planning in order to fund the applicant's addiction to illicit drugs; 

(7) there was no professionalism in the execution of the offences; 

(8) the applicant's drug addiction explains but does not excuse his offending. 

The applicant's antecedents 

24The sentencing judge referred to the applicant's extensive criminal history and noted that he had been dealt with for multiple break, enter and steals in 1986, 1988 and 1992. His Honour noted that the applicant's record shows 19 convictions for break, enter and steals and two aggravated break and enters as well as several other convictions for offences involving dishonesty. 

The applicant's subjective case 

25The sentencing judge considered the applicant's subjective case and referred to the difficulties in his upbringing and his problems with drug addiction. His Honour also noted his attempts at rehabilitation after the offence of 4 December 2008 when ""he decided enough was enough, stopped using illegal drugs, went on a buprenorphine program and secured work as a builder's labourer"". However, the sentencing judge found that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were: 
""very poor because of: the entrenched nature of his addiction and failures to successfully address it in the long term; his criminal history and breaches of conditional liberty; and his failure to face reality of these offences without resorting to drug usage."" 

26The sentencing judge also noted that the applicant's response to supervision during this time was satisfactory. His Honour observed that the applicant gave up his job and started using benzodiazepines again about a week before his arrest after he received a phone call from police that they wanted to talk to him. 

Grounds of appeal 

27The applicant, who represents himself in this Court, relies on five grounds of appeal and has filed two pages of submissions in support of those grounds. He appeared at the hearing of his application for leave to appeal and made oral submissions. 

Ground one: the applicant was not properly represented in court 

28The applicant did not elaborate on this ground in his written submissions other than to reassert that he was poorly represented. 

29The Crown submitted that the applicant was represented in the sentence proceedings by an experienced Legal Aid advocate, who made appropriate submissions to the sentencing judge on the basis of the subjective material that was before the Court, including a submission as to the applicant's remorse and reassessment of his life now that he is in his forties. Furthermore, the Crown submitted that all of the subjective material upon which the applicant relies in this Court was before the sentencing judge. 

30However, at the hearing, the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge had relied on facts that were said to have been agreed but which had not in fact accorded with the applicant's instructions, and therefore were not in fact agreed. This had not earlier been raised by the applicant in his grounds of appeal or in his written submissions and the Court did not have material such as would enable it to determine whether there was any substance to this submission. 

31During the course of submissions, the presiding judge provided the applicant with the opportunity to consider whether he wanted the matter adjourned so that he could obtain legal advice. When the applicant returned following the luncheon adjournment, he informed that Court that he would prefer to have the matter dealt with finally rather than have it adjourned. 

32For these reasons I do not consider that the complaint of incompetence on the part of the applicant's legal representative at the sentence hearing has been substantiated. 

33Accordingly, the first ground should be dismissed. 

Ground two: sentence is too severe and applicant was rehabilitated 

34The applicant contends that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was too severe and submits that by the time he was arrested in June 2009 he had been rehabilitated. These contentions will be dealt with in turn. 

35This Court in R v Harris (2007) 171 A Crim R 267 emphasised that heavy sentences should generally be imposed for break, enter and steal offences committed by repeat offenders on domestic premises, whether or not they were aggravated forms of the offence. 

36Ponfield is the guideline judgment for break, enter and steal offences, contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act . At [48]-[50], Grove J said: 
""A court should regard the seriousness of an offence contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act as enhanced and reflect that enhanced seriousness in the quantum of sentence if any of the following factors are present. Necessarily, if more than one such factor is present there is a cumulative effect upon seriousness and the need for appropriate reflection. 

(i) The offence is committed whilst the offender is at conditional liberty on bail or on parole. 

(ii) The offence is the result of professional planning, organisation and execution. 

(iii) The offender has a prior record particularly for like offences. 

(iv) The offence is committed at premises of the elderly, the sick or the disabled. 

(v) The offence is accompanied by vandalism and by any other significant damage to property. 

(vi) The multiplicity of offence (reflected either in the charges or matters taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act ). In sentencing on multiple counts regard must be had to the criminality involved in each: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 1416. 

(vii) The offence is committed in a series of repeat incursions into the same premises. 

(viii) The value of the stolen property to the victim, whether that value is measured in terms of money or in terms of sentimental value. 

(ix) The offence was committed at a time when, absent specific knowledge on the part of the offender (a defined circumstance of aggravation - Crimes Act , s 105A(1)(f)), it was likely that the premises would be occupied, particularly at night. 

(x) That actual trauma was suffered by the victim (other than as a result of corporal violence, infliction of actual bodily harm or deprivation of liberty - defined circumstances of aggravation: Crimes Act , s 105A(1)(c), (d) and (e)). 

(xi) That force was used or threatened (other than by means of an offensive weapon, or instrument - a defined circumstance of aggravation: Crimes Act , s 105A(1)(a)). 

It will of course be requisite for a sentencing court to give appropriate weight to matters in mitigation as manifest in the particular case. These will include evidence of genuine regret and remorse and any rehabilitative steps taken by the offender. Whilst addiction to drugs and alcohol is a relevant circumstance for the Court to consider it is not of itself a mitigating factor: see R v Henry (at 384 [193]-[203] and 387 [217]-[259]). 

Section 439 of the Crimes Act obliges this Court to take into account the fact that a person has pleaded guilty and when that plea was indicated. Specification of reasons for any decision not to reduce sentence on account of such plea is mandatory. Statistical material suggests that there is a need to direct attention to the statutory requirement which in any event substantially rearticulates what the common law requires."" 

37The Crown submitted in this Court that factors (i), (iii) and (vi) were particularly significant in the instant case and that the applicant's conduct warranted a commensurate sentence. 

38The Crown also points to the fact that the offences were committed while the applicant was on conditional liberty as amounting to an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(j) of the Act. The Crown relied on this Court's decision in R v McVittie [2002] NSWCCA 344 as support for the proposition that parole is a privilege, abuse of which calls for a higher punishment. 

39The Crown submitted to the sentencing judge and to this Court that in light of the fact that the applicant had only been on parole for 16 and 34 days for offences as serious as aggravated robbery, his commission of these further offences was a very significant aggravating factor which not only increased the need for general and specific deterrence for the applicant, but was also relevant to an assessment of the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation. 

40The Crown submitted further that the applicant's antecedents were such that the sentence imposed ought reflect the fact that he has shown a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law: Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477; considered in R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566. 

41The Crown submitted that the applicant has not shown that the sentence is either too severe or manifestly excessive in the circumstance of the applicant's criminal history and his offending whilst on conditional liberty. 

42Furthermore the Crown submitted that the applicant has not shown that the sentencing judge failed to take into account sufficiently the applicant's steps toward rehabilitation. The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge also took into account, as his Honour was obliged to do, the applicant's relapse prior to arrest and his commission of further offences at the time of his arrest, when assessing the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation. 

43I agree with the Crown's submissions. The applicant has not demonstrated any respect in which the discretion of the sentencing judge miscarried or that the sentence itself is either severe or manifestly excessive. 

44I consider that ground two ought be dismissed. 

Grounds three: mistakes made in factual material, and four: exclusion of evidence 

45The applicant has not provided the Court with arguments in support of these grounds in his written submissions, nor did he seek to do so in the oral hearing. Accordingly, these grounds should be dismissed. 

Ground five: sentencing judge's recommendations not met 

46In his Honour's remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge said: 
""The Court refers you to the compulsory drug treatment program."" 

47This referral can be taken to be a referral pursuant to s 18B of the Drug Court Act 1998 (NSW) so that the Drug Court could determine whether the applicant should be the subject of a compulsory drug treatment order. 

48This Court has been informed by a letter to the Clerk of the District Court dated 27 July 2010, attached to the Crown's submissions, that the matters involving the applicant came before Judge Barnett of the Drug Court on 20 July 2010. Barnett DCJ made the following order: ""Held not eligible for program."" 

49The Crown contends, correctly in my view, that the applicant's record shows that he would not be an ""eligible convicted offender"" within the meaning of s 5A of the Drug Court Act . The applicant was convicted in Queensland on 12 November 2003 of an offence of an attempted robbery with actual violence and whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. Section 5A(2)(c) precludes an offender from eligibility if the person has been convicted at any time of an offence involving the use of a firearm. 

50Accordingly, this ground ought be dismissed. 

Further matters 

51Although the applicant has not succeeded in any of his grounds of appeal, he made submissions to this Court that he wanted to participate in the programs administered by the Drug Court and that he wanted to be transferred from Goulburn Gaol to a prison where he would have a lower security classification so that he could have access to more training programs. He told the Court that he wants to be released so that he could be a better father to his children. He was also much affected by the deaths of his sister and his father. Because he was in custody, he was unable to attend the funerals of either of these members of his family. 

52Whether the applicant is allowed to participate in programs administered by the Drug Court and in what prison he is incarcerated are matters that are beyond this Court's jurisdiction. Nonetheless this Court recommends that he be permitted to participate in such programs, if possible, since this may advance his prospects of rehabilitation and reduce the chance of recidivism on release. 

Conclusion 

53In my view, for the foregoing reasons, the applicant has neither demonstrated any error, nor have the individual and total sentences been shown to be manifestly excessive. 

54Accordingly, leave to appeal should not be granted. 

Orders 
1. Leave to appeal refused.

The proceedings 

4This is an application for leave to appeal the sentence imposed upon Jose Lues Rios, the applicant, by his Honour Judge Colefax SC in the District Court of New South Wales. The applicant was convicted of three offences of stealing from person, contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), for which the maximum penalty is 14 years. 

5The applicant was sentenced jointly with a co-offender Martha Isabel Ruano. The applicant and the co-offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court and were given a 25 per cent discount. 

6The applicant was sentenced to a total sentence of imprisonment for 4 years, 3 months and 16 days, consisting of an effective non-parole period of 3 years, 5 months and 12 days. 

7The co-offender was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 3 years 11 months with a non-parole period of 2 years, 10 months and 12 days. 

8The sentences for both were structured as follows, with each of the individual sentences being accumulated by 6 months.

9In the instant case, the sentences for each of the 3 offences carry a non-parole period of about 75 per cent of the total. However, for the aggregate sentence the proportion is in the order of 80 per cent. 

10On 16 August 2011, the applicant applied for leave to appeal against the sentence on the basis that the sentencing judge had failed properly to consider the issue of special circumstances in the context of partially accumulating sentences. 

Facts 

11The sentencing judge recorded the following facts in respect of the three offences. 

The first offence: 5 June 2008 

12The first offence was committed on 5 June 2008. On that day the victim, who was 79 years old, withdrew $3,500 in cash from his account at the Commonwealth Bank at the Bankstown Shopping Centre. The purpose of the withdrawal was to assist his son in Lebanon with medical expenses. 

13After withdrawing the money the victim put it in one of his trouser pockets and left the bank to walk to his car which was nearby. Before he had left the shopping centre he felt a bump and someone touching his right side. He felt in his pocket. The money was gone. 

14When police attended, they obtained access to CCTV footage which showed the offenders present in that part of the shopping centre where the victim had been robbed. The footage showed the applicant stepping in front of the victim causing him to stop and Ms Ruano then moving in and stealing the money. A third person (a male) named Carlos was seen to be helping her. A fourth person (Mr Augustine Bolanos who at one point was in the shopping centre with the others) was waiting outside the shopping centre in his motor vehicle and drove the three offenders from the scene. 

The second offence: 28 May 2009 

15The second offence was committed on 28 May 2009. On that day the victim went to the St George Bank in Haymarket, with the intention of making a deposit of $1,600. She sat on a seat in the public waiting area inside the bank and counted the money she intended to deposit. When she finished, she placed the money in an A4 envelope which she placed in a small personal shopping cart. While the applicant watched the victim counting her money, he made a mobile phone call to Ms Ruano who shortly thereafter entered the bank and had a conversation with the applicant. A third unknown person, a male, who was an associate of the applicant and Ms Ruano, also entered the branch the same time as Ms Ruano. 

16The applicant and Ms Ruano then approached the victim. Ms Ruano took up a seat directly opposite her and the applicant took a seat directly behind her. The applicant then engaged her in conversation. Whilst the victim had turned to face the applicant, Ms Ruano reached into her trolley and removed the envelope. The applicant, Ms Ruano and the unknown male then swiftly left the premises. Almost immediately the victim realised what had happened. This incident was also recorded by CCTV in the bank. 

The third offence: 10 August 2009 

17The third offence occurred on 10 August 2009. On that day the victim went to the Westpac Bank in Haymarket where she withdrew $21,296 in cash on behalf of her employer. The teller placed the money in a hessian bag which bore the Westpac Logo and gave it to the victim. She then placed the hessian bag in her handbag and went to the ANZ Bank at Haymarket in order to deposit the money into another account of her employer. She collected a ticket from the automated ticketing machine, sat in the public area of the bank and waited for the number on that ticket to be called. While she was waiting the victim removed the hessian bag from her handbag and the cash from the hessian bag and began to count it. The applicant was already in the ANZ Bank at the time the victim entered. When he saw the victim count the money he made a mobile phone call and shortly thereafter Ms Ruano entered the bank with the same unknown man who was involved in the second offence, together with a fourth unknown man. 

18All four offenders took up positions in the public waiting areas of the bank. The applicant approached the victim and asked her to get up while he searched under her seat, saying that he had lost his credit card. The victim placed the money back into the hessian bag which she put in her handbag and moved to another seat. The applicant then stood himself behind the victim and smeared a quantity of wasabi on her back. The victim felt something touch her and got up from her seat to move away. When she got up the two unknown males approached her and said: ""There is a lot of Wasabi on your back and the chair."" The two men then pretended to offer assistance to the victim. 

19Whilst the victim was distracted by this activity, Ms Ruano sat beside her. The unknown males continued to distract the victim, while Ms Ruano reached into her bag and removed the hessian Westpac bag. After covering that bag with a scarf Ms Ruano, followed swiftly by the applicant and the other unknown males, left the bank. The whole of the third offence was recorded on CCTV. 

20The applicant was arrested with co-offender, Ms Ruano, on 14 August 2009. 

21Ms Ruano appealed her sentence and was successful on the ground that ""the sentencing judge erred in failing to structure the sentences imposed so far as to (i) give proper effect to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) ( the Act ), and (ii) to vary the statutory ratio having expressly stated his intention to do so"": Ruano v R [2011] NSWCCA 149 at [18]. The Court confirmed the sentences for the offences on 5 June 2008 and 28 May 2009. The sentence for the offence on 10 August 2009 was quashed, and in lieu thereof, a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months commencing on 14 July 2010 and expiring on 13 March 2012, with a balance of term of 1 year and 4 months commencing on 14 March 2012 was imposed. 

Applicant's submissions on sentence before the sentencing judge 

22The applicant submitted to the sentencing judge that there were special circumstances within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Act such as would warrant the balance of the term of the sentence exceeding one-third of the non-parole period. 

23At the time the sentencing judge imposed the sentence, section 44(1)-(3) of the Act provided: 
""(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 

(2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision). 

(3) The failure of a court to comply with subsection (2) does not invalidate the sentence."" 

24The applicant submitted to the sentencing judge that a finding of special circumstances was warranted, by reason of the following four circumstances: 

(1) The applicant's age of 51; 

(2) His early plea of guilty; 

(3) His potential for rehabilitation; 

(4) His need and suitability for supervision. 

25The applicant's counsel accepted that there ought be some accumulation, namely that it was not appropriate that all the sentences be served concurrently. 

Remarks on sentence 

26In the remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge referred to the following aggravating factors common to both offenders: 

(1) The offences were committed in company; 

(2) Each of the offences, and in particular the third, required significant planning and organisation; 

(3) The amount in the third offence was substantial; 

(4) The victim of the first offence was an old man. 

27The sentencing judge then referred to an additional aggravating factor in the case of the applicant: namely, that all three offences were committed when he was on bail. On 21 February 2008 he was charged with possession of a prohibited drug and on 7 March 2008 he was charged with stealing. Warrants for his arrest were issued when he failed to appear in court on 30 June 2008. The second and third offences were committed after the warrants were issued. 

28The sentencing judge recorded, in a way that has not been the subject of complaint, the subjective case of the applicant. 

29The sentencing judge's reasons for not finding special circumstances appear from the following passage from the remarks on sentence: 
""It has not been submitted on behalf of the offender that the sentences should be served concurrently. It is accepted that there should be partial accumulation, but not such that the total sentence is excessive. 

Given that the offender has already served earlier periods of imprisonment and that I do not regard his prospects for rehabilitation as good, I decline to find special circumstances."" 

Evidence adduced on appeal in the event of resentence 

30The applicant relies on an affidavit sworn on 6 December 2011 in which he deposes to his location in various prisons, his classification and the work he has performed since he was taken into custody in respect of these offences in August 2009. 

The ground of appeal 

31The applicant relies on a single ground of appeal: namely that the sentencing judge failed properly to consider the issue of special circumstances in the context of partially accumulating the sentences. 

32The applicant submitted to this Court that the accumulation of sentences is conventionally considered to provide the basis for a finding of special circumstances in respect of the last of a number of sentences imposed, in order to achieve an appropriate relationship between the effective non-parole period and the overall term. It was agreed that this principle applies even though there is no restriction on structuring a sentence in such a way that the non-parole period exceeds three quarters of the total sentence, that corresponds to the restriction that the non-parole period not exceed one third of the total sentences unless there are special circumstances, as provided for by s 44(2) of the Act. 

33The applicant submitted that in the absence of express reasons for imposing a non-parole period significantly in excess of the statutory portion, it might be inferred that the sentencing judge overlooked the effect of partial accumulation. He pointed to the decisions of this Court to that effect in R v Nightingal e [2005] NSWCCA 147 at [39]-[46], Dunn v R [2007] NSWCCA 312 at [40]-[41], Wakefield v R [2010] NSWCCA 12 at [26]-[28] and Barrett v R [2011] NSWCCA 213 at [29]. 

34The applicant submitted that the error could be corrected by varying the existing non-parole period such that it expires on 30 October 2012. This can be effected by reducing the non-parole period for the third count to 2 years 3 months and 17 days. The Crown agreed that if the Court was minded to accept the applicant's submissions, this variation was correct as a matter of mathematics. 

35The Crown did not take issue with the applicable principles. Rather, it contended that the question of special circumstances was raised and adequately considered by the sentencing judge and there was no error in the circumstance that the proportion of the non-parole period bears to the total sentence is in excess of 75 per cent. 

36Although the Crown conceded in oral submissions that the sentencing judge had simply overlooked the structure of the sentence in terms of s 44, this was nonetheless an appropriate case for the non-parole period to exceed 75 per cent of the total sentence. In support of this submission, the Crown pointed to the applicant's extensive criminal record, his complete lack of remorse, the low prospects of rehabilitation and the appropriateness of the non-parole period determined by the sentencing judge which would make it inappropriate to reduce it any further. 

37Furthermore, the Crown submitted that if the balance of the term were reduced so as to preserve the ratio of 75 per cent between the non-parole period and the total sentence, this would result in a deduction of 3 months which was insufficient to warrant the intervention of this Court. 

38I consider that although the sentencing judge's reasons were adequate to explain why his Honour did not find ""special circumstances"" within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Act, they were insufficient to explain why the proportion between the non-parole period and the total sentence was in excess of 75 per cent, thereby leaving open the inference that the sentencing judge overlooked the effect of partial accumulation. Although a period of three months would ordinarily not attract the intervention of this Court, it is of some significance in the instant appeal, since it constitutes the difference between an appropriate sentence where there are no special circumstances found, and one which requires reasons to displace an inference of arithmetical error. 

39For these reasons, the applicant is entitled to succeed on this ground. 

Resentence 

40I consider that the only error that infected the sentencing judge's discretion was the one identified by the applicant, namely that relating to the proportion between the non-parole period and the total sentence. It is appropriate, in my view, to correct the error so as to adjust that proportion such that it reflects a ratio of 75 per cent between the non-parole period and the total sentence. 

41Accordingly, I propose to reduce the non-parole period for the third count from two years, six months and 11 days to 2 years 3 months and 17 days, such that it expires on 30 October 2012. This reduction will be reflected in the orders of the Court set out below. 

Additional observations about the desirability of sentencing in rounded terms 

42In the course of the hearing of the appeal, the Court raised with counsel the prudence or otherwise of expressing a sentence in terms of years, months and days, as opposed to years and months. The applicant's counsel accepted that it was preferable that sentences not descend into numbers of days but submitted that any adjustment by rounding should operate to the benefit of the applicant. Mr Gartelmann referred to Grove J's observation in Ruano v R [2011] NSWCCA 149 at [20]: 
""... the somewhat unrounded terms of specification of non parole periods in particular make exact analysis awkward ..."" 

43The Court accepts that such specificity ought be discouraged because it adds an unnecessary complication in the sentencing process. However, since the parties have agreed on the appropriate date for the expiry of the non-parole period so as to reduce to 75 per cent the proportion it bears to the total sentence, I do not consider this to be an appropriate case to round the number of days down to a number of months. 

Orders 

(1) Leave to appeal granted. 

(2) Appeal upheld. 

(3) The non-parole period fixed by Colefax DCJ in respect of the offence of stealing on 10 August 2009 be varied to fix a non-parole period of two years, three months and 17 days, which commenced on 14 July 2010 and will expire on 30 October 2012. 

(4) The sentences imposed by Colefax DCJ be otherwise confirmed.

		22 February 2012",2012-02-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758632,R v Bonifasous REUTER [2012] NSWDC 178,"SENTENCE


1I am sentencing a young man who, as his lawyer Mr Bruce said, went off the rails seriously for a period of about ten months in 2010. Between March and August 2010 he committed a robbery in company and three break, enters and steal and one break and enter with intent to steal. He is a 20 year old man with absolutely no criminal record in his past. 

2As Mr Bruce realistically acknowledged, I have to sentence him to gaol but I need to balance out the important purposes of sentencing a person - including being accountable for the crime which he committed, making sure he is adequately punished for that crime and protecting the community. But as well as that, I need to take into account his rehabilitation as a young man.

3The young man's name is Bonifasous Reuter and he pleaded guilty at an early stage to the crimes which he committed. 

4What I am sentencing him for are two crimes called aggravated break, enter and steal. They are offences against section 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. They carry a maximum of 20 years imprisonment. Not only that, Parliament has seen fit to fix a standard non-parole period to each of those crimes of 5 years imprisonment. I am also sentencing him for the crime of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. That is an offence against section 97(1) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum of 20 years imprisonment. My earlier reference to robbery in company should have been a reference to armed robbery.

5When I am imposing the sentence for the armed robbery, he has asked me to take into account two other crimes which will be reflected in the sentence which I impose for the armed robbery. One of those crimes is a break, enter and steal and the other a break and enter with intent. I will take those two offences into account. Mr Reuter has signed a document under section 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and I sign the same document.

6It is important for a judge to set out briefly just what happened, so far as the criminal activity is concerned, that led to a person being charged. The earlier offence in time was the armed robbery. That was committed at about 11 o'clock on the evening of 25 March 2010. Ms Narelle Waters and two of her colleagues were at the Caltex service station at Maryland. They were closing up. Mr Reuter and Mr Lang came into the store wearing hooded jumpers and their faces were covered. Mr Reuter was holding a fake pistol and Mr Lang had a machete. They demanded to know where the money was and were directed to the till. The safe was apparently locked. They wanted cigarettes but they were not available. The till was empty and they took just under $500.

7Mrs Waters provided a victim impact statement setting out the impact which that crime had on her. She described herself as a wife, mother and grandmother working hard to provide for her family and make the best for them. She had a good rapport with her workplace. She said that all of this ""has been shot down in flames"" when she was held up. She finds it hard to go to social gatherings where young people are with hooded jackets. She feels insecure at night time outside. She talks about the nightmares which she has. She finds she is quick to judge people whereas before she treated all people equally. She clings on to her handbag if she is going to the shopping centre with her grandson. She has had to have counselling to help her through the trauma. Her friends help her as well. Some of the emotions and problems that she describes herself with are paranoia, anxiety, panic, being scared, being angry, moods and being teary. It is important to set out the impact which a crime, such as the one that Mr Reuter with Mr Lang committed, can have on an ordinary individual going about their job in the community and the long term impact which such an offence can have on the life of an innocent other person.

8It is also important to bear in mind the importance of protecting the community from crimes such as that by incapacitating Mr Reuter from doing it again, but also of stopping others - by the sentence which I impose - from thinking about that sort of crime. Unfortunately Ms Walters' graphic description of the impact which this crime has had on her is not unusual for a judge to read but it is important to acknowledge the impact which it has had. 

9The two crimes which I take into account when I am sentencing Mr Reuter for the armed robbery are to do with breaking and entering. One was committed a couple of months later on 14 May 2010, where Mr Reuter broke into an office in Newcastle. A rock was thrown through the glass doors and a plasma television was taken but dropped, causing it to be damaged. A computer was also taken. In addition, some months later on 27 August 2010, Mr Reuter was involved in an attempted break and enter at another building where the front doors were again smashed. An attempt was made to remove a plasma television but it was unsuccessful and the offender abandoned the effort. As I said, I will take those two crimes into account in sentencing Mr Reuter for the armed robbery.

10The two aggravated break, enter and steal offences which I am sentencing Mr Reuter for occurred some hours apart. The first was a little before midnight on 26 August 2010 and the second was about 2:00am on 27 August 2010. The first one was a break and enter at the Joyce Mayne store at Rutherford. A man was seen earlier in the evening looking at the store. At just before midnight Mr Reuter, with two other offenders - a Mr Britt and a Mr Lang - returned there and smashed the glass panel of the store and got in. Inside, they smashed cabinets containing electrical items. They took a variety of electrical items. This included cameras, video cameras, mobile phones, flat screen televisions. They drove off. The next day when the CCTV was viewed by one of the members of staff, the three offenders, including Mr Reuter, were identified as the three men who had been seen at about 7 o'clock earlier that evening, so that offence involved some hours of planning.

11A few hours later, just before 2 o'clock, Mr Reuter and again Mr Britt and Mr Lang smashed into the Switchboard store at Glendale. Again they smashed a number of cabinets. They stole items including clothing, sunglasses, a wake board and some cash. Police intercepted phone calls - because Mr Lang's phone had been lawfully intercepted - and there were discussions, mostly initiated by Mr Lang, between Mr Lang and the others regarding what they would do about disposing of the goods.

12I turn now to say something about Mr Reuter himself. Not only is it important for a judge to set out the facts of the crimes which an offender has committed and the impact on the victims, it is also important in sentencing that the judge takes into account factors personal to an offender. It is one thing to sentence an experienced criminal with a long criminal record for the same crimes; it is another thing to sentence a young man with no criminal record who, like Mr Reuter, has committed a serious crime. 

13I repeat, Mr Reuter has no criminal record whatsoever. 

14There is a helpful presentence report prepared by Annette Caffery of the Lake Macquarie district office of the Probation and Parole Service. Ms Caffery's summary of the report reads as follows - 

""Mr Reuter presents as a somewhat shy and introverted man, incongruent with the nature of the offence. Whilst he has made significant gains in his life since the commission of the offence and continues to enjoy the support of his family, it would appear that significant negative choices and attitudes attributed to his current predicament. As such, it is the passage of time that is the test that positive behaviour changes occurred.""

15Mr Bruce who, as I said, appeared for Mr Reuter, called his client to give evidence. He indicated that he appreciated the impact which the crime had on the victims of the offences. He said he could not forget the faces of the people involved in the armed robbery. He was prepared to pay compensation in respect of the break, enter and steal offences. He is well supported by his family. His father, mother and sister and aunt were in court. At the time that he committed these offences, he said he was in a particularly low point in his life. He had even considered committing suicide. In fact, to his credit, two months after this offence he got help from a psychiatrist. There has been, he said, a significant change in the last 18 months. He is now back in full time work as a machine operator and is undertaking some courses to qualify himself. He fully accepts responsibility for the crimes he committed and ... 

HIS HONOUR: Am I reading ...You are quite right thank you. I am sorry, my associate has drawn my attention to the fact that I am reading from the wrong - I apologise and I apologise to your family - I will start again. I have referred to Mr Bruce calling his client. Let's start again.

16Mr Reuter comes from a strong family. His father is Dutch, his mother is from the Philippines. He was himself born in Australia. He has three brothers and is employed in driving rollers on the road. He left school at the age of 15. He had already secured part time work earlier when he was 14 years of age at school. He experienced a little racism because of his mixed ethnic background and got into some fights but not major ones. He has maintained steady employment up until the sentence proceedings which were last week. He has always had a problem with literacy and had trouble in reading and writing. He did an apprenticeship as a chef but did not continue with that because he could not get on with his employer. He met Mr Lang at school and Mr Britt he has known all his life. 

17He acknowledged that he had committed a series of very serious crimes between March and August 2010. He in fact was arrested on 9 December 2010 and spent 14 days in custody, bail refused. He spoke about the scary impact which that period in custody had on him. He repeated, as I said, that he would remember the faces of the victims of the armed robbery and said that, although he knew that it was a fake gun, they did not. That is an important insight. He is working on his literacy and working hard, taking home some $700 a week.

18Cross-examined by Ms Wand, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, he acknowledged that he himself does not take drugs and does not take alcohol and he is working on the licences he needs for qualifications to work on the roads. Asked why he committed the crimes of breaking and enter and stealing as well as the armed robbery, he said it was a lack of money and he could not get jobs to get decent money at the time.

19Mr Bruce also called Mr Reuter senior, who is Mr Reuter's father. Mr Reuter explained how he and his wife had worked hard to give their whole family a very decent education and upbringing. They instilled in their family a philosophy of working rather than living off welfare. The importance of working for a living was emphasised in the family and it is clear that it has been passed on to Mr Reuter, whom I am sentencing. Mr Reuter senior, when he realised about the bad influence of Mr Lang, cut communications with Mr Lang. He indicated that the family would support his son absolutely when he left prison and support him into the future and continue with the values which have been instilled so far.

20Mr Reuter junior has always lived at home. Mr Reuter senior explained that his son had complained to him about the experiences which he had in prison and how unpleasant they were. He said that his son had many times expressed regret about the victims of the robbery and wished that he could reverse time and that he would never forget the peoples' faces.

21As I said, Mr Bruce realistically acknowledged that his client must go to gaol. That follows, in a way, from one matter which I have not yet referred to and that is that one of the co-offenders Dylan Lang has already been sentenced. The Chief Judge, Blanch J, sentenced him on 21 September 2011. His Honour sentenced Mr Lang for the same three crimes that I am sentencing Mr Reuter for. In Mr Lang's case his Honour also took into account two matters under section 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act but, significantly, Mr Lang had a significant criminal record which included armed robbery offences and aggravated robberies. His Honour, also significantly, found in appropriate terms at that time that the two offences of break, enter and steal fell below the mid range of objective seriousness. His Honour imposed, for each of the two offences of break, enter and steal, fixed terms of 2 years imprisonment. The two fixed terms were partly accumulated so that, in effect, there was a sentence of 3 years for the break, enter and steal. Taking into account the other matters in sentencing Mr Lang for the armed robbery, his Honour sentenced him to 7 years imprisonment with a 3 year non-parole period. It is, as I said, important to take into account that Mr Lang had a very serious criminal record. 

22Mr Bruce correctly pointed out that since that sentence, the High Court has delivered its judgment in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 85 ALJR 1154; [2011] HCA 39 and I have taken that into account. 

23I accept the following submissions. I take into account the fact that Mr Reuter has no criminal convictions. I take into account that he is a young man of good character with a strong work ethic. I take into account that his family support and employment mean that he is unlikely to re-offend. I take into account that the same factors, plus the fact that he has no drug and alcohol problems, means that his prospects of rehabilitation are also good. He has expressed, I agree, profound remorse. He has pleaded guilty at what Ms Wand agrees is the earliest available opportunity and should have the full discount in respect of that plea.

24I agree that Mr Reuter senior was an impressive witness and I am confident that the family will fully support Mr Reuter when he is released.

25I also agree that Mr Lang appeared to be the main leader in the criminal enterprises.

26Mr Bruce drew my attention to the guideline judgment delivered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; [1999] NSWCCA 111 and many of the factors of this case correspond with that guideline judgment. It is acknowledged that the weapon which Mr Reuter had was not itself capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. Objectively that is important to note but of course subjectively the victim did not realise that it was a fake.

27Ms Wand fairly acknowledged the entry of the early plea and the submissions about the impact of the guideline judgment. She acknowledged the fact that the co-offender Mr Lang had a serious criminal record but who was also, which I have not yet observed, on conditional liberty at the time that he committed the offence which is also an aggravating factor. She acknowledged, as Mr Bruce had submitted, that there are special circumstances for adjusting the usual or standard ratio between a non-parole period and a full time sentence. Normally a person must serve in gaol 75 per cent of their sentence. Mr Bruce had submitted that his client was young, immature and this was his first time in custody and he needed the continuing support of his family in his rehabilitation. I accept those submissions as Ms Wand acknowledged. She acknowledged the remorse which he had expressed. She correctly drew my attention to the importance in sentencing of protecting the community and preserving its safety and recognising the harm done to members of the community through the crime.

28I have taken all these factors into account. The guideline judgment suggests that for the kind of offence which was described in that judgment, the sentence should generally fall between 4 and 5 years for the full term. That of course does not take into account the impact of the plea of guilty since the decision in Henry being acknowledged to be 25 per cent. I therefore would regard an appropriate overall sentence for this offence as being a sentence of three and a half years imprisonment. For a sentence of 3 ½ years imprisonment or 42 months, the non-parole period which would normally be served is 75 percent of that which is some 2 years and 7 months. I propose to reduce that to 50 per cent instead of 75 per cent so that the non-parole period for Mr Reuter will be 21 months, that is 1 year and 9 months and, as I said, I have taken into account the matters on the Form 1.

29In respect of the two offences of breaking and entering and stealing, Mr Lang the co-offender received 2 years imprisonment. Taking into account that in Mr Reuter's case he did not commit the offence whilst on conditional liberty and did not have prior criminal records, I propose to fix sentences of 18 months which I will accumulate by 1 month. The overall sentence will be 42 months and the minimum time that Mr Reuter will have to stay in prison will be 21 months. 

HIS HONOUR: Now I will just pause there. I need to backdate the sentence by 14 days.

BRUCE: 27 January.

HIS HONOUR: 27 January is it? Thank you. 

30I take into account, in making the aggravated break enter and steal sentences concurrent with the armed robbery offences, that Blanch J did the same in respect of the offender Lang. 

HIS HONOUR: I am going to sentence you now Mr Reuter.

31In respect of the aggravated break, enter and steal - the Joyce Mayne complex - I sentence you to 18 months imprisonment to commence on 27 January 2012 and to expire on 26 July 2013. That is a fixed term.

32In respect of the aggravated break, enter and steal - the Switchboard complex - I sentence you to 18 months imprisonment commencing on 27 February 2012 and expiring on 27 August 2013. That is a fixed term.

33In respect of the armed robbery, taking into account the matters under section 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I fix a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months commencing on 27 January 2012 and expiring on 26 October 2013. The balance of the term will be 1 year and 9 months commencing on 27 October 2013 and expiring on 26 July 2015. The overall sentence is 3 ½ years from 27 January 2012 to 26 July 2015. The earliest date on which it appears to me that you will be eligible for release on parole is 26 October 2013. Your release will be dependent upon the Parole Authority. Have a seat Mr Reuter.

HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Bruce and Ms Wand, any factual or indeed legal matters that could be dealt with as part of this sentence or that I need to re-open under section 43 first. And secondly, the figures.

BRUCE: In relation to the first matter, your Honour may wish to correct a slip of the tongue with respect to a reference to Mr Britt when your Honour was dealing with Mr Reuter's subjectives.

HIS HONOUR: Yes I did. I referred to that in commencing my remarks on sentence about matters personal to Mr Reuter, I was reading from notes I had taken in respect of Mr Britt's evidence rather than Mr Reuter's. I corrected that partway through and I apologise. 

Anything else on the legal or factual matters?

WAND: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: What about the figures?

WAND: I agree with the figures.

34Mr Reuter, you have got a gaol term as Mr Bruce realistically acknowledged. It is 3 ½ years, it is for the armed robbery and it takes into account the other break and enters and there is two sentences for the Joyce Mayne and the Switchboard. They run at the same time as that because the Judge sentencing Lang did the same so I have done the same there but I have given you a gaol term for the armed robbery because it is so serious and that gaol term is 3 ½ years and your minimum term is 1 year and 9 months which is half that. Normally a standard one would be 2 years and 7 months that you would have to stay in gaol but because of your age and your prospects of rehabilitation, then I have adjusted that to half so you will be eligible to be released in 1 year and 9 months from 27 January which, as I repeat, you will be eligible on 26 October 2013 do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yeah.

HIS HONOUR: All right now you have got a very supportive family who are behind you so do your time. You have got a strong work ethic, I have referred to that. You have got a good upbringing and you can turn your life around so good luck. Thank you.

2758633,Usmanov v R [2012] NSWDC 290,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal from the Downing Centre Local Court when the appellant was convicted of an offence of publishing an indecent article. He had broken up with his girlfriend and he posted some indecent photographs of her on his Facebook page. She became aware of that. She asked him to take them off. He declined. She got in touch with the police and he then took the photographs off the Facebook page. They did reappear some time later. 

2The magistrate dealt with it on the basis that he failed to take them off completely. The magistrate also dealt with it on the basis that it was not clear on the evidence how many people had access to the Facebook page and, therefore, how broad the distribution of the material was. The magistrate was also concerned about similar offences and what the pattern of sentencing was. In this case the case involved a twenty year old with no prior criminal history and an otherwise respectable and responsible background. 

3In fact there have been other cases before the court and I know that I determined one case where the posting was more serious than this matter and in that matter I imposed a suspended sentence. 

4In my view, bearing in mind his age and lack of prior criminal history and the history of this matter, the magistrate was correct in assessing that it was a matter that required the imposition of a gaol sentence, because there does have to be a general deterrence aspect to these sorts of offences because they are offences that are easy to commit and can have a significant impact so far as the victim is concerned.

5The magistrate, having correctly come to that conclusion, then decided that the matter should be dealt with by way of home detention. In my view the matter can equally be dealt with by way of a suspended sentence. 

6Accordingly the order that I make is I allow the appeal against the sentence. I set aside the order of the magistrate. I confirm the order of the magistrate for a sentence of six months but I suspend that on the condition that he enters into a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of six months.

7Mr Usmanov, do you enter into that bond to be of good behaviour?

8APPELLANT: Yes.

9HIS HONOUR: Could you tell me what your present address is?

10APPELLANT: xx xxxxx Street, xxxxx 2007

11HIS HONOUR: What was the postcode?

12SPENCER: 2007, your Honour.

13APPELLANT: 2007.

14HIS HONOUR: A copy of the bond will be sent there, Mr Spencer.

		04 June 2013",2012-02-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758635,R v Jarrod BRITT [2012] NSWDC 62,"SENTENCE


1I am sentencing a young 21 year old man who has a negligible criminal record. But on two occasions on one night in August 2010, he embarked upon a spree of breaking and entering with co-offenders into some commercial properties. 

2He was charged with two offences of aggravated break enter and steal. This is an offence against section 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. That section has affixed to it a maximum of 20 years imprisonment for each of the two crimes. Not only that, Parliament regards the crime as so serious that it has fixed a standard non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment to the crime.

3It is important for a judge, before the judge sentences the offender, to set out briefly what happened which brought about the charges against the offender. In this case Mr Britt, with his co-offenders - a Mr Lang and a Mr Reuter - turned up at the Joyce Mayne store at Rutherford on 26 August 2010 at about 7 'clock. They looked around the store and were noticed by members of staff. They were there for about half an hour and then left. Then, just before midnight on the same night, the three of them turned up again. The store was, of course, by then closed. They smashed the glass panel of the store and got in. They then smashed cabinets containing electrical items. They took various items, including cameras, video cameras, mobile phones and two flat screen televisions. They put the haul into their car and drove off. 

4Then, a couple of hours later, they turned up at the Switchboard store at Glendale. Again they smashed their way inside and, whilst inside, smashed a number of cabinets. They stole things such as clothing, sunglasses, a wakeboard and a small amount of cash.

5The phone of one of the offenders, namely, Mr Lang, had been intercepted lawfully by the police. There were various phone calls over the next few days between Mr Lang and the other two. What to do with the proceeds of the crimes was discussed. It seems clear that Mr Lang was the ringleader, and indeed he said in one of the phone calls that when he, Mr Lang, went back on one of the occasions to get more goods, Mr Britt was scared and said, ""Let's go, man,"" and ran off. 

6It is also important when a judge sentences an offender for the judge to refer to things which are personal to the offender. In this case, as I said, Mr Britt is a 21 year old man. His only previous offences were a common assault and swearing in a public place, for which he received a fine and a bond. In fact, that occurred after the offences that I am sentencing him for. In 2009 he was fined for stealing. I note an offence of affray in 2008, but it was dismissed under section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and I place no weight on that. But it is a relatively minor criminal record. 

7The Probation and Parole Service prepared a helpful report about Mr Britt. It was prepared by their officer Brenda Baker and dated 19 October 2011. Ms Baker summarised Mr Britt's case in the following terms - 

""After being raised in a caring family atmosphere, Mr Britt appears to have had the benefit of having a sense of morality and work ethic attempted to be instilled in him. It seems that Mr Britt has emotional and behavioural problems which at this time are in their infancy of being addressed and his actions in these current offences have completely 'dumbfounded' his parents, but they still remain supportive of their son. It would appear that a level of immaturity and impulsivity were also factors in the offence, which are being addressed via his current interventions.""

8Ms Baker noted that he had been on a bond under section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act from 10 November 2010 - that is, after these offences - and that his ""response to supervision was unsatisfactory"". He had been given ""numerous opportunities to abide by the conditions of his order, however he did not appear to treat his obligations to his order seriously, and breach action was undertaken. No action was taken on the breach at Toronto Local Court on 14 September 2011.""

9It is important to note also that the Chief Judge of this Court, Blanch J, sentenced the co-offender Dylan Lang on 21 September 2011. Mr Lang had a serious criminal record and also committed the offence whilst he was on conditional liberty. For each of the aggravated break enter and steal offences that I am sentencing Mr Britt for, Blanch J imposed on Mr Lang fixed term sentences of 2 years each. His Honour staggered the sentences so that the effective overall sentence was 3 years for Mr Lang.

10Mr O'Brien, who appeared for Mr Britt in the sentencing proceedings, tendered a report from a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Christopher Bench. He diagnosed Mr Britt with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and also said that Mr Britt ""was suffering from depressive symptoms at the time of the index offences"". Later in his report, Dr Bench said that, regarding Mr Britt's ""mental health around the time of the index offences, it is likely that he would have met the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder with depressed mood."" The psychiatrist noted that Mr Britt was ""subjected to a number of significant stressors at the time, most notably revolving around his employment and financial straits."" He noted that over the last six months, Mr Britt had seen a resolution of his depressive symptoms and he thought that ""ongoing monitoring by a psychiatrist would be important for evaluation of further depressive episodes or the recurrence of his anxiety disorder"" although ""no other specific psychiatric treatment is currently indicated.""

11Mr O'Brien also tendered on behalf of his client a number of references which spoke very well of Mr Britt as an employee, as well as an individual. In particular, the referees spoke of a couple of significant events which had occurred in Mr Britt's life. A former partner of his sister, called Grant Odgers, became very close friends with Mr Britt. Tragically, Mr Odgers committed suicide and that had a significant impact on Mr Britt. His sister, Renae Britt, said that Mr Britt ""took this news very hard"". And then apparently 6 months after losing Mr Odgers, as his sister said, ""our nephew Riley passed away"". She observed that her brother ""was faced with these raw emotions he had never felt before. All this death in our family took a huge toll on Jarrod."" She herself noticed a change in her brother's personality and that ""he became emotionally unstable, taking a lot of his frustration out on mum and dad."" To his credit, Mr Britt asked his sister if she could help him seek professional help. She summarises her brother's predicament well in the following terms - 

""Jarrod is not a bad person. He has good morals and I am so upset that Jarrod has done these terrible crimes. This is not like Jarrod at all. Yes, he has had some problems and issues that he has had to face, but nothing that is as serious as the charges he is facing at this time."" 

She clearly is prepared to support her brother.

12Mr Britt's mother also provided a letter which indicated the fact that her son did not cope at all with the news of Grant Odgers' death and that he went into a deep depression with the death of the nephew as well. She says that her son ""is not a lazy boy; he always makes an attempt to gain employment, even if the jobs only last several weeks."" She says that he ""does not believe in receiving unemployment benefit."" She thought that Mr Britt ""has been emotionally unstable for some time now and as his mother I feel that I have let him down by not seeking medical attention sooner."" She noted that he had been diagnosed with ""ADHD and is now taking medication."" Both Mr Britt's mother and sister note regret at committing these crimes. Other referees noted that he has remorse about the crimes that he has committed and regard them as uncharacteristic.

13Mr O'Brien called his client to give evidence. He is prepared to pay the compensation which has been assessed for the damage to the properties which they broke into. His share would be $9000. 

14His father and mother and sister and aunt were in court for his proceedings and his family is back here today. He referred to the impact which the death of those close to him had on him and that he was feeling particularly low when these offences were committed. However, to his credit, he went to see a Dr Spruce, a psychiatrist, a couple of months later. That was referred to in his report by Dr Bench.

15He is presently in full time employment. He is working as a machine operator, bringing home between twelve and fifteen hundred dollars a week, and feels much better. He feels as though he is back on track. He accepts that it is his responsibility for the crime and does not try to blame anybody else. Cross-examined by Ms Wand for the prosecutor, he acknowledged that his lesson had been learned and that he had caught up with the co-offenders, Mr Reuter and Mr Lang, after he came back from Mount Isa where he had been working with his brothers, or at least one brother, and it was the impact of the news of the deaths in the family that brought him back to Sydney. In fact, he met Mr Lang only a week before the crimes. At the stage of the crimes he had been unemployed for some five months. He neither takes drugs nor drink, and is prepared, he confirmed, to pay the compensation.

16Mr O'Brien pointed to Dr Bench's report which links his client's mental health with the commission of the offences, and drew my attention to the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 and the impact which that can have on a sentencing judge. It may be relevant concerning the moral culpability of an offender, as well as whether an offender is an appropriate person for a judge to take into account general deterrence. A custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a person with a mental health condition. I put some weight on those factors, but not very much, because it was really Mr Britt's emotional reaction to the tragic events in his family and his failure to cope which contributed more to the crimes, and the condition was diagnosed in retrospect. He was not diagnosed at the time. Nevertheless, I do take into account the later diagnosis by Dr Bench and that doctor saying it was probably current at the time.

17I accept that Mr Britt was more of a follower and that Mr Lang was the driving force. I accept the references which he has received. I do accept, as Mr O'Brien realistically acknowledged, that the offences were aggravated by being in company; that there was a substantial loss; and that there was planning involving some hours. His record, though, on the other hand is almost negligible. He comes from a good and supportive family, and I regard his prospects of rehabilitation as being good. I regard it as unlikely that he will offend again. I also accept that he has been remorseful.

18He has pleaded guilt at what Ms Wand agreed was the earliest opportunity and should receive a discount of some 25 per cent for his plea of guilty.

19For the reasons I have just listed, I do not regard it as appropriate to impose the standard non-parole period. Mr O'Brien argued that there were four options in sentencing his client - a sentence of full time custody, a suspended sentence, a community service order and an intensive correction order. He said that the last would have the impact on his client of putting his job in jeopardy.

20Ms Wand pointed to the damage to the premises committed in the course of the crimes. Although she submitted that the offences were above the middle of the range of objective seriousness - which may no longer be as significant a concept as previously as a result of the High Court's decision in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 85 ALJR 1154; [2011] HCA 39 - as Mr O'Brien pointed out, Blanch J had found that the offences were below the middle of the range, and I would make the same finding.

21Ms Wand pointed to the planning involved in advance, and acknowledged Mr Britt's remorse. She acknowledged that Mr Lang had the criminal record and was a more serious offender. She queried whether the mental health condition had contributed in a material way, and that is reflected in the observations which I have already made. She argued that the crimes warrant a sentence of imprisonment. She argued that a sentence involving a community service order would involve appellable error. I would agree with her in the sense that I would regard a community service order as too lenient a response two crimes, to each of which Parliament has attached a maximum of 20 years imprisonment, and a standard non-parole period of 5 years.

22I regard a sentence of imprisonment as the only alternative. I regard an appropriate sentence for both crimes as being one of 2 ½ years. That takes into account that Mr Lang received a sentence of 3 years and Mr Britt's sentence should be lower. I am going to apply to the sentence of 2 ½ years the 25 per cent discount which Mr Britt is entitled to because he has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity, thereby saving resources which would otherwise be devoted to his trial. That reduces the overall sentence to one of 22 months, or 1 year and 10 months. I propose to take the unusual course of imposing those sentences concurrently because, although there were two victims, they occurred very close in time.

23In respect of the sentence, I do not regard an order suspending the sentence as appropriate because it is too serious an offence, but I do propose to make it the subject of an intensive corrections order.

HIS HONOUR: I will sentence you now, Mr Britt.

24I am sentencing you to 22 months, that is, 1 year and 10 months imprisonment, but under section 7 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I make an intensive correction order directing that the sentence be served by way of intensive correction in the community. 

HIS HONOUR: Have a seat, Mr Britt. No, hang on; I can't do that until I've got a report, an assessment.

OUTRAM: That's so, your Honour. If there's no report, that's so. Your Honour will have to stand it over for such a report.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. I can't do it.

OUTRAM: I don't know how long they take these days. I would expect something in the order of four to six weeks.

HIS HONOUR: That's right, isn't it, Mr Gabb?

GABB: I'm in your Honour's hands.

HIS HONOUR: I don't think I can-

OUTRAM: I was unaware that there wasn't one.

GABB: No, I wasn't aware.

HIS HONOUR: No, I should have been told that I can't - I mean, that option, which was canvassed by Mr O'Brien, that option was canvassed, but - I mean, I should have remembered myself, but nor was it drawn to my attention that I can't impose such an order without an assessment under section 67 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I think I'm right.

OUTRAM: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Gabb?

GABB: To the best of my knowledge, your Honour, yes. I wasn't here for the sentencing submissions, unfortunately.

HIS HONOUR: No, I know you weren't.

OUTRAM: No, nor was I.

HIS HONOUR: No, you weren't. 

OUTRAM: Your Honour has the option of standing the sentencing proceedings over part heard for that purpose.

HIS HONOUR: I'll have to do it, yes.

OUTRAM: I don't know where your Honour will be sitting in the next couple of months time.

HIS HONOUR: It's under section 69.

OUTRAM: It's 67(1)(b), I think, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: That's right, and then 67(2), I have to have regard to; although 69 says before imposing, I may refer for assessment, 67(2) says that, in deciding whether or not to make an ICO, the Court is to have regard to the contents of a report. So I don't think I can sentence him without that.

OUTRAM: And your Honour needs to be satisfied that he's a suitable person, and that flows from the report.

HIS HONOUR: It flows from the report. I think you're right. All right, that's regrettable. 

25Mr Britt, do you understand? Let me explain. It was my - it is my intention to give you a gaol sentence of 22 months, but to let you serve it in the community. That means you go about your job and where you live and things like that, but the Corrective Services, or Probation and Parole, keep a very tight rein on you. And there are all sorts of conditions, they can come and check on you and stuff, and you have got to do a certain amount of voluntary work. It keeps you out of gaol, keeps you in the community, earning, all those things. But what we have all overlooked is that before I can do that, you have got to be assessed as suitable, and I have to have you assessed. So I am going to make, in a moment, an order for you to be assessed, and then I will have to ask you to come back to court.

HIS HONOUR: And I am going to be away. I could offer you Thursday 5 April. And it will be Sydney.

OUTRAM: Someone can appear, your Honour, for the Crown.

HIS HONOUR: All right. Mr Gabb?

GABB: Is it in Sydney, your Honour? Is that what you're telling us?

HIS HONOUR: It is in Sydney.

GABB: I'll just speak to my client, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, thanks.

GABB: Suitable, your Honour.

26Under section 69(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I refer Mr Britt for assessment as to his suitability for intensive correction in the community. 

HIS HONOUR: And I think that is a reference to the Commissioner for Corrective Services. Now, where does he go? What happens now?

OUTRAM: He reports to Probation and Parole, your Honour. They will do the appropriate paper work.

HIS HONOUR: All right. Where is your nearest--

OFFENDER: Lake Macquarie.

GABB: Lake Macquarie office, your Honour.

27I direct Mr Britt to report to the Probation and Parole office at the Lake Macquarie District office on or before next Tuesday, 21 February 2012 by 5pm. So, Mr Britt, before next Tuesday at 5, between now and next Tuesday at 5, you have got to turn up for-

OUTRAM: Would your Honour make that 4?

HIS HONOUR: Four o'clock. You have got to turn up at the Lake Macquarie Probation - you have been there before, have you?

OFFENDER: Yeah, I've been there probably about three times.

HIS HONOUR: That is what I thought. You have got to turn up there, and do it sooner rather than later, and I have referred you for assessment for an intensive correction order.

OFFENDER: When they asses you, what's that, like--

HIS HONOUR: What do they do?

GABB: I'll explain to him, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, Mr Gabb will explain to you. They take into account all sorts of things.

OFFENDER: Yep.

28All right. Well, that is the order which I make in this case. You can come out of the dock. And you will come back on that date in April. And I stand over the sentence proceedings to Thursday 5 April 2012 before me at 10:00am in Sydney.

GABB: Bail to continue, your Honour.

OUTRAM: No objection to that, your Honour.

29Bail is continued on the same conditions as presently fixed.

		08 May 2012",2012-02-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758638,R v DJY [2012] NSWDC 59,"Judgment


1HIS HONOUR: Last Wednesday the accused was called for trial. He pleaded not guilty to two allegations that he had sexually assaulted the daughter of his de facto partner. The Crown called evidence from the complainant and a police officer. The Crown case was entirely dependent on the evidence of the complainant. No corroboration was presented by the Crown and the accused exercised his right to silence when spoken to by police. The accused did not give evidence in the defence case, but did call evidence from three important witnesses, his de facto partner the complainant's mother, the complainant's younger sister and the accused de facto partner's sister who had visited the location where the events were alleged to have occurred. The evidence of the de facto partner and the complainant's sister contradicted the complainant's evidence in many significant respects. 

2In accordance with authority I directed the jury and warned them about a number of matters that they would have to take into account including, perhaps most importantly, that the Crown case depended on a single witness, that the delay in complaining may indicate untruthfulness, (although it may need not necessarily do so) and finally that the delay in bringing the matters to the attention of the accused hampered his preparation for trial. There was a subsidiary matter also concerning whether the Crown had proved one of the elements of count 2.

3The jury acquitted the accused on both counts after a relatively short deliberation. It is clear that they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant gave evidence on which they could rely.

4An application is now made under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act. In helpful submissions Ms Kluss has summarised the principles of law, and referred to appellate court summaries of the principles which a judge should apply when dealing with such an application. What I am required to do is to consider the position of a hypothetical prosecutor, one in possession of all the facts put before the jury, together with any other matters tendered on the application. In that regard Ms Kluss has tendered statements from the complainant's mother, who, I repeat, is the accused's de facto partner, and also from one of the accused's natural children who has made allegations against him. I then look at whether, if the prosecution had evidence of all of those facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted, it would have been reasonable to institute the proceedings.

5The default position, as I have described it in earlier judgments, is that costs are not awarded after an acquittal. Oftentimes accused people expend considerable sums of money defending themselves, and ultimately, on a large number of occasions, not guilty verdicts are returned. It could be a policy position taken by government, albeit it an expensive one, that those found not guilty are automatically paid their costs. The legislature has not taken that position. Instead it seems to be accepted that the fact that innocent people will suffer financial loss in defending themselves is the price that we pay for living in a society where disputes as to whether serious criminal offences have been committed are usually resolved in courts in public, rather than by a prosecutor in private. But of course in circumstances where an applicant, a former accused, overcomes the burden placed on him under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, a certificate should be awarded in that person's favour.

6Of course the legislation has a beneficial purpose, its provision should therefore not be narrowly construed. Nor should I take into account any suggestion that it is sometimes better to ""clear the air"". Also there are significant differences between questions such as whether there was a prima facie case, whether a conviction would be unreasonable and the test that I have to apply at the present stage. Ultimately it is of course a matter for an individual trial judge's judgment as to whether the institution of proceedings by a hypothetical prosecutor would have been reasonable.

7The appellate courts provide some guidance. For example in R v Manley [2000] NSWCCA 196; (2000) NSWLR 203 Wood CJ at CL said:

""Given the wide variety of cases that might arise for consideration I am...reluctant to attempt any exhaustive definition of the test. It seems to me that the section calls for an objective analysis of the whole of the relevant evidence and particularly the extent to which there is any contradiction of expert evidence concerning central facts necessary to establish guilt or inherent weaknesses in a prosecution case.""

8I interpolate here that Justice Wood refers to expert evidence in particular in the case of Manley because Manley was a case where expert evidence was crucially important and the accused at trial was relying on contradictory expert evidence, but the important part of what Wood CJ at CL said appears after that passage I have just quoted. His Honour continues:

""Matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of unreasonableness being matters quintessentially within the realm of the trier of fact, whether it be judge or jury.""

9A hypothetical prosecutor knows that the complainant's evidence was contradicted in many respects, in particular by both her mother and sister. Those contradictions concerned matters such as whether the accused had ever thrown an iron at his wife. The complainant said that occurred and relied on that as evidence relevant to the question of why she did not complain about these matters until many years after she alleged they occurred. Both the person to whom the iron was directed allegedly, the complainant's mother, and the person who the complainant said was also there, that is the complainant's sister, denied that such an event ever occurred. The way in which the complainant's mother answered a question about this issue in her evidence certainly raised the possibility that she had rehearsed her response, but it could not be denied that it was very important to an assessment of the complainant's credibility that both her mother and her sister denied the occurrence of what would otherwise have been a very memorable event.

10Other matters concerning opportunity were dealt with by evidence called in the defence case. This was relevant of course not only to whether the two events occurred the subject of the indictment, but also to whether the complainant's evidence of repeated and regular sexual assaults could be accepted. As I told the jury, in assessing the complainant's credibility one of the matters they should look at was whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had regularly sexually assaulted her in the manner she described. Thus although the hypothetical prosecutor might think that given the evidence the prosecutor is aware of now, there would be opportunity to commit the two offences on the indictment, the hypothetical prosecutor might have a bit more difficulty in accepting that there would be opportunity for such regular but uncharged sexual assaults.

11A significant matter relied on by Ms Kluss, both before the jury in the trial and before me on this costs application concerns a question of timing. The complainant gave evidence that the matters on the indictment and the uncharged acts all occurred before the accused's daughter came to live with them. The evidence would suggest that the accused's daughter came to live with the family a year before the complainant said she did. Thus according to the date specified in the indictment, if time were of the essence, the Crown would have been in difficulty for that reason alone. But time was not of the essence. The jury would have convicted the accused if they accepted the complainant's reliability beyond reasonable doubt, even if they thought it possible or even likely or even certain that the events occurred a year earlier than the date range specified in the indictment.

12I cannot see that the circumstance that the complainant may have got things out by a year has much at all to say about her reliability as to whether the events occurred or not in the first place. She was after all not even a teenager at the time of the relevant events and it would not be at all surprising for her to be accurate as to the occurrence of the events, but inaccurate as to when they occurred.

13Another matter which has been raised in the course of submissions concerns the circumstance that the accused did not give evidence, nor did he answer questions put to him by police when he was arrested. Of course he had that right. He has the right to silence and he has the right, as I told the jury, to remain silent in court, but when the hypothetical prosecutor considers all the evidence that the hypothetical prosecutor has, the hypothetical prosecutor is entitled to take into account that he or she does not have anything from the accused, when making the decision as to whether it is reasonable to institute proceedings and when I make the decision as to whether the hypothetical prosecutor should have instituted proceedings. It cannot be pretended that there exists, something which does not exist that is a version given by the accused. 

14I should mention one other significant aspect of the evidence in the trial which the hypothetical prosecutor now knows about. It would not be surprising for a person who had been sexually assaulted by her mother's de facto partner to want to distance herself from that person but there is evidence, which the hypothetical prosecutor now knows about, (of course the hypothetical prosecutor is to be taken as having known about it before proceedings were instituted) regarding cards and a gift given by the complainant to the accused. In those cards she expresses her love. In the cards she refers to him on one occasion as dad and on another occasion as pa and a third occasion I think as her father. She gave the accused a lighter, as I said to the jury it is one matter to buy a lighter for someone as a gift but it is an extra step to have it engraved an yet even a further step to have the words ""lots of love"" engraved on the gift. The complainant's explanation for the cards and gifts is that she was trying to keep her mother happy. Her natural father had left the marital home after having affairs and she gave evidence that in those circumstances her mother was effectively the only parent she had. Once more there was evidence as to whether this was a proper categorisation of the complainant's relationship with her natural father and no doubt the jury were able to use their experience of life and commonsense in assessing the explanation of the cards and gift offered by the complainant. The point I wish to make for present purposes is that the complainant had an explanation for those matters, which at first blush would be thought to be inconsistent with the proposition that she had been sexually assaulted by the accused. 

15Some cost cases are easy, I have on occasion refused certificates and I have on occasion granted certificates. This matter I think is finely balanced, but even given the difficulties that have been identified with the credibility of the complainant it was always ultimately going to be a question as to whether she would appear as credible, her demeanour was a matter of great importance and as Wood CJ at CL, matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially within the realm of the trier of fact, whether it be judge or jury.

16The complainant gave evidence which was not inherently unbelievable and more importantly as regards many aspects of her description of the events had the ring of truth. I know this is not the test but were there no defence case I would not have at all been surprised for the accused to have been found guilty. As I say I know that is not the test but I use that as a way of illustrating my assessment of the demeanour of the complainant both in evidence-in-chief and in cross-examination, a matter of course that the hypothetical prosecutor knows about. That there were matters contradictory of her, both in the defence case before the jury and in statements tendered today is clearly a matter which would give the hypothetical prosecutor some pause and some cause for concern. But there were explanations for those contradictory matters which were themselves not inherently unbelievable. To take but one example the complainant's evidence that she wished to keep in good with her mother and that was why she referred to the accused in the way she did is a matter which is easily capable of acceptance. Other matters contradictory of the complainant's evidence can be dealt with in a similar way.

17For those reasons I decline the application to grant a certificate under the Costs and Criminal Cases Act.

		21 May 2012",2012-02-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758651,R v Pankhurst [2012] NSWDC 165,"Judgment


1The offender pleaded guilty to two offences:

(1)An offence against s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 that on 10 April 2010 at Cougal she wounded Jarrod McShane with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm (by stabbing);

(2)An offence against s 35 of the Crimes Act 1900 that on 10 April 2010 at Cougal while in company she recklessly caused grievous bodily harm to Mr McShane (a broken left jaw occasioned by kicking Mr McShane). 


2The first offence carries a maximum available term of imprisonment of twenty-five years and a standard non-parole period of seven years. The second offence carries a maximum available penalty of fourteen years and a standard non-parole period of five years. The maximum available penalties and the standard non-parole periods provide very important sentencing guideposts or parameters. 

3The facts were described in the sentencing remarks made in relation to the co-offenders, Shane Hurst and A, a child at the date of the offences. Briefly, the facts relevant to this offender are that, on the afternoon of 9 April 2010, the victim and the three offenders travelled to Brisbane in the victim's BMW motor vehicle, intending to meet with Mr Hurst's associates in the Queen Street Mall in Brisbane so that Mr Hurst could buy drugs. The drug vendors did not attend. Their failure to do so was attributed to some wrongdoing on the part of the victim. 

4Leaving central Brisbane, the group drove to a suburb where the offender met with some people. The offender allegedly told one of those people that the group was intending to ""set up"" the victim. There is a dispute about the contents of the conversation. I do not find the alleged words were said by the offender. The relevant witness was not called. However, as with the other offenders, I find that, when the group left Brisbane, the offender and co-offenders believed that something untoward would or may well occur on the return journey by way of dealing with the victim for his alleged failure to ""deliver"" in relation to the drug transaction. As to whether there was a firm plan to occasion serious harm to the victim, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such an intent was formed significantly prior to the time when the harm was actually occasioned. 

5The group drove to an isolated area that overlooks a section of rail known as the Border Loop. The group remained there for a total period of about an hour. They saw a train pass through and talked to two couples, who were the only other people who visited the location during the period that the offenders were present at the Border Loop. 

6After the offenders had been there for quite some time and the couples had well and truly left the scene, the victim began to feel uneasy. He became keen to leave the area. Mr Hurst said that he wanted to have a discussion with the victim. Mr Hurst and the victim walked away from the vehicle in which A and the offender were then located. Mr Hurst had a conversation with the victim. As the victim and Mr Hurst were walking back towards the car, Mr Hurst stabbed the victim in the back twice, and then kicked him to the ground and began kicking him around the head and body. 

7A and the offender then came over to where the victim was located on the ground. A willingly participated in further kicking the victim, and she stabbed him at least twice. According to the victim (whose account of events is generally consistent with what the various offenders have said at various stages), the offender spoke to the victim and expressed her dissatisfaction with the fact that he had rejected her in a sexual way. She proceeded to kick the victim in the head and testicles. A then passed the knife to the offender and encouraged her to stab the victim, stating, ""It's just like stabbing a chicken."" The offender delivered a stab to the victim's left side. 

8In all, the victim sustained six stab wounds. Inferentially, the wound to the left chest area was delivered by the offender. The other five stab wounds were to the back. With one exception, the wounds were relatively shallow, point five to two centimetres in depth. A deep wound of about three to five centimetres in depth was delivered to the back. It was not delivered by the offender. However, the case is one of joint criminal enterprise, and the offender has pleaded guilty on that basis. The victim also suffered significant bruises and abrasions when he was dragged around on the bitumen surface of the car park at Border Loop. When he was kicked and punched in the left jaw, he suffered a fracture. It is unclear who delivered that kick or punch. The Crown case in that regard is one of joint criminal enterprise. 

9Through most of the episode, the victim feared for his life. The attack lasted for a considerable period. The victim was pleading to be saved. He was taunted primarily by A. Mr Hurst also made very cruel statements. From what A and Mr Hurst said, they were motivated to attack the victim because the victim had breached the code of ""three Rs"", being respect, revenge and reputation. Mr Hurst and A considered that the victim had sullied the reputation of Mr Hurst in Brisbane drug dealing circles. 

10After the lengthy assault on the victim, A made the statement, ""finish him"" or words to that effect. The offender and Mr Hurst proceeded to push or pull the victim to a steep embankment next to the car park, and they pushed him down the embankment. As he was lying at the bottom of the embankment, the victim thought that he might die because of the extent of his injuries, but he was obliged to remain there for a long time, until he felt certain that the car containing the offenders had departed. He then managed to make his way up the embankment and he walked for some kilometres until he found a dwelling. The occupant took him to the police and he was then conveyed to hospital.

11In relation to the offender's role, she was the last one to engage in any physical assault on the victim. She had her own motive for assaulting him, which was rejection. She stabbed him only once and only when encouraged by A to do so. She also delivered kicks to the head and the testicles, and assisted to drag the victim to the edge of the embankment. 

12When the offender spoke to police on 10 April, she provided a relatively accurate account of what had occurred, but she minimised her own role. She said that she did not stab the victim and she suggested that, to the extent that she did participate, she was under duress from Mr Hurst and A. Later, she informed a psychologist that she had ""blanked out"" in relation to the stabbing. I take this to mean that her recollection of what she did had become blocked because she was horrified by her conduct. She could not have ""blanked out"" at the time because the delivery of a stab wound is something that is specific and one would need to be thinking about it in order it to do it. 

13Fortunately, the victim made an excellent physical recovery. He provided a victim impact statement which refers to a number of very serious psychological consequences. One would expect that any person subjected to such a horrific assault over an extended period of time in an isolated location, and who was then obliged to walk for some distance not knowing whether he would find help and believing that he may die, would suffer from very serious psychological sequelae. That has been the case with this victim. 

14The offender advances very strong subjective circumstances. She is twenty-one years of age. She was nineteen at the date of the offence. A was seventeen and Mr Hurst was twenty at the date of the offence. The offender was raised in the Port Macquarie area on a dairy farm. When she was thirteen or fourteen years of age, the family moved to the Casino area and the offender's parents commenced a cattle freight business. The offender attended Casino High School and had some difficulty fitting in. She became rebellious, fell in with a poor peer group, and began to use alcohol and drugs extensively. She has had an alcohol problem since that time. By the time that she left school in Year 11, she was a very heavy cannabis user. 

15Despite these problems, since fourteen years of age the offender has always worked long hours, supporting herself. She has a very strong work ethic. She has worked in takeaway and retail establishments. She is a qualified barista and has a retail certificate. 

16After leaving school, the offender left home for a brief period and moved to Brisbane, where she lived with an aunty. She was trying to make a break with her peer group and settle down. However, about twelve months later, she returned to Casino to be with her close and supportive family. The unfortunate consequence of returning to Casino was that she fell in with her former associates, including the co-offenders. 

17Immediately after the incident, the offender became extremely remorseful and upset about her conduct. The offender said that she ""blanked out"" in relation to the stabbing. That is probably because she was emotionally upset by what had occurred. The offender was contemplating suicide. She wrote a suicide note to her mother. On the morning after the incident, she resigned from work, possibly because she was going to commit suicide, or possibly just because she could not face work. Her immediate post-incident conduct is consistent with her feeling extremely upset; deeply remorseful and horrified at her own behaviour. 

18Since the incident, the offender has been on strict bail, at first reporting six days a week and later reporting four days a week. Initially, her bail conditions prevented her from leaving her parents' premises unless she was in their company. She spent one day in custody. 

19Recently, the offender's family moved from Casino to Queensland. The offender has been working in Queensland. Initially, she had difficulty sleeping. She was ""paranoid"" and very stressed. Since the move to Queensland (which has provided some geographic removal from the area of the incident and from people who know about the incident), she has felt somewhat better. However, she remains anxious and stressed about what occurred. 

20The psychological evidence describes the offender as someone who is very sensitive to interpersonal rejection, who is vulnerable, and who seeks acceptance and approval from others. Those characteristics would have contributed to her involvement in the offence. Mr Hurst and A were a couple. The offender would have felt emotional pressure to join in. It was a way to gain acceptance by Mr Hurst and A. Her emotional immaturity lead her to become involved with the co-offenders and to feel pressured to engage in the activities in question. Having said that, she had her own motive for some of the activities in which she engaged. She was not just a passive bystander. Rather, she was actively involved in stabbing, kicking and pushing the victim down the embankment. 

21The offender has an ongoing problem of binge drinking. She needs assistance with that. She has provided references, which show that she is very strongly attached to and emotionally dependent on her family, who provide her with great support. Generally, she is a person of very good character. Since the offence, she has become involved in charity functions organised through the North Coast Truck Drivers Association, an organisation with which her parents are involved. She comes from a very good family. 

22The Crown submits that a discount of fifteen to twenty per cent would be appropriate. Mr Kumarasinhe argues for a greater discount on the basis of the information and co-operation evident in the initial interview with the police, where the offender provided a good deal of accurate information about what had occurred on the night in question. However, in the initial interview, the offender also sought to exonerate herself from any serious wrongdoing. The plea was only entered after the matters had been listed for trial. A discount of fifteen per cent or perhaps a little more is a relatively generous discount. That is the discount that I intend to give. 

23You are convicted of these matters. In relation to the less serious matter under s 35, the starting point for the sentence is a sentence of two years, which I have discounted by fifteen per cent to a sentence of twenty-one months. The minimum period that you should spend in custody is a period of seventeen months. You are sentenced to a non-parole period from 15 February 2012 to 14 July 2013, with a balance of term of four months. The sentence will expire on 14 November 2013. I have partly accumulated the other sentence. The starting point for the sentence on the more serious matter is three years imprisonment, which I have discounted by a little over fifteen per cent to arrive at a sentence of thirty months imprisonment. I am accumulating it by five months. The sentence will commence on 15 July 2012. The non-parole period will expire on 14 July 2013, a non-parole period of twelve months. The balance of the term will expire on 14 January 2016. That represents an effective sentence of two years and eleven months with an effective non-parole period of seventeen months. In relation to the matter on the s 166 certificate, you are convicted and sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of four months from 15 February 2012 to 14 June 2012.

24I make a recommendation (which should be noted on the warrant) that the offender be transported to a women's detention centre in Sydney as soon as possible, and Corrective Services should avoid housing her at Grafton Prison if at all possible.

		03 October 2012",2012-02-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758655,R v Clarissa BURROW [2012] NSWDC 61,"SENTENCE


1Clarissa Burrow is still only 33. She came out of a long term relationship some years ago. Until then she had practically no criminal record apart from a drink driving offence. But since her mid to late twenties, has accumulated a large number of convictions which reflected her disordered drug addicted lifestyle. The convictions were usually for matters to do with goods in custody or possession of drugs and were dealt with by the Local Court. However I am sentencing her today, in the District Court, for a far more serious crime. 

2She has pleaded guilty to the crime of conspiracy to manufacture a prohibited drug, namely methyl-amphetamine, in an amount not less than the commercial quantity. That is an offence against s 24(2) and s 26 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and Parliament regards the crime as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to the crime. I formally convict her of that crime. 

3It is important for a judge to say little about what behaviour an offender engaged in to amount to the crime so that it can be seen what basis the judge has for sentencing the offender. 

4In this case, Ms Burrow had just come out of the long term relationship. She met up with a man named Craig McGregor. Craig McGregor at that stage was also leading a disordered and drug affected life. He was using his residential unit as an amateur laboratory for manufacturing or attempting to manufacture methyl-amphetamine. He was in an arrangement with a man named Brett Staas. 

5What Ms Burrow has pleaded guilty to is joining in that arrangement with Mr Staas and Mr McGregor, at a stage later that when they started. She has pleaded guilty to agreeing with them to manufacture methyl-amphetamine in a commercial quantity. 

6Her role is set out in the statement of facts, which is part of exhibit A and also helpfully summarised by Mr S Littlemore QC, in his written submissions. I regard as accurate his reference to her as essentially a gofer in assisting in the process of the manufacture. She did a lot of running around for Craig McGregor, sourcing and obtaining the materials which he needed to manufacture the drug back in his unit. At one stage she even joined Mr McGregor in breaking into an abandoned technical college to steal laboratory equipment. She was also used as a conduit between Mr Staas and Mr McGregor so far as communications were concerned. Mr McGregor was not reliable because of his drug taking habits and often the communications between the two men would occur through Ms Burrow. 

7I accept also that Ms Burrow joined the conspiracy because of her personal use of the drug and she was kept supplied by Mr McGregor with quantities of that drug for her personal use.

8It is acknowledged in the statement of facts that ultimately little methyl-amphetamine was in fact produced, partly because the chemicals were not the right ones. No one involved in the process was a qualified chemist. 

9Mr M L Barr, of counsel, who appears as Crown Prosecutor adopts the description used in the statement of facts that Ms Burrow's position in the conspiracy ""is at the lower end of the spectrum"". She ""took no part in the actual manufacture nor did she have the capacity or skills with chemicals to take part in the manufacturing process"". Her role was limited to getting various chemicals and other help which I have referred to. 

HIS HONOUR: I am just going to depart from my remarks on sentence for a moment and ask Mr Barr and you your instructing solicitor and Mr Littlemore see if you could agree - which I have not yet done - when the sentence should date from. In other words what is 1 year, 6 months, 2 weeks and 6 days back from today. So I will come back to that. I now resume my remarks on sentence. 

10There is included in exhibit A, an extensive induced statement provided by Ms Burrow to the police. I have very limited information about Ms Burrow's personal factors. The only information I have evidence of are her criminal convictions and her movements in custody, apart from the extensive statement which she provided to the police. However her criminal record supports the submission put by Mr Littlemore QC, that her life fell apart in a significant way in her mid to late twenties when the long term relationship broke down and she linked up with Mr McGregor. 

11Ms Burrow entered her plea of guilty on 7 November last year but, as I said, had given a lengthy statement to the police about a year after her arrest. The statement commenced on 10 May 2010 and it extended over some time. 

12There was a committal proceeding which was controversial only in a limited way. I have been provided with confidential exhibit B which I have read and taken into account. I have marked it not to be opened except by order of a judge of the District Court or a higher court and I will ask my associate to seal that with tape at a convenient time and place it with the Court papers. 

13The offence was committed by Ms Burrow when she already had on her criminal record various offences including offences relating to the possession or consumption of drugs and crimes associated with that habit. As Mr Littlemore QC pointed out, those offences did not relate to manufacturing drugs. However, she was also on various good behaviour bonds when she committed the offence that I am sentencing her for. 

14I accept that she is remorseful. That is clearly evidenced by the statement which she has provided. I do not have sufficient evidence to find that she is unlikely to re-offend or that her prospects of rehabilitation are good. I am told that she saw a psychologist readily but that she has since ceased seeing that psychologist. I note the absence of any psychological material regarding Ms Burrow. 

15The fact that a person pleads guilty by law is taken into account when they are sentenced. For a plea of guilty at the earliest available opportunity, the Court usually allows a discount of 25 per cent on the sentence because of the resources which are saved by the person pleading guilty instead of going to trial. Mr Littlemore QC urges me to make the full allowance of 25 per cent. Mr Barr suggests that a range of 15 to 20 per cent is appropriate because the plea was not at the earliest available opportunity and there was a committal which was contested in a limited way. I propose to allow a discount which will combine the plea of guilty and the subject of confidential exhibit B, in the region of 28 per cent overall. 

16Ms Burrow has been in custody in relation to this offence for 1 year, 6 months, 2 weeks and 6 days and in due course when I come to sentence her, I will backdate the sentence to commence that period of time before today, to take into account the time that she has already served relating to this offence. 

17On 17 February this year, I sentenced Mr McGregor. He was convicted of manufacturing methyl-amphetamine being an indictable amount. In my remarks on sentence, I record that I allowed him a discount of 20 per cent for his plea of guilty and sentenced him to 4 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years. He was far more extensively involved in the manufacturing process than was Ms Burrow. On the other hand, the crime to which Ms Burrow has pleaded guilty is more serious and carries a higher maximum penalty than the crime that Mr McGregor was convicted of. 

18I take into account that the attempted manufacture of methyl-amphetamine in this case did not produce much methyl-amphetamine. There was a conspiracy but it was not a very productive conspiracy. It was not a sophisticated or complex operation compared to some. It is acknowledged that Ms Burrow's role was at the low end, so far as the participants are concerned. I accept that she was vulnerable and drug addicted when she joined in the conspiracy.

19I would regard an appropriate sentence initially as one of 4 years imprisonment. I will discount that by some 14 months, namely 28 per cent, and I regard the appropriate sentence to impose as one of 34 months or 2 years and 10 months.

20Normally a non-parole period fixed for such a sentence would be 75 per cent, about 25 months in this case. However I propose to reduce that slightly to 22 months which is a reduction of about one-third. I do not really have a basis for finding extensive special circumstances to reduce that non-parole period any further. Accordingly the non-parole period will be 22 months or 1 year and 10 months and the head overall sentence will be 34 months or 2 years and 10 months.

21I set a non-parole period of 1year and 10 months commencing 1 October 2010 and expiring on 1 August 2012. The balance of the sentence is 12 months to commence on 2 August 2012 and to expire on 1 August 2013. So your overall sentence is 34 months, that is, 2 years and 10 months. Of that you must serve a minimum of 1 year and 10 months and the earliest date on which it appears to me that you would be eligible for release is 1 August 2012.

22This is less than 3 years so I order Ms Burrow's release under s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order directing the release of Ms Burrow on parole on 1 August 2012.

HIS HONOUR: Ms Burrow, I have made an order directing your release. That depends upon whether you are in custody on other matters because my order may not be effective if you are in custody on other matters, but I have directed your release then. Now, I should fix some conditions of parole. Good behaviour, supervision by Probation and Parole Service, come to court if called upon to do so, change of address and supervision, reasonable recommendations and directions particularly regarding drug rehabilitation, I assume.

23The conditions of your parole are these:
(1)That you be of good behaviour;
(2)That if you receive a notice to attend court that you attend court;
(3)That you inform the Parole Authority of any change in your address;
(4)That you agree to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service and accept all reasonable recommendations and directions which they may have, particularly regarding drug rehabilitation.

		07 May 2012",2012-02-19 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758660,DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Whealy JA and with his Honour's reasons, and make the following additional comments. 

2Subsection s 98(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) provides as follows: 

""98(1) Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless: 

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and 

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value."" 

3Whilst probative value is defined in the dictionary to the Act in the following terms: 

""probative value of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue."" 

4I have set out the relevant provisions of the Act because the issues raised in the appeal depend upon the application of its requirements: cf Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21 at [37]. 

5There are a number of matters that should be noted about s 98(1). 

6First, its provisions will only fall for consideration if the evidence in question is relevant. That is in terms of s 55 of the Act it could rationally affect the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. 

7Second, it requires the Court to form a view, ""think"", that the evidence had significant probative value, that is, that the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue to a significant extent. 

8Third, it follows from the use of the word could in the definition of significant probative value that what the Court is required to assess is the possibility of the evidence affecting the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. It is not required to assess whether the evidence would have this effect, that is, engage in a fact-finding exercise involving an assessment of the reliability and credibility of the evidence: cf R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 226 at [59]-[67]. 

9Fourth, the matters to which the Court is to have regard in performing this task is the evidence sought to be adduced either on its own or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to tender it. In particular, regard is not to be had to evidence either adduced or to be adduced by the other party to the proceedings. This also demonstrates, in my opinion, that it is no part of the Court's task to engage in a fact-finding exercise to determine the reliability or credibility of the evidence, or to form a view one way or the other whether the jury would in fact find the evidence to be of significant probative value. 

10However, as Whealy JA has pointed out (at [78]-[81]), the trial judge in forming a view as to whether the evidence has significant probative value must consider by reference to the evidence itself or other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party tendering it, whether there is a real possibility of an alternate explanation inconsistent with (in this case) the guilt of the party against whom it is tendered. This is because the availability of such an alternative hypothesis will be relevant to forming the view required by the section that the evidence has significant probative value. However, this does not involve either undertaking the fact-finding analysis suggested by senior counsel for DSJ or reaching a conclusion that the explanation for the coincidence proffered by the party seeking to tender the evidence was more probable than an alternative hypothesis. Each of these approaches go beyond what is required by the terms of s 98(1)(b) of the Act and would involve the judge usurping the fact-finding role of the jury. 

11ALLSOP P: I have read the reasons of Whealy JA. Subject to the following, I agree with his reasons. I agree with the orders proposed. I appreciate the reasons for, and importance of, the reconciliation of my reasons in DAO v R ([2011] NSWCCA 63; (2011) 278 ALR 765) with those of Simpson J in R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437, 158 A Crim R 504. I accept his reconciliation of our views. It is important, as Whealy JA recognises, that there be no misunderstanding about the task of the judge. It is his or her task to assess the capacity of the evidence in the manner described by Whealy JA, not to assess what a jury will do. I also agree with the additional comments of the Chief Justice. 

12WHEALY JA: On 9 September 2011, the Court of Criminal Appeal (Allsop P, Kirby and McCallum JJ) granted leave to appeal to DSJ and NS against a pre-trial order made by Hall J on 23 August 2011 dismissing their application to have a number of the charges in the indictment presented against them tried separately. 

13The two men had been charged with insider trading offences under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act). DSJ was charged with 10 counts pursuant to s 1043A(1)(d) of the Act. NS was charged with 10 counts pursuant to s 1043A(1)(c). In essence, the charges against DSJ alleged that he was an insider, that he possessed inside information, and that, contrary to the legislation, he procured NS to apply for, acquire or dispose of relevant products being shares or securities. The charges against NS allege that he had possession of the insider information given him by DSJ and that he intentionally acquired the financial products particularised in the indictment. The products were either shares or activity in relation to seven listed companies. 

14In shorthand terms, the Crown case was described in its early submissions as follows: 

There was a scheme in place whereby NSJ would obtain inside or confidential information through the opportunity afforded by his employment at Moody's. He would then pass it on to his trusted friend NS, whom he had recruited to purchase shares - securities in the circumstances pleaded. Each of the counts in the indictment represents an instance of the scheme in action. The fact that 10 separate charges have been laid against each accused ought not to distract from what is the central allegation of the Crown and that is that there was a scheme in place whereby NSJ would pass the relevant information onto his recruit, NS, in the circumstances alleged in the charges. The Crown case is circumstantial. It is the Crown case that taken together, each pair of charges represents the scheme in action. 

15It was the Crown's intention to lead coincidence evidence at the trial. It sought to do so on the basis that the evidence relating to each individual count in the indictment should be admitted and available as evidence in respect of each other count. The Crown had served a notice of coincidence evidence on 25 February 2011. This expressly stated that the evidence was to be adduced for the purpose of establishing that each of the accused did the acts alleged against him in the indictment and that each had the required state of mind on the basis that, having regard to the similarity of the events, it was improbable that the events occurred coincidently. This course was necessary because of the coincidence rule provisions in s 98 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). 

16Each accused filed a notice of motion on 11 March 2011 seeking, in effect, orders that the question of admissibility of the Crown's coincidence evidence be determined in advance of the trial, and that an order be made that it ought not be admitted. Further, an order was sought pursuant to s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), that the charges in the indictment (other than charges 6-9) be tried separately. 

17It was accepted during the pre-trial hearing that the separate trial issue was interdependent upon the coincidence evidence issue. In other words, it was accepted that the question of the severance of the counts essentially turned upon whether the Crown should be permitted, in relation to each individual count, to rely upon the evidence it sought to tender in proof of each other count and vice versa. This, in turn, depended on whether the coincidence evidence was admissible. The applicants sought to fragment the trial in the sense that they sought orders that there should be a joint trial of the two accused but limited to the counts relating to each of the individual entities in which securities were traded. For example, counts 1 and 11, it was submitted, should be heard separately from counts 2 and 12 and so on. 

18In its original submissions before Hall J, the purpose of the coincidence notice (in relation to DSJ) was stated by the Crown to be as follows: 

The evidence of the two or more related events is to be tendered to prove DSJ did the particular acts alleged in each of counts 1-10 in the indictment, namely, that he procured NS to acquire the relevant ... financial products identified in each count in the indictment. The evidence of the two or more related events is also to be tendered to prove that DSJ had a particular state of mind, namely, that at the time he procured NS to acquire the relevant ... financial products ... he acted intentionally and was in possession of the inside information as particularised ... 

Conversely, the Crown submits that the evidence will rebut any suggestion that the contacts between DSJ and NS were merely coincidental. 

19A similar submission was made in relation to NS, his acts being the acquisition of the relevant financial products, and his state of mind being that he acted intentionally and was in possession of the inside information. Once again the Crown submitted that, in each case against NS, the evidence would rebut any suggestion that the contact between the two men was merely coincidental. 

20The substance of the coincidence evidence against each accused was set out in a document described as ""Table A"" of the Crown's Coincidence Notice. The combined course of conduct, alleged to have been an intended course of conduct, was compartmentalised into seven ""events"" as follows: 

(1) The receipt by Moody's of information from or concerning seven corporate entities the subject of the charges, being ""inside information"". 

(2) DSJ's direct receipt of inside information in some instances and indirect receipt of information in others. 

(3) Telephone communications between DSJ and NS by which the Crown alleged that the former communicated inside information to the latter, thereby procuring NS to trade while in possession of the inside information. 

(4) NS's acquisition of the financial products in the seven entities whilst in possession of the inside information. 

(5) An announcement made to the market or an event occurred that pre-empted the transaction. 

(6) NS's trading out of his position in the seven entities. 

(7) DSJ's significant surveillance of the share price in the entities traded in by NS, usually on CommSec, throughout the material time. 

The hearing before the trial Judge 

21The hearing of the pre-trial application turned into something of a marathon. It extended over some five days before the trial Judge and required him to assimilate very extensive written submissions. On 17 August 2011 his Honour ruled that the evidence particularised in the Table to the notice of coincidence evidence, being Table A, was admissible pursuant to s 98(1)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995. On 23 August 2011, mindful of the fact that the parties wished to appeal his decision but that such an appeal depended upon there having been ""an interlocutory judgment or order""; Hall J made an order in the following terms: 

The applications by the accused in their respective notices of motion filed on 11 March 2011 for an order pursuant to s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 that the charges in the indictment, other than charges 6-9, be tried separately, is dismissed. 

22Hall J noted the position of the parties before him, in that they had proceeded on the basis that the admissibility of evidence question had been understood as essentially determining the application for the orders for a separate trial of particular counts. 

The leave application 

23As I have previously indicated, leave to appeal was granted on 9 September 2011. There were a number of matters argued on the leave application. However, leave was granted on a limited basis. The decision of the Court was given by Allsop P (with whom Kirby and McCallum JJ agreed) in these terms: 

The approach to s 98 by his Honour is one in respect of which, in my view, leave should be given. The matter is an important one to the operation of a provision relating to many aspects of the operation of both the criminal law and the civil law and the arguments raised are real, and without expressing any view one way or the other as to the correctness of his Honour's views, in my view, it is appropriate that leave be granted in relation to the interpretation and application of s 98. 

24Allsop P indicated that the leave granted should be limited to the ground of Hall J's approach to the interpretation and application of s 98 and, to the extent that that fed through, to the operation of s 101 in both matters. 

Submissions on appeal 

25The written submissions in this Court are, as they were before the trial Judge, very lengthy. Moreover, Mr McHugh SC for DSJ and Mr Odgers SC for NS have markedly different approaches to the interpretation of s 98. There is, of course, an element of overlap but Mr Odgers' submissions suggest a more radical approach to the interpretation of s 98. The submissions, however, may be substantially distilled into a number of discrete propositions. I shall turn to Mr Odgers' submissions first. 

26Mr Odgers argued that the trial Judge had made the following errors of principle: 

(a) The trial Judge erred in following the holding of Simpson J (Buddin J agreeing) in R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437, 158 A Crim R 504 at [139] that a trial Judge, in applying the test of significant probative value in s 98 is ""to evaluate in the light of any evidence already adduced, and evidence that is anticipated, the likelihood that the jury would assign the evidence significant (in the sense explained by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457) probative value"". 

(b) The trial Judge erred at [64] in holding that there is no requirement for the purpose of a ruling on admissibility under s 98 ""to determine the existence and weight to be given to inferences that may be considered as alternative or inconsistent with those relied upon by the Crown by analysing parts or segments of evidence in a circumstantial evidence case"". 

(c) The trial Judge erred at [206] in rejecting a submission made on behalf of NS that a determination whether coincidence evidence has ""significant probative value"" for the purpose of s 98(1)(b) requires the Court to ""evaluate whether it could rationally be concluded that the probability of the inference the Crown seeks to draw is significantly greater than the probability of an inference inconsistent with that fact"". 

27Mr McHugh, as I have indicated, pursued a more conservative approach. Mr McHugh's first submission was that the trial Judge in making the assessment required under s 98, ought to have taken into account the possibility of alternative inferences arising from the evidence. This proposition suggested that the Court's task, if Zhang were correctly decided, was to take the evidence at its highest and then form its own view about the strength of the probative value of the evidence. Secondly, Mr McHugh took this proposition a step further by suggesting that the task required of the Court was to make its own comparative assessment of the probabilities or, put differently, to determine the relative strength of the alternative theories to assess whether the Crown theory had significant value. In this regard, it was necessary to take into account the availability and strength of inferences to be found in the Crown evidence other than those sought to be relied on by the Crown. Senior counsel submitted that the trial Judge had fallen into error in that he eschewed altogether any consideration or proper assessment of the probability of alternative theories. He had to weigh up the Crown's theory, examine the alternative theories, and ask himself - what are the probabilities? He had erroneously determined that this last step was unnecessary. 

28Subject to one qualification, Mr McHugh did not submit that Zhang was wrongly decided but rather that Hall J had not appropriately applied it to the circumstances of the present case. The qualification was this: if Simpson J's decision, when correctly construed, abrogated the obligation of the Judge to make the relevant assessment in favour of the jury, it was to that extent incorrect. 

The Crown response 

29In its written submissions, the Crown agreed with the submissions of the appellant, DSJ, that the evaluation as to whether there is significant probative value in coincidence evidence involved a relative concept. It did not agree, however, with the proposition that ""the internal coherence of the Crown theory had to be assessed relative to other available theories"". In other words, as I understood the Crown's submission, it did not agree that the trial Court's task was to make its own assessment of the probabilities of the Crown theory and, by way of contrast, the probabilities of any alternative theory. The Crown submitted that the exercise involved a qualitative assessment requiring an examination of the capacity of the evidence to establish the fact or facts in issue. It did not, however, involve a process of comparison with other available theories, except in order to test the cogency of the hypothesis upon which the prosecution relied to justify the admission of the evidence. (This last proposition, it might be observed, had not been advanced by the then Crown prosecutor before the trial Judge). 

30Secondly, the Crown submitted that Zhang , when read fairly, had been correctly decided. It was, in fact, supported by other authorities in this Court, for example, Gardiner v R [2006] NSWCCA 190; (2006) 162 A Crim R 233; R v Ceissman [2010] NSWCCA 50 at [16]-[17]). The Crown recognised that other judicial pronouncements have emphasised that it is the task of the Judge to consider whether the evidence will have significant probative value (Basten JA in Zhang at [46] and Allsop P in DAO [2011] NSWCCA 63 at [98]-[100]. The Crown accepted that, while some minor criticism might be made of Simpson J's formulation, overall it should be regarded as an appropriate and practical contraction of the test under s 98. The Crown argued that it was clear that Simpson J intended that the requisite task should be that of the Judge in every respect. 

31The Crown took issue with Mr Odgers' submissions. It argued that the test propounded on behalf of NS required, in effect, the trial Judge to usurp the function of the jury ( R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 per Spigelman CJ at [64]). In general terms, the Crown submitted that the submissions of both appellants, in the ultimate, advocated a contention that the Judge was required to choose between competing hypotheses. This, however, was the task entrusted to the jury. 

32Finally, the Crown argued that, notwithstanding what had been said by the trial Judge at [64], that particular statement, together with the extensive review of the arguments advanced by the appellants concerning the probative value of the evidence, indicated that the trial Judge had properly discharged the obligation required by s 98 of evaluating the extent of the probative value of the evidence and predicting its capacity, in terms of its likely ultimate effect, in establishing proof of the facts in issue. The Crown argued that the coincidence evidence here had the capacity to show a particular kind of collusion between the two men in relation to NS's trading. This was fundamental to the prosecution case, not only because of the allegation of a scheme or joint venture between them, but also because it was necessary for the Crown to demonstrate that DSJ had procured NS to acquire the financial products. The evidence, it was argued, was clearly capable of establishing a pattern of NS purchasing securities but only in corporations currently dealing with Moody's. It was capable of demonstrating close interaction between the two men at the time of the acquisition and disposal of those particular securities. In relation to each individual charge, the Crown argued that it must be highly probative to adduce evidence of the other occasions when precisely the same thing happened, or where interactive behaviour of the same kind was apparent. 

Facts in issue 

33Before endeavouring to resolve the issues between the parties, it may be helpful to identify the nature of the facts in issue. The trial, of course, is at a preliminary stage. It will be many months before a jury is empanelled and no evidence will be taken until after the Crown opening has concluded. Nevertheless, the Crown case statement is both voluminous and detailed. Similarly, the coincidence notices are extremely detailed. The appendix to the trial Judge's decision in the present matter is nearly 60 pages in length and contains over 350 paragraphs involving a careful analysis of the preliminary arguments of the parties in relation to each share and security transaction. Both before the trial Judge and this Court, written and oral submissions in relation to these various transactions, including submissions as to the existence of inside information, the nature of the contacts between the two men and whether the information was, in any event, in the public domain, extend to more than 50 pages. 

34Each appellant has pleaded not guilty to the charges in the indictment. Apart from the plea, neither appellant has indicated at this stage the precise nature of any defence that may be raised or the case sought to be raised on his behalf. For the purpose of the arguments before the trial Judge (and before this Court) NS raised a hypothetical alternative theory that may or may not be raised in the trial. This is the proposition that NS may have simply been ""tipped off"" by DSJ but did not receive the insider information in relation to any trade. If a jury were to accept that as a reasonable possibility, it would mean that NS would be found not guilty of the present charges. Mr Odgers was careful to indicate that this would not necessarily be his case at trial and that he did not wish to be bound by any such proposition at this stage. It was, he argued, simply an alternative hypothesis that might properly be seen as a possible explanation consistent with innocence. 

35Mr McHugh has also argued that a number of alternative hypotheses could possibly arise based on the evidence to be tendered by the Crown. Each of these may (and probably will) be relied on at trial. Mr McHugh, however, as I have said, has not raised any precise or specific defence at this preliminary stage. 

36The possible hypotheses advanced by Mr McHugh (when prompted by this Court) may be summarised as follows: 

Moody's had knowledge of and information about a vast number of companies; 

DSJ was not always, on the evidence, in a position to acquire inside information in relation to a number of the charges; 

Some of the information, in any event, was already in the public arena; 

The men were very close friends with an interest in the stock market. There were many communications between them in the relevant period of time, many more than could be related to the charges. NS was, in any event, possibly a speculator in his own right. 

37The Crown responded to these arguments by suggesting that the evidence would show a pattern of NS commencing trading ""out of the blue"" as it were. The overall trading activity was within a relatively brief period of time. According to the Crown, the evidence would show NS purchasing shares at first, and then far more adventurous securities, but always in companies currently dealing with Moody's. It would show a very close and constant interaction between the two men at the time of both the acquisition and disposal of the securities. It would also show a plethora of occasions when DSJ was involved in checking share price movements for these securities, far more than his employment required. In the arguments before the trial Judge (and before this Court) those matters were said to have the capacity to impact sharply upon the arguments as to the significance of the coincidence evidence. Indeed, these were the very matters that led the trial Judge to the firm conclusion he reached as to the significant probative value of the coincidence evidence. 

38In the light of all these matters, it may be said that, so far as can be seen at present, the facts in issue for the purpose of the trial are as follows: 

(a) Did DSJ possess inside information as alleged? 

(b) Did DSJ communicate that information to NS? 

(c) Did DSJ procure NS to acquire division 3 financial products? 

(d) Did NS, whilst in possession of the inside information, acquire the division 3 financial products as alleged by the Crown. 

39There is no issue that NS acquired the products. But what is very much in issue is whether he did so whilst in possession of the inside information. More broadly, the issue at trial is whether there was an unlawful arrangement or enterprise between the two men that is encapsulated in and by the facts in issue as I have described them. Moreover, it is apparent from the facts in issue that the appellants will raise an argument, if the evidence be allowed, that any similarities in the situation of the communications, possession of inside information and acquisition of the products was and is entirely a matter of coincidence. 

Resolution 

40It is first useful to set out the coincidence rule in s 98 of the Evidence Act : 

(1) Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless: 

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and 

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 

(2) Subsection (1)(a) does not apply if: 

(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or 

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party. 

41Section 101 also applies. It provides: 

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98. 

(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. 

(3) This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant. 

(4) This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant. 

42The term 'probative value' is defined in the Dictionary of the Act to mean: 

""The extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue."" 

43It is necessary, I think, to make a preliminary observation about s 98 in the context of the present trial. It can be seen from the history of the matter that the Crown wished to adduce the relevant body of evidence in the trial as coincidence evidence. The ""events"" referred to in the notice related to the conduct and state of mind of each of the appellants. It was the Crown's purpose in relying upon the coincidence notice to overcome the coincidence rule. If achieved, this would enable the Crown to argue, upon the admission of the evidence at trial, that it was improbable that the events relied upon had ""occurred coincidentally"". It would also enable the Crown to meet a defence based on coincidence. These were, no doubt, the primary objects of the exercise. There was, however, an undoubted secondary purpose. Success in the application would secure for the Crown the ability to have the evidence in each count available for use on each of the other counts. That, in turn, would have provided a proper basis for the continuance of a joint trial in the broadest sense. 

44Equally, from the defence point of view, it was clearly imperative, if it could be achieved, to prevent the Crown from relying on the coincidence evidence. In that sense, it was also important, if possible, to succeed in severing the counts. A separate trial on the counts in the indictment was no doubt perceived to be a perfectly legitimate tactic in fragmenting the broader aspects of the Crown case and thereby limited the prospect of forensic damage. Hence the motion before the trial Judge. 

45Against this background, I turn to discuss s 98 itself. This section (together with s 101) may be seen as the statutory replacement of the common law treatment of similar fact evidence. At common law, evidence of other criminal conduct of an accused was admissible if the objective improbability of its having an innocent explanation was such that there was no reasonable view of it other than as supporting an inference that the accused was guilty of the offence charged: Pfennig v R (1995) 182 CLR 461; 127 ALR 99. In that case it was held that ""striking similarity"", ""underlying unity"" and such other descriptions used to explain relevant similar facts were not essential to the admission of such evidence, although usually the evidence would lack the requisite probative force if it did not possess those characteristics. 

46In Phillips v The Queen [2006] HCA 4; (2006) 225 CLR 303, the High Court of Australia, in discussion concerning provisions of the Queensland Criminal Code and the Evidence Act 1977 (Qld) referred to certain aspects of the common law tests for the admission of similar fact evidence. At 320-321 [54] the Court made reference to a number of authorities which suggested that there was a fundamental requirement for similar fact evidence to possess a particular level of probative quality. Reference was made, for example, to the Director of Public Prosecutions (UK) v Boardman [1975] AC 421 at 444 per Lord Wilberforce, approved in Markby v The Queen [1978] HCA 29; (1978) 140 CLR 108 at 117 where the admission of similar fact evidence was said to be ""exceptional and requires a strong degree of probative force"". Reference was also made to Hoch v The Queen [1988] HCA 50; (1988) 165 CLR 292 at 294-295 where the criterion of admissibility for similar fact evidence was said to be ""the strength of its probative force"". In Boardman , the House of Lords had adopted, as a guiding principle to determine the admissibility of similar fact evidence, the test whether the prejudice to the accused was outweighed by the probative force of the evidence. 

47The present s 98 (as with s 97 dealing with tendency evidence) took its current form as a result of recent amendments to the Evidence Act (Act No 46 of 2007 s 3 and Sch 1). This Act came into operation on 1 January 2009. It refers to ""coincidence evidence"" as defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act . Coincidence evidence means evidence of a kind referred to in s 98(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that subsection. It relates to evidence that is sought to be adduced in both criminal and civil proceedings. It relates to evidence that is sought to be adduced by any party to the proceedings. 

48In its terms, the purpose of the coincidence rule is to render inadmissible similar fact evidence unless prior notice of the use of such evidence has been given, and unless the Court thinks that the evidence either by itself or having regard to other evidence to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence will have significant probative value. 

49In criminal proceedings, s 101, as has been seen, imposes an additional hurdle to the admission or use of coincidence evidence. The probative value of the evidence must substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. 

50An important cornerstone in the structure of the Evidence Act 1995 is s 55. This deals with the topic of relevant evidence. The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings. 

51Another key section is s 56(1) which provides that, except as otherwise provided by this Act, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in a proceeding. Subsection (2) provides that evidence that is not relevant in the proceeding is not admissible. 

52I have earlier set out the definition of probative value - the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue. 

53As is recognised and stated by the High Court in Smith v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 650, the first question to be asked when an issue of the present kind arises is whether the evidence is relevant. In the present matter, that the evidence is relevant would hardly be thought to be a matter of contention. However, Mr Odgers SC has queried in his submissions this primary matter. As Gleeson CJ observed in Smith v The Queen , although questions of relevance may raise ""nice questions of judgment"", no discretion falls to be exercised. Evidence is either relevant or it is not. If the evidence is not relevant, no further question arises about its admissibility. The simple fact is that irrelevant material may not be received. This is a proposition that is fundamental to the law of evidence and well settled. 

54In determining the basic issue of relevance in a criminal trial, it is especially important to identify the ultimate issues. These will ordinarily be expressed in terms of the element of the offence with which the accused stands charged in light of the defence, if known. However, behind these ultimate issues, there will often be many issues about facts that are relevant to facts in issue ( Smith v The Queen at 654; Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 307: especially at 312 and 321-322). 

55In my opinion, it is plain that s 98, in its terms, poses this simple question: whether the evidence being considered is capable, to a significant degree, of rationally affecting the assessment (ultimately by a jury) of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. Again, in its terms, it requires the trial judge to assess whether the evidence has capacity to that extent and for that purpose. In R v Shamouil Spigelman CJ, in examining s 137 of the Evidence Act , pointed out that, by reason of the terminology of the Dictionary definition of ""probative value"", the focus is on the capacity of the evidence to have the effect mentioned. As the Chief Justice said, ""It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude"". 

56Assessment of the probative value of the evidence, whether for the purposes of ss 97, 98, 101 or 137 Evidence Act , does not, generally speaking, depend on any assessment of its credibility or reliability: Shamouil At 237 [60]. Nor does it depend upon any prediction of the likelihood that a jury will in fact accept it. The trial Judge considering probative value has to make his own estimate or assessment of probative value predicated upon the assumption that the jury will accept the evidence. See also Lodhi v R [2007] NSWCCA 360 at [174]-[177]; R v Mundine [2008] NSWCCA 55 at [33] where this Court said: 

""probative value"" is not to be determined by the weight that might be given to any piece of evidence. What is to be considered is the role that that piece of evidence, if accepted , would play in the resolution of a (disputed) fact - or the contribution it might, if accepted , make to that resolution. ... to make the assessment of probative value on the basis of the perceived credibility or reliability of the witness through whom it is given, or perceived weakness in the evidence, would be to attempt to anticipate the weight the jury would attach to it, a task to be undertaken by the jury when all the evidence is complete. 

57A case that is often cited in relation to the requirement that a judge determine whether evidence has ""significant probative value"" is R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457. This was a decision of Hunt CJ at CL, made in the course of a criminal trial in which he was the presiding Judge. The accused had been charged with the murder of his young daughter. There was no dispute that the child had been seriously physically assaulted and that this had led to her death. The issue in the trial was whether it was the accused who had ""bashed"" the child. There were only two adults in the premises where the incident occurred at the relevant time. One was the accused and the other was his de facto, Ms Dolan. It was agreed by the Crown that there were only two possible suspects - the accused and Ms Dolan. The defence case was that there was a reasonable possibility that it was Ms Dolan who had injured the child. 

58Unusually, it was the accused who sought to lead tendency evidence under s 97 of the Evidence Act . The proposed tendency evidence was that both the deceased and one of her brothers had previously received injuries in circumstances from which an inference could be drawn that there was a reasonable possibility that Ms Dolan had been responsible for inflicting those injuries. The provisions of s 97 in force at the time provided that such evidence would be inadmissible to prove that a person acted in a particular way if the Court ""thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced, have significant probative value"". At 459 Hunt CJ at CL said: 

The ""probative value"" of evidence is defined as meaning the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the particular fact in issue. The terms of that definition are thus substantially similar to those of the definition of relevance in s 56 ... In other words, the probative value of evidence is the degree of its relevance to the particular fact in issue. There is no definition of ""significant"" probative value as that phrase is used in s 97. In its context as I have outlined it, however, ""significant"" probative value must mean something more than mere relevance but something less than a ""substantial"" degree of relevance. ... 

One of the primary meanings of the adjective ""significant"" is ""important"", or ""of consequence"". In my opinion, that is the sense in which it is used in s 97. To some extent, it seems to me, the significance of the probative value of the tendency evidence (whether led by the Crown or by the accused) must depend upon the nature of the fact in issue to which it is relevant and the significance (or importance) which that evidence may have in establishing that fact. 

59His Honour held that the evidence was not excluded by either s 97 or s 135 of the Act and therefore ruled it admissible. 

60It has long been accepted that the approach by Hunt CJ at CL in Lockyer is correct both in relation to s 97 and s 98 (there was no submission made in the present appeal to suggest that Hunt CJ at CL erred in his approach to the construction of the phrase ""significant probative value"" in s 97. Indeed, counsel for the appellants placed reliance upon it). 

61I turn now to the decision of this Court in R v Zhang . In that case, as will be seen, Simpson J (and the other members of the Court, Basten JA and Buddin J) applied Hunt CJ at CL's reasoning in Lockyer . 

62It appears that Simpson J had earlier analysed the processes by which the tender of tendency evidence under s 97 of the Act was to be determined: R v Fletcher (2005) 156 A Crim R 308 at [32]-[35]. In Zhang , having referred to the earlier decision, her Honour (at [139]; p 573) said: 

The analysis is no different in the case of evidence tendered under s 98. The principles are these: 

(i) coincidence evidence is not to be admitted if the court thinks that evidence would not, either by itself, or having regard to other evidence already adduced, or anticipated, have significant probative value; 

(ii) probative value is the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue (see the Dictionary to the Evidence Act ); 

(iii) the actual probative value to be assigned to any item of evidence is a question for the tribunal of fact - here, the jury; 

(iv) the probative value actually to be assigned to any item of evidence cannot finally be determined until all of the evidence in the case is complete; 

(v) the task of the judge in determining whether to admit evidence tendered as coincidence evidence is therefore essentially an evaluative and predictive one. The judge is required, firstly , to determine whether the evidence is capable of rationally affecting the probability of the existence of a fact in issue; secondly (if that determination is affirmative) to evaluate, in the light of any evidence already adduced, and evidence that is anticipated, the likelihood that the jury would assign the evidence significant (in the sense explained by Hunt CJ at CL in Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457) probative value. If the evaluation results in a conclusion that the jury would be likely to assign the evidence significant probative value, the evidence is admissible. If the assessment is otherwise, s 98 mandates that the evidence is not to be admitted. 

63(It should be noted that at the time the Court considered s 98 in Zhang , the section had been expressed in the terms mentioned in para 58 above. There were other differences as well. Nothing, however, turns on that in relation to the present point under consideration). 

64Buddin J agreed with Simpson J. Basten JA, however, differed from Simpson J in two respects. These were, first, that in examining the decision made by the trial Judge, the appellate Court was obliged to evaluate the evidence on the basis identified in Warren v Coombes (1979) 142 CLR 531 rather than by applying the principles established in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. Secondly, his Honour took issue with Simpson J's fifth point (""the task of the Judge in determining whether to admit evidence tendered as coincidence evidence etc""). His Honour said: 

The decision under s 98 is then said to be a two stage process by which the trial Judge first identifies whether evidence is ""capable of"" rationally affecting the probability of a fact in issue, and, secondly evaluating the likelihood that the jury would assign the evidence significant probative value. I do not agree with that approach nor do I think it is supported by the judgment of Hunt CJ in CL in Lockyer . ... Evidence has significant probative value if it could have such an effect, to a significant extent. The trial Judge is not required to second-guess the jury: the Judge must make his or her own assessment of probative value for the purposes of s 98. 

65There is no need to say anything further about the first point of disagreement. It is not relevant to this matter and has, in any event, been settled by the decision of this Court (a five Court bench in DAO [2011] NSWCCA 63; (2011) 278 ALR 765; special leave refused in the High Court: DAO [2011] HCATrans 298). 

66As to the second matter, I have reached the conclusion that, broadly speaking, the formulation of the process by Simpson J at [139] does not demonstrate error. In my opinion there is no justification for overruling Zhang or departing in any significant way from the approach advocated by her Honour in relation to s 98. There are, however, some qualifications that need to be stated in that regard. 

67First, it needs to be recalled, as I have mentioned earlier, that s 98 is now expressed in somewhat different terms to the provisions considered by her Honour. The differences need to be factored in, although I do not consider that they impinge on the principal arguments advanced in this appeal. Similarly, it must be borne in mind that Simpson J, no doubt for the benefit of those presiding over trials where tendency and coincidence evidence is likely to arise, was endeavouring to explain in a practical way the process to be undertaken by a trial Judge. Her Honour's formulation of the process was not intended to supplant or replace the language of the section. Thirdly, I accept that the substance of Simpson J's formulation (at [139]) is in truth focused on the evaluation to be performed by the trial Judge, although her language, on one view, might be thought to suggest otherwise. 

68This third point is critical to the debate as to whether Zhang is correctly decided. I shall briefly explain why I have reached the conclusion that the submissions of both Mr Odgers and Mr McHugh in this regard are not to be accepted. 

69Mr Odgers focuses upon her Honour's statement: 

""Whether the jury would be likely to assign the evidence significant probative value."" 

70Senior counsel argued that this statement is inconsistent with other authorities. A number of decisions were referred to in support of this argument. Three of them, it seems to me, require separate comment. 

71The first is Basten JA's dissenting judgment in Zhang itself. For my part, I do not, with respect, read the language or substance of her Honour's formulation as requiring the trial Judge to ""second-guess the jury"". Indeed, Simpson J drew a clear distinction between the ""actual probative value"" of the evidence, the evaluation of which is entrusted to the jury, and the capacity of evidence to rationally affect the probability of the existence of the fact in issue, the evaluation of which falls to be assessed by the Judge. I read the substance of her Honour's formulation as requiring that this distinction be recognised and that the task to be undertaken by s 98 is entirely the task of the trial judge. The phrase used by her Honour (""the Judge is required ... to evaluate ... the likelihood that the jury would assign the evidence significant ... probative value"") is unexceptionable if it is intended to convey the meaning that the Judge ask whether a hypothetical jury would be likely to find the evidence of importance or of consequence in coming to a conclusion about the matters in issue in the trial. In my opinion that is the meaning Simpson J intended to convey. 

72As I perceive it, the point being made by her Honour is simply this: if a hypothetical jury would think it unlikely that the evidence were important in relation to the facts in issue then the trial Judge might the more readily conclude that the evidence lacks the capacity required for admissibility. Simpson J's formulation recognises that the trial Judge has no part to play in the evaluation of the actual weight to be given to any of the evidence or to its ultimate assessment. The substance of her Honour's formulation is that the trial Judge is required to take the evidence at its highest, and to determine whether it has the capacity to be of importance or of consequence in establishing the fact in issue. In undertaking that task, the statute also requires, as her Honour recognised, that the evidence may be examined on its own account, or by having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the tendering party. As I have said, the trial Judge does not make any evaluation of the actual weight of the evidence nor does he or she make any prediction about the weight that will actually be assigned to the evidence by the jury in the trial. As stated in Mundine , what must be assessed is the role that the evidence, if accepted, would play in the resolution of the disputed fact - its capacity to contribute to that resolution. 

73The next matter relied on by Mr Odgers is the statement by Spigelman CJ in R v Shamouil (referred to above at paragraph 55). In my opinion, the reference by the Chief Justice there was to the distinction between the capacity of evidence to establish a fact in issue and the actual impact or weight of the evidence (as assessed) to do so, a very different concept. The expression ""likely to conclude"" is plainly a reference to the process by which a jury would actually set out to evaluate the evidence and its likely findings in that regard. The Chief Justice's remarks are not inconsistent with the approach taken by Simpson J. 

74The third case of importance referred to by Mr Odgers was DAO , in particular the remarks of Allsop P at 783 [98]-[99]: 

The question of probative value is a question of relevance: the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. This is a matter of logical analysis in the light of the balance of posited evidence. It is a judgment or evaluation, but one by reference to a fixed clear legal standard ... A statutory precondition is provided for in s 97(1)(b) that the court (that is the judge ruling on the admissibility) thinks something. That something is that the evidence ""will"", that is looking forward, have the required quality. I do not think that that requires predicting how a jury will react to the evidence (if there is a jury), other than through the logical assessment called for by the definition of ""probative value"". What is required however, as a precondition, is that the court thinks that it will have that effect in the body of anticipated or expected evidence. In the ordinary course this is a quintessential task of a trial judge dealing with the living fabric of the trial and the evidence unfolding before him or her. 

75There is admittedly a tension between the formulation expressed by Allsop P in DAO and that expressed by Simpson J in Zhang . In substance, however, the approach in each case is the same: the task is to decide the capacity of the evidence, either by itself or having regard to other evidence of the kind mentioned in the section, to be significant (that is, to be of importance or of consequence) in establishing the fact or facts in issue. 

76As I have explained, both Simpson J and Allsop P accept that the task of assessing the evidence's capacity to play that role in the trial falls entirely upon the Judge. 

77In my opinion, Mr Odgers' arguments on this point should not be accepted. The reasons for rejecting Mr Odgers' submission apply equally to the more muted submission to similar effect made by Mr McHugh. 

The contested interpretations of s 98 

78In this appeal the Crown has conceded that, in performing the task under s 98, a trial Judge may, in an appropriate case, have regard to an alternative explanation arising on the evidence. The Crown, however, insisted that, in so doing, the trial Judge is restricted to examining whether the Crown hypothesis has cogency, that is, whether the Crown evidence is capable of being regarded as significant in its ability to prove the Crown case. If the coincidence evidence, either by itself or having regard to other evidence in the Crown case, positively and forcefully suggested an explanation consistent with innocence, then the coincidence evidence could scarcely be regarded as important or of consequence in proving the fact or facts in issue. What is required is this: the trial Judge must ask whether the possibility of such an alternative explanation substantially alters his (or her) view as to the significant capacity of the Crown evidence, if accepted, to establish the fact in issue. Does the alternative possibility, in the Judge's view, rob the evidence of its otherwise cogent capacity to prove the Crown's case? If it does not, the trial judge may safely conclude that the evidence has significant probative value. 

79In a practical sense, there are two avenues of approach to be taken. First, in examining the coincidence evidence (together with other material already in evidence or to be adduced) the trial Judge is required to ask whether there emerges, from a consideration of all the Crown evidence, a possible explanation inconsistent with guilt. For regard to be had to the alternative explanation, it must be a real possibility, not a fanciful one. It must be a broad or overarching possibility, capable of being stated in general terms, even though it may derive from an individual piece or pieces of evidence or the evidence taken as a whole. 

80Secondly, the trial Judge must ask whether that possibility substantially alters his (or her) view as to the otherwise significant capacity of the coincidence evidence to establish the fact or facts in issue. Of course, if the trial Judge has already concluded that the coincidence evidence does not reach that level of significance in terms of its capacity, he will have rejected the evidence in terms of s 98. In that situation, the possibility of an alternative inference may, for the time being, be set to one side. Later in the trial, when the evidence has concluded, that possibility will become a matter for the jury to assess and determine when it comes to consider whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. 

81The Crown, in making its concession, however, stressed that at no stage in this process was the trial Judge required or entitled to assess the actual weight of any part of the evidence, or to make any actual assessment concerning the probabilities of any alternative theory. Nor was the trial judge required or entitled to make a comparison of the Crown theory and the probabilities of any alternative theory. This proposition appears consistent with established authority. Any attempt by the trial Judge to anticipate the actual weight the jury would attach to the evidence is prohibited, as I have explained. 

82I agree with the Crown's concession and with the important qualification attached to it by the Crown in it submissions. This brings me to the reason why I consider that the contested interpretations advanced by Mr Odgers and Mr McHugh are not correct and cannot be accepted. This is because, in my opinion, they require the trial Judge to embark on a task that is entrusted solely to the jury. This is the task of fact finding. It is the task of assigning weight to the evidence; of accepting facts that are considered of value, and rejecting those that are not. It is ultimately the task of determining whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. In a circumstantial case, it is the task of deciding whether, having regard to the whole of the evidence, there is an explanation consistent with innocence. If the jury decide that is the situation, the Crown will have failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The trial Judge can play no part in any of these matters. 

83Of course, senior counsel for the appellants have insisted that their respective formulations do not require that the Judge trespass into this forbidden territory. A careful examination of their respective positions, however, shows that this insistence is misplaced. 

84Mr McHugh's detailed argument that the task faced by the Court under s 98 is to make its own comparative assessment of the probabilities reveals starkly that Hall J was invited to move impermissibly into the arena of fact finding. Even more so, in the case of Mr Odgers' more radical submission, is that the position. 

85That this is so can be seen clearly when regard is had to a number of the arguments advanced before the trial Judge. Although we were not invited in this appeal to descend to any degree into the factual arena, a number of submissions were made to us concerning various aspects of the practical ""evaluation"" of the evidence involved in the coincidence notices. This was done to satisfy this Court that the incorrect test had been applied and that, in any event, the trial Judge had failed to apply Zhang correctly. For example, the topic of NS's trading in AWB Limited (""AWB"") was examined. The submission comprised a 14 page analysis (see appendix A to Mr McHugh's further submissions). It will be sufficient to refer to several of the matters in this document to make the point. 

86At paragraph 11 of appendix A and following, Mr McHugh makes submissions that the Crown's ""theory"" with respect to AWB is ""highly improbable"". The document then pursues an argument based upon the information in the possession of DSJ at the relevant time relating to AWB. This was information actually or arguably received by DSJ in the course of his employment at Moody's. In detailed arguments, Mr McHugh argued that the passing of this information to NS would not have been likely to persuade the latter to take a short position in AWB CFDs. One aspect of the information was that AWB was about to announce to the Stock Exchange that it would indemnify AWB (International) Limited (""AWBI"") for its legal costs arising from the Cole inquiry, and for any tax that might be assessed against AWBI in connection with transportation fees paid for wheat sold to Iraq. Another aspect related to information confirming the correctness of an ABARE forecast that was well below AWB's most recent crop forecast for domestic wheat production for 2006-2007. 

87Mr McHugh included in the appendix several pages of detailed argument and analysis about these pieces of information. At the conclusion of his analysis, counsel suggested it would have been ""irrational"" for DSJ to procure NS to take a short position in AWB CFDs. These arguments included, for example, that the market may already have been well aware of the nature of the potential tax risk for AWBI, and also the worst case figure of about $250 million in that regard; that AWB in any event had little choice but to indemnify AWBI against the risk; and that the likelihood that AWBI would call on the tax indemnity was remote. All these matters, it was argued, supported the proposition the information passed to DSJ suggested a positive for the AWB share price rather than a negative. In relation to the ABARE ""pessimistic"" forecast as to domestic wheat production for the 2006-2007 crop, Mr McHugh argued that there was already material in the public domain forecasting a likely decline in production. For example, the day before the information came to DSJ at the meeting (if it did), ABARE had published a report stating wheat production was forecast to decline by around 35% in 2006-2007. Further, Mr McHugh argued that there was no direct evidence to suggest that the ABARE report had been mentioned at the meeting in DSJ's presence. Before the trial Judge, however, the Crown had argued that DSJ had made a note at the 20 September meeting stating that the ABARE forecast had been ""correct"" with certain other details written on it. 

88In appendix A, Mr McHugh argued that, for various reasons, it should not be accepted that DSJ's note reflected something he had been told at the meeting. It was, more likely than not, merely a recording of his own views, rather than a communication to him that the ABARE forecast had been correct. 

89I have gone to some trouble to repeat the detail of these submissions. They highlight the proposition that ""the probability or improbability of any alternative theories"" argument is in reality a series of detailed submissions on the facts, urging the trial Judge to take an adverse view of those facts contrary to the Crown's position. Each and every of those submissions can properly be seen as more in the nature of arguments to place before the jury in closing address. In reality, they are jury submissions par excellence . Indeed, the Crown response to those submissions can and should be categorised in exactly the same way. 

90One further example will suffice. In paragraph 7 of the appendix, Mr McHugh submitted that there was a powerful argument available to answer the Crown's coincidence reasoning. This was that, during the eight month charge period, NS had traded in three non charged entities, namely, PBL, Australian Pipeline Trust and Downer. The Crown's expert witness had given evidence that Moody's had no inside information in respect of those three listed entities. Yet the Crown case was that NS had been trading in CFDs for those companies. Mr McHugh argued: 

The Crown makes much of its claim that CFDs were risky and dangerous and that NS was only prepared to run the risk of trading in them because he had inside information. But that theory collapses when the Crown in unable to establish that NS had any inside information at all with respect to [those entities] but still traded. The proper conclusion to draw from that evidence is that NS was a speculator who was prepared to run the risk of significant losses in the hope of significant gains. 

91This, to my mind, is a clear example of the point I have made above. It is an argument as to the weight to be given to the evidence in the Crown case. It is an argument as to the drawing by a tribunal of fact of inferences suggested by the Crown, and the actual evaluation of inferences to the contrary. Once again, these arguments should properly be classified as jury arguments, not s 98 arguments at all. 

92Yet, Mr McHugh would suggest that these arguments (and many more of those contained in the detailed appendix) were not invitations to the Judge to intrude upon the jury's task of fact finding. The two arguments I have mentioned were said to be examples of alternative ""explanations"" or ""theories"" which were ""more probable"" than the theory advanced in the Crown case. However at paragraph 44 of the appendix, Mr McHugh argued that: 

... the Court, having carried out the factual analysis above , is then required under s 98(1)(b) to take those matters into account in following the approach of the Victorian Court of Appeal in CGL ... and set out at paragraph 24 of the main submissions above. [My emphasis] 

And again at paragraph 45: 

... [DSJ] submits that the factual analysis demonstrates that it is not at all improbable that the events occurred coincidentally. To the contrary, it is highly likely that any similarities in the events or circumstances are mere coincidence. ... [DSJ] submits that the evidence of those events and circumstances does not tend to prove that [DSJ] did the specified acts or had the specified states of mind in relation to the AWB charge. In other words the Crown's coincidence evidence has no real probative value in relation to the AWB charge. [My emphasis] 

93These submissions, based as they are on Mr McHugh's contested interpretation of s 98, demonstrate clearly that he is inviting the Trial Court to accept the submissions he has made in relation to the weight to be given to factual matters and the inferences to be drawn from those factual matters. It is not possible to make an assessment of the probabilities without doing so. Counsel is inviting the Trial Court to come to a conclusion of fact in those regards before making a determination in relation to s 98. This suggested construction of s 98 plainly falls foul of the prohibition against the Judge entering into the factual arena. 

94It needs to be recalled that detailed arguments of this kind, each requiring a ""factual analysis"" and evaluation, in relation to every trade by NS in the relevant period were placed before the trial Judge in the context of s 98 arguments. Hall J was right to recognise that the s 98 exercise did not require him to resolve these detailed and complex factual arguments. They were matters for a jury at the conclusion of the trial when the actual evidence had been assembled in its totality. 

95It must also follow that Mr Odgers' submissions, based as they are on a more radical proposition than Mr McHugh, equally fall foul of this prohibition. In fairness to Mr Odgers, he did not descend, in his submissions, to the level of factual analysis enunciated by Mr McHugh. Indeed, his principal ""alternative theory"", based on the admitted evidence of his client's trading, suggested a hypothetical possibility that NS may have been operating on the basis of ""tips"" he received from DSJ rather than being in actual receipt of inside information. This possibility was said to arise, not from any positive evidence, but from an absence of evidence as to the detail of the communications between the two men. 

96In that situation, how could the trial Judge ""evaluate whether it could rationally be concluded that the probability of the inference the Crown seeks to draw is significantly greater than the probability of an inference inconsistent with that fact""? In practical terms, the trial Judge could not do so without evaluating the weight of the evidence. At paragraph 57 of his written submissions Mr Odgers referred to a number of other alternative inferences that might be available in his client's case. These included: 

(a) the possibility that NS and DSJ talked about companies or investment trading in general but did not discuss anything to do with the specific companies involved; 

(b) the two men discussed the industry or even specific companies at particular times but DSJ neither provided information nor tips. 

97In view of the forceful findings made by Hall J in relation to the cogency of the coincidence evidence, it seems hardly likely that any of these inferences, even if they could be said to arise on the evidence, had the capacity to disturb the trial Judge's conclusions. Mr Odgers' suggested construction of the s 98 process, in any event, required some level of weighting of the inferences akin to the task entrusted to the jury. 

Did the trial Judge fall into error ? 

98The narrow point in issue here is whether the trial Judge fell into error by rejecting altogether that, in determining the extent to which the evidence could be significant in establishing the facts in issue, regard should be had to an alternative explanation for the conduct said to have the capacity to point to towards guilt. If that was the conclusion reached by the trial Judge, then, on the basis of the concession made by the Crown in this appeal, an error will have been established. The difficult question is determining, on a fair reading of the comprehensive and detailed judgment, whether that was his Honour's conclusion or not. 

99I should immediately say that if his Honour did fall into error in this regard, it was scarcely his fault. This is so for two reasons. First, far from making the concession that has been made in this appeal, the Crown, during the preliminary hearing, urged his Honour to reach a conclusion ""in the absence of any consideration of another party's alternate interpretations of the evidence to the interpretation for the party who seeks to have the evidence admitted"" (Appeal book 69 (45)). Secondly, as I have already indicated, Mr McHugh's submissions on behalf of DSJ did not propound a broad alternate explanation inconsistent with guilt. Rather, they required the Judge to analyse, in minute detail, the majority of facts in the coincidence evidence and the Crown case statement with a view to establishing that the Crown case did not have sufficient weight and that there were many arguments on each transaction that might render the Crown case less than substantial. 

100I shall briefly say something further about the position adopted by the Crown before the trial Judge. Its original submission is to be found at Appeal book 275: 

It is submitted that the Court, in considering the admissibility of two or more events by the party seeking to adduce the evidence of two or more events, is confined to a consideration of the evidence adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence of the two or more events. This consideration should be done in the absence of any consideration of another party's alternate interpretation or possible challenge to the evidence of the party seeking to have the evidence admitted. 

In Samadi v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 330 Beazley JA stated at [97] (Hislop and Price JJ agreeing) that ""... a Court is not required to engage in a (sic) imaginative task of speculating what possible other explanations there could be for the circumstances relied upon"". 

101A number of points can be made about this submission. First, the proposition contained in the first sentence is undoubtedly correct. Secondly, the proposition in the second sentence (at least in part) is now conceded by the Crown to be incorrect. Thirdly, the reference to Beazley JA's comment in Samadi is apt to mislead. The full quote in that case at [97] demonstrates that Beazley JA had been dealing with an important aspect of the legislation as it stood before the amending legislation in 2007. Her Honour's remarks were concerned with the then s 98(2) which contained a definition of ""related events"". The subsection read: 

For the purposes of subsection (1), two or more events are taken to be related events if and only if, 

(a) they are substantially and relevantly similar, and 

(b) the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar. 

102In its entirety, the paragraph relied upon by the Crown in Samadi is as follows: 

Whilst an array of circumstances might be posited against the availability of drawing an inference, s 98, at the admissibility level, does not work in that way. The Court is concerned with determining whether evidence is substantially and relevantly similar and occurred in substantially similar circumstances, so that those events may be relied upon to prove, if accepted, that it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally. In determining that question, the Court is not required to engage in a (sic) imaginative task of speculating what possible other explanations there could be for the circumstances relied upon. 

103As I have said, s 98 was expressed in different terms in a number of respects prior to the 2007 amendment. It is clear that her Honour's comments relate to the aspect of the subsection that defined the notion of ""related events"", a concept not mentioned in the current s 98. Further, when the paragraph is read in context in the decision, it is quite clear that her Honour was not seeking to address the question that has been involved in this appeal, namely the method of evaluation of significant probative value. 

104The fact that the Crown relied on the passage in its written submissions before the trial Judge and, in particular, relied on it to support its proposition that ""another party's alternate interpretation ... to the evidence"" is to be disregarded, reveals quite plainly that the submission was apt to mislead. In fairness to the Crown, it has made it quite clear in this appeal that an alternate explanation inconsistent with guilt arising from the Crown evidence may be recognised in order to test the cogency of the hypothesis upon which the prosecution relies to justify the admissibility of the evidence. 

105Before the trial Judge, the Crown presented further written submissions through the then prosecutor, Mr Agius SC. The proposition I have found to be incorrect was put more nakedly at Appeal book 290: 

12. Much of what was submitted on behalf of [DSJ] was directed to demonstrating other explanations for the circumstances relied upon by the Crown, for example some of these explanations pointed to publication of material in the public domain which may have operated upon the mind of [NS] and which may have led to his purchase of shares or securities. However, these possible explanations are to be set aside when considering admissibility under s 98. 

13. This approach is in accordance with the scheme of the section which refers in s 98(1) to a court having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence. There is no room to have regard to what the defence claims may be another explanation for the circumstance ... 

106It is clear that these submissions went well beyond the proposition that regard was only to be had to the evidence adduced or likely to be adduced by the Crown. Mr Odgers' argument, for example, had placed reliance on a possible explanation inconsistent with guilt said to arise from evidence in the Crown case statement. This further Crown submission (which once again purported to rely upon the statement by Beazley JA in Samadi (Appeal book 289)) suggested even more forcefully the proposition that is now conceded to be incorrect. 

107The second matter, as I have stated, was the nature of the defence submissions before the trial Judge. Argument proceeded, as I indicated at the outset, over a span of five days. A perusal of the transcript demonstrates that much of the time was taken up with detailed analysis by the Crown and Defence counsel of the contested factual matters. This led to the trial Judge producing the lengthy appendix to his decision. In other words, the main focus throughout was on the various arguments concerning the relative strength and weight to be given to the evidence and the inferences to be drawn from it. At Appeal book vol 2 179, his Honour raised his acute concern with this situation: 

At some point in time I do want to visit this question, that is, the extent to which on an application such as this it is within my province to be analysing the evidence in terms of what I might put as the alleged deficiencies in it, or the holes in it, in order to evaluate the probative value of the evidence under s 98 ... There is a boundary which it might be said that I would be crossing over in this application if I were to descend into fact finding, which is the province of the jury and not the province of any Judge ... 

108The then Crown prosecutor assured his Honour that he would address this issue on the following day. On that next occasion, the Crown urged his Honour to ""take care"" not to trespass into the factual area and to take the Crown evidence ""at its highest"" in assessing whether it could be ascribed significant probative value. His Honour, however, maintained his concern in these terms (Appeal book 194): 

So that at the end of the day many of the factual questions I have raised may not be within the jurisdiction I have on this application. So that raises the question then well there is a myriad of factual matters raised in MFI 1 and your response in MFI 2. The question is to what extent am I entitled to involve myself in fact finding in relation to each and every one of those issues and the issues may run to dozens if not hundreds ... 

109His Honour said that he was concerned to know the extent of his jurisdiction. He asked once again for Counsel's assistance in that regard. The Crown, in essence, simply adhered to its written submissions. Without being overly critical of the parties, it appears that his Honour was not given the assistance that he sought. Thereafter, the submissions on both sides simply re-absorbed themselves into the mass of factual material and concentrated on the strengths and weaknesses alleged by each side to arise from that detailed exercise. 

110In their reply submissions before the trial Judge, Mr Odgers and Mr McHugh essentially adhered to the contested interpretation arguments of s 98 that have been presented in this appeal. Neither counsel, it must be said, expressly suggested that the trial Judge should make factual findings or should actually draw inferences. However, as I have said the contested interpretations for which each argued effectively required a weighting of the evidence and the inferences to be drawn. His Honour was consequently left in a very difficult situation. 

The trial Judge's decision 

111I turn then to his Honour's findings. It is convenient, I think, to go directly to the conclusions expressed at Appeal book 121-122. These occur on page 70 of his Honour's reasons. He said: 

[227] I am satisfied and determine that the evidence identified and particularised in Table A in the Coincidence Notice is evidence that is capable of rationally affecting the probability of the existence of the following facts in issue: 

(1) Possession of [DSJ] of inside information. 

(2) That that information was communicated by him to [NS]. 

(3) That he procured [NS] to acquire Division 3 financial products. 

(4) That [NS], whilst in possession of inside information, acquired Division 3 financial products. 

[228] For the purpose of determining admissibility, I am satisfied and determine, in light of the evidence which the Crown proposes to adduce that, in accordance with the test to be applied, the jury would be likely to assign that evidence significant probative value within the meaning of s 98(1)(b). 

[229] The probative value of the evidence referred to in [228], I assess as being high based upon the following matters: 

(1) The similar events identified and particularised in the Coincidence Notice. 

(2) The sequence and timing of the specified events before and following the acquisitions the subject of the counts in the indictment. 

(3) The number of the events and the attenuated similarity of such events. A pattern of events may still exist on the basis of similarities even though a variation in the pattern may occur in some aspects (as in the case of GasNet). 

(4) The capacity of the evidence in relation to such evidence to rationally affect the probability of the existence of facts in issue including, in particular, the issue of ""possession"" and procurement within s 1043A(1)(d). 

(5) The capacity of the evidence in question to establish a relevant interrelationship between the issues of possession of inside information, communications between [DSJ] and [NS], the transfer of such information from one to the other, the issue of procurement by [DSJ] and arrangements for the acquisition of the relevant financial products and the acquisitions themselves. 

(6) The evidence establishing that, in relation to all acquisitions in entities referred to in the counts in the indictment, Moody's had previously been entrusted with inside information by and in relation to all such entities. 

112These conclusions were principally in connection with the application of s 101, but they referred back to and gave content to his Honour's earlier findings on significant probative value. After an extensive series of deliberations on the issue of significant probative value his Honour, prior to examining Mr Odgers' submissions, had earlier said at Appeal book 114: 

[195] Accepting the Crown's evidence as I must for the purpose of determining the issue of significant probative value, I have concluded that the ""events"" "" and their surrounding circumstances do exhibit similarities and for the purposes of determining admissibility under s 98, I consider they constitute striking similarities. In assessing the probative value of the evidence in question, it is relevant to take into account the facts relied upon in the Crown case in relation to each count that are, at least, consistent with what might be termed selectivity in the acquisitions in the sense that those acquisitions ... related to entities that had provided to Moody's what became inside information. 

113His Honour then turned to Mr Odgers' submissions. First, he rejected Mr Odgers' primary submission relating to the process of finding relevance in s 55. Secondly, in relation to the broader submissions made by Mr Odgers as to the interpretation of s 98, his Honour said: 

[205] In relation to the submission that under s 98 more is required than that an inference is "" open "" on the evidence for a finding in respect of ""significant probative value"" , I respectfully agree. I have proceeded on that basis. An assessment under that provision is directed to evaluating the strength of the evidence including inferences based on an acceptance of the evidence in question. 

[206] I, with respect, do not accept the submission that the requirement under s 98(1)(b) means "" ... the Court must evaluate whether it could rationally be concluded that the probability of the inference the Crown seeks to draw is significantly greater than the probability of an inference inconsistent with that fact"" ... In that respect, I refer to what has been said on that issue above. However, in my assessment, for the purposes of determining admissibility under s 98(1)(b), I consider that the ""probative value"" of the evidence relied upon by the Crown in relation to the charged matters is such that, assuming a jury accepted that evidence at trial, then, on that basis, the jury would be likely to assign the evidence significant probative value such as to render the inferences relied upon by the Crown as having a high degree of probability. It need hardly be said that that is not intended to be the expression by me of any final opinion as to what or how a jury should decide. A jury's actual assessment will depend, of course, upon its acceptance of the evidence in the Crown case following cross examination and in light of all the evidence in the case. 

114These conclusions, forcefully stated as they were by the trial Judge, do not, however, clearly indicate whether his Honour had rejected the Crown submission that, in performing the task ascribed by s 98, he must eschew altogether the recognition of any alternative explanation inconsistent with guilt arising from the Crown evidence. Mr McHugh and Mr Odgers placed reliance, however, on his Honour's remarks at paragraph 64 (Appeal book 75) where his Honour had said, in the context of a discussion on ""significant probative value"": 

The Appendix to this judgment contains a summary of facts and particular matters that were raised in the submissions for [DSJ] and in the Crown's reply. For reasons discussed below, I have concluded that there is no requirement for the purpose of a ruling on admissibility under s 98 to determine the existence and weight to be given to inferences that may be considered as alternative or inconsistent with those relied upon by the Crown by analysing parts or segments of evidence in a circumstantial evidence case. In deference to the arguments raised, the appendix endeavours to capture many matters raised and relied upon in the submissions made on behalf of [DSJ]. The summary of factual material relating to the ""events"" in MFIs set out in the appendix also assist in understanding the contentions made on behalf of [DSJ] and [NS]. 

115It is not clear to me that this paragraph, read in isolation, contains the error for which Defence counsel contend. Rather, it seems to my mind that the trial Judge may have been repeating the concerns that he had identified during oral submissions. It may have been that his Honour was simply stating that his task, as he saw it, did not extend to making an assessment of the weight of alternative inferences by scrutinising those parts or segments of the evidence which had been referred to by Mr McHugh for [DSJ]. If that is the meaning that his Honour intended to convey, as the Crown argued in this appeal, he was quite correct in that regard. I have said enough in the earlier part of these reasons to demonstrate why that is so. 

116However, it is necessary to look beyond the particular paragraph and endeavour to see whether his Honour has elsewhere expressed a concluded finding about the broader issue, namely whether it was (or was not) necessary for the purposes of testing the cogency of the Crown hypothesis, to consider any broad alternative or inconsistent inferences arising on the Crown evidence. This topic was raised again by his Honour at paragraphs 68 and 70. His Honour noted that there was no case law authority that had determined whether he should have regard to ""the availability and strength of inferences founded in the evidence other than the inferences for which the Crown"" contended. 

117His Honour returned to the issue at paragraphs 88-111. At 111 his Honour said: 

One difficulty, apart from the absence of authority to support the above line of argument is that, at this stage of proceedings in which an advanced ruling is sought on admissibility, there is evident difficulty in determining the availability of inferences and the comparative strength of alternative inferences in relation to a particular fact or matter. The drawing of inferences will, to an extent, depend, as it does with a jury's finding, upon what particular facts or combination of facts the evidence is found to establish. This, at a pre-trial stage, is problematic where there exists a dispute as to primary facts or where the Crown case is largely or wholly a circumstantial one. 

118His Honour then listed, in broad terms, a number of matters that had been identified by Mr McHugh as matters in ""dispute"". Secondly, at paragraph 114 and following, his Honour listed, ""alternative inferences"" identified by Mr Odgers on behalf of NS. These, in one form or another, referred to the possibility that NS had been ""tipped off"" by DSJ but had not been provided with the inside information. His Honour carefully set out the submissions made out by Mr Odgers in support of this argument. 

119Next his Honour considered a number of authorities that had looked at the issue of similar fact evidence. Having done so, the trial Judge turned to a more general discussion of the evaluation of the probative force of similar fact evidence. He acknowledged Mr McHugh's submission that the probative value of the evidence here, in a number of respects, was low or non-existent, diminished or amenable to alternative explanation or inferences (Appeal book 94, para 134). His Honour commented: 

135. A number of submissions for DSJ did not deal with the subject of ""alternative inferences"" by considering particular evidence referred to in the context of the whole of the evidence in relation to a particular count or the evidence in relation to other counts or both. Rather, the approach was to refer to parts of the evidence in the Crown case relating to particular ""events "" referred to in MFI 1 as an individual segments [sic] of evidence. As discussed below, such an approach does not sit comfortably with principles that apply to the assessment of probative value of evidence particularly in circumstantial evidence cases. 

120His Honour then referred to authority that supported the approach that, in similar fact cases, cogency is demonstrated when regard is had to the particular fact seen in the context of the other evidence in the case ( Sutton v R [1984] HCA 5; (1984) 152 CLR 528 per Brennan J). His Honour's reasoning turned to the propositions advanced in Zhang and Lockyer . He then set himself the task formulated by Simpson J in Zhang : 

152. The analysis of Simpson J in Zhang ... and her Honour's expression ""... an evaluative and predictive one"" are to be understood on the basis discussed above, namely, that, in determining the admissibility of coincidence evidence, the Judge acts upon an assumption that the evidence in question will be accepted. ... On that basis, the question of which I must satisfy myself is, would it be likely that the jury would assign the evidence significant probative value in the sense that the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the facts in issue. 

153. I have earlier referred to submissions on behalf of [DSJ] in which a number of items of evidence relied upon by the Crown were either disputed or one of more bases of which were said to be susceptible to innocent or alternative explanations or inferences. The submission was that alternative inferences were open in relation to such evidence. In dealing with those submissions, it is important to identify the role of a court in determining the admissibility of evidence on the basis of an assessment of the probative value. The cases referred to in the paragraphs that follow have considered that role. 

121The trial Judge then gave consideration to judicial statements in R v Shamouil; R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 and other authorities which had stressed the importance of the division of functions between a trial Judge and the jury in the trial process. 

122Against that background, his Honour entered upon the following discussion (Appeal book 105-106): 

165. In the submissions for [DSJ] it was argued ... 

...there is nothing in s 98 and s 101 to prevent the Court from assessing the probability of inferences other than those relied upon by the party who seeks to adduce the evidence ... 

166. The submission in this respect continued by stating that the Court ""must have regard to all the circumstances in which the allegedly similar events are said to have occurred and to all the available inferences"" ... and that it was impossible to assess the relative probability or improbability that a similar set of events occurred coincidentally without considering the likelihood of alternative available inferences ... 

167. There are a number of matters raised by these submissions in relation to the subject of alternative inferences. Even if evidence on a particular aspect is capable of carrying an alternative inference, that does not detract from the fact that that evidence nonetheless remains open to any rational inference relied upon by the Crown. In other words, in terms of the capability of the evidence in the sense discussed above, it may nonetheless remain capable of carrying significant probative value in the relevant sense as explained in Zhang ... even though other inferences may also be open. This may be because, as a matter of evaluation and prediction, it can be considered likely that the jury would assign it significant probative value and prefer the inference the Crown relies upon. Importantly, the evaluation of the probative value of the evidence, when it is considered along with other evidence, may further enhance the probative value of the evidence in question. 

123I pause there to observe that each of these propositions advanced by Hall J is undoubtedly correct. His Honour continued: 

169. At the centre of the submissions made on behalf of both accused is the proposition that the probative value of the evidence proposed to be led by the Crown is diminished if the evidence may be considered to be open to alternative inferences or explanations and not only the inferences which the Crown proposes to ask the jury to draw. Not only, it is suggested, must a Judge in evaluating significant probative value determine whether alternative inferences are open but he or she must set about weighing and evaluating the strength of competing inferences, a task that would require, in most cases, that the whole of the relevant circumstantial and other evidence in the proceedings be evaluated, that is, in similar fashion to the approach required of a jury. 

170. These submissions are to be assessed, firstly, by the principle that, in determining the admissibility of evidence, a court is to proceed on the basis of taking the evidence in the Crown case on the basis that it will ultimately be accepted by the jury and, secondly, that parts of the evidence must be considered in the whole context of a circumstantial evidence case. 

124It may be observed at this point of his Honour's discussion that his reasoning has led him to identify clearly enough the propositions that had been advanced to him on behalf of the defence. His Honour has rightly identified that it was no part of his task to weigh and actually evaluate the strength of competing inferences for the purpose of the s 98 exercise. However, it appears that his Honour has left open, at this point in his reasoning, the question whether, in undertaking the s 98 task, the Court should ignore altogether the possibility of an alternative inference being available arising from the Crown's evidence. 

125His Honour next turned to Samadi and the passage from Beazley JA which I have set out earlier. His Honour noted that the point in that case arose in circumstances that were ""very different"" to those with which he was concerned. His Honour said: 

""It is nonetheless instructive to observe the distinction drawn by Beazley JA between the task required by s 98 to be undertaken ( ""at the admissibility level"" ) from issues that are for a jury's ultimate determination. The former obviously involves a significantly different approach to that involved in the process by which a jury determines subjacent issues of fact (including inferences) and ultimately the facts in issue."" 

126His Honour, after further reference to the Chief Justice's remarks in Shamouil (and other cases) referred once more to the distinction between the task performed by the trial Judge and that performed by the jury in relation to factual evaluation. His Honour continued: 

178. There is evident difficulty in many of the submissions made on behalf of [DSJ] in determining the question of admissibility of evidence under s 98. In relation to many counts, submissions were made as to the absence of evidence on particular or discrete ""events"" (as, for example, ""no actual evidence"" of [DSJ] receiving any information as alleged, of what was said in telephone calls or the content of text messages or of acts of [DSJ] to ""procure"" acts by [NS]). Particular submissions, as noted above, related to the weight to be given to expert evidence on ""materiality"" in light of certain information in the public domain. 

127His Honour then concluded: 

181. There is nothing either in the terms of s 98 nor in the analysis of Simpson J in Zhang ... or, in my opinion, in any other authority that indicates or mandates that a judge in assessing ""significant probative value"" under s 98 must identify the possible alternative inferences that could have support from the evidence or parts of the evidence the Crown proposes to rely upon in relation to particular matters and then set out about sifting and weighing the alternative inferences for the purpose of determining ""probative value"" . 

182. In accordance with the common law trial principles, the determination of available rational inferences is to be made in the context of all relevant evidence at the conclusion of the evidence and then only by the tribunal of fact, the jury. The provisions of s 98 do not state or suggest that, at the level of admissibility, the judge is to conduct an inquiry of all evidence with a view to determining whether more than one inference is open on the basis of particular evidence and whether one possible inference, in fact, trumps another. It is not the function or within the province of a judge in determining an admissibility question under s 98 to predict the inferences or hypotheses that might ultimately be drawn by the jury from the evidence in the course of it determining actual probative value. ... 

128In paragraph 184, his Honour noted the difficulty of resolving the comparative availability and strength of alternative inferences or explanations at the admissibility stage. He underlined the fact that ""alternative inferences to those relied on by the Crown would often necessarily depend upon how a jury resolves conflicting evidence and how it may determine the probative force of evidence on the basis of the mass of evidence"". His Honour endorsed as helpful to his exercise the metaphor referred to by Brennan J in Sutton where similar fact evidence was likened to ""the tiles constituting a mosaic"". His Honour thought that such a metaphor was equally apposite in relation to coincidence evidence. 

129The trial Judge then moved to the conclusions which I have set out earlier. 

130I have concluded, not without some considerable hesitation, that the trial Judge did fall into the error of rejecting altogether the need to recognise, in the evaluation process, the existence of alternative inferences inconsistent with guilt arising from the Crown evidence. This was as a consequence of the Crown argument that was advanced to him, his reliance on the passage in Samadi , and arising from his overall concern that it was not his task to intrude into the fact finding area which included the weighing and assessment of inferences. 

131In relation to the last matter, his Honour was quite correct. His Honour was also correct in accepting that it is the task of the jury to undertake this weighing task at the point where all the evidence in the trial had been assembled and concluded. None of this, in my opinion, means, however, that the trial Judge in assessing s 98, and making the evaluation required under that section, must ignore and put to one side altogether an alternative explanation that properly arises on the evidence inconsistent with guilt. Of course, it is not for the trial Judge to weigh and assess that alternative explanation, as a jury would do. Nor is the trial Judge required, in that regard, to examine and weigh parts of the evidence only in isolation from the whole body of the evidence. 

132However, in the present matter, the trial Judge was required to ask himself whether, for example, the possibility that NS had been ""tipped off"" about the corporate entities without receiving inside information might otherwise substantially alter the capacity for cogency he thought the coincidence evidence possessed. Similarly, in the case of DSJ, his Honour was required to ask whether, for example, this mass of phone calls and other communications between the two men might mean no more than that they were engaging in social and recreational communications, without reference to stock market trading. If that were a possibility, did it substantially alter his view as to the otherwise significant capacity of the Crown evidence to establish the facts in issue. He had to ask whether the fact that Moody's had information about a vast number of corporate entities, and that, in some cases, there was no direct evidence that DSJ had acquired inside information, substantially altered the high cogency of the coincidence evidence, as he saw it, to prove the facts in issue. In each case, did the possibility deprive the coincidence evidence, taken with the other evidence, of its capacity to prove significantly the Crown case? His Honour, in considering these alternative inferences, may well have taken the view that none of these possibilities had the capacity to diminish the otherwise strong probative value of the Crown evidence. However, in my opinion, they had to be recognised and taken into account in the limited manner I have suggested, and it was an error not to do so. 

133For these reasons, I have concluded that error has been demonstrated. The order refusing severance of the counts should be set aside and that issue should be sent back to the trial Judge for re-consideration. It may well be that his Honour will, after applying the approach I have suggested is the correct one, reach precisely the same conclusion both as to the admissibility of the evidence and the need for the counts to be tried together. Those matters will be entirely within his province as trial Judge. 

134I propose the following orders: 

1. Appeal allowed. 

2. Order made by Hall J on 23 August 2011 dismissing the applications that the charges in the indictment, other than charges 6-9, be tried separately, be set aside. 

3. The motions are referred back to the trial Judge for reconsideration in the light of this Court's rulings. 

135McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Whealy JA. 

136McCALLUM J: I agree with the orders proposed by Whealy JA, for the reasons given by his Honour. I also agree with the additional comments of the Chief Justice.

2758662,"Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage v Kyluk Pty Limited [2012] NSWLEC 22","Judgment 

1The Defendant is charged with committing an offence between about 11 June 2009 and 11 August 2009 pursuant to s 118A(2) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 in that it picked plants that were part of an endangered ecological community (the EEC), being ""Shale/Sandstone Transition Forest in the Sydney Basin Region"" as described in the Final Determination of the Scientific Committee (the Final Determination) to list the ecological community, which at the time of the offence was listed as an EEC in Sch 1 Pt 3 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. The Defendant has pleaded guilty to the charge. 

2The Final Determination contains a number of paragraphs (1 to 15). The focus of the parties' submission was paragraphs 1, 4, 9 and 10. 

3This is a judgment on a voir dire as to the admissibility of two experts' reports containing opinions of Mr Tulau, soil scientist, (exhibit A) and Ms James, botanist and ecologist, TAJ-5 (exhibit B) in the sentence hearing. Earlier reports prepared by Ms James which were served by the Prosecutor were not relied on being TAJ-2, TAJ-3, TAJ-4 and TAJ-6. Both experts were cross-examined about their respective reports.

Rule 5.2(2)(f) of the Court Rules state that UCPR r 31.3, 31.7, 31.11, 31.12, 31.21 and 31.22 apply. The Supreme Court Rules Pt 75 r 3J provides that unless the court otherwise orders experts are bound to comply with the Code. 

Defendant's submissions 
Mr Tulau 
9Mr Tulau's report fails to comply with Sch 7 cl 31.27 (1)(f) which requires that it must identify any tests or investigations on which Mr Tulau relied. Firstly, this was not done for the coarse particle size analyses relied on. That test was done by the Yanco Natural Resources Laboratory of the Prosecutor. The processes for undertaking the tests, chain of possession and the process of actual testing are not disclosed. The test results are not included in the report. According to the oral evidence the results were sent as an email, not attached to a report. Further there is no identification of who did the test and their qualifications, a further breach of cl 31.27(1)(f). 

10There is no discretion to waive compliance under UCPR r 31.27. Experts' reports must comply with the Code. There is no provision for an otherwise order as provided for in r 31.23(3). (As already noted these rules do not apply in Class 5 proceedings). 

11Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [85] requires that an expert must establish the facts on which opinion is based in order to identify a proper foundation for it. That finding was adopted by Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; (2011) 277 ALR 611 (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ concurring). If no evidence is admitted to establish the basis of an opinion it may be concluded that the opinion evidence does not make it possible to assess whether it is capable of affecting the probabilities of the existence of a fact in issue. 

12Secondly, Mr Tulau's discussion of results in par 7 of the report reveals that his diagrams (Fig 8 and 9) are dependent on the undisclosed and hearsay particle size analyses. 

13Thirdly, his evidence is not probative because it is not capable of proving beyond reasonable doubt the fact in issue that he identified soil types relevant to the definition in the Final Determination. The only relevant samples are at sites 4 and 8 as referred to in table 7. In his oral evidence in relation to site 4 he said that perhaps the soil was transitional, said ""indicated"" not ""was"", said ""consistent with"" not ""was"", and said ""could be characterised"" as transitional. That evidence is incapable of proving the fact in issue because too qualified and therefore in breach of s 56 of the Evidence Act 1995 which requires that evidence must be relevant. Only unqualified opinions can be relevant. Mr Tulau's opinions expressed in his report and even more so orally were so qualified as to be neutral and therefore not probative of any fact per R v RTB [2002] NSWCCA 104 and R v Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 74. 

14Where the criminal standard of proof applies, evidence including opinion evidence that is incapable of proving the relevant issue beyond reasonable doubt is not probative and therefore inadmissible as irrelevant per s 56(2) of the Evidence Act. See Dasreef at [90]. 

Ms James 
15Report TAJ-5 cannot stand given that it expressly states that it is cumulative and that earlier reports should also be read in conjunction with it. These earlier reports are no longer relied on by the Prosecutor. As it cannot be a stand alone report it cannot be relied upon as a matter of logic. 

16Paragraph 7.2 of the report states: 
My opinion as to the extent of these communities that were cleared on the property in 2009 is shown in Figures 1 & 2 and comprise an area of approximately 16 ha including 12.54 ha of SSTF and 3.6 ha of CPW. 

17This opinion as to area cannot be that of Ms James as she is relying entirely on Ms Byrne's calculation as set out in annexure 6. This opinion is inadmissible given Evidence Act s 79(1) and in light of Dasreef at [30] - [43] and [137]. Further the process of reasoning of Ms Byrne is not disclosed which is a failure to comply with cl 5(1)(f) of the Code. 

18Other submissions were made about weight to be attributed to this report if admitted but I do not need to consider these at this stage. 

Prosecutor's submissions 
19This voir dire is made in the context of a plea of guilty whereby all the essential facts have therefore been admitted. It is not open to the Defendant to challenge the existence of the EEC. It is the area of the EEC that is in issue. 

20UCPR r 31.23 and r 31.27 do not apply in summary criminal proceedings in this court contrary to Defendant's submissions. Supreme Court Rules Pt 75 r 3J adopts the Code in Sch 7. This does not exclude the making of an otherwise order in summary criminal proceedings. 

21Each of the experts' reports complies with cl 5 of the Code but for the possible criticism in cl 5(1)(f) that the third party was not identified and/or its qualifications are not identified. In relation to Mr Tulau the issue is the extent to which his opinion is dictated by the soil tests. The tests confirm the field observations undertaken by him in any event. The Final Determination in par 1 identifies that the EEC occurs in a transitional zone between clay and sandy soils. Paragraph 9 refers to where the EEC occurs generally. There is uncertainty in the definition and in the definition of soil location. The language reflects the need to identify a range, and consistency with that range. His evidence fully satisfies the requirements of proof as identified in Makita . 

22Mr Tulau was subject to cross-examination. His methodology includes analysing aerial photographs identifying sandstone outcrops as seen in plates 32 and 34 and in Fig 10. This is confirmed with land forms and physical observation of the site. The photograph shows the clearing of boundaries and conclusions that are consistent with the Final Determination. His opinion is based on his own expertise. 

23Ms James' report can stand on its own as it is self-contained when read as a whole. She refers to two site inspections she undertook. Her opinion as to area expressed in par 7.2 is not dishonest as can be seen from par 3.2, annexure 6 and her oral evidence. Figure 2 on p 9 relies for arithmetical calculations on GIS mapping. Ms James placed the lines on the map. She states who did the calculations. The areas are stated to be approximate which is necessary given the subjective elements in the Final Determination. 

Consideration 
24As the Defendant's counsel stressed, these are criminal proceedings in which the Prosecutor must prove those matters on which it relies beyond reasonable doubt. That said, as the Prosecutor identifies, the Defendant has pleaded guilty and therefore must be taken to have admitted the essential elements of the offence, namely that the EEC as specified in the charge was cleared during the period of the charge. At issue in this sentence hearing is the area of the EEC cleared. 

25The Defendant relied on UCPR r 31.27 as imposing mandatory requirements about which the Court has no discretion to allow breaches of the rule's requirements. As identified above at par 8 and as submitted by the Prosecutor, that rule does not apply in these summary criminal proceedings. Supreme Court Rules Pt 75 r 3J requires compliance with the Code in Sch 7 of the UCPR. Clause 5 of the Code is in the same terms as r 31.27 including subclause (1)(f) which requires that an expert report include any examination, test or other investigations on which the expert has relied including details of the qualifications of the person who carried them out. The parties agree that I can exercise my discretion to make an otherwise order providing for the admission of the experts' reports if I find a breach of the Code established. 

26Dasreef (majority) at [32] states that evidence that is tendered must satisfy two criteria to be admissible under s 79(1) of the Evidence Act (providing for expert opinion evidence to be admitted). The witness must have specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience, and the opinion expressed must be wholly or substantially based on that knowledge. That requires identification of the fact in issue that the party tendering the evidence asserts the opinion proves or assists in proving. Heydon JA (as he then was) in Makita at [85] was approved in Dasreef (majority) at [37]. Makita states at [85]: 
In short, if evidence tendered as expert opinion evidence is to be admissible, it must be agreed or demonstrated that there is a field of ""specialised knowledge""; there must be an identified aspect of that field in which the witness demonstrates that by reason of specified training, study or experience, the witness has become an expert; the opinion proffered must be ""wholly or substantially based on the witness's expert knowledge""; so far as the opinion is based on facts ""observed"" by the expert, they must be identified and admissibly proved by the expert, and so far as the opinion is based on ""assumed"" or ""accepted"" facts, they must be identified and proved in some other way; it must be established that the facts on which the opinion is based form a proper foundation for it; and the opinion of an expert requires demonstration or examination of the scientific or other intellectual basis of the conclusions reached: that is, the expert's evidence must explain how the field of ""specialised knowledge"" in which the witness is expert by reason of ""training, study or experience"", and on which the opinion is ""wholly or substantially based"", applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propounded. If all these matters are not made explicit, it is not possible to be sure whether the opinion is based wholly or substantially on the expert's specialised knowledge. If the court cannot be sure of that, the evidence is strictly speaking not admissible, and, so far as it is admissible, of diminished weight. And an attempt to make the basis of the opinion explicit may reveal that it is not based on specialised expert knowledge, but, to use Gleeson CJ's characterisation of the evidence in HG v The Queen [1999] HCA 2; (1999) 197 CLR 414 (at [41]), on ""a combination of speculation, inference, personal and second-hand views as to the credibility of the complainant, and a process of reasoning which went well beyond the field of expertise"". 

Mr Tulau 
27The Defendant submits that as Mr Tulau failed to include the email of the test results of the soil particle size analyses from the Yanco Natural Resources Laboratory of the Prosecutor and failed to include the name and qualifications of the person undertaking the test, he did not comply with cl 5(1)(f) of the Code. I agree with the Prosecutor that his report otherwise complies with cl 5 of the Code to the extent other parts apply. As the Prosecutor submitted Mr Tulau's report is consistent with Makita at [85]. His qualifications and expertise are identified, there is no challenge to his expertise. The facts on which he relied are identified, with further expansion of these in cross-examination, reasons are given for his opinion in the conclusion, and relevant literature is identified. In relation to the Defendant's criticism, par 5.1 of the report identifies that field inspections were carried out and soil samples taken from six sites and basic field measurements were taken including texture and field pH taken according to soil layer. The soils were also sampled according to soil layer. Samples for laboratory analyses were submitted to the Department's Yanco Natural Resources Laboratory through a documented chain of custody. Section 5.2 refers to the type of soil testing requested for fourteen samples taken from six sites using the methodology of B Craze et al, Soil testing procedures , Department of Conservation and Land Management and identifying the international scale for size ranges. Gravels were retained and returned to Mr Tulau for examination and characterisation. Section 5.3 refers to aerial photograph interpretation. 

28In cross-examination Mr Tulau was asked to clarify his opinion of consistency of soil type for sites 4 and 8, stating for site 4 this was perhaps transitional and the same for site 8. He considered both sites met the relevant criteria. He referred to the importance of undertaking aerial photograph interpretation to derive a spatial extrapolation. This together with soil testing is the definitive methodology required to determine soil type. He agreed that particle size analyses was critical to his analysis, which he did not personally carry out. He agreed the document identifying the results from the laboratory was not in his report. The Yanco Laboratory is accredited nationally to undertake soil analyses. He considered it was sufficient under the Code to identify the accredited laboratory. In relation to the weight of soil samples referred to in table 7 he weighed them, estimated their size and counted the soil fragments. He considered it was practical to map soil on this occasion as there was a clear outcrop of Hawkesbury sandstone which is the boundary of where transitional soil would be. In re-examination he was asked how much analysis is done in the field and how much in the scientific laboratory. Mr Tulau stated that the scientific laboratory tests support work done in the field with certain field tests used to identify texture. This does not arrive at a numerical result but can assist in determining if soil is sandy or clay based. He explained that he received back coarse fragments from the laboratory for his analysis of soil weight which was recorded in table 7. This data can be compared with data from other soil types. His oral evidence was that his conclusions were also drawn from his own analysis of soil samples. 

29I consider the breach of cl 5(1)(f) of the Code while more than technical is relatively minor when considered in the overall context of the report and the oral evidence of Mr Tulau concerning his methodology. While it is necessary according to the rule to identify the individual undertaking a test at the accredited laboratory, that accreditation presumably requires appropriately qualified staff to be present and to follow established procedures for receipt and testing of soil samples. Mr Tulau specified in his report the soil analysis methodology he wanted done (Craze et al). That omission appears minor. Of possibly greater significance is the absence of documentation establishing the chain of custody of soil fragments sent to the laboratory. Mr Tulau's sworn evidence is that he collected the soil samples himself from the site. The actual results provided by the laboratory were not included in his report. It is Mr Tulau's sworn evidence that the results he received are included in his report however. The laboratory data was part of several matters considered by Mr Tulau including aerial photograph interpretation and his own weighing of soil fragments returned from the laboratory. Considering his evidence as a whole the breach of the Code is not sufficient to warrant exclusion of his whole report. 

30A further objection of the Defendant was that the opinion evidence of Mr Tulau was too qualified to be probative and was therefore irrelevant under s 56 of the Evidence Act. Mr Tulau's evidence is not neutral in the sense referred to in RTB and Skaf , cases relied on by Defendant addressing quite different opinion evidence (medical) in a different factual context. I do not consider Mr Tulau's evidence can be characterised as neutral. His expression of opinion must be considered in light of the Final Determination including par 9 and par 10. As identified by the Prosecutor the descriptions of the EEC are qualified by using words such as ""generally"" in par 9 and par 10, reflecting the imprecise boundaries of transitional soil zones where the EEC may be located inter alia. The Defendant's submission in reply that cl 9 was descriptive only and not part of the definition in the Final Determination, which was identified only in par 1, 4 and par 10, is too narrow a reading of the whole of the Final Determination. The locational characteristics identified in par 9 are relevant to the identification of the EEC according to the expert Mr Tulau. He addressed these general descriptors as part of the matters considered. In these circumstances it is difficult to see why Mr Tulau's qualified opinion is not admissible. It does address appropriately a fact in issue about which he has expertise to express an opinion. 

31The Defendant's objections to Mr Tulau's evidence are not sustained. His report is admissible in its entirety. 

Ms James 
32I consider Ms James' report can be read as a stand alone report when viewed in its entirety. It identified the methodology applied by her, the site inspections undertaken and the references relied upon. It does not fail as a matter of logic. There is no challenge to Ms James' expertise. 

33The adoption of Ms Byrne's opinion as to the area of EEC cleared estimated as 12.54 ha in par 7.2 as Ms James' own was heavily criticised by the Defendant as being misleading. I considered the criticism of the report in this regard was adopting a fine-tooth comb approach to the report which is not justified simply because these are criminal proceedings. Ms James' approach is entirely understandable when other sections of the report are given a fair reading. These refer to Ms Byrne's annexure 6 where figures for the area cleared are shown and identify that Ms Byrne did the GIS calculation for those areas (par 3.2). When read in context it is clear that Ms James is adopting that figure as the approximate area. It is Ms James' lines on the aerial photograph of where clearing occurred which informs the mathematical calculation carried out by Ms Byrne using a GIS system. According to Ms James' oral evidence this method is more accurate than her method of using a ruler and topographical map to calculate the area cleared. There is no criticism of the identification of the lines on the Fig 1 and 2 prepared by Ms James. This criticism of the report is not sustained. 

34A further criticism arising from the use of Ms Byrne's calculations is that there are no workings or explanation as to how these were undertaken or her qualifications, a breach of cl 5(1)(f) of the Code. As already noted I have discretion whether to admit a report where there is a breach. I consider this breach is technical in nature and should not prevent the report being admitted as a whole. The calculations are using GIS points on the aerial photographs marked up by Ms James to calculate the area cleared mathematically. Such a calculation can be done, roughly no doubt, in Court if necessary using a ruler. The approach using the GIS system is more accurate according to Ms James' oral evidence. That evidence in her report should be admitted in these circumstances. 

35The reports of Mr Tulau and Ms James the subject of the voir dire are admissible.

2758669,"Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage v Kyluk Pty Limited (No 2) [2012] NSWLEC 24","EX TEMPORE Judgment 

1Section 5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that questions of law during summary proceedings before this Court may be taken to the Court of Criminal Appeal as a stated case. Kyluk Pty Limited, the Defendant, seeks to have a case stated to the Court of Criminal Appeal before the completion of this sentence hearing. 

2The decision whether to state a case rests in the Court's discretion given that the request is by the Defendant rather than the Crown (if the Crown, s 5AE says the Court must submit the stated case). There is no guidance provided in the section in relation to the exercise of that discretion. 

3The questions of law, if that is what they be, in the draft stated case concern whether various errors of law arise from my decision in Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage v Kyluk Pty Limited [2012] NSWLEC 22 on a voir dire allowing admission in the sentence hearing of two expert reports in light of the Expert Witness Code of Conduct (the Code) in Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (the UCPR) Sch 7. 

4The Defendant submits that this is a live issue that ought be determined before the Court imposes sentence as a stated case now would reduce possible delay and expense in the future. If there is an appeal in the future following sentence the Court of Criminal Appeal is likely to remit the matter for further sentence by this Court occasioning delay and expense. 

5The Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage, the Prosecutor, submits that the Defendant must establish that it will be prejudiced if the stated case is not made. The balance of convenience and the proper disposal of the proceedings must be weighed up. 

Consideration 
6This application is made in relation to an interlocutory judgment on a voir dire concerning the admissibility of evidence in a sentence hearing where the Defendant has pleaded guilty to a charge. The voir dire concerned the nature of the evidence able to be considered on sentence, and the issue is the area of endangered ecological community cleared. I am not aware of any other cases in this Court where a stated case has been sought at this stage of a sentence hearing. 

7The Prosecutor referred to three cases which considered whether to apply for a stated case at different points in summary criminal proceedings before this Court. 

8Factors in Morrison v Peacock and Roslyndale Shipping Company Pty Ltd [2000] NSWLEC 32 considered by the trial judge included the importance of the point of law sought to be raised and the dearth of appellate authority in relation to the matters raised. In that case the prosecutor, being the Crown, was seeking to have a case stated after findings on guilt were delivered before final orders were made. The Court had no discretion because it was the Crown's application. 

9In Gosford City Council v Aliton Pty Ltd [2002] NSWLEC 138 a no case to answer application was made out by the defendant. In determining whether to state a case on that decision, in the exercise of his discretion Lloyd J considered he should not as there was no matter of general public importance raised. 

10In State Pollution Control Commission v Brownlie [1990] NSWLEC 86 an earlier version of s 5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act (s 5A(1A)) applied. Cripps J refused the application as he considered that the application for a stated case in the course of a hearing was premature, the matter had been allocated a number of hearing days and that this Court was established as a superior court of record to hear and dispose of proceedings in a summary manner. 

11Whether to grant a stated case must depend on the particular circumstances. The draft stated case concerns the admissibility of evidence which can go solely to the question of the area of endangered ecological community cleared in relation to the plea of guilty. The same general issues sought to be raised in the draft stated case can be raised in any subsequent appeal taken by the Defendant in these proceedings once sentence has been delivered. The exercise of the Court's discretion in the application of the Code in admitting expert reports in a particular case is not a matter of general public importance justifying a stated case at this stage. There is no particular saving of expense and delay whether I state the case now or the Defendant elects to appeal the case following the delivery of final sentence on the assumption that the Court of Criminal Appeal may well remit the matter back to this Court in either case. The Court has allocated a number of days to the determination of this matter and the efficient dispatch of Court business suggests these days should be used. There is no identified prejudice to the Defendant if I do not issue the stated case. These factors suggest that I should exercise my discretion to refuse the application for a stated case at this part heard stage of the sentence proceedings. 

Order 
12The Court makes the order that the Defendant's application for a stated case to the Court of Criminal Appeal is refused.

		27 February 2012",2012-02-20 00:00:00,NSW Land and Environment Court
2758672,RESTUCCIA v REGINA [2012] NSWCCA 15,"Judgment  1RS HULME J:  On 18 March 2011, this Applicant for leave to appeal was sentenced by King SC DCJ in respect of three offences.  Each was constituted by the supply - in this case deemed supply - of an indictable quantity of ecstasy or, to give it its scientific name, 3,4- methylenedioxymethylamphetamine.  The maximum penalty prescribed for each of the offences is imprisonment for 15 years and a fine, a penalty that applies to quantities up to 125 grams.  2The circumstances of the first offence were that on 7 March 2010 near the front entry to the ""Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade After-party"", the Applicant was found in possession of 61 ecstasy tablets weighing a total of 17.83 grams.  He was also found in possession of a pipette, a small glass bottle containing 22.5 grams of gammabutyrolactone and a mobile telephone containing as one of its ""received"" text messages an enquiry about his having pills available for supply at the Mardi Gras Party.  Possession of the gammabutyrolactone was the subject of a Form 1 and taken into account in the sentencing for possession of the 61 ecstasy tablets.  3The Applicant was arrested, charged but later released on conditional bail.  4The second offence was committed after the Applicant agreed to meet a police undercover officer at the Columbian Hotel in Oxford Street, Darlinghurst.  Around midnight on 26 March 2010, the Applicant supplied the officer with 10 ecstasy tablets weighing a total of 2.86 grams in return for the sum of $300.  Shortly thereafter, the Applicant was again arrested.  5Following his arrest, police conducted a search of the Applicant's bedroom in the house of his parents.  There, police found:-  (i) A resealable plastic bag containing approximately 30 ecstasy tablets weighing a total of 8.93 grams.  (ii) Six sets of digital scales.  (iii) A ""drug testing"" kit.  (iv) A number of other indicia of dealing in drugs.  (v) A little over 100 grams of cannabis leaf.  (vi) Tablets and fragments containing 2.7 grams of alprazolam.  (vii) Two valium tablets consisting of 0.3 grams of diazepam.  6The three last-mentioned items were included on a second Form 1 and taken into account when the Applicant was sentenced for the second offence.  The 30 ecstasy tablets found were the subject of the third offence charged.  7After allowing a 25% discount for the Applicant's plea, the sentences imposed by King DCJ were:-  (i) First offence - a fixed term of imprisonment for one year commencing on 26 February 2011.  (ii) Second offence - imprisonment for three years including a non-parole period of one year and six months, both such periods commencing on 26 August 2011.  (iii) Third offence - a fixed term of imprisonment for 18 months commencing on 26 August 2011.  8The effective sentence was thus one of three years and six months including non-parole periods totalling two years, his Honour concluding that the Applicant was substantially involved in drug dealing at the time of his commission of the offences and he regarded the fact that the Applicant was on bail at the time of the second and third offences as a significant aggravating feature.  9The sole ground of appeal is that the sentences for Counts 2 and 3 are manifestly excessive.  10The Applicant and his father gave evidence on sentence and also tendered were a pre-sentence report dated 28 October 2010 and a report from an educational and developmental psychologist.  There were significant inconsistencies between these various sources of information.  11The Applicant was born in January 1981.  He left school was he was 17, commenced, but at the time of sentence had not completed, a plumber and gasfitter course at TAFE and had worked for a period his Honour was not able to determine between leaving school and the commission of the offence.  12Included in the evidence which the Applicant gave was that, though he had commenced using illicit substances at about the age of 14 or 15, he ceased such use on 7 March 2010.  His Honour concluded that the later offences were thus clearly to obtain money.  Surprisingly, given the inconsistencies in evidence on other topics, his Honour accepted statements by the Applicant that the drugs the subject of the second and third charges were, in fact, acquired prior to 7 March.  His Honour said it was difficult to find there were good prospects for rehabilitation and the commission of the second and third offences indicated a significant disregard for compliance with the law.  The Applicant's record and the fact that, at the time of all of the offences he was on a good behaviour bond, confirms his Honour's view.  13That record included three charges of possession of a prohibited drug and in respect of the third of which he was fined in December 2008, driving with a middle range PCA, driving with a high range PCA, and two charges of driving whilst disqualified.  For the last of these offences, the Applicant on 30 April 2010, was placed on a one year good behaviour bond.  14The principal argument in support of the ground of appeal was that the second and third sentences were excessive, given the relatively small quantities of drugs the subject of the second and third charges.  However, both the legislature and the courts have made it clear that it is important that the sentences imposed for drug dealing have a substantial deterrent element in them.  It is apparent that the Applicant has not been deterred by sentences imposed in other cases, even though the illegality of his activities must have been brought home to him on the occasions when he was charged with drug possession offences.  15The Crown drew to the Court's attention two previous cases R v Tirtabudi [2004] NSWCCA 328 and Howarth v R [2010] NSWCCA 211.  In the first of these, the offender had been sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 44 months including a non-parole period of 22 months for two offences involving the supply of about 14 grams of ecstasy and methylamphetamine.  In the second, the sentences included a fixed term of two years for the supply of 39 ecstasy tablets and three years, including a non-parole period of 18 months, for the supply of 24 grams of methylamphetamine.  The report does not indicate the degree of accumulation. These cases demonstrate that the sentences imposed in this case were well within King DCJ's sentencing discretion, a view I had formed in any event.  16During the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the Appellant submitted that one basis upon which the appeal should be allowed is that the sentences on the second and third charges were disproportionate when compared with the sentence imposed on the first charge.  There are a number of answers to this submission.  Firstly, there is no principle of parity applying between the sentences imposed at the one time on one particular offender and counsel was not able to refer the Court to any authority which supported his submission.  A second answer is that at the time of the second and third offences not only was the applicant on bail but his arrest in respect of the first offence must have put him on full notice as to the illegality of the conduct IN which he was disposed to indulge.  His second and third offences were a contumelious breach of the law.  17Another matter which should be noted is the fact of the concurrency of the sentences imposed on the third offence with the sentence imposed on the second.  Prima facie that concurrency was unjustified and certainly if I had been disposed to interfere with the sentence imposed on the second offence I would have taken the view that there should be some accumulation by reason of the commission of the third offence.  18It follows that, while I would grant leave to appeal, the appeal should be dismissed.  19MACFARLAN JA:  I agree.  20GARLING J:  I also agree.  21MACFARLAN JA:  The orders of the Court are leave to appeal is granted.  The appeal is dismissed.

		22 February 2012",2012-02-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758674,Munro v ACP [2012] NSWSC 100,"Judgment 

1This is an appeal against the refusal of an application for the carrying out of a forensic procedure pursuant to Part 5 of the Crimes (Forensic Procedure) Act 2000 (the Act) by his Honour Magistrate George at the Hornsby Local Court on 18 April 2011. 

2The appeal is brought pursuant to s 115A(2) of the Act. A magistrate's refusal to make an order under the Act authorising the carrying out of a forensic procedure may be the subject of an appeal to this Court under Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 as if the refusal were an order dismissing a matter prosecuted summarily. Such an appeal is as of right, with the stipulation that it is on a ground that involves a question of law alone: s 56(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act . There is no issue that each of the grounds relied upon by the plaintiff involve such questions. 

3The second defendant, the Local Court of New South Wales, has filed a submitting appearance. For convenience, hereafter I will simply refer to the first defendant as the defendant. 

4The magistrate did not refuse the application after a hearing on the merits. Indeed, he did not engage with the merits of the application at all because he was not required to. An important feature of the application, and the appeal to this Court, is that it was not the first application that had been made in respect of the defendant. To explain, it is necessary to trace some history. 

5The defendant was charged on 2 August 2010 with having committed offences of indecent assault on 29 and 30 July 2010. The allegation is that he purported to ""accidentally"" bump into school girls around railway stations on the mid north shore and in doing so touched their breasts. The plaintiff contends that there are significant similarities in the manner in which the offences were committed. Two of the offences were captured on CCTV security cameras. There is limited evidence which is capable of identifying the defendant as the perpetrator. It is to the issue of identification that the forensic procedures the subject of the application were directed. Police also contend that the same type of offences were committed in very similar circumstances by a similarly described man in the same types of locations in the period October 2008 to October 2009. 

6Thus far, the only evidence available to police that tends to identify the defendant as the perpetrator is that of the manager of a local business that he frequented. She was shown still images derived from the CCTV footage and has made a statement to the effect that they depict the defendant. 

7An application was made by the plaintiff to the Local Court for the carrying out of a forensic procedure. It was heard and granted by her Honour Magistrate Stapleton at the Hornsby Local Court on 24 September 2010. This application was supported by a four page affidavit by the plaintiff. The forensic procedure sought in that application was stated to be, ""Photographs of the accused head and shoulders"". The taking of photographs ""of a part of a person's body, other than the person's private parts"" is within the definition of ""non-intimate forensic procedure"" in s 3(1) of the Act. These photographs were sought for use in identification procedures with complainants and eyewitnesses. Through oversight, police had failed to take photographs of the defendant when he was in custody following his arrest. 

8The defendant appealed against the making of the order. The appeal came before Pembroke J, sitting as vacation duty judge, on 27 January 2011. It was conceded by the plaintiff that there was a deficiency in the material before the magistrate and that the appeal should be allowed. His Honour made consent orders, including the quashing of the decision of the magistrate and substituting an order that the application was refused. The deficiency was that the material before the magistrate was incapable of satisfying the statutory requirement, that ""there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed an offence"": s 24 (3)(a) of the Act. There was nothing in the supporting affidavit about the local business manager having identified the defendant as the perpetrator. 

9It was on 4 February 2011 that the plaintiff made the second application which is the subject of the present proceedings. This time it was supported by a far more extensive affidavit (6 pages and about 170 pages of annexures comprised of witness statements (including that of the local business manager), transcripts of witness interviews, police notebook entries, still images from CCTV footage, and the like). The forensic procedures sought to be carried out in this application were: 

1. The taking of a photograph of the respondent's face (front and sides). 

2. The taking of a number of non intimate photographs of the respondent's body and body parts (face / arms / legs). 

3. The taking of measurements of the respondent's body and body parts (entire body / arms / legs / torso). 

10The second and third of these procedures was sought so that the resulting photographs and measurements could be submitted to a biomechanical engineer to see whether an expert opinion would support a proposition that the man depicted in the CCTV footage was the defendant. 

11The application came before Magistrate George at the Hornsby Local Court on 18 April 2011. Objection to the application was taken by senior counsel then appearing for the defendant. The objection was based upon the provisions of s 26(3) of the Act. The section is in the following terms: 

26 Application for order 

(1) An authorised applicant (but no other person) may apply to a Magistrate for an order under section 24 authorising him or her to arrange the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a suspect. 

(2) An application for an order must: 

(a) be made in writing, and 

(b) be supported by evidence on oath, or by affidavit, in relation to the matters as to which the Magistrate must be satisfied, as referred to in section 24 (1), and 

(c) specify the type of forensic procedure sought to be carried out, and 

(d) be made in the presence of the suspect (subject to any contrary order made by the Magistrate). 

(3) If a Magistrate refuses an application for an order authorising the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a suspect, the authorised applicant (or any other person aware of the application) may not make a further application to carry out the same forensic procedure on the suspect unless he or she provides additional information that justifies the making of the further application. (Emphasis added). 

12Written submissions were provided by senior counsel for the defendant. There were a number of documents annexed, including copies of the first application and the affidavit in support of it, together with a copy of the affidavit in support of the second application with portions underlined to indicate ""material which is over and above that which was contained in Ms Munro's Affidavit in support of the first application"". These documents conveniently enabled the magistrate to consider whether there was ""additional information that [justified] the making of the further application"". 

13The magistrate indicated at the outset of the hearing that he had read the written submissions and annexures. Counsel then explained certain aspects of the earlier appeal to this Court, which was relevant to whether there had been a previous refusal of a magistrate but made no other oral submissions. The police prosecutor was then invited to make submissions. 

14Before looking at what the prosecutor said, it is worth noting that the written submissions for the defendant sought to make three points: 

1. That the orders of Pembroke J should be regarded for the purposes of s 26(3) as amounting to a refusal of the first application by a magistrate. 

2. The same forensic procedure was the subject of both the first and current applications and therefore the operation of s 26(3) was attracted. In the alternative, the first of the three procedures sought was the same as that which was sought in the first application and so, if the other two points were made good, the application in respect of that procedure would be precluded by s 26(3). 

3. No ""additional information"", in the sense contemplated by s 26(3), had been provided in support of the current application. It was accepted that there was more information, but it was submitted that ""additional information"" in the context in which it appears in s 26(3) meant evidence that was not available to the police at the time of making the first application. A similar construction was given to ""additional relevant information"" in the s 62(1) of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 by Rothman J in Singh v Motor Accidents Authority of NSW (No 2) [2010] NSWSC 1443; [2010] 57 MVR 157 at [53]. The further information put forward in relation to the new application had been available to the police at the time of the first application. Accordingly, it was not ""additional information"". 

15The prosecutor submitted: 

""[I]t has to be conceded from the outset that this is a second application for basically the same application [sic]. And what prosecution or applicant is relying on is whether or not this is new information. And, certainly, ... (not transcribable) ... in the absence of decisions in relation to this aspect of the application. That is, the question is that after the application was refused, further application was made containing that information, is that new information."" 

16The prosecutor then made a submission in which he sought to persuade the magistrate that Singh v Motor Accidents Authority of NSW (No 2) was distinguishable on the basis that it involved construction of a provision in an entirely different statute which had entirely different objectives. He concluded by submitting that the application should be granted. 

17The magistrate immediately gave judgment: 

""It is certainly remarkable that when police have the defendant in custody in the first place, that nobody thought to take proper pictures at the time, when I am assuming that there was ample power available to do so. 

The application on is face, the original application and the current one, are for a non intimate procedure, which essentially comes down to photographing the defendant . Objective observers might say, ""Well, what's the problem with all of that?"" And the real issue, so far as I can see, is simply whether the effect of the Supreme Court judge, Pembroke J, whether the effect of his decision is to enliven the statutory provision which would prevent the bringing of a further application. 

In my view, the application before the Court today is ostensibly the same application that was considered by the Supreme Court. I am told that it was agreed at that point in time that the orders that were made should be made, but that does not move away from the implication that there is a statutory provision which is in place which bars magistrates from continuing to consider the same application. And the only other live issue would be whether the intervention of the Supreme Court counts as a magistrate's decision. It seems to me illogical to produce any other result. Certainly, the terms of the order that Pembroke J has made are in terms of a direction concerning the magistrate's decision, and to suggest that because it is made by the Supreme Court, it is not covered by s 26(3), I think is a little bit optimistic. 

This is an area which, quite plainly, has not been the subject of any close examination. But, it seems to me, that Parliament has put in place a provision here which is designed to stop repeated similar applications being made . As I have said, ostensibly whilst there are differences between the two applications, I do not think anybody can objectively conclude that what is being sought is different from what was first considered by Stapleton LCM and then latterly by Pembroke J. 

In the circumstances, I do not believe I have jurisdiction to consider this application, because the relevant statutory provision would prohibit the consideration of another similar application. 

In the circumstances, the application is refused on that basis."" (Emphasis added). 

18It can be gleaned from what his Honour said that he was well aware that this was a second application in the matter and that the question whether the applicant was entitled to make the application depended upon the provision in s 26(3). 

19It seems clear enough that the magistrate determined that this application was not materially different to the first application. He said that they were both ""for a non-intimate forensic procedure, which essentially comes down to photographing the defendant"". They were ""ostensibly the same"" and his Honour did not think that ""anybody can objectively conclude that what is being sought is different from what was first considered"". 

20That is the extent of his Honour's reasoning to the conclusion that he did not have jurisdiction to consider the application because s 26(3) prohibited the consideration of ""another similar application"". 

21I readily acknowledge the care with which one must approach the task of reviewing ex tempore reasons for judgment of a magistrate sitting in a busy Local Court. There are many statements to this effect in judgments of this Court on appeals from magistrates: see, for example, by Kirby P in Acuthan v Coates (1986) 6 NSWLR 472 at 478-479; by Mason P in Maviglia v Maviglia [1999] NSWCA 188 at [1]; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 343; (2006) 67 NSWLR 402 at [15] per Johnson J and by Sully J in L v Lyons & anor; B and S v Lyons & anor [2002] NSWSC 1199; (2002) 56 NSWLR 600 at [59] - [60]. 

22There are, however, some minimum requirements as to the giving of reasons. In Stoker v Adecco Gemvale Constructions Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 449, Santow JA observed: 

[41] It is clear that the duty to give reasons is a necessary incident of the judicial process. Without adequate reasons, justice has not been seen to be done, so that failure to give adequate reasons may be an error of law: Pettitt v Dunkley (1971) 1 NSWLR 376; Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 278-279 per McHugh JA; Mifsud v Campbell (1991) 21 NSWLR 725; Beale v Government Insurance Office of NSW (1997) 48 NSWLR 430. But the duty does not require the trial judge to spell out in minute detail every step in the reasoning process or refer to every single piece of evidence. It is sufficient if the reasons adequately reveal the basis of the decision, expressing the specific findings that are critical to the determination of the proceedings. 

23Moreover, Sully J observed in the course of his judgment in L v Lyons & anor; B and S v Lyons & Anor referred to above that: 

[59] ... None of the foregoing observations, I should perhaps stress, could excuse manifest error of law on the part of a magistrate ... 

24What fell for decision by the magistrate in the present case was whether the plaintiff was permitted to make the second application. The provisions of s 26(3) required consideration of three issues. 

25First, had there been a prior refusal by a magistrate of an application? It was, and remains, common ground that the order of Pembroke J quashed the order granting the first application and substituted a refusal so there was no difficulty with this issue. The magistrate accepted that proposition. 

26Secondly, was the application ""a further application to carry out the same forensic procedure""? The defendant submitted that it was. The prosecutor submitted that it was ""basically the same"" and focussed his submissions on the third issue. The magistrate determined that the second application was ""similar"" or ""ostensibly the same"" as the first. 

27Thirdly, if the answer to the second question was affirmative, it then had to be determined whether the applicant had provided ""additional information that justifies the making of the further application"". 

28There are two components to this: whether there is ""additional information"" and, if so, whether it ""justifies the making of the further application"". The first is a matter requiring objective assessment of the material put forward in support of the application and comparing it with that put forward in support of application(s) made in the past. The second is a matter for discretionary judgment. The present case was only concerned with the first component, but the second component should not be ignored. 

29The defendant conceded that there was more information but contended that ""additional"" meant material that was in addition to that which was available to the applicant at the time of the first application. The prosecutor may be understood to have submitted that the defendant's contention was incorrect and that there was in fact additional information that justified the further application. The magistrate did not refer to this issue, let alone determine it, at all. 


Grounds of appeal 

The plaintiff relied upon three grounds of appeal: 

""1. The learned magistrate erred in law when determining the construction of the term ""additional information"" as contained in s 26(3) of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000. 

2. The learned magistrate erred in law in determining that the Plaintiff did not provide additional information in support of an application for an order authorising the carrying out of a forensic procedure on the Defendant, pursuant to s 26(3) of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000. 

3. The learned magistrate erred in law in determining that s 26(3) of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000 prevented the Plaintiff from making an application for a final order authorising the carrying out of a non-forensic procedure on the respondent pursuant to s 24, namely the taking of measurements of the respondent's body and body parts."" 

Ground 2 

30It is convenient to deal with the second ground first because it is determinative. 

31The point advanced on behalf of the plaintiff was not so much that the magistrate decided that the material in the plaintiff's affidavit did not amount to ""additional information that justifies the making of the further application"" for the purposes of s 26(3). The submission was that ""the proceedings below never reached the stage where the learned Magistrate came to consider whether the additional information justified the making of the subsequent application"". 

32For the defendant, it was submitted by senior counsel that it was implicit in the magistrate's reasons that he determined that the ""additional information"" requirement was not satisfied. This was said to arise from his Honour having made what was obviously a reference to the provisions of s 26(3). The ""additional information"" point was raised in the submissions that had been read by his Honour and the prosecutor had made oral submissions about it. In the defendant's submission, his Honour must have been mindful of this controversy and must be regarded as having decided it adversely to the plaintiff. 

33The problem with this is that the magistrate did not say anything about the ""additional information"" point. He did not give any indication whether he accepted that there was ""additional information"". He did not indicate whether he preferred the construction advanced by either party. If his Honour did consider the point, it may be the case that he preferred the submissions for the defendant, but it also remains possible that he accepted the prosecutor's submission yet determined that it was not of a nature that justified the making of the further application. This, unfortunately, is a matter for speculation. 

34I am satisfied that error of law has been established, probably through the failure to consider a matter necessary for decision and to make a determination of that matter. If not that, it was through the failure to give any reasons concerning the determination made. 

35Whilst that is enough to determine the appeal it is appropriate to consider the other grounds as well, particularly in the light of the issues raised in the parties' submissions. 


Ground 1 

36The plaintiff submitted that the interpretation of a statutory provision begins with the ordinary and grammatical sense of the words used, having regard to their context and the legislative purpose: Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Territory Revenue [2009] HCA 41; (2009) 239 CLR 27 at [4] per French CJ. Reference should also be made to the judgment in the same case of Hayne, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ: 

[47] This Court has stated on many occasions that the task of statutory construction must begin with a consideration of the text itself. Historical considerations and extrinsic materials cannot be relied on to displace the clear meaning of the text. The language which has actually been employed in the text of legislation is the surest guide to legislative intention. The meaning of the text may require consideration of the context, which includes the general purpose and policy of a provision, in particular the mischief it is seeking to remedy. (footnotes omitted) 

37For the ""ordinary"" meaning of the word ""additional"", reference was made to the definition in the Macquarie Dictionary 4th ed (2005) of ""added, supplementary"". So, it was submitted that the term meant information that added to, or was supplementary to, that which was put forward in the earlier application. Whether the applicant was in possession of that information at the time of the earlier application was said to be irrelevant. 

38Other principles of statutory interpretation must be considered. There is the provision of s 33 of the Interpretation Act 1987 requiring preference to be given to a construction that would promote the purpose and object underlying the Act over one that would not promote that purpose or object. There is also the need to construe the provision in question so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the Act: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [69] per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. 

39Both parties referred to the fact that whilst the objectives of the Act are not explicitly stated, they have been the subject of judicial consideration. The judgment of Simpson J in Orban v Bayliss [2004] NSWSC 428 has often been referred to in other cases concerning the Act and both parties in the present matter relied upon the following passage: 

[30] The Forensic Procedures Act conferred new and unprecedented powers upon, inter alia , magistrates that would have the result of compelling persons suspected of criminal offences (including those against whom charges have not been laid) to cooperate in the investigation of the crime(s) of which they are suspected, and to provide, from their own bodies, evidence which may be used against them (and which, of course, may also be used to exonerate them). The Parliament was, in my view, seeking to maintain a delicate balance between preserving the traditional rights of citizens and individuals, including those suspected of crime, to decline to participate in investigations or to cooperate with investigating authorities, and the overall interests of the community and of justice in facilitating the investigation of crime, and the administration of justice, in securing the conviction of the guilty and the non-prosecution or acquittal of the not guilty. The Act was a specific response to scientific and technological developments, but in the context of valued traditional civil liberties. 

[31] The conditions that must be met before an order can be made demonstrate that the purpose of the legislation is not to enable investigating police (or other authorised persons) to identify a person as a suspect; it is to facilitate the procurement of evidence against a person who already is a suspect. 

40In the defendant's submissions, reference was also made to Walker v Budgen [2005] NSWSC 898; (2005) 155 A Crim R 416, where (at [28]) Hall J observed that Burchett J in Parker v Churchill (1985) 9 FCR 316, in relation to search warrant legislation, had referred to a Justice of the Peace (a fortiori, a magistrate) standing ""between the police and the citizen"". Hall J referred (at [17]) to what had been said by Simpson J in Orban v Bayliss . Later (at [53]), after referring to her Honour's characterisation of a ""delicate balance"", his Honour concluded that ""authorisation under the Act can only be granted strictly in accordance with its provisions"". Later, Simpson J said in JW v Detective Sergeant Karol Blackley [2007] NSWSC 799 at [31] that the ""provisions relevant to the making of a final order [are] rigid and demanding and very specific. No order may be made unless the requirements of s 25 are met"". 

41It was submitted for the defendant before the magistrate, and repeated in this Court, that ""the purposes of the Act can only be achieved, and the necessary delicate balance maintained, by construing the words 'additional information' in the manner previously advanced"", namely ""additional to the party relying upon it as a ground for the making of a further application"". In support of this it was submitted that whilst the words might be described as being of general application, because the statute impinges on fundamental rights recognised by the common law, they should be read down so as to protect those rights: see, for example, Bropho v State of Western Australia [1990] HCA 24; (1990) 171 CLR 1 at 17. 

42With respect, I do not accept that submission. Such a construction would give far greater emphasis to a matter on one side of the scales at the expense of the matter on the other side, and the ""delicate balance"" of which Simpson J spoke would be decidedly unbalanced. 

43It was submitted for the defendant that without such a construction, the Act would give police officers ""permission (and incentive)"" to always withhold some information relevant to the determination of the application so as to provide them with an alternative avenue (aside from an appeal to this Court) of re-agitating proceedings in the event of refusal. It was also submitted that this would serve to penalise diligent officers and reward the less diligent. 

44I prefer the plaintiff's submission in response to this. If magistrates were compelled to disallow applications where there was more information put forward but which had previously been available to the applicant, that would have a tendency to encourage police officers to burden magistrates with the entirety of what was available, perhaps even to the extent of providing entire briefs of evidence. In any event, it is inconceivable that the construction for which the plaintiff contends would encourage police officers to do anything less than put the most persuasive case forward in support of applications for the carrying out of forensic procedure. 

45The effect of the submissions for the defendant was that s 26(3) should be construed so as to make no allowance whatsoever for inadvertent errors or misjudgements. That proposition is not an attractive one. 

46Submissions were also made which invoked the ""principle of finality"" (reference was made, for example, to The Queen v Carroll [2002] HCA 55; (2002) 213 CLR 635) in support of the proposed narrow construction of ""additional information"" in s 26(3). I am not persuaded that it supports the contention at all. The provision contemplates that there can be second and subsequent applications for the carrying out of the same forensic procedures. Its effect is to limit the ability of an applicant to make repeated applications based on the same material. That is consistent with the notion of finality. There was no persuasive explanation why a subsequent application would offend the principle of finality if the additional information had previously been available to the applicant, but would not if that information had only become available after an earlier refusal. 

47The formulation requiring ""additional information that justifies the making of the further application"" is not unique to the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act . My research has not been exhaustive but it was used in s 12C Search Warrants Act 1985 (repealed), s 356J (repealed) Crimes Act 1900, s 64 Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002, and s 27M Terrorism (Police Powers) Act 2002. 

48The provision was inserted in the Search Warrants Act by the Search Warrants (Amendment) Act 1991. In support of the bill for the amending act, the then Attorney General, Mr Collins, said: 

""The present Act allows unlimited applications for a warrant to any justice on the same information. Proposed new section 12C will ensure that this cannot occur. Generally only one application to an authorised justice will be allowed. If the application is refused, a new application will only be accepted if the applicant provides additional information."" (New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 13 November 1991 at 4424). 

49Whilst the construction of a provision in legislation enacted in 2000 cannot be based upon what was said in a second reading speech in relation to different legislation enacted in 1991, I am prepared to accept that the explanation for the provision being inserted in the Search Warrants Act represents a reasonable view of the rationale for the legislature including the provision in s 26(3) in the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act . 

50The construction of the words ""additional information"" is, in my view, straightforward. They should be given their ordinary meaning. They require that in a subsequent application for the same forensic procedure the applicant must provide more information than was provided in support of the earlier application(s). An applicant is not entitled to make an application based solely upon information that was the subject of an earlier unsuccessful application. 

51There is nothing in such a construction which in any way detracts from the purpose or object underlying the Act and there is nothing that is inconsistent with the language and purpose of the Act as a whole. If a magistrate is satisfied that there is such additional information, then it will be necessary for the magistrate to then assess whether it is of such a nature, degree and quality that it justifies the making of the further application. 

52The plaintiff's submissions in relation to Ground 1, to reiterate, were that the magistrate erred by adopting the construction of ""additional information"" in s 26(3) that had been advanced on behalf of the defendant. If his Honour had done that, it would have been erroneous for the reasons just given. As I am not persuaded that his Honour fell into that error because there was no engagement with the issue at all, I would not uphold this ground. 


Ground 3 

53The issue raised by this ground is whether the magistrate erred in not identifying that the third forensic procedure sought in the plaintiff's application (measurements of body parts) was not part of the earlier application. It was not ""the same forensic procedure"" and so was not caught by the provisions of s 26(3) at all. The second forensic procedure sought (photographs of ""face/arm/legs"") had also not been sought in the earlier application. 

54The plaintiff's contention has merit. The taking of measurements was a different procedure to the taking of photographs. Both are within the definition of ""non-intimate forensic procedure"" with s 3(1) but are separately itemised: 

(h) the taking of a photograph of a part of a person's body, other than the person's private parts, 

and 

(j) the taking of a person's physical measurements (whether or not involving marking) for biomechanical analysis of an external part of the person's body, other than the person's private parts. 

55It was submitted for the defendant before the magistrate, and repeated in this Court, that the forensic procedure sought in the first and second applications were the ""same forensic procedures"" for the purposes of s 26(3). ""Forensic procedure"" is defined in s 3(1) as meaning ""an intimate forensic procedure"" or ""a non-intimate forensic procedure"". The first application sought a forensic procedure by way of a non-intimate forensic procedure. The second application also sought a forensic procedure by way of a non-intimate forensic procedure. Therefore, it was submitted that both applications sought the ""same forensic procedure"". Accordingly, s 26(3) applied to both applications in their entirety. 

56An alternative argument was put. The first of the three procedures sought in the present application was the same as that sought in the first application. So, s 26(3) applied at least to it. 

57Senior counsel for the defendant in this Court also made submissions on issues such as whether ""the definition of non-intimate forensic procedure is a single, indivisible class""; whether there existed ""recognisable sub-classes of non-intimate forensic procedures""; and whether there could be ""severability in relation to a magistrate's determination of identified component sub-classes of a single forensic procedure application"". Reference was made to the Act which were said to confine a magistrate's power in determining an application. There are provisions that apply in the event the application is approved and provisions that apply in the event it is refused. There is nothing in the Act authorising a magistrate ""to partially approve and partially refuse severable components of a single application"". 

58Simply because an application requests a number of different types of non-intimate forensic procedures (or intimate forensic procedures or a combination of the two), that cannot possibly mean they cannot each be dealt with on their merits. It is impracticable, inconceivable and would be inconsistent with any sensible construction of the provisions of the Act to hold that a magistrate only has power to grant all types of non-intimate forensic procedures sought in an application, or to refuse them all, and has no power to grant some and not others. 

59It is difficult to see how different types of the same categories of non-intimate forensic procedures (or intimate forensic procedures) need all be considered the same. To illustrate with an example away from the facts of the present case, one type of non-intimate forensic procedure is ""the taking from a person of the person's hand print, finger print, foot print or toe print"". One of the requirements for granting an application is that the magistrate must be satisfied that there are ""reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence"": s 24(3)(b). There might be information before the magistrate that indicates an offender left a hand print at the crime scene but no suggestion of any foot prints. An application that sought both a hand print and a foot print would have merit in relation to the former but none in relation to the latter. In those circumstances, and assuming other requirements are satisfied, it would be appropriate for the taking of a hand print to be authorised but not for the taking of a foot print. 

60In the present case, the first of the three procedures sought was the same procedure that had been sought in the first application. It required consideration of the matters in s 26(3). The other two procedures had not been sought in the first application. The application, insofar as it concerned those two procedures, should have been determined on its merits. 

61I am satisfied that the magistrate failed to appreciate that the second and third procedures sought in the application were different forensic procedures than what had been sought in the first application. It was erroneous to decline to deal with the application in relation to those matters. Whilst the appeal succeeds in relation to Ground 2, Ground 3 should be upheld as well. 

Orders 

1. Appeal allowed. 

2. The order made on 18 April 2011 refusing the application is set aside. 

3. The proceedings are remitted to the Local Court to be heard according to law. 

4. The first defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs. 

5. Liberty to apply within 7 days if any alternative order as to costs is sought.

2758676,R v Harpreet Bhullar [2012] NSWSC 93,"remarks on sentence
1HIS HONOUR: On 20 February 2012 the offender Harpreet Kaur Bhullar pleaded guilty before me to one count of accessory after the fact to the murder of Ranjodh Singh, contrary to s 349 of the Crimes Act 1900.  The Crown accepted that plea in full discharge of all counts on the indictment, which included a charge that on 29 December 2009 the offender did murder the deceased.  Upon the basis of the agreed facts and other evidence not the subject of contest, including an induced statement from the offender, the following facts are accepted for sentencing purposes.
2The deceased was residing in one-bedroom boarding house accommodation with Harpreet Singh in Wagga Wagga.  Both the deceased and Harpreet Singh used to live and work in Griffith but Harpreet Singh left Griffith around October or November 2009 due to issues involving considerable amounts of money that Harpreet Singh owed to workers whom he had contracted to work as farm hands on local farms in the Griffith area.  The deceased moved to Wagga Wagga in early December that year because he could not find work in Griffith.
3Harpreet Singh also owed money to the deceased for work that the deceased had performed for him.  Harpreet Singh would deal with farmers who required workers to harvest their crops.  Harpreet Singh would then engage others to perform this work.  One farmer named Russell Vardanega had also engaged Harpreet Singh who had in turn engaged the deceased, among others, to work on his farm.  Mr Vardanega had refused to pay Harpreet Singh due to some damage occasioned to his property and so the deceased was also not paid.
4Gurpreet Singh and the offender were living in a de facto relationship and residing at premises in Kookora Street, Griffith.  Harpreet Singh knew Gurpreet Singh and the offender, as he was responsible for finding them work in the Griffith area.  The deceased lived with Gurpreet Singh and the offender for a short time in 2009.
5On Sunday 27 December 2009, Harpreet Singh, the offender, Gurpreet Singh and the deceased were in Wagga Wagga, planning to return to Griffith the following day.  The deceased purchased a gift for the offender, which was handed to her in the presence of Gurpreet Singh and Harpreet Singh.  Later that day Harpreet Singh, Gurpreet Singh, the offender and the deceased travelled back to Griffith in a red 1995 Ford Falcon sedan, which was registered in the name of the offender.
6For Monday 28 December 2009, Harpreet Singh had planned a party in order to celebrate his birthday.  This took place that night at the offender's premises in Kookora Street, Griffith.  Everyone at the party was drinking alcohol with the exception of the offender.  Other friends were also there.
7At approximately 12.30am on 29 December 2009 the deceased left the premises and did not return.  When the offender gave an induced statement to police, she originally indicated that the deceased did not leave the premises.  She also stated that Harpreet Singh had told her and others to tell the police that the deceased had left and not to say that the deceased and Harpreet Singh had had a fight at the party.
8At about 2.45am on Tuesday 29 December 2009 a witness saw the offender's vehicle near the intersection of the Wilga Road and Main Road 80 at Willbriggie.  This is a rural area in a 100km/h zone but the vehicle was travelling slowly, which the witness described as unusual.  He could see that the vehicle contained three people, with one person seated in the rear on the passenger's side.  This sighting apparently occurred after the murder of the deceased.
9About five minutes later another witness travelling along the Wilga Road, approximately eight kilometres from the intersection with Main Road 80, saw three small spot fires not more than 30cm high and 15cm wide.  At 3.18am the offender's vehicle entered the Yambil Street Carwash in Griffith.  Harpreet Singh alighted from the rear passenger seat of the car whilst Gurpreet Singh alighted from the front passenger seat.  The offender was driving.  She opened her door but did not get out.  Harpreet Singh washed the car.  They all left a short time later.
10At 9.10am on Tuesday 29 December 2009 the body of the deceased was discovered on the north side of the Wilga Road approximately eight kilometres from the intersection with Main Road 80.  He was wearing only a white T-shirt, he wore no shoes and his hands and feet had been bound.  He was burnt beyond recognition.  It would appear that his throat had been cut and he had been stabbed as well.
11Between 4.00am and 5.00am Gurpreet Singh contacted the offender's employer and advised him that she was unable to attend work because they had all been to a party that night and she was too tired to work.  Later that morning Harpreet Singh travelled by bus to Wagga Wagga.  At 1.50pm on 29 December 2009 Gurpreet Singh and the offender drove her car back to the carwash where they thoroughly cleaned the boot and vacuumed the inside of the car.  They wiped around the boot seals as well.  This took about 18 minutes to complete.
12At about 3.00pm Gurpreet Singh drove the offender's vehicle to Pat's Tyres in Griffith where he sought to purchase four new tyres for the car.  Despite advice from the proprietor that new tyres were not needed, Gurpreet Singh insisted that they be changed.
13At about midnight on 29 December 2009 Gurpreet Singh and the offender attended the residence of the deceased's aunt in Griffith and advised her that the deceased left their residence around midnight and that they had not seen him since.  The next morning Gurpreet Singh travelled to Sydney.
14A description of some distinctive jewellery located on the deceased was released to the public.  On 31 December 2009 the deceased's aunt attended the Griffith police station to report her nephew missing.  He was later identified as the deceased.
15Police took statements from Harpreet Singh, Gurpreet Singh and the offender.  Inconsistencies emerged from these statements. Other information concerning movements of the offender's vehicle was received.  On the morning of 4 January 2010, Gurpreet Singh and the offender purchased a one way ticket to Sydney.  In Sydney they both purchased one way tickets to Nepal on Thai Airlines Flight TG 452.  They passed through customs but were arrested and removed from the plane.  They were later released but rearrested on 28 January 2010.  Numerous statements were taken from members of the Griffith Indian community indicating that Harpreet Singh operated as a standover man and had a reputation for violent and intimidating behaviour relating to workers operating in the agricultural labour market in the local Griffith area.
Induced statement
16On 15 December 2010 the offender gave an induced statement to the police.  She confirmed the matters to which reference has already been made.  She gave the following additional information that is particularly relevant for present purposes.
17The offender said that after midnight on the night of the party, and after she had gone to bed, Harpreet Singh came into her room asked her to drive him to Wagga Wagga.  Gurpreet Singh discussed this request with the offender, even though it is accepted that he was quite drunk at the time.  Ultimately they agreed to the request.  Harpreet Singh then joined them in the offender's car, bringing the deceased with him as well.  The deceased appeared to be walking with difficulty and needed assistance to do so.  Harpreet Singh and the deceased entered the rear seats of the car.  With Harpreet Singh directing, the offender drove the four of them towards Leeton.
18After travelling for 20 to 25 minutes, Harpreet Singh asked the offender to stop so that he could have a drink.  Harpreet Singh got out of the car and asked Gurpreet Singh to assist him to remove the deceased.  The deceased was unable to get out of the car and Harpreet Singh dragged him out.  The offender stayed in the car with the engine running and the lights on.  About ten minutes later Harpreet Singh and Gurpreet Singh returned to the car without the deceased.  The offender asked where he was.  Harpreet Singh said: ""I finished him"" or ""I finished the job"". The offender became very scared and frightened.  Harpreet Singh said: ""Do you have some tissues because I have blood on my hands?""
19Harpreet Singh told the offender then to drive him to Wagga Wagga.  The offender told him that she could no do so as she was frightened and confused.  Instead she drove back to Griffith.  She drove slowly but without stopping.  Harpreet Singh said: ""We have to get the car washed because there might be some blood on it because I opened the door and there might be some blood marks on the car"".  The offender drove to the carwash as earlier described.
20After the carwash the offender noticed that there was blood on Harpreet Singh's trousers.  He took off his trousers and soaked them in the bathroom.  She and Gurpreet Singh went to their bedroom but could not sleep.  She told Harpreet Singh that he could sleep in the other room.
21At about 8.15am Harpreet Singh knocked on her bedroom door and asked the offender to drop him at the bus stop.  Harpreet Singh told her and Gurpreet Singh that if anyone asked about the whereabouts of the deceased that they should say nothing of what occurred but tell any inquirer that he had just left the house.  After dropping Harpreet Singh at the bus stop, the offender and Gurpreet Singh went to the carwash as earlier described.  The car was also driven to be fitted with new tyres as Harpreet Singh told them that the tyres might have left marks at the scene where the deceased was killed.
Subjective factors
22The offender was born in March 1989 in Shaina, which is a small city in the Punjab region of India.  She is therefore almost 23 years of age and was only 20 years of age at the time of the events that give rise to these proceedings.  Her parents are still both alive and living in India.  She has an older sister who lives in Sydney and a younger brother.  Her mother is a housewife and her father is a farmer.
23The offender came to Australia in March 2008 when she was aged almost 19 years.  She had left school in India when she was 16 to help her mother with her housework.  In her culture it is customary for young girls to do so until they marry.  However, the offender found that her life was restricted and she felt helpless and depressed.  When she was 16 she unsuccessfully attempted suicide by self-immolation.  When she was 17 she attempted to hang herself from a ceiling fan.  As a result her parents decided to send her overseas.  She saw neither a psychologist nor a psychiatrist following these events and received no counselling.  When news of these events reached her sister in Australia, she was offered a place with her.
24In August or September 2007 the offender married.  The relationship was not close.  The offender's husband travelled to Australia to study cooking and the offender travelled here at that time.  They lived with the offender's sister in Sydney.  She then spoke no English.
25The offender's relationship with her husband deteriorated further.  The offender and her husband separated and the offender moved to Griffith in September 2008 in the hope of finding work.  She found accommodation with a group of Indians that included Gurpreet Singh.  She was apprehensive living in a house with men she did not know well.  She acquired work on a farm pruning grapevines.  Work was irregular.  She did tomato packing as well.  She earned about $400 to $500 per week.  She was able to pay for food and rent.
26In due course she formed a relationship with Gurpreet Singh.  He offered her the opportunity of staying at home while he worked.  She did this for about four months.  She made friends and was very happy during this time.
27Following her arrest she went to gaol.  She had never been in custody before that, either in Australia or anywhere else.  Bail was never granted.  She was very frightened.  She failed to appreciate the gaol culture, largely because of her lack of English and ended up in conflict with other prisoners and the prison officers.  She had no way of easily learning the rules and found life in custody to be harsh, confusing and correspondingly frightening.  She was alone in a cell for the first month.  She missed her family.  She found the food strange, especially as a vegetarian.  She had no contact with anyone who spoke her language.  She sat alone and cried for her first month in gaol.
28In the middle of 2010 the offender commenced to learn English.  Her teacher did not converse in her language so the process was particularly difficult.  However, she persevered and now is able to speak English and write a little as well.  She has been employed within the gaol since almost as soon as she was taken into custody and has continued with that work up to the present.  She has also completed a computer course and topped the class.  The offender has high hopes for her future and intends to teach English upon her eventual return to India.
29The offender gave evidence before me.  She expressed considerable remorse with respect to the death of the deceased and spoke of her concern for the deceased's family, especially his mother, in the circumstances as they have transpired.  She also expressed regret for providing misleading information to the police when she was first interviewed.
Objective gravity
30It was submitted on behalf of the offender by Ms Yehia SC that the offence was at the lower end of seriousness for offences of this type.  In this respect I was asked to take account of the fact that her conduct consisted in a series of low level acts that included driving the deceased and Harpreet Singh to the countryside some 20 to 25 kilometres from Griffith.  She then drove the car to the carwash in the early hours of the same morning.  She did not wash the car herself but remained seated within.  The following afternoon she assisted Gurpreet Singh to clean the inside of the car.  She later gave a false account of her involvement.  She was present when Gurpreet Singh purchased new tyres for her car at the behest of Harpreet Singh.
31Ms Yehia emphasised that the offender was not involved in harbouring Harpreet Singh or attempting to disguise his identity.  She played no role in disposing of the body of the deceased or of a murder weapon.  Such conduct is not unusual in cases of this type and tends to characterise an offender's conduct as at the higher end of the scale of criminality.  The present case is to be contrasted with such cases.  Moreover, the offender had no criminal motivation for her involvement in the events leading to the death of the deceased and was not otherwise concerned in some associated anterior criminal enterprise.  Indeed it would appear, and I accept, that the offender had no appreciation or understanding of what Harpreet Singh intended for the deceased until after it had occurred.  Apart from her relative youth and apparent naivete, the overriding explanation for her role in these events is directly related to the character and characteristics of Harpreet Singh, to which I now turn.
32I am asked to accept that Harpreet Singh is a violent and dangerous individual with a propensity for and history of intimidation and violence within the local Indian community within which he circulated.  Considerable material has been tendered in aid of that contention, to the particular details of which it is unnecessary to refer.  It is sufficient to note that farmers and labourers in and around the Griffith area have complained to the police on several occasions about the conduct of Harpreet Singh.  He is alleged to have threatened to kill people.  He has attacked residential properties occupied by people with whom he has had disputes about money.  Apprehended violence orders have been taken out against him.  He has been convicted for an offence involving violence.
33The offender herself set out in some detail her experience with the violent propensities of Harpreet Singh.  She understood that he was prepared to ""fix"" people, meaning kill them, if the circumstances as he saw them required it.  He was regularly in disputes concerning the non-payment of money to contractors.  There is other material to indicate an ongoing period of harassment of Mr and Mrs Vardanega by Harpreet Singh involving threats by him to kill them and members of their family.  These matters came to the attention of police and I have been provided with statements and other documents that record these incidents at some length.  I accept all of this material for present purposes as supporting the proposition that Harpreet Singh had the violent propensities of which the offender has given evidence and that her role in the subject events was significantly inspired by the fear for her own safety that her knowledge of Harpreet Singh engendered.
Assistance to authorities and early plea
34The offender pleaded guilty to the current offence at the first available opportunity.  The Crown uncontroversially accepts this.
35The offender has also given an undertaking to give evidence in the Crown cases against Gurpreet Singh and Harpreet Singh who are each charged with the murder of the deceased but who are to be tried separately.  The trial of Gurpreet Singh is now scheduled to commence later today.  The trial of Harpreet Singh is due to commence in the middle of the year.  Ms Yehia has submitted that a discount in the order of 45 to 50 percent is appropriate in this case for the combined effect of the offender's early plea and her undertaking to give assistance to the authorities as a witness in the trials to which I have just referred.  The Crown accepts that this submission has merit.
The proper sentence
36I was referred to considerable authority and to helpful statistics published by the Judicial Commission of NSW relating to like offences.  These included, but were not limited to, R v Dileski [2002] NSWCCA 345; (2002) 132 A Crim R 408; R v Jin [2011] NSWSC 169; R v Fennell [2011] NSWSC 489; and R v Cowen [2008] NSWSC 104.   In the latter case, Buddin J helpfully summarised some of the principles that apply in a case of this sort.  His Honour set these out at [15] - [26].  At [27], in terms that are, with obvious factual exceptions, somewhat informatively redolent of the present case, his Honour recorded the following:
""[27] The offender is entitled to have weighed in her favour a number of matters which mitigate the otherwise appropriate sentences. First, there are her pleas of guilty which were entered, as I have indicated, at the first opportunity which was available to her. Moreover, after some prevarication, she made admissions to police which effectively guaranteed that she would be convicted of these offences. In those circumstances, and because of the views which she expressed to the authors of the pre-sentence report and the psychological report respectively, the offender is entitled to a finding that she has accepted responsibility for her actions for which she is suitably contrite. Furthermore, somewhat unusually she entered her pleas before knowing of the outcome of the proceedings against the principal accused which have not yet commenced. It is at least theoretically possible that the verdicts in those trials could have been of assistance to her in her own proceedings. It goes without saying of course that the principal accused remain entitled to the presumption of innocence. Secondly, the offender is entitled to a finding that she is otherwise of good character. Thirdly, I am of the view that the offender enjoys good prospects of rehabilitation, particularly if she overcomes her dependency upon alcohol."" 
37Although the present offender has not had the advantage of, or the opportunity to obtain, a report concerning her mental state from an appropriate medical or forensic specialist in the field, I am in any event satisfied that she is contrite and remorseful in the way that I have indicated.  Moreover, the offender has no drug or alcohol related problems of any sort, has no criminal record and is entitled to a finding that she is in all respects otherwise of good character.  It follows from this that she has what I consider to be excellent prospects of rehabilitation and presents with no obvious or discernible indication of any likelihood of reoffending.
38It was contended on the offender's behalf that having regard to the fact that she has already served 2 years and 25 days on remand since she was taken into custody on 28 January 2010 that a sentence of that length was an appropriate one in all of the circumstances, meaning that she should immediately be released,.  I note that the Crown did not contend otherwise and indeed accepted, quite properly in my view, that such a submission was appropriate.
39It follows from all of the matters to which I have referred, namely the reduced gravity of the offender's criminal conduct, in combination with her favourable subjective features, and my finding that the offender was motivated by fear of Harpreet Singh, who is clearly capable of extreme and unpredictable acts of violence, that I am presented with a somewhat wider range of realistic sentencing options in respect of the offence charged.  In so saying, I am mindful of and take into account the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
40I also observe, retrospectively, that the conditions under which the offender has served time in custody to date would, in other circumstances, attract attention as potentially more onerous and difficult than would have been the case for an incarcerated offender or prisoner on remand whose first language was English and whose family were local and able to offer physical and emotional support.  These things have conspired to make the offender's time in custody so far more difficult than might ordinarily be the case and notionally increase the significance of the time already served.
Sentence
41In respect of the offence of accessory after the fact to murder I sentence the offender to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 25 days.  That sentence will be taken to have commenced on 28 January 2010 and to have expired today.  It follows that the offender is entitled to be released immediately.
42I note that the offender's status for immigration purposes is described now as an illegal non-citizen.  Whatever may be the specific ramifications of that troubled expression, it carries with it the potential consequence of immediate deportation.  I am however informed by counsel for both sides that the offender can be confidently expected to be issued with what is described as a criminal justice visa, which will ensure that she is entitled to remain in Australia for as long as her promise to give evidence in trials to which I have referred remains undischarged.  I note further that the Crown holds no fears that the offender will not honour her undertaking to remain in Australia to give this evidence, and that she has in any event offered forthwith to surrender her passport to the police.  It is expected that she will reside with her sister in Sydney.

		02 August 2012",2012-02-20 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758680,Derbas v R [2012] NSWCCA 14,"Judgment 

1Meagher JA : This is an appeal brought by the Attorney General under s 5F(1)(a) and (2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against an interlocutory order made by King DCJ on 24 February 2011 rejecting a claim to public interest immunity from production of a document. 

The issue in this appeal 

2That order was made in proceedings brought against the first respondent ( Accused ) for a number of offences related to items found at his home in Telopea Street, Punchbowl on 23 November 2008. Those items included a quantity of cocaine and two firearms seized during the execution of a search warrant. The search warrant was issued in the early hours of 23 November 2008 following the making of an application by Detective Paul O'Neill under s 7 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002. That application ( Application ) was in the form prescribed by cl 4(1)(a) of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Regulation 2005 and contained, in a narrative form, a statement of the ""grounds"" relied upon in support of the issue of the warrant. 

3The primary judge rejected a claim made by the Commissioner of Police ( Commissioner ) that no access be granted to any part of the Application on the ground that the document was subject to immunity from disclosure in the public interest. That claim was made on the basis that production of the Application would disclose the identity of a police informer. 

4The primary judge ordered that a version of the Application, limited (by masking the rest of the document) to the part of the ""grounds"" relied upon in support of the Application which is set out in confidential [32] of his reasons for judgment, be produced to the parties. 

5The primary judge's reasons were issued in two forms - a ""Confidential"" judgment and a ""Public Redacted Version"". Where a paragraph of the primary judge's reasons is confidential, and redacted in the public version, I will refer to that paragraph as ""confidential"", as I have done above with confidential [32]. It is possible in these reasons to deal sufficiently with the arguments of the parties without subverting the immunity which is the basis of the proceedings: cf DPP v Smith (1996) 86 A Crim R 308 at 311 where a part of the Court's reasons had to be given in a confidential appendix to the judgment. 

Does the common law or the Evidence Act apply to the claim to public interest immunity? 

6The primary judge dealt with the claim for public interest immunity by reference to the common law. The Attorney submitted that the claim should have been determined by reference to the provisions of Part 3.10 of the Evidence Act 1995. The Attorney also submitted that nothing turned on this point, because, it was submitted, s 130 of that Act reflects the common law position. In my view, for the reasons which follow, the primary judge was correct to address the application for immunity by reference to common law principles. 

7The application for immunity from production was made in respect of documents required to be produced to the District Court pursuant to a subpoena to produce addressed to the Registrar of the Local Court of New South Wales at Mt Druitt and issued at the request of the Accused in the proceedings R v Derbas . In accordance with the terms of that subpoena, that Registrar produced to the District Court documents, which included the Application. The Commissioner sought leave to be heard in those proceedings and, by notice of motion filed on 2 December 2010, sought orders that access to the Application not be granted to either party to the proceedings. 

8Thus, the question before the primary judge was whether inspection should be permitted to a document produced to the District Court by the Registrar of the Local Court at Mt Druitt. The question was not whether that document should be admitted into evidence in the proceedings or in any application in the proceedings. Therefore, s 130 did not in its terms apply. Nor did s 131A operate to require the primary judge to determine the Commissioner's objection by applying the provisions of s 130. That is because s 131A only applies if the ""person"" required to produce the document is ""the person"" who objects to the provision of the document or giving of information: s 131A(1)(a), (b). In State of New South Wales v Public Transport Ticketing Corporation [2011] NSWCA 60 at [26]-[32] the person producing documents by way of discovery (the Public Transport Ticketing Corporation) and the person making the claim for immunity (the State) were distinct juristic entities, with the result that ss 130 and 131A were not engaged. That is also the position here. The person producing the documents (the Registrar) and the person making the claim for immunity (the Commissioner) were not the same. 

The relevant circumstances 

9Before addressing the grounds on which the Attorney challenges the decision of the primary judge, it is necessary to summarise the relevant circumstances. 

10Immediately before the warrant to search the Accused's home was applied for, the police had executed a search warrant at the home of the Accused's cousin, Shadi Derbas, which was also in Telopea Street, Punchbowl. 

11The cocaine and firearms found at the Accused's home were in a shoebox and inside a bag which was in the Accused's bedroom. During the execution of the search warrant and subsequently in an electronically recorded interview, the Accused made a number of admissions. Specifically, he stated that the cocaine was for his ""personal use"" and that the firearms had been stored in the bedroom for various periods of between six months and one year. 

12The charges brought against the Accused, following the discovery of those items, include supplying a prohibited drug (cocaine) contrary to s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The deeming provision in s 29 is relied upon for that offence. Accordingly, if the Accused is shown to have possessed more than a traffickable quantity, to successfully defend the charge he must prove that he possessed the cocaine ""otherwise than for supply"": R v Carey (1990) 20 NSWLR 292. 

13Before the primary judge, counsel for the Accused outlined his client's defences as follows (at [12]): 

"" · The accused did not know what was in the bag; 

· He was forced several days before the search to temporarily hold the bag by his cousin, Shadi Derbas; 

· The admissions were false; 

· The admissions were made because of the accused's fear of Shadi Derbas, a well known and dangerous criminal; and 

· That it is known to the investigating Police that the admissions are false."" 

14The evidence said to be available to support the Accused's contentions was summarised by the primary judge (at [17]): 

"" · The police told the accused and his solicitors that they would be prepared to give evidence that he was holding the bag for Shadi. They would not have agreed to that unless they believed it. 

· There is forensic evidence on the goods found which is linked to Shadi Derbas. There is no forensic evidence linked to the accused. 

· There is also forensic evidence linked to one of the Dib brothers. It seems that the police believe that Shadi Derbas obtained the goods, or some of them, from one or more of the Dibs. 

· The ammunition in the bag found in the accused's home is suitable for a gun found at Shadi Derbas's premises. 

· The ammunition in the bag was in a green sock. The matching sock was noted to be at Shadi Derbas's house. 

· The police accept that Shadi Derbas is dangerous and that the accused and his family were being threatened. Such a scenario would only arise in circumstances where Shadi Derbas was the source of the illicit material. 

· The accused, a fully employed butcher, is in a position to adduce evidence of good character. 

· Evidence would be adduced from the police that a modus operandi of the 'Telopea Street Boys', a Middle Eastern organized crime group of which Shadi Derbas is a senior member, was to have people like the accused hold illicit material."" 

15A number of these matters had been communicated to the Accused's solicitor by Detective O'Neill or a Detective Ryan Jeffcoat. The primary judge set out (at [19]) excerpts from the conversations in which that occurred. 

Evidence admitted by leave on the appeal 

16Subsequent to the decision of the primary judge and before the hearing of this appeal, two signed statements of Detective O'Neill were provided to the Accused. Those statements set out what Detective O'Neill was told, by a ""confidential police source"", which led to the application for the issue of a warrant to search the Accused's premises. His statement of 8 June 2011 includes the following: 

""10. On the 23 November [2008], I was given information from a confidential police source to the effect that: 

a. two firearms and an amount of cocaine were stored at [No.] Telopea Street Punchbowl; 

b. the items were stored there as a security measure to minimise the loss to the items' owners if police searched a home within the street; 

c. the items were stored in the accused bedroom; and 

d. the items were not owned by the accused at any time. 

I will refer to the information in sub paras. (a) - (d) above in this statement hereon as 'the information'. I believed the information to be accurate. 

11. As a result of the information, I applied for a search warrant for [No.] Telopea St Punchbowl at 4.30am on 23 November [2008]. At no time, including at the time when I was given the information referred to in para.1, was I given any specific information by the confidential source about the accused state of knowledge that firearms and cocaine ('the illicit goods') were stored at the accused premises. I am also not aware of any police intelligence about his state of knowledge. I also wasn't given any information about how long the illicit goods had been stored at the accused premises. 

12. I am aware, from both my experience outlined above and from my knowledge of police intelligence, that one of the methodologies used by the owners of illicit items (such as firearms and illegal drugs) on Telopea Street is the 'safe house' methodology. That methodology typically involves the following steps: 

a. illicit items, such as illegal drugs and firearms, are stored on the street in the house of someone other than the owner; 

b. that house is usually a house close to the owner's house so that the items can be quickly accessed if needed urgently. This is particular so in the case of firearms; 

c. that house is also usually the house of an occupant or occupants who are not well-known to police as being actively involved in organised criminal activities; and 

d. the illicit items may be, but are not necessarily, moved around between houses for protection of the items. 

13. I believe that this is precisely the methodology that was adopted in this case, leading to the accused having the illicit goods in his possession and the discovery of the illicit goods when the search warrant was executed."" 

17Paragraph 4 of his statement of 1 July 2011 says: 

""4. On 23 November 2008, I was given information by a confidential source as referred to in my statement dated 8 June 2011. On the basis of the information provided to me by the confidential source and on the basis of confidential police intelligence, I believe that: 

a. Shadi Derbas was given the responsibility for holding drugs and firearms (together, 'the illicit goods') but he did not own them. 

b. The illicit goods were given to Shadi to store by two other people (one of whom was a resident of Telopea Street and the other of whom was a frequent visitor to the street). 

c. Shadi Derbas divided the illicit goods as a security measure, consistent with para. 10(b) of my statement dated 8 June 2011. 

d. The accused was given some of the illicit goods to store by Shadi Derbas but the accused did not own them."" 

18Those two statements were admitted by leave under s 5F(4) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 as additional evidence able to be considered by this Court in the event that it concluded that the primary judge had erred and was required to make its own ruling on the question of immunity pursuant to s 5F(5)(b). 

The grounds of appeal 

19The Attorney relies upon two grounds of appeal. The first is that the primary judge erred when conducting the balancing exercise required for the purpose of determining whether any part of the Application should be disclosed. It is said that the primary judge did not address what assistance the disclosure of the identity of the police informer would be to the Accused in answering the case against him. It is also said that, when undertaking that balancing exercise, the primary judge had regard to irrelevant matters including the potential consequences to the police informer of his or her identity being disclosed: see confidential [43]-[45]. The second ground is that the primary judge erred, before undertaking that balancing exercise, in not requiring further evidence of matters which he regarded as relevant but about which he was not satisfied on the evidence led by the Commissioner: see confidential [41]. 

Relevant principles 

20The general principle was stated by Gibbs ACJ in Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43; (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 38-39. 

""The general rule is that the court will not order the production of a document, although relevant and otherwise admissible, if it would be injurious to the public interest to disclose it. However the public interest has two aspects which may conflict. These were described by Lord Reid in Conway v. Rimmer (43), as follows: 

'There is the public interest that harm shall not be done to the nation or the public service by disclosure of certain documents, and there is the public interest that the administration of justice shall not be frustrated by the withholding of documents which must be produced if justice is to be done.' 

It is in all cases the duty of the court ... to decide whether a document will be produced or may be withheld. The court must decide which aspect of the public interest predominates, or in other words whether the public interest which requires that the document should not be produced outweighs the public interest that a court of justice in performing its functions should not be denied access to relevant evidence. In some cases, therefore the court must weigh the one competing aspect of the public interest against the other, and decide where the balance lies."" 

21As is pointed out in Alister v The Queen [1984] HCA 85; (1984) 154 CLR 404, where a party seeks the production of and access to documents in respect of which a claim to immunity is made, the party seeking access first must demonstrate a legitimate forensic purpose for having the documents produced. It is only in the event that such a purpose is demonstrated, that both aspects of the public interest require consideration by the undertaking of the balancing exercise and, when doing so, the Court may inspect any documents produced: Alister v The Queen at 412, 414, 438-439, 456; Air Canada v Secretary of State for Trade [1983] 2 AC 394 at 436, 439; R v Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14 at 18-19; Attorney-General for New South Wales v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667 at 675-676, 681, 690. 

22It has long been recognised that there is a public interest in the protection against disclosure of the identity of police informers. The leading English cases include Marks v Beyfus (1890) 25 QBD 494 and D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children [1978] AC 171. In the latter case the practice which had developed by the time of Marks v Beyfus was described as having hardened ""into a rule of law"" that the informer's identity should not be disclosed ""except where upon the trial of a defendant for a criminal offence disclosure of the identity of the informer could help to show that the defendant was innocent of the offence"": per Diplock LJ at 218. 

23In Cain v Glass (No. 2) (1985) 3 NSWLR 230, McHugh JA (with whom Kirby P agreed on this question) said of that rule (at 248): 

""... the courts in this State should continue to apply the rule that no question of weighing competing public interests arises when a claim is made that the name of a police informer should be disclosed. The rule is absolute and is relaxed only 'where upon the trial of a defendant for a criminal offence disclosure of the identity of the informer could help to show that the defendant was innocent of the offence'. I have stated the exception in the language of Lord Diplock in D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (at 218). In the same case Lord Simon of Glaisdale said (at 232) that the sources of police information 'must be forthcoming when required to establish innocence in a criminal trial."" 

Priestley JA considered (at 242-243) that the court was still required to undertake a balancing exercise of the competing interests. 

24As this passage from McHugh JA's judgment shows, the exception to the informer rule has been described in different ways. In Marks v Beyfus Lord Esher MR (with whom Lindley LJ agreed) described it (at 498) as being that disclosure should be made where the judge is of the opinion that ""it is necessary or right in order to shew the prisoner's innocence"". Bowen LJ (at 500) said the exception applied when the judge ""saw that the strict enforcement of the rule would be likely to cause a miscarriage of justice"" because of the risk of innocent people being convicted. 

25In DPP v Smith (1996) 86 A Crim R 308 this Court said (at 311-312) with reference to these cases that there was powerful authority for the proposition that, at common law, when a claim for immunity from production is made in respect of the identity of a police informer, the court before whom the claim is made does not undertake for itself, afresh, a balancing exercise, weighing one interest against the other because that balance has already been struck and is reflected in the various statements of the exception to the rule. 

26As this Court also noted in DPP v Smith , there are contrary views as to the extent to which a weighing of the competing interests is still required when a claim is made to protect the identity of a police informer. Those contrary views have been stated in this Court: see R v Meissner (1994) 76 A Crim R 81 at 88; and in other intermediate appellate courts: see Jarvie v Magistrates Court of Victoria at Brunswick [1995] 1 VR 84 at 89-90; R v Werner Paul Roberts [2004] VSCA 1; (2004) 9 VR 295 at [103]; Haydon v Magistrates Court of South Australia [2001] SASC 65; (2001) 87 SASR 448 at [13]-[18]; R v McKelliff [2004] SASC 63; (2004) 87 SASR 476 at [20]-[27]; and Australian Securities and Investment Commission v P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 123; (2008) 247 ALR 646 at [22]-[28]. It is not necessary in this case to resolve these different views because on either approach the primary judge erred in the exercise he undertook. 

27As Doyle CJ notes in Haydon v Magistrates Court of South Australia (at [17]), on either approach the court is required to make an assessment of the significance to the defence case of the material which identifies the police informer and the need to disclose his or her identity. In DPP v Smith (at 311-312) the rule was described as requiring non-disclosure except where disclosure could help show that the accused is not guilty. In Jarvie v Magistrates Court of Victoria , Brooking J considered (at 89-90) that the balance would incline in favour of disclosure once it was demonstrated that ""there is good reason to think that disclosure of the informer's identity may be of substantial assistance to the defendant in answering the case against him"". The latter formulation was adopted in R v Meissner at 88; R v Mason (2000) 77 SASR 105 at [36]-[45]; Haydon v Magistrates Court of South Australia at [29]-[31], [118]; and R v McKelliff at [26]. 

28An assessment of the significance of the material which identifies the police informer directs attention to why disclosure is required to avoid the likelihood of substantial prejudice to the accused. The circumstances in which that may be the case include that mere disclosure of the identity of the informer will help to show that the accused is innocent, that disclosure is necessary to adduce evidence of information which will help to show that the accused is innocent and that disclosure will lead to the production of other evidence which will have that consequence: Cain v Glass (No. 2) at 250-251; R v Mason at [38]-[44]. 

29Another factor to be taken into account, when addressing the exception to the rule and balancing the competing public interests, is the stage which the criminal proceedings have reached. In Cain v Glass (No. 2) the question was whether the exception applied to committal proceedings. McHugh JA (with whom Kirby P agreed) concluded (at 251) that the rule applied ""at all stages of criminal proceedings"" including the committal stage and that ""(r)ejection of the claim at one stage will not preclude an application at a subsequent stage"". At each stage it was necessary to consider the question being addressed and whether, in that context, disclosure of an informant's identity would assist the defendant. At the trial stage it is sufficient to require disclosure ""that the jury might reasonably think that the evidence which is likely to result from the disclosure, will lead to an acquittal"" (at 251). 

30The authorities also make clear that for the non-disclosure rule to apply or the public interest against disclosure to prevail, it is not necessary to show the existence of any real or imminent threat or danger to the particular informer in the event of disclosure. That is because the public interest and rationale for the rule is to ensure that sources of information which assist police in discharging their duty of preventing and detecting crime do not dry up: D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children at 218, 232; Cain v Glass (No. 2) at 233-234, 247; DPP v Smith at 311. That interest is put at risk if the anonymity of those sources is not respected and protected. In R v Mason Bleby J noted (at [29]-[31]) that the existence of a threat to the informer is not a condition precedent to the operation of the informer rule. The same point was emphasised by McHugh JA in Cain v Glass (No. 2) (at 253-254) when addressing whether it was relevant to consider the safety of police informers who were witnesses: 

""... the anonymity of the informants is entitled to be protected whether or not they are likely to be in danger. It is precisely because informants may often be in danger that the public interest requires that their anonymity should be protected. It is not for individual judges or magistrates to weigh up the competing public interest. The law has already done so. The public interest always requires the protection of the informant unless disclosure will assist in the protection of the liberty of the subject in criminal proceedings."" 

There was error on the part of the primary judge 

31The primary judge approached the claim to public interest immunity by addressing first whether the Accused had a legitimate forensic purpose in having access to the Application or at least parts of it. He concluded that the Accused had demonstrated such a purpose for obtaining production of the Application because it was ""on the cards"" that it would materially assist his case that he only recently had come into possession of the cocaine and firearms and did so because he was forced to store them by his cousin, Shadi Derbas: [21], [22]. 

32The primary judge did not err in so concluding. The subpoena was issued in August 2010 and sought the production of documents including the Application. By that time those acting for the Accused had been informed by the police of the matters set out in [14] above. The accused was aware that the police had received information from a confidential source which was relied upon to obtain the issue of a search warrant in relation to prohibited drugs and firearms offences. It was also known that any application for the issue of a search warrant would have had to set out the grounds relied upon to support its issue. On the Accused's case, there were issues as to when and in what circumstances he had come to be in possession of the cocaine and firearms and as to the basis upon which he held them. Where it was known that the police had received information that he held those items, it was ""on the cards"" that the Application would set out the basis upon which the police believed that he had possession of the cocaine and firearms and their understanding of the circumstances in which he had come to do so: see Carroll v Attorney General for New South Wales (1993) 70 A Crim R 162 at 181-182; Attorney General for New South Wales v Chidgey [2008] NSWCCA 65; (2008) 182 A Crim R 536 at [64]-[68]. 

33The primary judge then undertook the process of balancing ""the competing interests"" in deciding whether to require production of the Application or any part of it to the court: [23]. With respect to the material extracted in confidential [32], he addressed whether the information contained in that part, which included the identity of a police informer, was ""relevant"" to any of the matters raised or proposed to be raised by the Accused by way of defence. He concluded (at [46]): 

""[T]he interest of the accused in being provided with information clearly relevant to the expressed defence substantially outweighs any public interest in the information not being disclosed. That is, that ... access to ... that portion ... of the Application as set out at paragraph 32 above, is in the interests of justice and relevant to establishing the innocence of the accused."" 

The primary judge then considered the public interest in the information not being disclosed. When doing so he took into account as relevant his views about the possible consequences for the informer of the disclosure of his or her identity: confidential [43], [44] and [45]. 

34The primary judge did not address the significance of the identity of the police informer to the conduct of the Accused's defence and the need to know that identity at this stage of the proceedings. Specifically, he did not consider whether, apart from the identity of the informer, there was other information contained in confidential [32] which was not already available to the Accused or why it would be of substantial assistance to the Accused to know the identity of the informer at this stage of the proceedings. Nor did the primary judge consider whether there was some other reason why the Accused should have access to part of the Application at this time. 

35It was not sufficient for the primary judge to consider, as he did, whether the information contained in confidential [32] was relevant in the sense that it supported the defences outlined on behalf of the Accused. Ultimately it was necessary to assess the significance of the identity of the informer and the other information in confidential [32] to the Accused's ability to pursue those defences in the proceedings. The primary judge erred in not doing so. 

36The primary judge also erred in taking into account his assessment of the likely consequences of disclosure of the informer's identity: see confidential [43], [44] and [45]. For the reasons given above, that matter was not relevant to whether the exception applied or to any balancing exercise. 

The claim to immunity from production should be upheld 

37Accordingly, this Court is required to address the claim for public interest immunity in accordance with the principles stated above. In doing so it has the benefit of the evidence which was adduced by leave under s 5F(4). 

38The following matters are relevant to that consideration. First, except for the identity of the police informer, at the time the subpoena was issued the Accused and his lawyers were aware of the information provided to the police by that informer concerning the cocaine and firearms held by the Accused which is recorded in confidential [32]. That information was provided in the course of communications between the Accused and his solicitor and the police, following the execution of the search warrant. 

39Secondly, the claim to immunity is made after the completion of the committal proceedings and before the commencement of the trial. A significant purpose identified by counsel for the Accused for seeking access to the Application at this time is that it might form part of representations to be made on behalf of the Accused to the Director of Public Prosecutions in support of a no bill finding in respect of all or some of the charges against him. In my view that purpose is not one to which the exception to the rule applies because it is not directed to assisting the Accused in relation to any issue arising in the prosecution or defence of the criminal proceedings at any of the stages of those proceedings. Nor, in undertaking any balancing exercise, is there good reason to think that knowledge of the identity of the informer would be of ""substantial assistance"" to the Accused in persuading the Director to make a no bill finding in respect of any charge, and specifically the charge of possession for supply. 

40Thirdly, the specific issues to which the identity of the informer is said to be relevant are whether the Accused's possession of the firearms was as a result of duress and whether the Accused possessed the cocaine ""otherwise than for supply"". The Accused's case is that he was forced to hold the items by his cousin, Shadi Derbas, and that he did so because of his fear of his cousin. That case is supported by forensic evidence which is said to link the items found at the Accused's home with Shadi Derbas. It is also consistent with the information provided to the police by the informer and communicated by the police to the Accused or his solicitor. The Accused argues that knowledge of the identity of the informer may increase the perceived likelihood that the information provided to the police was correct and that this is something which a jury might take into account when assessing whether to accept that hearsay evidence as correct. 

41This argument assumes that hearsay evidence of statements made by the informer may be led before the jury and that there is a risk that a jury might not accept that evidence, or give it sufficient weight, in the absence of knowledge of the informer's identity. It is conceded by the Accused that the police officer who applied for the issue of, and executed, the search warrant will have to be called at the trial to establish possession of the charged items. At present that officer does not dispute that he was given the information referred to and does not suggest that he does not believe that information to be true. If he is cross-examined on behalf of the Accused and permitted without objection to give that evidence, his evidence and the forensic evidence would confirm the Accused's case that he held the items for Shadi Derbas. In those circumstances it is difficult to see why there is a risk that a jury would not treat that evidence as correct. If he gives different evidence as to what he was told or as to his belief in the accuracy of that information, he could be further cross-examined by reference to his two signed statements admitted in evidence before this Court. If necessary at that stage a further application could be made for access to the Application so that he could also be cross-examined by reference to that document. At that time it would be necessary to address in that context whether the document should be produced and the identity of the informer disclosed. 

42If the giving by the officer of hearsay evidence is objected to at the trial, the Accused's position would not be advanced by having the Application or a part of the Application because the hearsay rule would also apply to its admission in evidence. Any statements made by the informer to Detective O'Neill would be first-hand hearsay if given in evidence by him and second-hand hearsay in the Application. The only circumstance in which hearsay evidence of the information provided to the officer might be given is if one of the exceptions in ss 65 or 66 of the Evidence Act was shown to apply. Should the Crown object to the hearsay evidence, and it become necessary to consider the application of those exceptions, it would also be necessary to address whether the informer's identity should be disclosed to enable one of those exceptions to be established, or for some other good reason. 

43Fourthly, as is assumed above, rejection of the claim to allow access to any part of the Application so as to disclose the informant's identity at this time does not preclude a further application being made during the course of the trial in the circumstances which then obtain: Cain v Glass (No. 2) at 251. 

44The foregoing analysis shows that depending upon what happens at the trial, disclosure of the informer's identity may assist the Accused in prosecuting his defence to some of the charges against him. As the matter presently stands, however, the Accused has not established any more than that it ""might"" be of some assistance to him to have disclosure of the informer's identity, depending upon what happens at the trial. That is not sufficient either to establish the exception to the rule or to justify disclosure at this time in a balancing of the relevant interests. As Doyle CJ said in Haydon v Magistrates Court of South Australia (at [30]): 

""... the fact [that] disclosure of an informer's identity, or of information provided, might be of some assistance will not be sufficient. To require disclosure on this basis would be to undervalue the importance of public interest in non-disclosure."" 

45For these reasons the appeal should be allowed for the first of the grounds of appeal. That makes it unnecessary to consider the second of the grounds relied upon by the Attorney. 

46Finally, reference was made in the written submissions of the Accused to an appeal by the Accused from that part of the primary judge's order refusing access to the balance of the Application. That matter was not addressed in oral argument and there was no leave sought to file a cross-appeal. Accordingly, it does not arise for consideration. I should add that by mentioning this matter I am not to be taken to suggest that any such argument would have had any real prospects of success. 

Proposed orders 

47The following orders should be made: 

(1)The appeal be allowed. 

(2)Orders 1, 2, 3 and 4 made on 24 February 2011 be set aside. 

(3)There be no access to the document headed ""Application for Part 5 Search Warrant/Record of Application"" dated 23 November 2008 and signed by Detective Paul O'Neill as applicant which was produced in answer to a subpoena to produce documents addressed to the Registrar of the Local Court, Mt Druitt. 

48Hoeben J : I agree with Meagher JA and the orders which he proposes. 

49Rothman J : I agree with Meagher JA.

2758717,R v Gurpreet Singh [2012] NSWSC 135,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: On 23 February 2012 the offender Gurpreet Singh pleaded guilty before me to one count of accessory after the fact to the murder of Ranjodh Singh, contrary to s 349 of the Crimes Act 1900. The Crown accepted that plea in full discharge of all counts on the indictment, which included a charge that on 29 December 2009 the offender did murder the deceased. Upon the basis of the agreed facts and other evidence not the subject of contest, including an induced statement from the offender, the following facts are accepted for sentencing purposes.

2The deceased was residing in one-bedroom boarding house accommodation with Harpreet Singh in Wagga Wagga. Both the deceased and Harpreet Singh used to live and work in Griffith but Harpreet Singh left Griffith around October or November 2009 due to issues involving considerable amounts of money that he owed to workers whom he had contracted to work as farm hands on local farms in the Griffith area. The deceased moved to Wagga Wagga in early December that year because he could not find work in Griffith.

3Harpreet Singh also owed money to the deceased for work that the deceased had performed for him. Harpreet Singh would deal with farmers who required workers to harvest their crops. Harpreet Singh would then engage others to perform this work. One farmer named Russell Vardanega had also engaged Harpreet Singh who had in turn engaged the deceased, among others, to work on his farm. Mr Vardanega had refused to pay Harpreet Singh due to some damage occasioned to his property and so the deceased was also not paid.

4The offender and Harpreet Kaur Bhullar were living in a de facto relationship and residing at premises in Kookora Street, Griffith. Harpreet Singh knew them, as he was responsible for finding them work in the Griffith area. The deceased lived with the offender and Ms Bhullar for a short time in 2009.

5On Sunday 27 December 2009, Harpreet Singh, the offender, Ms Bhullar and the deceased were in Wagga Wagga, planning to return to Griffith the following day. The deceased purchased a gift for Ms Bhullar, which was handed to her in the presence of the offender and Harpreet Singh. Later that day Harpreet Singh, the offender, Ms Bhullar and the deceased travelled back to Griffith in a red 1995 Ford Falcon sedan, which was registered in Ms Bhullar's name.

6For Monday 28 December 2009, Harpreet Singh had planned a party in order to celebrate his birthday. This took place that night at Ms Bhullar's premises in Kookora Street, Griffith. Most people at the party were drinking alcohol but Ms Bhullar was not. Other friends were also there. At approximately 12.30am on 29 December 2009 the deceased left the premises and did not return. 

7At about 2.45am on Tuesday 29 December 2009 a witness saw Ms Bhullar's vehicle near the intersection of the Wilga Road and Main Road 80 at Willbriggie. This is a rural area in a 100km/h zone but the vehicle was travelling slowly, which the witness described as unusual. He could see that the vehicle contained three people, with one person seated in the rear on the passenger's side. This sighting apparently occurred after the murder of the deceased.

8About five minutes later another witness travelling along the Wilga Road, approximately eight kilometres from the intersection with Main Road 80, saw three small spot fires not more than 30cm high and 15cm wide. At 3.18am Ms Bhullar's vehicle entered the Yambil Street Carwash in Griffith. Harpreet Singh alighted from the rear passenger seat of the car whilst the offender alighted from the front passenger seat. Ms Bhullar was driving. She opened her door but did not get out. Harpreet Singh washed the car. They all left a short time later.

9At 9.10am on Tuesday 29 December 2009 the body of the deceased was discovered on the north side of the Wilga Road approximately eight kilometres from the intersection with Main Road 80. He was wearing only a white T-shirt, he wore no shoes and his hands and feet had been bound. He was burnt beyond recognition. It would appear that his throat had been cut and he had been stabbed as well.

10Between 4.00am and 5.00am the offender contacted Ms Bhullar's employer and advised him that she was unable to attend work because they had all been to a party that night and she was too tired to work. Later that morning Harpreet Singh travelled by bus to Wagga Wagga. At 1.50pm on 29 December 2009 Ms Bhullar and the offender drove her car back to the carwash where they thoroughly cleaned the boot and vacuumed the inside of the car. They wiped around the boot seals as well. This took about 18 minutes to complete.

11At about 3.00pm the offender drove Ms Bhullar's vehicle to Pat's Tyres in Griffith where he sought to purchase four new tyres for the car. Despite advice from the proprietor that new tyres were not needed, the offender insisted that they be changed.

12At about midnight on 29 December 2009 the offender and Ms Bhullar attended the residence of the deceased's aunt in Griffith and advised her that the deceased left their residence around midnight and that they had not seen him since. The next morning the offender travelled to Sydney.

13A description of some distinctive jewellery located on the deceased was released to the public. On 31 December 2009 the deceased's aunt attended the Griffith police station to report her nephew missing. He was later identified as the deceased.

14Police took statements from Harpreet Singh, the offender and Ms Bhullar. Inconsistencies emerged from these statements. Other information concerning movements of Ms Bhullar's vehicle was received. On the morning of 4 January 2010, the offender and Ms Bhullar purchased one-way tickets to Sydney. In Sydney they both purchased one-way tickets to Nepal on Thai Airlines Flight TG 452. They passed through customs but were arrested and removed from the plane. They were later released but rearrested on 28 January 2010. Numerous statements were taken from members of the Griffith Indian community indicating that Harpreet Singh operated as a standover man and had a reputation for violent and intimidating behaviour relating to workers operating in the agricultural labour market in the local Griffith area.

Induced statement

15On 21 February 2012 the offender gave an induced statement to the police. He confirmed the matters to which reference has already been made. He gave the following additional information that is particularly relevant for present purposes.

16On 1 January 2010 the offender made a statement to the police at Griffith concerning the murder of the deceased. He now acknowledges that parts of that statement were untrue. The offender said that he told lies to the police at that time because he held fears for his safety and for the safety of Ms Bhullar and their families. This was because Harpreet Singh had threatened to kill him and Ms Bhullar as well as his family in India. He said that he is still scared of Harpreet Singh but that he now wishes to tell the truth about what happened to the deceased on the night of 28 and 29 December 2010 when he was murdered.

17The offender, the deceased and Harpreet Singh drank heavily at the birthday party on 28 December 2010, commencing at about 4.00pm that day. During that afternoon the deceased asked Harpreet Singh on a number of occasions for money that he was owed. These constant requests degenerated into an argument as the evening progressed and as the drinking increased. During the evening the deceased and Harpreet Singh were alone together outside on the veranda. At some point the deceased said to Harpreet Singh, ""Give me my money that you owe me or I will tell [your wife] and Russell Vardanega that you had a plan to kill them and to burn Russell's shed"". Harpreet Singh became very angry and started yelling at the deceased, saying, ""You are a dog, I do everything for you and you are acting like this"". Harpreet Singh was pushing the deceased as he said these things and he looked very angry. A fight between them then took place inside the premises with the deceased being pushed to the floor and kicked in the stomach by Harpreet Singh. He said to the deceased, ""You dog, I will kill you"". Harpreet Singh had to be physically restrained. The deceased was left lying on the bedroom floor.

18The next thing that the offender recalls is Harpreet Singh knocking on the door of the bedroom he shared with Ms Bhullar. The offender went outside and Harpreet Singh said to him, ""I am going to throw [the deceased] from the balcony"". He said, ""I have done everything for him, I am giving him a car, he is staying with me and ... my wife cheats on me and now he is deceiving me by saying he is going to tell Russell what I am thinking to do to them"". The offender said, ""[The deceased] can stay with me"". Harpreet Singh then turned and removed a knife from a knife block on the kitchen bench and pointed it at the offender and said, ""What did you say?"" The offender repeated what he had said. At this point Harpreet Singh became very angry and again pointed the knife at the offender saying, ""You are all the same as [the deceased]. Don't try to stop me or I will kill you all. Do what I tell you or I will kill you"".

19At this the offender became frightened for his life. Harpreet Singh walked the offender into the bedroom still holding the knife. He said, ""Tell your wife we are going to Wagga Wagga"". He then said to Ms Bhullar, ""Drive me and [the deceased] to Wagga Wagga. I will not tell you again"". Ms Bhullar said, ""It's night time"". The offender said that he knew that Harpreet Singh still had the knife so he said to his wife, ""Just do what he is saying"".

20During the drive towards Leeton the offender saw Harpreet Singh tie the deceased's hands with a piece of cloth that was in the back seat of Ms Bhullar's car. It was a piece of material that the offender sometimes used to tie a small turban when visiting the temple. It was black.

21After driving for about 25 minutes Harpreet Singh ordered Ms Bhullar to stop the car. He took the car keys from her. Harpreet Singh then dragged the deceased from the car on his side and away from the car. The offender remained at the car. After two or three minutes the boot of the car opened when Harpreet Singh activated the remote opening device with the car keys. A few minutes later the offender noticed a big fire about four or five metres away from the rear of the car. Harpreet Singh got back into the car. Ms Bhullar said, ""What happened, what happened?"" Harpreet Singh said, ""I have done the job. I have killed him. Have you got any tissues?"" He then wiped the knife, gave the car keys back to Ms Bhullar and told her to drive to the carwash.

22They returned home via the carwash. Harpreet Singh cleaned the knife in the pressure cooker several times.

23Harpreet Singh later told the offender and Ms Bhullar to tell people that the deceased left home and that they did not know where he had gone. Harpreet Singh said to the offender, ""I know where your family live and your wife's family live and I know the Detectives here in Griffith. I am working with them. Just say what I told you and I will sort the rest out myself.""

24On 1 January 2010 the offender went to the police station and gave his statement referred to earlier. He said that he told the police what Harpreet Singh had told him to say due to threats from Harpreet Singh to himself, his wife and his family. Harpreet Singh constantly contacted the offender by phone over the ensuing days to remind him to say nothing to the police about what had really happened. The offender's fears of Harpreet Singh were only confirmed and strengthened by what he had seen Harpreet Singh do to the deceased. He became aware that Harpreet Singh was capable of carrying out his threats and that he was a very violent person.

25Somewhat inexplicably, the offender and Harpreet Singh shared a cell in gaol after they were taken into custody. Harpreet Singh continued to threaten the offender during this time, saying that he knew people in India who could do things to his family. The offender says that he remains fearful of Harpreet Singh.

Subjective factors

26The offender is 25 years of age. He comes from a background of rural poverty in the Punjab region of India. His parents and three sisters are alive and still living there. He came to Australia in August 2006 on a student visa to study hotel management. He relocated to Griffith in March 2008 to pick fruit. He has no criminal record in Australia or in India. It follows that he has never been incarcerated at any time other than for the present charges.

27He now speaks fair English but has encountered difficulties in gaol as a result of difficulties with communication. This has made him the subject of intimidation and harassment in gaol.

Objective gravity

28It was submitted on behalf of the offender by Mr Ozen that the offence was at the lower end of seriousness for offences of this type. In this respect I was asked to take account of the fact that his conduct consisted in a series of low level acts that included accompanying the deceased and Harpreet Singh to the countryside some 20 to 25 kilometres from Griffith. He remained in the car when it was driven to the carwash in the early hours of the same morning. He alighted from the vehicle at the carwash but apparently took no active role in cleaning it. The following afternoon he and Ms Bhullar cleaned the inside of the car. He later gave a false account of his involvement to the police. He purchased new tyres for Ms Bhullar's car at the behest of Harpreet Singh.

29Mr Ozen emphasised that the offender was not involved in harbouring Harpreet Singh or attempting to disguise his identity. He played no role in disposing of the body of the deceased or of a murder weapon. Such conduct is not unusual in cases of this type and tends to characterise an offender's conduct as at the higher end of the scale of criminality. The present case is to be contrasted with such cases. Moreover, the offender had no criminal motivation for his involvement in the events leading to the death of the deceased and was not otherwise concerned in some associated anterior criminal enterprise. Indeed it would appear, and I accept, that the offender had no genuine appreciation or understanding of what Harpreet Singh intended for the deceased until after it had occurred, both because of his reasonably intoxicated condition and the unexpected manner in which the fatal events quickly unfolded when the vehicle stopped in the countryside. Although the offender was neither as young as Ms Bhullar nor to my observation as naive as her, the overriding explanation for his role in these events is directly related to the character and characteristics of Harpreet Singh, to which I now turn.

30I am asked to accept that Harpreet Singh is a violent and dangerous individual with a propensity for and history of intimidation and violence within the local Indian community. Considerable material has been tendered in aid of that contention, to the particular details of which it is unnecessary to refer. It is sufficient to note that farmers and labourers in and around the Griffith area have complained to the police on several occasions about the conduct of Harpreet Singh. He is alleged to have threatened to kill people. He has attacked residential properties occupied by people with whom he has had disputes about money. Apprehended violence orders have been taken out against him. He has been convicted for an offence involving violence.

31The offender himself set out in some detail his experience with the violent propensities of Harpreet Singh. He understood that he was prepared to kill people if the circumstances as he saw them required it. He was regularly in disputes concerning the non-payment of money to contractors. There is other material to indicate an ongoing period of harassment of Mr and Mrs Vardanega by Harpreet Singh involving threats by him to kill them and members of their family. These matters came to the attention of police and I have been provided with statements and other documents that record these incidents at some length. I accept all of this material for present purposes as supporting the proposition that Harpreet Singh had the violent propensities of which the offender has given evidence and that his role in the subject events was significantly inspired by the fear for his own safety that his knowledge of Harpreet Singh engendered.

Assistance to authorities and early plea

32The offender pleaded guilty to the current offence at the first available opportunity. The Crown uncontroversially accepts this.

33The offender has also given an undertaking to give evidence in the Crown case against Harpreet Singh who is charged with the murder of the deceased but who is to be tried separately. The trial of Harpreet Singh is due to commence in the middle of this year. Mr Ozen has submitted that a discount in the order of 45 to 50 percent is appropriate in this case for the combined effect of the offender's early plea and his undertaking to give assistance to the authorities as a witness in the trial to which I have just referred. The Crown has not sought to contest this submission.

The proper sentence

34I was referred to considerable authority and to helpful statistics published by the Judicial Commission of NSW relating to like offences. These included, but were not limited to, R v Dileski [2002] NSWCCA 345; (2002) 132 A Crim R 408; R v Jin [2011] NSWSC 169; R v Fennell [2011] NSWSC 489; and R v Cowen [2008] NSWSC 104. In the latter case, Buddin J helpfully summarised at [15] - [26] some of the principles that apply in a case of this sort.

35The present offender has not had the advantage of, or the opportunity to obtain, a report concerning his mental state from an appropriate medical or forensic specialist in the field. Although the offender gave evidence before me, he did not in terms express remorse in any way for his involvement in the events that give rise to these proceedings or for the relatives of the deceased who must deal with his death. This is to some extent regrettable. However, the offender has no drug or alcohol related problems of any sort, has no criminal record and is entitled to a finding that he is in all respects otherwise of good character. It follows at least from this that he has what I consider to be excellent prospects of rehabilitation and presents with no obvious or discernible indication of any likelihood of reoffending.

36It was contended on the offender's behalf that, having regard to the fact that he has already served 2 years and 32 days on remand since he was taken into custody on 28 January 2010, a sentence of that length was an appropriate one in all of the circumstances, meaning that he should immediately be released. I note that the Crown did not contend otherwise and indeed accepted, quite properly in my view, that such a submission was appropriate.

37It follows from all of the matters to which I have referred, namely the reduced gravity of the offender's criminal conduct, in combination with his favourable subjective features, and my finding that the offender was motivated by fear of Harpreet Singh, who is clearly capable of extreme and unpredictable acts of violence, that I am presented with a somewhat wider range of realistic sentencing options in respect of the offence charged. In so saying, I am mindful of and take into account the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

38I also observe, retrospectively, that the conditions under which the offender has served time in custody to date would, in other circumstances, attract attention as potentially more onerous and difficult than would have been the case for an incarcerated offender or prisoner on remand whose first language was English and whose family were local and able to offer physical and emotional support. These things have conspired to make the offender's time in custody so far more difficult than might ordinarily be the case and notionally increase the significance of the time already served.

Sentence

39In respect of the offence of accessory after the fact to murder I sentence the offender to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 32 days. That sentence will be taken to have commenced on 28 January 2010 and to have expired today. It follows that the offender is entitled to be released immediately.

40I note that the offender's status for immigration purposes is described now as an illegal non-citizen. Whatever may be the specific ramifications of that particular status, it carries with it the potential consequence of immediate deportation. I am however informed by counsel for both sides that the offender has now been issued with a criminal justice visa, which will ensure that he is entitled to remain in Australia for as long as his promise to give evidence in the trial of Harpreet Singh remains undischarged. I note further that the Crown holds no fears that the offender will not honour his undertaking to remain in Australia to give this evidence, and that his Indian passport has expired. He has also undertaken not to apply to the Indian High Commission for the issue of a new passport. It is expected that the offender will reside with Ms Bhullar and her sister in Sydney until they are both likely to be, if not inevitably, deported when the trial of Harpreet Singh is concluded.

4For the offence of break, enter and steal he was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months, comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months and a balance of term of 1 year. The sentence was directed to commence on 6 June 2011, upon the expiry of a series of other sentences imposed by the sentencing judge on appeal from the Local Court. For the offence on the s 166 certificate he was sentenced to a short fixed term of imprisonment, to be served concurrently with the sentence on the break, enter and steal. He seeks leave to appeal against the sentence for the break, enter and steal. 

5Given the limited scope of the application, it is unnecessary to examine in any detail the facts of the offences or the applicant's subjective circumstances. In the early hours of 6 November 2009 the applicant broke into the Griffith North Public School and stole property of significant value from classrooms there. He did not get very far with it, because police had been alerted to the offence. They arrived at the school, chased the applicant and apprehended him. Nevertheless, items taken from the classrooms, including a flat screen television, a video conferencing kit and a smart board, were found to have been destroyed. The cost of replacing those items was roughly $20,000. In addition, a screen door had been damaged and two windows were smashed. At the time of sentence the cost of repairs for those items had not been assessed. 

6The applicant was 43 years old at the time of the offences, and is now 45. He has an extensive criminal history for a variety of offences, including break, enter and steal, commencing in the Children's Court in 1979 and persisting thereafter. On a number of occasions he had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment. At the time of the offences at the school he was on bail for other offences, some of them of a similar nature. 

7His background was disturbed, his education and employment were limited, and he had a history of alcohol and drug abuse. The sentencing judge allowed him an appropriate discount for his plea of guilty, but did not find him to be remorseful. Her Honour was pessimistic about his prospects of rehabilitation, describing those prosects and the likelihood of his re-offending as ""cause for concern."" 

8The applicant gave evidence to the effect that he had had enough of gaol and wished to turn his life around. A psychological report noted his extensive criminal history, together with an entrenched resistance to authority, and concluded that any treatment to be undertaken would be protracted. A long term program of residential rehabilitation was recommended. 

9On the basis of that material his representative in the District Court, who did not appear in this court, asked her Honour to find special circumstances. She declined, observing that he would have ""ample opportunity both in custody and upon his release to parole to address those aspects of his life"", and noting that drug and alcohol counselling and psychotherapy were available in prison, albeit not to the degree that they might be in the community. 

The application 

10There are two grounds of the application, directed to the fact that her Honour did not find special circumstances even though the sentence imposed was accumulated upon the sentences for the Local Court matters to which I earlier referred. The effect of the grounds is that her Honour failed to have regard to that accumulation and that it should have led to a finding of special circumstances. 

11It is necessary to examine briefly the offences dealt with in the Local Court and the sentences her Honour imposed in respect of them. At Griffith Local Court the applicant had been dealt with for a series of offences committed at Balranald in early December 2008. There were two charges of break, enter and steal, three charges of malicious damage, two charges of unlawfully obtaining goods, two charges of intimidating police, and charges of being armed with intent and larceny. He broke into the premises of the Balranald Shire Council and removed a plasma TV screen and a DVD recorder. He also broke into locked premises of the SES and stole a computer. He damaged a wall and a door at these premises, as well as the windows of some vehicles parked in a yard. 

12When he was arrested, he was found to be in possession of several keys from the council's premises, together with remote controls for the television and DVD recorder. In the dock at the police station he became aggressive. He threatened to blow up a petrol bowser at the council depot. More importantly, he threatened to kill one of the police officers, saying that he knew where he lived. He damaged the dock by smashing a plastic item against it, and threatened to kill another police officer with a piece of the broken plastic, which he brandished like a knife. 

13He was also dealt with in the Local Court for a further offence of intimidating police, committed on 3 February 2010 while he was in custody. Whilst being transported to court from Junee Correctional Centre he behaved in an aggressive way, and threatened to hunt down the police and kill them. 

14On appeal, her Honour set aside the sentences passed by the magistrate and imposed a series of fixed terms of imprisonment. For the offence of intimidating police committed on 3 February 2010, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months, dating from 6 November 2009. For each of the offences committed in December 2008, he was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment of varying lengths, all dating from 6 December 2009. The longest of those sentences were terms of imprisonment for 18 months. In the event, for all the offences dealt with on appeal he was sentenced to an aggregate fixed term of 1 year and 7 months, dating from 6 November 2009 and expiring on 5 June 2011. 

15As I have said, the sentence the subject of this application was directed to commence on 6 June 2011, so as to be wholly cumulative upon those sentences. The effect of all the sentences her Honour passed was an aggregate term of 5 years and 4 months, dating from 6 November 2009, with an effective non-parole period of 4 years and 4 months. 

16The solicitor for the applicant in this court, Mr Townsend, noted that the ratio between that effective non-parole period and the aggregate sentence is about 81%. When her Honour declined to find special circumstances in passing sentence for the subject break, enter and steal, she referred to the applicant's subjective case but said nothing about the practical effect of the accumulation of that sentence upon the sentences passed for the Local Court matters. In so doing, Mr Townsend submitted, her Honour fell into error. (In fact, in the sentence for the subject break, enter and steal, 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, the ratio of the non-parole period to the total sentence is a little under the statutory norm, roughly 73%. Nothing, however, turns on this.) Mr Townsend asked this court to reduce the non-parole period so as to achieve a ratio between effective non-parole period and aggregate sentence of 75%. This would require a reduction of the non-parole period by 4 months. 

17There is no need to refer to the numerous decisions of this court which have dealt with this issue. They were helpfully reviewed in the judgment of Buddin J in Kalache v R [2011] NSWCCA 210, at [31] - [42]. It is well settled that accumulation of sentence may itself amount to a special circumstance warranting an adjustment of the ratio between non-parole period and sentence, if only to maintain the 75% proportion between effective non-parole period and aggregate sentence. However, whether that course is adopted depends on the circumstances of the case at hand. If it is not, so that the effective non-parole period bears a higher proportion to the aggregate sentence, a sentencing judge should normally give reasons for that approach. In the absence of reasons, it might be inferred that the issue was overlooked. 

18In the present case, accumulation as a basis for finding special circumstances was not raised in addresses to her Honour, even though the Crown's representative (who also did not appear in this court) submitted that there should be a measure of accumulation in the sentences she was to pass. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that her Honour was unmindful of the issue. It arose in the sentences passed in the Local Court which were before her on appeal. They comprised partly cumulative sentences leading to an aggregate term and an effective non-parole period which exceeded 75% of that term. In setting those sentences aside, her Honour noted that the aggregate sentence ""exceeds the prima facie ratio between the total term and the non-parole period."" 

19It appears to me that her Honour gave careful thought to the structure of the sentences she passed for all the offences with which she was dealing. No doubt, she passed fixed terms of imprisonment for the Local Court matters because of the sentence she had determined for the subject break, enter and steal, having regard to totality. It was necessary for her Honour to arrive at a minimum custodial component of the sentence adequate to reflect the applicant's criminality. At the same time, her remarks convey a conclusion that such prospects of rehabilitation as the applicant had would be appropriately fostered by the counselling and treatment available to him in prison, supplemented by 1 year of parole eligibility. 

20Accordingly, I am persuaded by the submission of the solicitor for the Crown in this court, Ms Gouda, that the non-parole period her Honour set was not the result of inadvertence or miscalculation but, rather, reflected her intention. In Kalache at [31], Buddin J referred to the well known decision of the High Court concerning the principle of totality in Mill v The Queen [1998] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59. In that case, at 62 - 3, the court referred with approval to a passage in Thomas, Principles of Sentencing , 2 nd ed, which included the following: 

""The principle has been stated many times in various forms: ' when a number of offences are being dealt with and specific punishments in respect of them are being totted up to make a total, it is always necessary for the court to take a last look at the total just to see whether it looks wrong[']; 'when ... cases of multiplicity of offences come before the court, the court must not content itself by doing the arithmetic and passing the sentence which the arithmetic produces. It must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences'."" 

21This appears to me to be the approach which her Honour took, both as to the aggregate sentence and the effective non-parole period. Other judges might have reduced the non-parole period so as to preserve the overall proportion of 75%, but I am not persuaded that her Honour fell into error in declining to do so. In any event, I am also persuaded by Ms Gouda's submission that, having regard to all of the offences, a lesser aggregate non-parole period was not warranted in law: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Frankly, the applicant was fortunate to have had the benefit of wholly concurrent sentences for the offences committed at Balranald. It would have been well open to her Honour to have accumulated the sentences for the offences committed in the police station upon those for the offences at the Shire Council premises. 

22On occasions this court has dismissed appeals in cases where an effective non-parole period has exceeded 75% of the aggregate sentence on the basis that no lesser sentence was warranted, even though it appeared that the sentencing judge had overlooked the effect of accumulation: see, for example, Stevens v R [2008] NSWCCA 294, France v R [2010] NSWCCA 24. That said, it should be noted that in those cases the proportion was not markedly greater than 75%. 

23I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

		19 March 2012",2012-02-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758739,LYSLE v R [2012] NSWCCA 20,"Judgment  1BASTEN JA:  I agree with RS Hulme J.  2RS HULME J:  In early 2010 the abovenamed Appellant stood trial on three charges.  The first two were in identical terms, viz.:-  That between 1 February 1981 and 31 March 1981 he did assault a female then under the age of 16 years and at the time of the assault did commit an act of indecency upon her.  3The third count differed only in that the end date of the period nominated was 31 August 1981.  During the period covered by the charges, the complainant was eight.  4The Appellant was convicted on the first two counts but acquitted on the third.  There are two grounds of appeal, viz:-  1. The convictions were unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence, as in the particular and relevant circumstances those verdicts are inconsistent with the verdict returned in relation to the remaining count on the indictment.  There is no reasonable basis for the inconsistency.  2. A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of impermissible questions asked by the Crown Prosecutor.  5Not in contest was that in early 1981 the complainant, her sister, brother and mother commenced to live in a caravan at the side of the house occupied by the Appellant and his wife.  The complainant's mother was the Appellant's wife's sister.  Sometime later the two sisters commenced going to play Bingo on Monday nights on a regular basis.  According to the complainant and her mother, but not the Appellant and his wife, the complainant and her siblings were left in the caravan, in bed, before the two women went out.  6The complainant's evidence concerning the first count was to the effect that on one of these nights the Appellant entered the caravan, picked her up out of it and took her into his lounge room.  There, he took hold of her hand and used it to stroke his thigh and eventually touch his testicles.   She said the touching lasted for 10 to 15 minutes after which the Appellant sent her back to the caravan, saying, ""Come up next Monday night"".  7Her evidence concerning the second count was that she woke at about 9.00 o'clock, remembered that she had to go up to the house, got out of bed and did so.  In the house, she sat on the lounge.  The Appellant touched her inner thigh and then moved his hand up to touch her vagina on the outside of her underwear.  After about five minutes, the Appellant's wife and complainant's mother returned from Bingo early.  The Appellant said to the complainant, ""If they ask, you come up to use the toilet"".  The two women walked in, the complainant's mother asked ""What are you doing up here?"" and the complainant said ""I come up to use the toilet"".  Then, the mother took the complainant back to the caravan.  8Her evidence in chief concerning the third occasion was that she again went up to the Appellant's lounge room on a night when her mother and aunt were at Bingo.  She sat on the lounge and the Appellant sat before her, putting his hand on her left leg and then commencing to move it in the direction of her vagina.  The complainant said she told him to stop, saying, ""I get sore on Monday nights"" after which the Appellant took his hand away, got up from the lounge and the complainant returned to the caravan.  9In her original statement to police, the complainant had said that the Appellant had put his hand on her right thigh and after the Appellant had stopped she must have ""fallen asleep on the lounge but I woke up and mum got home and we moved back out to the caravan"".  In cross-examination, the complainant gave evidence that the second incident was the only occasion when she was in the house when her mother and aunt came home from Bingo and denied that she had been in the house on more than one such occasion.  10The only witness as to the happening of the assault and the acts of indecency was the complainant.  There was limited support for some other aspects of her evidence.  The complainant's mother confirmed that the children were always in bed before she left for Bingo, that there was one occasion when she and her sister returned early from Bingo and saw the complainant in the lounge room with the Appellant.  She asked the complainant why she was there.  The complainant did not reply, but ""looked sort of scared"" and the Appellant said that the complainant ""had a bloody nose"".  11The complainant's mother said she looked around, observed that there was no blood on clothes or any tissues or face washers or towels in the lounge room and it looked to her as if the complainant hadn't had a nose bleed.  She did not pursue the matter with the complainant.  12The complainant's sister, K, gave evidence that, from time to time, her mother went out.  She and her siblings had to go to bed before her mother left and that did not occur before the children were asleep.  There were two occasions she could recall when the Appellant came into the caravan, lifted the complainant out of bed, took her outside the caravan and shut the door.  At the time, K was 13.  13The Appellant was interviewed by police on 20 June 2008.  He denied the allegations.  The interview was recorded and a DVD taken at the time played to the jury.  In addition, the Appellant gave evidence and again denied assaulting the complainant.  His wife also gave evidence.  14There were a number of inconsistencies between the three sources of evidence referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph and between the evidence of the Appellant and his wife on the one hand and the evidence of the complainant's mother on the other.  One has been referred to above.  The only other one to which I need refer is that, according to the Appellant's evidence, there were a number of occasions when the children were watching TV when his wife and the complainant's mother returned home while the Appellant's wife said that there was only one and that on that occasion, the complainant and her brother and one of the children she had with the Appellant were on the lounge.  15It should also be mentioned that the jury retired to consider its verdict at 2.27 pm on 2 March 2010.  Very shortly thereafter, the jury asked for a copy of the complainant's ""transcript and original police statement"".  They were informed that the transcript of the evidence but not the police statement would be provided.  The jury very shortly thereafter retired.  They left court that day at 3.30 pm.  16The trial judge had another commitment and the jury resumed its deliberations at 12.10 pm on 3 March.  Fifteen minutes later, they asked ""is it possible to view DVD or audio of (complainant's) testimony and (Appellant's) testimony given in court?""  17At 2.31 pm, they were recalled, told they could have the evidence replayed in court immediately or have ""tapes cut"" so they could play them in the jury room but the preparation of the tapes would take a little time.  The jury retired again at 2.36 pm and soon afterwards informed one of the court officers that they wished to hear the evidence in the jury room.  18At 3.48 pm, the jury were informed that the ""CDs"" (rather than tapes) were available and a transcript of the Appellant's evidence would be available in a few moments.  The jury retired again at 3.49 pm.  19At 4.30 pm on 3 March, the jury sent a note to the presiding judge which was in terms:-  We, the jury, are unable to reach a unanimous decision on indictments 1 and 2 and require further direction.  But we have reached a unanimous decision on indictment 3.  20It may be inferred that the reference ""indictment"" was intended to refer to ""count"".  21There followed discussion between the judge and counsel as to what should occur in consequence and while this discussion was occurring another note from the jury was received indicating that they had reached a unanimous verdict on all counts.  At 4.36 pm, the verdicts were taken and were as indicated above.  Ground 1  The convictions were unreasonable and cannot be supported by  the evidence, as in the particular and relevant circumstances those verdicts are inconsistent with the verdict returned in relation to the remaining count on the indictment.  There is no reasonable basis for the inconsistency.  22There was no dispute as to the relevant legal principles to be applied in a consideration of this ground.  They are sufficiently explored in MFA v R (2002) 213 CLR 606, TK v R [2009] NSWCCA 151 and Dungay v R [2010] NSWCCA 82 to which the Court was referred.  It is sufficient for present purposes to quote briefly from the last two of these cases. In TK v R Simpson J, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, said at [133]:-  Doubt about credibility of a witness is not the only available explanation for acquittal on one or more counts on an indictment, even in circumstances where the prosecution depends entirely or very substantially upon the evidence of that witness - invariably, in a trial involving sexual offences, the complainant. One alternative explanation is the possibility of the jury delivering a merciful, or compassionate, verdict, where, for example, it is perceived to have taken the view that an episode of criminality justifies one, or a smaller number, of charges and convictions, in place of a multiplicity that has been charged. That this possibility may appropriately be taken into account was reaffirmed as recently as 2002, in MFA . Another possible explanation is compromise amongst a divided jury:  see R v Crisologo (1997) 99 A Crim R 178. An appeal court will examine all relevant circumstances to determine the most likely explanation for differential verdicts.  23In Dungay v R , Giles JA with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, said at [11] - [12]:-  It is not necessary to explore whether there is truly an addendum to the test derived from M v The Queen , or only an additional dimension within that test. Consistency or inconsistency of verdicts will always come down to what was open to the jury upon the whole of the evidence. Examination of the evidence, with an appreciation of how it was presented and left to the jury, will reveal whether there is a rational explanation for a verdict of guilty on one count and a verdict of not guilty on another count. In MFA v The Queen , for example, it was held at [36] that there was an explanation in the evidence of the differences between the verdicts, and that it was therefore open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of guilt on two counts notwithstanding unwillingness to convict on the other counts.  If a rational explanation cannot be discerned, it can be said that it was not open to the jury upon the whole of the evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in coming to the guilty verdict, or it can be said that there was otherwise a miscarriage of justice. The formulation will rarely be of moment, and is not in the present case. Ultimately, as Wood CJ at CL pointed out in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at [237], on reviewing the entirety of the case the court may maintain a comfortable satisfaction as to the guilty verdict upon the evidence separately considered concerning it.  24Undoubtedly, the evidence referred to above was capable of supporting the convictions.  The contention advanced on behalf of the Appellant under this ground was limited to one that the difference between the verdicts on counts 1 and 2 on the one hand, and count 3 on the other, demonstrated a miscarriage of justice.  25It was submitted that the circumstances surrounding each of the alleged incidents were, according to the evidence, substantially similar and that there was no significant difference in the nature of the complainant's evidence in relation to the three counts with the consequence that the difference between the verdicts was an affront to logic and common sense.  26On the other hand, the Crown submitted that there were logical and reasonable explanations in the evidence for the difference in the verdicts.  So far as the first count was concerned, the Crown drew attention to the evidence of K of seeing the Appellant carry the complainant outside the caravan, albeit, K said this occurred on at least two occasions.  So far as the second account is concerned, the Crown drew attention to the evidence of the complainant's mother of seeing the complainant in the lounge room on their/her early return from Bingo.  27So far as the third account was concerned, the Crown pointed out that there were inconsistencies in the complainant's account.  One of these inconsistencies was that, in her evidence, the complainant had said it was her left leg the Appellant had touched, while in the police statement, she had said it was her right leg.  28A more significant inconsistency was the difference between the complainant's statement to police that that she was still in the house when her mother arrived home and that she had gone back to the caravan with her mother and her firm evidence to the effect that this had occurred only once, and that was the occasion of the second assault.  The inconsistency may well have left the jury wondering about the complainant's recollection and whether there was a third occasion of assault.  29One matter relied upon by the Crown was the jury's 4.30 pm note to the effect that they had reached a unanimous decision on ""indictment 3"" but were unable to reach a unanimous decision on ""indictments 1 and 2"".  The Crown submitted that this demonstrated that the difference between the verdicts could in no sense be accounted for by compromise.  30That last proposition may be accepted but, nevertheless, it does not answer the complaint of inconsistency.  However, that complaint is sufficiently answered by the differences in the evidence to which I have referred.  This ground fails.  Ground 2  A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of impermissible questions asked by the Crown Prosecutor  31Under this ground counsel for the Appellant complained not only about questions asked by the Crown Prosecutor but also remarks in the latter's closing address and a portion of her Honour's summing-up.  32The questions relied on in this ground are set out below in bold.  The other questions are included merely to place those the subject of objection in context:-  Q. See, sir, I suggest that what you were endeavouring to do with the police in this interview was to deliberately mislead them to present a picture that there would just have been no opportunity for you to have behaved towards (the complainant) in this way.  What do you say about that?  A. Never happened.  Q. You were - no, you were deliberately trying to, number 1, leave open the possibility that you weren't even there during the period where they were living in the caravan at the back of the house, weren't you?  A. No.  Q. Number 2, you were deliberately trying to indicate to the police that there were no occasions that you were left at home in charge of the children while (N) and Joy went to bingo?  A. They weren't because my children were there.  Q. Left alone as the only adult in charge of the children?  A. I wasn't alone with anyone.  My son was the other person that was up.  My daughter was in bed.  Q. You were trying deliberately, sir, to suggest to the police that it was a bloody ridiculous suggestion that any of the children, (the complainant) in particular, would be in the main house during the night?  A. I never said that.  Q. The reason, sir, I'd suggest that you gave those answers in relation to those topics was to avoid any suggestion that you were at any time alone with (the complainant) in the house?  A. No, that's not true.  Q. So this occasion that you've just given some evidence about where you carried (the complainant) out of the caravan, where were your children that night?  A. My son was in the lounge room watching TV. I recall that.  Q. An you took (the complainant) up to the house?  A.  Yes.  Q. Had you told your barrister about that episode before (the complainant) gave evidence?  A. Absolutely no denial at all and I have told him.  Q. Did it concern you that he didn't ask her any questions about that when he was cross-examining her?  A. That's not for me to say.  Q. Did you bring to his attention when he was cross-examining her that he hadn't ever put to her that there was an occasion where you had carried her from her bed up --  A. That's not for me to say.  Q. Now, tell me, was that something that you had discussed at all with (N) before you did it?  A. Beg yours?  I didn't quite hear you, sorry.  Q. No, I'm going back to 1981, this occasion that you've now given some evidence that there was an occasion that you took (the complainant) out of her bed.  A. Yes, I don't deny it.  Q. Did you talk to (N) about that before you did it?  A. No.  Q. Did you understand from Joy that she'd spoken to (N) about it before you did it?  A. I presumed that (N) knew about it, yes, from Joy.  Q. And, again, did it concern you that your barrister didn't -  EDWARDS Well, I object to that.  It's a presumption.  He's being asked a hypothetical, you Honour.  He's not given any evidence about any direct conversation that he heard.  A presumption is not something that can be - it's not admissible.  CROWN PROSECUTOR I'm entitled to ask the question I was about to ask, your Honour  HER HONOUR: Yes, no, I will allow it, thank you, Mr Crown.  CROWN PROSECUTOR  Q. Did it concern you that your barrister didn't ever put to (N) that she was aware that you were going to go into the caravan and take (the complainant) out?  A. It didn't concern me, no.  Q. So, what was the reason that you were doing that again?  A. Doing what?  Q. Taking (the complainant) out of the caravan?  A. Joy had asked me to make sure that the children came upstairs, that is the younger children.  They used to fight like cat and dog and they certainly weren't asleep when I went down there to pick them up but (the complainant) decided that she wasn't going to move.  Q. And you had a conversation with her about that while you were taking her out of the caravan, with (the complainant)?  A. Yes.  Q. You spoke to her at the time?  A. Of course.  Q. And did you observe whether (K) was awake at all while you were speaking to (the complainant)?  A. Yes.  Q. And was she awake?  A. Yes.  Q. But you did that, you say, without ever discussing it with (the complainant's) mother beforehand?  A.  Yes.  33It was submitted that the highlighted questions amounted to a challenge to the Appellant's credibility and were unfair and this unfairness was compounded by the remarks in the Crown Prosecutor's address and in the summing-up.  Reference was made to a number of cases where what is known as the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 has been considered, including R v Dennis [1999] NSWCCA 23 at [35]-[37] per McInerney J at [45]-[51] per Spigelman CJ; R v Abdallah [2001] NSWCCA 506; (2001) 127 A Crim R 46 at [19]-[24] per Sheller JA; Picker v R [2002] NSWCCA 78 at [38]-[62] per Smart AJ; R v Scott [2004] NSWCCA 254 at [41]-[63] per Hulme J; R v Banic [2004] NSWCCA 322 at [23]-[29] per Barr J; RWB v R [2010] NSWCCA 147 at [63]-[102] per Simpson J; Llewellyn v R [2011] NSWCCA 66 per Garling J at [137].  34The first proposition may be accepted.  Undoubtedly the highlighted questions were intended as a challenge to the Appellant's credibility but there is nothing inherently wrong in that.  However, the first and the third questions were unfair.  Although of course it was for the Appellant to claim professional privilege if he wished to maintain it - see Evidence Act 1995, s 118 - an accused person should not be asked, certainly for the first time in the presence of a jury, as the content of conversations with his legal advisers.  For an accused to deal with such a question properly, he is entitled to legal advice and the potential for prejudice if either the accused or his counsel raise this need in the presence of the jury in preference to the question being answered is obvious.  The first and third questions (in the first group) should not have been asked.  35The other two questions, commencing ""Did it concern you"" were not affected by the same considerations and were not unfair.  Of themselves, or combined with either a positive or negative response, they were not calculated to take the Crown far.  If a positive response was pursued it would likely have resulted in evidence or a suggestion that counsel's inaction did not reflect his instructions:  Given the possible reasons why a layman, almost certainly ignorant of the factors relevant to cross-examination, would not be concerned about his counsel's failure to ask questions on a particular topic, a negative response was also unlikely to advance the Crown case.  However this did not make the ""Did it concern you"" questions unfair.  36The Appellant's answers to these questions must also be noted.  ""That's not for me to say"" and ""It didn't concern me, no"" are inherently credible and certainly tend to ameliorate, if they did not extinguish, any adverse inference arising from the asking of the questions.  37A further point to be made about the three highlighted questions in the first group is their irrelevance.  The complainant had alleged that the Appellant had carried her from the caravan on one occasion.  In his evidence in chief the Appellant had said the same.  This suggests strongly, and there was nothing in the evidence to the contrary, that there was no occasion for the Appellant's counsel to question the complainant about that particular aspect of her evidence.  Furthermore, directed as those three questions were to the Appellant's credibility, ss 102 and 103 of the Evidence Act made them inadmissible unless they could substantially affect the assessment of the Appellant's credibility.  Because of the similarity of the evidence of the complainant and the Appellant on the issue, those questions could not.  38The background to the further question that is the subject of this ground is that N, the complainant's mother, had given evidence to the effect that her children were always in bed prior to her departure for Bingo and there was a rule that, ""except for an emergency like going to the toilet"" they were to stay in bed until the next morning.  Two questions and answers in cross-examination were as follows:-  Q. If I said to you in fact that the children spent quite a bit of time in the main house.  A. Not after they were put to bed.  Q. And if I said to you that in fact ordinarily when you left for bingo the children weren't in bed yet.  A. Yes, they were in the caravan, they were in bed.  They could have read a book or something, but they were in bed.  39The Appellant gave evidence that sometimes he brought the children out of the van into his home pursuant to an instruction from his wife, ""to make sure that they didn't trash the van, so to speak"" and that sometimes when the women returned from Bingo the children were in the house watching TV.  He did not suggest that he had discussed this, or his entering the caravan with N.  In the circumstances, while one might have expected the Appellant's counsel to put to N that she was aware that the Appellant was going into the caravan and had taken the complainant out, it does not seem to me that there was a requirement that such a question be put.   It follows that the fourth question was also irrelevant and, directed as it was to the Appellant's credibility, ss 102 and 103 of the Evidence Act made it inadmissible unless it could substantially affect the assessment of the Appellant's credibility.  It could not.  40These conclusions make it unnecessary for me to explore the limits of the rule in Browne v Dunn as it applies to the cross-examination of accused persons.  In MWJ v R [2005] HCA 74; (2006) 80 ALJR 329, the majority of the High Court threw doubt on the application of the rule without serious qualification but their Honours' remarks were obiter and I do not find it necessary to pursue them.  Otherwise the authorities make clear that the rule has application in those circumstances although caution is required of Crown Prosecutors trying to rely on it - see R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 691.  I would however add the following.  In Llewellyn v R [2011] NSWCCA 66 at [137], Garling J in summarising principles he deduced from earlier authorities on the topic said of cross-examination of an accused predicated on a failure of his counsel to put something to a Crown witness:-  ""(d) Except in the rarest of cases and only where a proper basis exists, cross-examination of the accused in this manner is highly and unfairly prejudicial to the accused, with the potential to undermine the requirements of a fair trial: R v Birks at 703D per Lusher AJ; R v Dennis at [45]-[46] per Spigelman CJ; Picker v R at [41]-[42] per Smart AJ.""  41I would respectfully disagree with his Honour's reference to the ""rarest of cases"".  His Honour relied on three authorities for this statement.  The first were remarks by Lusher AJ in R v Birks .  Those remarks do not reflect the views of the majority in that case.  The second authority relied on were observations of Spigelman CJ in R v Dennis at [45] - [46].  Paragraph [45] and the cases referred to in that paragraph were directed to a different topic and although his Honour's incorporation of ""extremely dangerous"" in [46] provides some support for Garling J's views, this description goes appreciably beyond the approach in R v Birks and may well have been influenced by the factor of prominence to which Spigelman CJ referred.  42The third authority Garling J relied on were remarks of Smart AJ in Picker v R at [41] - [42].  The remarks in those paragraphs were directed to the facts of that case and, as was pointed out in R v Scott at [61], Smart AJ did not indicate what it was about the cross-examination in Picker v R that led him to characterise it as ""impermissible and highly and unfairly prejudicial"".  43I take the liberty also of quoting what I said, with the concurrence of Sully and James JJ, at [62] of R v Scott :-  Furthermore if one accepts, as the Chief Justice's endorsement of the quoted remarks from R v Manunta makes clear one may accept, ""that it is legitimate ... to draw appropriate conclusions from counsel's failure to put in cross-examination some matter to which his client or witnesses subsequently depose"", in cases where it is intended to contrast that failure with evidence subsequently given by an accused, the rule in Browne v Dunn itself make it obligatory to put to an accused the inferences or conclusions which it will be suggested should be drawn, in order that the accused may provide such explanation as he is able.  44It may be that the caution that Crown Prosecutors have been told to exercise should inspire them to first raise the issue of any explanation for a contrast between the silence of an accused's counsel and evidence of an accused in the absence of the jury or, if they do not adopt that course, of going little or no further than drawing the contrast, merely asking an accused if he can give any explanation for the difference, and suggesting he has made up his evidence on the topic.  Any explanation may involve a waiver of the confidentiality of communications by an accused with his legal advisers and that argues for at least some aspect of the matter being first raised in the absence of the jury.  However, in an appropriate case the Crown is entitled to the benefit of the rule and, as was said in R v Scott , this requires that an accused be given an opportunity to provide an explanation.  Nor should the Crown be obliged to lose such advantage as the rule provides by forewarning an Accused of too much in the absence of the jury.  45To return to the instant case, all four questions the subject of the present ground were irrelevant and inadmissible by reason of s 102 and 103 of the Evidence Act .  Two of the questions were unfair.  There was objection to only the fourth.  46The remarks in the Crown Prosecutor's address and the summing-up that are relied on under this ground are those set out in bold in the following passages:-  Crown Prosecutor  The circumstances of that as explained in the defence's case, the Crown says would leave you with some serious concerns as to whether you can accept the accused's explanation, even if it was supported by his wife Joy. Your task is made somewhat more difficult by the fact that the version that the accused gave, that he carried (the complainant) or that he'd been told in effect by his wife to bring the children up to the house after the wife and (N) had gone to bingo.  That circumstance was never put to (the complainant) and so you haven't had an opportunity to assess what her response would have been had that been suggested to her in the witness box and it was never put to (K) that that's what had happened on the occasion that she gave evidence or occasions that she gave evidence that she saw the accused taking (the complainant) out of the room.  Nor was that factual scenario ever put to (N) in cross-examination, that the usual arrangement, to paraphrase the evidence as I understood it, that the usual arrangement had been that the children stayed in the main part of the house and then (N) wanted to change it this one particular night, for the first time and leave the children down at the caravan.  So Joy said to John as she was walking out the door, 'Look that's not what's going to happen.  I want you to go down there and bring the children up'.  So you haven't had an opportunity to assess the response of (the complainant) or (N) or (K), to that factual dispute. (emphasis added)  Her Honour  He asked you to contrast (the complainant's) demeanour with that of the accused.  He submitted to you, or suggested to you, that the accused avoiding answering questions and didn't provide straight answers, particularly in answer to cross-examination about three issues from the record of interview.  Firstly, he didn't remember them living in the caravan and he was at sea at the time.  And he brought your attention to questions 9, 152 and 153.  I think that's question 152 and 153 I apologise.  He didn't remember Joy and (N) going to bingo or leaving him in control of the children.  And you have the interview, of course, especially questions 159, 163 and 173.  Thirdly, there's a suggestion that Joy's children would use the toilet in the main house during the night was ridiculous, especially question 178.  The accused's evidence, that he did carry (the complainant) up to the house from the caravan on one particular night, this was not put to (the complainant), (N) or (K) so you had no opportunity to assess their response to that evidence.  The inconsistencies between the accused's account and Joy Lysle's evidence ....  47The first point to be made so far as the Crown Prosecutor's remarks are concerned is that they were directed, not to the Appellant's credibility but to the assistance the jury might have derived had questions on the topics been put to the complainant, her sister and mother.  The second is that, for reasons apparent from what I have said above, there was no point in questioning the complainant or her sister on the topic of whether the carrying of the complainant from the caravan was inspired by the Appellant's wife.  Although it had not been put to N that ""the usual arrangement had been that the children stayed in the main part of the house"", questions quoted above to the effect that ""the children spent quite a bit of time in the main house?"" and ""ordinarily when you left for Bingo the children weren't in bed yet"" were close enough to answer this submission.  48So far as the further point made is concerned that it was not put to N that she wanted to change the usual arrangement for this one particular night, it was the Appellant's wife not the Appellant who gave evidence to that effect.  At the time he was cross-examining, the Appellant's counsel may well not have had any advance notice of what the Appellant's wife was going to say.   Because of this, and the other sorts of possibilities adverted to in R v Birks , it would have been preferable if the submission had not been put in the bald terms that it was although the fact that it was rather directed to the absence of a response from Crown witnesses rather than to the Appellant's credibility removes much of its possible sting.  49Her Honour's brief reference to the topic was to the same very limited submission.  50In these circumstances, although there were some errors in the trial, they were of a relatively minor, and in my view inconsequential, nature and could not have had any significant impact on the jury's assessment of the Appellant's credibility.  I am satisfied that there was no miscarriage of justice.  This ground also fails.  51Because there were some arguable errors in the trial, but the ground of appeal fail, the orders I would propose are:-  (a) Grant leave to appeal.  (b) Dismiss the appeal.  52SCHMIDT J:  I agree with RS Hulme J.

		01 March 2012",2012-02-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758752,R v Vella [2012] NSWDC 263,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: On 29 August 2011 Paul John Vella was arraigned upon six charges all relating to steps he had taken to obtain a false passport. Five counts charged Vella with providing misleading documents in support of an application for an Australian passport, the sixth charged Vella with making a false statement in an application for an Australian passport. All offences were said to have occurred on 7 October 2006. 

2Vella pleaded not guilty. After a seven day trial the jury found him guilty of all offences. Today Mr Vella is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct. 

3The Court's task in sentencing is to determine the appropriate sentence for these offences. It does that firstly by finding facts in relation to the offending conduct arising out of evidence in the trial, it then assesses the objective criminality of those facts as found to be as against other offences of a similar kind. This is an offence against the Commonwealth law and that requires consideration of matters found in 16A of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914. 

Facts

4The starting point then is the facts which need to be found. In its submission the Crown produced and overview of facts it argued were established before the jury. I am prepared to accept them as a reasonable reflection of the facts reflecting the jury's verdict. 

At some stage prior to 7 October 2005, namely the date of the offences, the offender sought the services of Charles Cassar for the purposes of obtaining a passport in a name other than his own. The offender specifically requested that Cassar obtain a Queensland name/identity for the false passport. The offender paid for and arranged for Cassar to travel to Southport Queensland to meet with the offender and to obtain the details for the Queensland identity of the false passport that was to be obtained. After Cassar arrived in Queensland the offender drove Cassar to the Southport cemetery so Cassar could look through the headstones for an appropriate name for the passport to be obtained. Cassar obtained the details of one ED, from a headstone. I make an order in respect of that name that it is not to be published. 

Cassar then subsequently obtained the necessary supporting documentation for an identity of E D, including a Medicare card and bank cards. At the offender's request Cassar also created a false residential tenancy agreement purporting to be a lease entered into by E D for the rental of the property at 77 Clifton Road Marsden Park New South Wales. The property was in fact owned by the offender's parents. Through an intermediary the offender provided Cassar with at least two photographs of himself to be affixed to the passport application. 

The offender met with Cassar on 7 October 2005 outside the shops at Londonderry where the post office Agency was located. Cassar provided the offender with the Medicare card and residential tenancy agreement in the name of E D. The offender brought the bank cards that had been sent to 77 Clifton Road Marsden park. The offender provided Cassar with instructions [as said - read ""Cassar provided the offender with instructions] on how to complete and lodge the passport application. 

The offender attended the post office and lodged the application for a passport in the name of E D, in so doing the offender purported that he was E D and provided the false Medicare card, bank cards, and residential tenancy agreement as proof of that identity. The offender signed the application as E D. The offender also provided/submitted two signed photographs of himself which had been signed by Cassar using the name and identify of Richard Opie, as guarantor. 

The offender nominated 77 Clifton Avenue Marsden Park New South Wales as address for the passport to be sent to via registered mail, the passport was issued and sent via registered mail to that address. The offender arranged for Cassar to be paid a sum between $20,000 and $30,000 for this service. The passport had never been used by way of travel, nor was it recovered by police. The Crown submits that the offender must necessarily have collected and hidden/disposed of the passport. 


5The defence case at the trial was that Cassar was the real applicant of the false passport. It was he who had come to Queensland and found the false identity of E D at a Queensland cemetery. It was he who undertook the principal role in the creation of the false documents and endorsed the picture of the accused as being E D. It was he who had used the false documents to make the false application passport at the Londonderry Post Office and it was he who had filled out the application. 

6By its verdict the jury had clearly rejected this account. The defence case on sentence, that the jury was correct, is made clear in the undated affidavit of Vella tendered on the sentencing hearing, paragraphs 9 to 20;
 


9. In relation to this matter I now admit the following: 

10. The witness Cassar did make an application and did obtain for me a passport and did so in the following circumstances.

11. I did not know Cassar directly I knew a member of his family a person who has been referred to as Mohammad in the brief was known to me. In the course of the conversation between us he told me that he had a second passport and said casually, ""Do you want one"".

12. Without giving the matter any real thought I said, ""Yes"". I did not know how serious a breach of the law that getting a false passport was. I only ever considered that I might use it to open a second bank account to try and hide money from my now ex-wife. We were separating and the situation was becoming very bitter on her part.

13. I met Cassar on one occasion only and that was outside the Londonderry Post Office, I had previously provided my photo he did everything else.

14. He took me inside and we had the interview with the male post office person. The interview was not with the female from the post office who gave evidence in this matter.

15. That was the first and last time I saw Cassar.

16. I did not go back to the post office for the second interview, I did not even know about a second visit to the post office.

17. I paid $10,000 for the passport and that was paid through an intermediary.

18. The passport was sent to a post office box and I collected it.

19. I never used it on even one single occasion.

20. When I heard about the police interest in the matter with people being arrested I burnt the passport and all associated plastic cards and other associated paperwork.
7In respect of this affidavit the offender was required for cross examination, that is to say his evidence was tested. I accept his evidence that his intent was to use the false passport for identification points in the event he chose to hide money from his ex-wife in family law matters or for some other purpose. Inherent in this admission is a concession that he at least contemplated presenting a false financial picture of his assets to his wife and/or her advisors when settling property issues from his marriage dissolution.

8The creation of fraudulent documents, the obtaining of false passport and its intended use to deceive bankers, former wife and others, indicated the offender is a man willing to use manipulation to achieve deception. Such a person does not inspire confidence as a speaker of the truth. 

9I reject paragraph 12 of the affidavit, that is, the offender's claim of failing to give the matter any serious thought. This is simply self serving. The taking of the photographs, the creation of the false residential agency and the paying on his own account of $10,000 must necessarily directly involve him in acts to advance the aim of securing the false passport. Those acts alone and the money sum involved would put a lie to, ""not giving the matter any real thought"". 

10If the offender is saying in paragraph 12 that a reason he decided to hide money from his ex-wife was because of the bitterness of the situation and they were then separating, I reject that also. The principle reason he is trying to hide money was because he wanted to keep it. I am satisfied that the sum he was trying to hide was well in excess of the money he paid for the false passport, the evidence in the trial was that the offender paid $20,000 for the false passport. 

11My understanding of the evidence is that his ex-wife that he was seeking to hide the money from was Diana. Bearing in mind the offences charge date -October 2005 - and that the events leading up to the fraudulent application required some preparatory work, the time of the offender's relationship is informative. 

12He met Diana in 2002 I think in Malta, visited her in the Ukraine after that. In 2005 she came to Australia. In December 2006 she gave birth to the offender's daughter. The couple did not separate until 2009, four years after the events where he was speaking about a bitter separation. While I accept there may have been difficult moments throughout the relationship including at the time of her arrival in Australia, I do not accept that as things were playing out in 2005, there was any need for him to hide money from Diana if things had not worked out in October 2005, there was no child and scope for very little claim by Diana, upon his assets. 

13The offender's counsel, on instructions in cross examination, put to Charles Michael Cassar, that he Cassar was passing himself as being the applicant. I am unsure whether the offender has resiled from that position. In paragraph 10 of his affidavit, Vella deposes, ""the witness Cassar did make an application and did obtain for me a passport"". The offender also describes the circumstances of these events as meeting Cassar at the Londonderry Post Office. It was also put by Mr Korn, on instructions, that his evidence [Cassar's] that he met the offender at the post office was a lie. That has now revealed a use of his counsel to put to a witness a proposition the offender knew to be untrue. It is another example of manipulation by the offender for the purposes of seeking to deceive.

14The meeting of Cassar at the Londonderry Post Office, Cassar taking the offender inside, ""we had an interview with the male"", (not the female post office person), frankly this is minimising. I am satisfied the offender presented himself as the applicant and engaged in the interview as the applicant. The offender in his affidavit puts the sum he paid Cassar at $10,000. Given there is unchallenged evidence in the trial that Vella paid for Cassar's travel to Southport and paid him somewhere between twenty and thirty thousand, the burden of proving the mitigation of those facts falls upon the offender on the balance of probabilities. A line in an affidavit is insufficient for that purpose. 

15Cassar's evidence is that he received payments through an intermediary, that being the evidence before the jury, it is more likely that not the intermediary also took a cut or commission. The jury acted on this evidence. Given its verdict, the jury is likely to have accepted payment as described by Cassar. 

16I reject the offender's evidence that he never used the passport on any occasion. While there is no proof to the contrary I cannot and do not rule out that the passport has been used to hide money from his ex-wife and it follows, from the authorities. It makes no sense for a man to pay, even on his own version, a five figure sum for a false passport and put it to no use. It should be understood I am in no position to make an adverse finding, my point is I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the passport remained unused, I cannot go further than that. 

17Nor do I accept the offender has proved on the balance of probabilities the passport has been destroyed. It may be listed in Customs and Immigration black books around the world, but it was never intended to be a travel document, but rather a document offering what is regarded as a confident source of identification. In this area, it may still have some value to the offender. I view the claim self serving. 

18I regard paragraphs 9 to 20 in the offender's affidavit as primarily self serving and an attempt to minimise or perhaps rationalise his criminality and his criminal conduct. These paragraphs have not caused me to modify my view as to the appropriateness of the facts and circumstances of the offence as set out by the prosecution, in paragraph 6 of the Crown prosecution's submissions.

Objective Criminality

19From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of an offender's behaviour. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the charges before me with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in that way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. Quite clearly the objective criminality has an important if not the most important impact upon the sentencing outcome. 

20The principle purpose of the Australian Passports Act, is to provide for the issue and administration of Australian passports to be used as evidence of identity and citizenship by Australian citizens travelling internationally. Clearly the creation of false passports for criminal purposes attacks the very integrity of the objective passports are meant to achieve. It also undermines the capacity of Governments to administer passports and it's Act, that is the proper regulation of movement of peoples into and out of Australia and it's treaty obligations in respect of other countries. It opens the door for a range of offences from tax evasion, money laundering, unlawful enrichment and of course, the arrival and departure of people who are seeking to hide their identification such as criminals. That is to say it may assist in the interfering with the administration of criminal justice and the administration of justice in Family Law matters, by facilitating the non-disclosure of matrimonial assets. The offences before the Court are to be found in the Part for Offences Relating to Australian Travel Documents. Their seriousness is to be evaluated against a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. While I have noted the potential and obviously link to use of false passports for an ongoing criminal activity, there are no other offences proved or that should be taken into account. Each of counts one to five were offences committed as preparatory offences with the intent of using the product of that earlier offending, in support of the fraudulent application which is the subject of the sixth count. 

21The victim of the offences is not a person, but rather a deceased person whose identity has been taken. The other victim is the integrity of the passport system as a means of facilitating travel and identification. This offence as with others, adds to the pressure on the Government to police the system, all of which costs taxpayers money and may result in increased regulation such as fingerprints on passports or eye scans for travellers. The injury, loss and damage relate to costs and efforts needed to detect offenders and to maintain as best as can be done, the integrity of the passport system. 

22I do not regard the offender as being contrite. As late as 23 November last year, he was denying to Probation and Parole any involvement in the offence. His lack of contrition is also to be measured against the instructions he gave to his counsel as demonstrated in the cross examination of Cassar. Nor does he have any insight into his offending as is demonstrated by those parts of his affidavit touching upon the offending conduct that I have earlier referred to. Nor does he have any sympathy for or even concern about the possible affront that using the name E D may have had to those who knew and loved and mourn E D. 

23His principal regret is it the consequence of the guilty verdicts and how they will impact upon his prospects of obtaining custody of and/or access to his daughter. His claim to have destroyed the passport has not been proved. The question of reparation is no issue in this matter. So far as I am aware no attempt has been made to apologise to the family of the deceased man or baby actually it was, whose identity and memory were being desecrated by his conduct. 

Subjective Matters

24Vella is a forty one year old man in a de-facto relationship, he has two children of prior relationships, a nineteen year old son Joshua, and a five year old daughter Tiffany. His separation from his former wife Diana is still ongoing with a level of bitterness that regrettably is not unknown in Family Law matters. As noted the offender's involvement in these offences had provided an unwelcome and self inflicted ammunition for his protagonist in circumstances where other less savoury allegations against him have failed for want of any merit. As best I can tell, he is well supported by his current partner and his son. 

Education, Employment and Skills

25Vella completed Year Ten, a motor trimming apprenticeship and a specialised vehicle trimming course. He was a self employed business man operating his own motor trimming business for some ten years. He moved to the Gold Coast and operated a boat yard there for three years. Currently he manages holiday rental apartments. It would seem he has a strong work ethic. Since the Court cases (crime and family law), he has employed a manager. Through his work he has made a useful contribution to the community. 

General Health

26So far as one can tell there are no general physical health problems. 

Emotional and Mental Health Issues

27Vella has never been diagnosed with any mental health issue, it is likely that he is seriously stressed by the potential outcome of Court cases in two jurisdictions. There is no suggestion of any drugs, alcohol or gambling addictive issues. I have sought to highlight the strengths of his character as a father of two children and through his work he has made useful contributions to the community. I have noted his good work ethic.

Antecedents, and Rehabilitation Prospects

28His antecedents do not disentitle him to some leniency, there are three offences recorded against his name since 1997, all finalised in the Local Court. His total criminality as measured by Court results amounts to $1,150 and three months disqualification. He should be regarded in essence, as a person of prior good character. There are a number of matters to be regarded as positive rehabilitation indicators,




Supportive partner and son;

Available accommodation upon release;

Good work ethic and reasonable income stream;

Minimal criminal antecedents with last offending a decade ago;

Good physical health;

No drug, alcohol or gambling issues.

On the negative side,



An absence of meaningful contrition; 
An absence of insight as to the antisocial nature of his offending or any genuine concern about it 

29While there are those negative aspects, I am prepared to accept that his rehabilitation prospects are better than reasonable. While the offender has not sought to cooperate with police and certainly has disclosed nothing to assist, nor has be been obstructive. He has taken advantage of his right to silence and that cannot add to his criminality. 

30There are three people of significance in the offender's life so far as the evidence reveals, his son, his daughter and his partner. A period of incarceration will adversely affect each. He is to be incarcerated in New South Wales, there may be access deprivation to family because of distance. His incarceration will be most telling in the outcome of the custody battle being raged over his daughter Tiffany. 

31From what I have read of the Family Law proceedings the relationship between mother and daughter may be troubled, disturbing and destructive for the child. That is not a matter I wish to express any firm opinion on, because I have not heard nor is it appropriate for me to hear, from the mother. There are other proceedings afloat dealing with those issues. But on the evidence before me such full time custody as is required will be arduous for this offender because of his inability to offer himself as a custodian for the immediate future. That is a factor which has impacted significantly upon the period of non-release. 

32I also recognise that his care of his daughter, assuming he devoted himself to it, would be more therapeutic than care and custody by some other relative. However, there is another Court dedicated to finding the best custodial situation for the child and that too is a factor I take into account. 

33Incarceration inevitably causes high levels of emotional stress and deprivation for those left behind. It is only in exceptional circumstances when incarceration is called for by the nature of the offending, that it can thereby be avoided by exceptional circumstances being experienced by a third party. I have already noted why these circumstances will mitigate the punishment but they do not fall into a category where the punishment due can be avoided.

34This offender has not been to prison before. Insofar as personal deterrence is of importance I note the research points to the deterrent impact of arrest, charging, criminal proceedings and the very fact of incarceration as being the areas of highest deterrence, (see [(Marginal) General Deterrence Doesn't Work - and What It Means for Sentencing] - Bagaric and Alexander (2011) 35 Criminal Law Journal 269 and authorities cited there). I regard these factors as constituting sufficient personal deterrence. 

35It is to be noted there is no requirement in s 16A(2) for general deterrence to be applied. I note Hunt J in R v El Kahani (1991) 21 NSWLR 370 regarded that as a legislative oversight. On that occasion the Court of Criminal Appeal had not been referred to the ALCR report 41, which preceded the introduction of s 16A. The general tenor of the Australian Law Reform Commission report was critical of the concept and effect of general deterrence. Later research has to strengthen the arguments against the usefulness and appropriateness of general deterrence, see (Marginal) General Deterrence Doesn't Work ibid. 

36Notwithstanding my strong reservations and reluctance, my oath of office requires me to accept decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal as binding upon me and to apply the doctrine of general deterrence as a factor in the intuitive synthesis process. I do so. 

37Section 16A(3) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) requires the Court to have regard to the nature and severity of conditions that may be imposed on, or may apply to an offender under any sentencing order I make. I note that this will be the offender's first time in custody. At age forty one he will be older than the majority of prisoners. He will be housed in a single sex paramilitary institution where all significant decision making in respect of accommodation, classification, cell mates, eating time, food choices, clothing choices and the like, will be made by authorities and not by him. 

38What programs he may enter and the time he spends out of his cell will be determined in the final instance by others and not by him. He will not be at liberty to leave his custodial sentencing until the expiration of the sentence or by special order of the manager of the gaol where he is housed. The architecture is crude, harsh and unwelcoming. His environment will be something foreign to him with clanging doors, continual noise, inmates who are mentally unwell and overly sensitive, as his companions. 

39I have already noted difficulties his family may have visiting him and it's impact upon him whilst in custody. I have already noted his sense of impotence in respect of obtaining custody of his child. It is no wonder full time custody is to be a sentence of last resort.

Parity

40On 24 August 2011 Judge Zahra sentenced Cassar for aiding and abetting this offender to produce documents that sustained the false passport application, to a sentence of two years and six months on a plea of guilty. His Honour found genuine contrition and gave a significant discount for assistance to authorities. That offender was sentenced on a total of eleven counts. This sentence was partly cumulative upon a sentence imposed by Judge Ainslie-Wallace. Cassar was regarded as a major producer of false passports, in a sense, the manufacturer and retailer of false passports for that clientele that was seeking them.

41Judge Ainslie-Wallace's sentence had an non parole period expiring on 9 December 2016. In other words Judge Zahra was facing totality issues among the eleven offences before him and further totality in respect of already existing substantial sentence earlier imposed. It would appear he set an overall sentence of four and a half years with a recognisance release order of two and a half years. 

42Judge Walmsley, dealt with Bonny Purac, Mr Cassar's de-facto and assistant. She was before Judge Walmsley for nine offences including two counts contrary to s 29(1) of the Australian Passports Act. She had pleaded guilty.

43Her subjective case was particularly strong, her participation in the offending was powerfully influenced by her attachment to Cassar. None of the offences she was on appears to share any relationship with this offender's indictment calendar. As to those two offences which are related to the same section of the most serious offence for this offender his Honour imposed terms of imprisonment of two years for each. The overall sentence was one of two years and three months. A recognisance release order was made to affect her release after fourteen months. 

44Another client of Cassar's one Adam O'Brien, was also dealt with by Judge Zahra. O'Brien was before his Honour on eleven matters including four offences relating to actively engage by him to secure, including two actively engage by him to secure a false passport and one count of possessing a false passport. And then there were six counts relating to firearm offences. The offender had pleaded guilty to all of the counts. His Honour found remorse for the passport offences. In that totality of offences his Honour was dealing with, his Honour set a sentence of two years.

45Those sentences provide a guide. The Cassar sentence for aiding and abetting this offender is of particular value. Frequently the criminality of the aider and abetter does not reach the level of the principle in the first degree. However, Cassar both has skill and commitment and him holding himself out as a retailer, that is committing a series of offences to produce fraudulent passport documents, points to his criminality being greater. While this offender certainly requested and paid for the documents, the skill of Cassar was vital. Moreover, his offending in Vella's matters was part of his extensive ongoing criminal conduct. 

46I regard Count Six in the indictment before me as the offence displaying the worst criminality. The application was in a false name and address. The application document was fraudulent. To give it an aura of legitimacy it was supported by five further documents each known to be false. That greater criminality is to be reflected in my sentence.

Setting the Sentences

47Paul John Vella you are convicted of these five offences, that you on or about 7 October at Londonderry in the State of New South Wales produced misleading document, namely a Queensland birth certificate in the name of E D, to another person and the document was produced in connection with an application for an Australian travel document, namely an Australian passport application in the name of E D. Likewise, at the same time and place and in the same circumstances, you did produce an Australian Medicare card in the name of E D.

Again, at the same time and in the same circumstances you did produce a St George Bank Visa card in the name of E D and finally in this group, you did produce a false document namely a residential tenancy agreement in the name of E D at the same time and in the same circumstances and for the same purpose. In respect of these five offences you are convicted. You are sentenced to two years imprisonment, to date from 2 March 2012 and expire on 1 March 2014. 

48In respect of Count Six, you are convicted that you on or about 7 October 2005 at Londonderry in the State of New South Wales, did make a false document to another person and that you did falsely state that the statements you had made in the information you had given to the post office employee were true and correct, and the statement was made in connection with an application for a Australian passport that I have earlier mentioned in the name of E D, you are convicted. For that offence you are sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment. That will date from 2 March 2012 and expire on 1 September 2014. 

49You are to be released on 1 June 2013, that is next year.

2758754,R v Menzies [2012] NSWSC 158,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: The offender, Christian Menzies, was found by a jury to be guilty of affray. This is an offence contrary to s 93C of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years. In relation to a separate incident, the offender was found not guilty of murder but the jury were unable to reach a unanimous or majority verdict in respect of manslaughter. The offender subsequently pleaded guilty to manslaughter. That is an offence against ss 18 & 24 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years. 

2The trial commenced with the empanelment of the jury on 24 May 2011 with seven accused. The jury retired on 29 September 2011 and returned its verdicts on 2 November 2011. It was on 2 December 2011 that the offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter. 

3On 10 February 2012 I heard and received evidence and submissions on sentence before standing the matter over until today. 

Facts 

4The matter concerns events at the Qantas domestic terminal at Sydney airport on 22 March 2009 where there was violent conflict between members and associates of rival outlaw motorcycle gangs, the Hells Angels and the Comancheros. At the time of the offences the offender was a member of the Comancheros. For convenience, whether they were members, nominee members or associates of members, hereafter I will simply refer to people as being a member of one or the other gang. 

5The initial confrontation between the two groups giving rise to the charge of affray occurred at Gate 5 of the terminal. There was violence and threatened violence which constituted an affray. There was a second incident a short time later in the departure hall. A riot erupted that culminated with the tragic death of Mr Anthony Zervas, a brother of one of the Hells Angels. 

6A statement of agreed facts was tendered in the sentence proceedings and I draw the following from that document, supplemented with some evidence given in the trial. 

7The Comancheros were led by a national president, Mahmoud Hawi, who was described as having absolute power. The club had a hierarchical structure with strict and enforceable rules. These rules governed the behaviour of members and reinforced a strong culture of loyalty to the club and to one another; cowardice was not tolerated. 

8There had been ongoing hostility between the Comancheros and the Hells Angels for some time prior to 22 March 2009 and the offender was aware of this hostility. 

9The offender spent the weekend of 21-22 March 2009 in Melbourne with Hawi, Ishmail Eken, Pomare Pirini and Maher Aouli. On the Sunday they boarded Qantas flight QF430 at Melbourne airport at about midday to return to Sydney. 

10By chance, the president of the Hells Angels, Derek Wainohu, was on the same flight. It was this happenstance that was the catalyst for the events that took place at Sydney airport. Before the flight took off, Hawi exhibited animosity towards Wainohu and he directed Aouli to telephone club members in Sydney to have them attend the airport. Wainohu sent text messages to members of the Hells Angels for the same purpose. There was also evidence of telephone calls being made from Eken's telephone at this time. There was no suggestion that the offender was involved in making these arrangements. 

11Seven members of the Comancheros in Sydney proceeded with haste to the airport. They arrived at about 1.30pm and five of them (AL, SP, Tiago Costa, Zoran Kisacanin and Francesco La Rosa) proceeded through security screening to Gate 5 where passengers from QF430 were disembarking. The other two (Farres Abounader and Usama Potrus) remained in the non-secure departure hall. 

12Seven Hells Angels members also arrived at the airport. Two of them (Tom Baker and David Padovan) went to Gate 5. The other five (Musa Ovalle, Elias Khoury, Peter Martin, Peter Zervas and the deceased) remained in the departure hall. 

The affray at Gate 5 

13After disembarking, Hawi, Pirini, Aouli, Eken and the offender were joined by the five Comancheros who had gone through to Gate 5. Wainohu was met by Padovan and Baker. In all, there were ten Comancheros and three Hells Angels in the vicinity of the gate. 

14Almost immediately after emerging into the terminal there was a confrontation between Hawi and Wainohu. There was a short verbal argument before Wainohu was punched, causing him to fall to the ground. The witnesses AL and SP, two of the Comanchero members who pleaded guilty and gave evidence for the Crown, both said that they saw the offender punch Wainohu twice at the start of the confrontation. However, AL agreed in cross-examination that he told police that he did not see the offender punch Wainohu; rather he was only told about it. 

15Members of the Comancheros were then observed to chase and assault Padovan. The affray escalated with him being violently punched and kicked. The fighting resulted in Padovan losing his shirt and at one stage he was on the ground being punched and kicked by numerous Comanchero members. There was no evidence that the offender was one of those who chased or assaulted Padovan. 

16There were many members of the public at Gate 5 at the time of the affray, including children and elderly people. Many of them were understandably shocked, horrified and scared by what they witnessed. 

17In respect of this incident, the offender was found by the jury to be guilty of affray. The same verdicts were also returned in respect of Hawi and Kisacanin. Some of the others involved had earlier pleaded guilty to affray, they being SP, AL, Pirini, Aouli, La Rosa and Costa. Eken was acquitted. The only Hells Angel to be charged was Padovan and he was also acquitted. The submission by Mr Padovan's counsel in his closing address to the jury that ""he was flogged"" by the Comancheros was, in my view, apt. 

18Once the fighting had ceased, Padovan re-joined Wainohu and Baker. Hawi pointed and yelled threats in their direction, including, "" You're fucking dead "". He was standing close to the other Comancheros, including the offender, when he made these threats. 

19The entire incident, from the initial confrontation until the uttering of the threats, took less than three minutes. None of the participants involved in the affray were seriously injured. 

20The group of ten Comanchero members, including the offender, left the Gate 5 area and walked as a group to the exit. When they emerged into the departure hall they were met by Abounader and Potrus who had been waiting in the vicinity of the escalators connecting the departure hall with the arrivals hall and baggage collection area on the level below. 

The riot in the departure hall 

21Rather than going down the escalator to collect their baggage, the group of now 12 Comanchero members, including the offender, walked quickly in a direction which happened to be towards the five Hells Angels who were waiting behind the check-in counters in the departure hall. It was a disputed fact at the trial but I am satisfied, as I have indicated in other sentence proceedings ( R v Eken; R v Potrus [2012] NSWSC 91 at [20]; R v Kisacanin [2012] NSWSC 2 at [23]) that prior to the two groups coming together the Comancheros quickened their pace. The two groups came together at the rear of the check-in counters; the Comancheros having covered a distance of about 73 metres. 

22There was a short verbal argument between Hawi and Peter Zervas before a riot erupted. Witnesses gave various descriptions but generally described fighting and ""punches flying everywhere"". One witness said, "" The group of them, they were all fighting one another. Then it started to move towards the check-in counters, towards the front glass doors. They were continually fighting. I heard things getting knocked over "" (T898). Another said that she heard yelling and looked up and saw "" a rush of men coming through the little gaps between the counters ""; seven or eight men; she then saw "" the group of men running through the barriers, the barriers were falling over, passengers scrambling to get out of the way, punching "" (T946). 

23A witness who was using a self service check-in kiosk in front of the check-in counters said that she heard yelling and a lot of swearing, including ""I'm going to kill you, cunt"" . She looked over her shoulder and saw "" someone like chasing someone and I saw them run through this part here [she indicated through the check-in counters] knocking over anything that was in their way. ... As they got slowed down by the people who dropped their bags off, it started breaking off into groups and then they started having their own little altercations, throwing punches, kicks, with barrier poles, signs, just about anything they could find "" (T1024 - 1025). 

24The fighting moved from behind the check-in counters to the area at the front of the terminal. Eyewitnesses described it as fighting between two groups with more men on one side than the other. There were references to it being an ""all in brawl"" with ""everybody"" punching. Bollards, normally used to guide queuing passengers, were taken up and used as weapons in the fighting. These bollards weigh about 12 kilograms each. 

25A further witness description appears to have captured the essence of the riot. An airline pilot who was standing at one of the self service check-in machines said "" I saw approximately 12 to 16 males having - basically all fighting. They were fighting one on one, two on one, just a general brawl and melee is what I saw. I saw kicking, I saw punching and where these automatic kiosk check-in counters are there's a number of metal bollards holding ropes to organise the queues and I saw the metal bollards being thrown through the air and smashed on to people ."" 

26The fighting, although short-lived, was shockingly vicious. One witness spoke of ""an explosion of fighting"" (T1281). This witness was sitting on a bench with her two very young children, one of whom was in a pram. She became ""frozen with fear"" and held her children close to protect them. Another witness said that she ""saw the large group of men fighting incredibly violently and aggressively"" (T2293). She said that the men were fighting in one group and then they split up into smaller groups. 

27Another witness referred to the fighting as ""chaotic and quite wild and uncontrolled""; the men were ""raging, really angry"" (T1533-4). This witness and her companion fell over when he tried to pull her out of the way as the brawling continued into the area in front of the check-in counters. Her companion also gave evidence that there was a little girl in front of him who he grabbed to get her out of the way. The fatal assault upon Anthony Zervas took place within a metre or two of an elderly couple who were seated on a bench waiting for a wheel chair to be brought to them. 

28I have indicated in other sentence proceedings that I am satisfied that the Comancheros were responsible for initiating the riot. There was a question as to why they proceeded along the back of the check-in counters in the direction of the waiting Hells Angels when they claimed not to know that they were there. The explanation that was advanced was incredible. But, even if they did not intend to attack the Hells Angels when they embarked upon the 73 metre walk from the exit doors to their location, I am satisfied that such an intention was formed as the two groups came together. The Comancheros quickened their pace and one of them, Kisacanin, ran around to approach from the other side of the check-in counters. 

29It was contended that the violence was initiated by Anthony Zervas attacking Hawi with a pair of scissors. I am satisfied that this was a pre-emptive strike made in the face of an imminent attack about to be made by the Comancheros upon the Hells Angels who were outnumbered by 12 to 5. The attack by Anthony Zervas was also foolish; it was David and Goliath in nature but Mr Zervas did not enjoy the advantage that it is said that David did. 

30Mr Zervas did manage to injure Hawi, not seriously, but he was quickly pursued to the glass wall at the front of the terminal where he went to the ground. He was bludgeoned by one or more of the bollards and was stabbed in the chest and abdomen. 

31He received three stab wounds, at least one inflicted by a pair of scissors. They caused injuries to the liver, stomach and right lung and caused significant internal bleeding. The head injuries were severe, including fracturing at the base of the skull, bleeding over the surface of the brain and bruising of the brain tissue. He died at the scene. 

32Hawi was found by the jury to be guilty of his murder. All of the other Comancheros were acquitted of murder. Some were also acquitted of manslaughter, while the jury could not agree in respect of manslaughter for Abounader and the offender. 

33The Crown alleged at the trial that the offender was directly involved in the fatal assault upon the deceased. This was not accepted beyond reasonable doubt by the jury. The agreed basis for the offender's subsequent plea to manslaughter is that he was not directly involved in that assault but was complicit in the killing by virtue of being a participant in a joint criminal enterprise. 

34The offender gave evidence in the trial. He said that he was trying to get away from an attack by the Hells Angels behind the check-in counters. He proceeded through the counters to the front where ""there was just a big scuffle"". There were people fighting. He said, "" I ran in, started throwing punches. I seen Pirini, Peter Zervas, Anthony. We all sort of fell over. I was copping punches, throwing punches "". He noticed Eken on the ground with a Hells Angels person on top of him, "" just laying into him "". He grabbed that person around his neck and punched him in the head to try and get him off Eken. He succeeded in doing that but the man turned around; there was a skirmish which resulted in them falling to the ground where they had what he said was ""a little scuffle"". They both got up, shaped up to each other for a couple of seconds and then the offender ""took off"" (T3976 - 3977). 

35The offender's evidence must, of course, be understood in the context of him claiming that he was only acting in justifiable self-defence, a claim now disavowed by his plea of guilty. 

36The riot was relatively brief. It is likely that the physical fighting took less than a minute. Nevertheless, it is clear that many witnesses found the incident most distressing. The witness who was trying to protect her two small children said that she went into shock and felt like she could not breathe (T1288). Her husband described her as being ""really distressed, yelling, crying"" (T1314). Another witness said that the mother was ""clearly ... very distressed and looked quite shocked and she burst into tears"" . This witness added, ""I suppose I became distressed myself"" (T2513). An elderly woman said that she had to turn away because she ""got too distressed because (she had) never experienced anything like this"" (T1353). The elderly couple seated close to where the fatal assault took place were observed to have been in distress (T1676). One of the first police officers on the scene said that a number of the members of the public who were present ""appeared distressed and upset"" (T2518). The offender said in a letter tendered in the sentence proceedings that he had "" reflected on the trauma that the incident has caused to the people involved, their families and the community at large "". 

37The offender fled from the terminal at the same time as the other participants in the riot. He left in a taxi with Hawi, La Rosa and AL. His luggage was left unclaimed. 

38The offender surrendered himself to police on 27 March 2009 when he was arrested and charged with affray and he has been in custody since that date. He was charged with murder on 12 August 2009. It is agreed that his sentence should be backdated to 27 March 2009.

Seriousness of the offences 

40It is important to stress that I am not sentencing the offender for directly causing the death of the deceased and I am not sentencing him for being involved in any joint enterprise that had the object of either killing or causing grievous bodily harm to anyone, or that he contemplated that such a consequence could occur. He is being sentenced for his participation in a joint criminal enterprise to commit an unlawful and dangerous act, namely the assault of one or more members of the Hells Angels, in circumstances which objectively carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury being caused. 

41For the earlier affray, the offender is being sentenced for his participation with fellow Comanchero members in using or threatening unlawful violence towards one or more members of the Hells Angels in circumstances that would cause an ordinary person of reasonable fitness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety. 

42The affray was relatively short-lived and none of those involved suffered serious injury. There was no evidence that the offender was involved in the violent punching or kicking of David Padovan. However, the offence is still a serious one. The verdict of the jury indicates that it accepted the evidence that the offender did use or threaten unlawful violence. The evidence of SP (and AL with some qualification) was that he was one of the Comancheros who punched Wainohu and Mr Stratton SC accepted that the offender should be sentenced on the basis that the offender did so (T14.18 10.2.12). 

43There was a large crowd of innocent bystanders of all ages ranging from children to the elderly at Gate 5 during the affray. There were also a large number of combatants involved. The evidence given by many of the witnesses left me with the distinct impression that they were shocked and frightened that such violence could occur in such a place. These are prominent features of the offence and render it more serious than if it had been carried out elsewhere and otherwise. 

44The starting point in assessing the gravity of an offence of manslaughter is to recognise that it involves the unlawful taking of a human life. There are, however, a wide variety of ways in which the crime of manslaughter can be committed and there are an equally wide variety of ways in which an offender may be culpable. 

45I have earlier referred to the evidence given by the offender as to his involvement in the fighting. Mr Stratton submitted that I could sentence the offender on the basis that he found himself in the middle of a fight which he then joined (T 20.13 on 10.2.12). I cannot accept that submission. 

46The offender was part of the group of Comancheros that approached the Hells Angels. I have said in other sentence proceedings (e.g. R v Eken; R v Potrus , supra at [21] - [22]) that it seemed highly likely that the Comancheros walked deliberately towards the waiting Hells Angels. However, even if they had not previously been aware of their presence, they obviously became aware of them as they walked in their direction and they then hastened towards them. A violent fight erupted almost immediately the two groups came together and it is an agreed fact that the offender was part of the group of Comancheros moving through the check-in counters during the fight. 

47The incident in the departure hall occurred in a very short period of time and while it cannot be determined exactly when the joint criminal enterprise was formed, it was formed at least when the two groups came together. This must be understood in the context of the existing hostility between the two gangs and what had transpired only moments before at Gate 5. On his own evidence and on the agreed facts, the offender played an active role in the assault on the Hells Angels, and he was a significant participant in the fighting. 

48A matter that is particularly relevant in assessing the objective seriousness of the manslaughter is the location in which it occurred. The participants in the joint enterprise to fight were prepared to engage in wanton and significant violence regardless of the presence of many airline and airport staff and members of the public. An airport terminal is a place where people are entitled to expect safety and security. There were elderly people and small children present. A significant number of those who witnessed the events were utterly distressed and fearful. I have no doubt that the memory of it will live long in their minds. For example, I very much doubt that the mother who cowered in fear trying to protect her infant children will easily forget the experience. 

49Overall, I judge each of the offences as being of considerable seriousness. While the offender was not involved in planning or organising the attendance of other members at the airport, he was a willing participant in the violence that occurred, both at Gate 5 and in the departure hall. 

Subjective features 

50The evidence before me as to the offender's personal circumstances comprised a handwritten letter and oral evidence by him, criminal and custodial history printouts, a report by Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, a vocational education certificate and a number of testimonials. 

51The offender was born in June 1982 and was 26 years old at the time of the offences. 

52He has prior criminal convictions, including two incidents involving violence. Senior counsel for the offender conceded that these matters do not assist his client's case in the assessment of sentence. The first incident occurred when he was aged 21 and involved a confrontation between the offender and a hotel manager; he grabbed the manager's shirt and said ""come outside and fight me"". He then threw a metal bin which hit a female bar attendant and caused her to fall to the ground. The offender was convicted at Waverley Local Court on 10 March 2004 of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, common assault and failure to quit licensed premises. He received a good behaviour bond for the first and fines for the latter two offences. 

53The second incident occurred on 15 June 2006, on the eve of his 24 th birthday, and involved an attack by the offender and two others on two victims at a bus shelter and on a bus. This included the offender smashing a bourbon bottle over the head of one of the victims. In respect of this matter the offender was convicted on 9 July 2007 at the Downing Centre Local Court of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and violent disorder. He was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with a 6 month non-parole period and a 2 year good behaviour bond respectively. 

54These were offences involving violence in public places and one was committed in a group. Clearly, they deny to the offender any claim to the leniency that might be afforded to a person without such a record. 

55The offender is of Torres Straits Islander (on his father's side) and Aboriginal/Norfolk Island (on his mother's side) origin. His parents separated when he was 6 months old and he has not had contact with his father since he was an infant. He was raised in Sydney by his mother and maternal grandmother, and has a full brother and 3 half-siblings. He was happy as a child and was not exposed to any violence or other abuse. He has a good and continuing relationship with his family. His mother was present throughout the trial. 

56The offender has been in a relationship for about 5 years and his partner has remained with him while he has been in custody. He hopes to continue the relationship after his release. 

57The offender left school in Year 9 at the age of 15. He was more interested in sport than academic pursuits. He took up a bricklaying apprenticeship. He has since worked as a bricklayer, concreter and shotcreter, and has been in almost continuous employment until he went into custody. The offender previously undertook training at TAFE, and there is evidence that he has undertaken some further vocational training since he has been in custody. 

58The offender began to smoke cannabis in his early teen years but gave that up at the age of 18 and took to binge drinking of alcohol. Drinking alcohol was said to be a factor in the two incidents leading to his prior convictions for violent offences. He has also used other illicit drugs, including ecstasy, amphetamines and cocaine. The offender ceased taking alcohol and illicit drugs about six years ago, after he realised that using them began to affect his reliability at work. 

59The offender expressed in his letter that the absence of his father left him with feelings of abandonment. He became involved with the Comancheros when a friend introduced him to the club and the members became male role models for him. He wrote, "" As a young man, attaching myself to a group of men made me feel important, accepted, strong and cared for."" It is regrettable that he chose to attach himself to this group and he has now realised that "" this association did not fill my void."" 

60The offender left the Comancheros about two years ago while in custody. He was housed with other Comanchero members at Silverwater MRRC at the time. He has since been moved to the Long Bay Correctional Complex at his request so as to no longer be housed with club members. He has also voiced his intention to have two club related tattoos removed or covered over. These steps bode well for rehabilitation, and it will be important that he does not re-establish his ties with the club while in prison or after his release. 

61The offender has not been found guilty of any prison disciplinary offences since he has been in custody. While at Long Bay, he has been employed as the head sweeper of his wing, a position of some responsibility. He also stated in his letter that he has a positive rapport with the prison staff and his fellow inmates. A testimonial from a corrective services worker at Long Bay Hospital describes the offender as polite, courteous, compliant with routine and a hard worker. 

62The offender has the ongoing support of his mother and family. Upon his release, he hopes to undertake further study and states that he plans to take a youth workers course in order to work with young aboriginal men. He told Dr Westmore, however, that he hoped to do a riggers/dogman's course and thought he could get a job in the building industry. There was also the prospect of an uncle in Western Australia helping him to get a job in mining, although that would depend upon approval of the parole authorities. 

63The opinion of Dr Westmore was that if the offender remains drug and alcohol free and does not become affiliated with the Comancheros or any other similar organisation, "" his risks of re-offending are probably low."" He found that the support of the offender's family and partner, and his capacity to hold employment were factors that influenced his positive assessment. 

64That the offender has ongoing support of family and friends is confirmed by the testimonials. He has engendered respect as a hard-worker and capable in his chosen trade of bricklaying. The authors speak of a variety of other positive personal qualities as well. 

65In his letter, the offender has expressed his remorse for the events that occurred on 22 March 2009. He wrote that, "" In particular, I would like to express my deep sympathy and regret to the family of Mr Zervas and I would like to tell them that I am sorry for the loss of their son, brother and loved one ."" He also said, "" I take full responsibility for my actions, and accept the consequences of my behaviour ."" At sentence proceedings, the offender was asked by senior counsel whether the letter "" truly reflects your feelings and thoughts about being involved in this offence?"" to which the offender responded in the affirmative. The remorse felt by the offender is relayed in the testimonial of Ms Bridgette Loveday and I believe that it is genuine. 

Specific mitigating features 

Plea of guilty 

66As I noted earlier, on 2 December 2011 the offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter. The plea was entered subsequent to a jury at the first trial finding him to be guilty of affray, and finding him to be not guilty of murder. There was no offer by the offender to plead guilty to any offence prior to the first trial. However, it is acknowledged by the Crown that in any informal discussions between legal representatives, it was generally understood that as the Crown case was one of direct responsibility for murder, a plea to a lesser charge was unlikely to be accepted. Nevertheless, and regardless of whether the Crown would have accepted it, the fact remains that there was no plea to manslaughter at the trial and no prior offer to enter such a plea. I stress, however, that the offender should not be disadvantaged by the fact that he went to trial with the Crown alleging he was guilty of murder and the jury found that he was not. 

67There is, of course, no question of any reduction of the sentence in relation to the affray. The offender pleaded not guilty to that offence and was found to be guilty by the jury. However, it is necessary to determine what reduction of sentence there might be for the utilitarian benefit resulting from the offender's belated plea to manslaughter. 

68The plea was entered about 21/2 years after being charged, 14 months after committal for trial, a month after acquittal for murder, and about 9 months before the time a prospective retrial would have commenced (Abounader's retrial is listed in September 2012). A retrial would not have been as lengthy as the first trial but the Crown concedes it would still have been lengthy and complex. In these circumstances, notwithstanding the delay, the offender's plea does have significant utilitarian value. 

69The Crown submitted that any reduction should not be the same as the discount afforded to those persons who pleaded guilty (or offered to do so) prior to the first trial. On the other hand, Mr Stratton submitted that the reduction should be ""close to that given to those who pleaded guilty before the trial"". In oral submissions he accepted that the offender ""would [not] get anywhere near the full discount"" (i.e. 25 per cent). 

70I allowed a reduction of 20 per cent in the case of Pirini, 15 per cent in the case of La Rosa and 12.5 per cent in the cases of Aouli and Costa. In relation to Eken, Potrus and Kisacanin I allowed 20 per cent on account of their willingness about 6 months prior to trial to plead to either the same offence for which they were found guilty, or a greater offence. 

71The circumstances are unusual. Counsel were unable to refer me to any precedent that might guide the exercise of my discretion. I propose to allow a reduction of 15 per cent in respect of the sentence for manslaughter. 

Onerous custodial conditions 

72Although Mr Stratton did not specifically address this point in submissions, he led evidence from the offender in the sentence proceedings directed to it (T6.1 - 6.6.17 10.2.12) and so I am prepared to assume that he intended a submission that is something I should take into account. It is something I have taken into account in sentencing Messrs Eken, Potrus and Kisacanin. 

73Normally it is not a mitigating factor that an offender has been required to attend court. However, in this case the trial was protracted, including the period during which the jury were deliberating. The committal hearing extended over some three months as well. These periods combined, in the order of 8 or 9 months, involved the offender being taken from his cell at an early hour; not returned until late in the day; being denied other than legal visits on those days and being denied recreational opportunities. Being required to remain in the court cells for much of each day while the jury were deliberating for over a month, often without being required to be brought up to the court room at all, is also a relevant matter. Whilst this is not a major factor in mitigation, it is something to which I have had regard. 

Other mitigating factors 

74There are a number of other statutory mitigating factors that I must take into account. I cannot find that the offender has been of prior good character, given his admitted illicit drug use and prior offences of violence. 

75It was submitted that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. I am satisfied that this is so, provided he remains drug and alcohol free, as he has been for the past 6 years or so, and does not involve himself with the Comancheros or other similar organisations. The fact that the offender has a close and supportive family and a strong work ethic supports this finding as well. 

76Usually when an offender goes to trial with a denial of responsibility for a crime it is difficult to find that he or she is remorseful. However, in this case, I am satisfied that the offender is genuinely remorseful. This is evident not only from his letter but also from what he has said to others. The letter was tendered during the course of his evidence in the sentence proceedings and he was not challenged in relation to its contents. 

Totality 

77In other sentence proceedings in this matter I have explained why there should be a partial accumulation of sentences. It was conceded by Mr Stratton that a similar degree of partial accumulation was appropriate in this case. I will adopt the same approach. 

78I propose to impose a fixed term of imprisonment for the affray offence as there would be no utility in setting a non-parole period. I refer to, but do not repeat, what I said about fixed terms of imprisonment in sentencing Pirini: R v Pirini , supra, [2011] NSWSC 1395 at [73]. The fixed term I propose will be the equivalent of the full term of the sentence, not what would have been a non-parole period. 

Deterrence 

79An important matter that must be factored into the assessment of the appropriate sentence is deterrence. Personal deterrence cannot be ignored, even with the finding I have made about the offender's rehabilitation prospects. 

80More important, however, is general deterrence; that is, the deterrence of others. It was brazen and arrogant for the offender and his Comanchero colleagues to further their ongoing dispute with the Hells Angels by carrying out a violent attack in such a public place as an airport terminal. 

81As I have said in other sentence proceedings, it is a regrettable and distressing fact that wars between rival bikie gangs occur from time to time. Those who perpetrate serious violence or property damage in pursuit of such wars must know that significant punishment awaits them upon detection. However, when the violence spills out into the public arena, as exemplified by this case, a clear message must be sent that it will be met by punishment that is severe. 

Parity 

82Mr Sttratton conceded that the offender's criminal record diminshed the application of strict parity, but submitted that in ""all other respects the offender is in a very similar situation to the other offenders who have been sentenced"" and that the principles of parity should apply. 

83I do not intend to recite in any detail how sentences were assessed for each of the co-offenders. His Hounour Judge Charteris in the District Court sentenced the offenders AL and SP and I have elsewhere referred to the manner in which his Honour assessed their sentences: see, for example, R v Pirini , supra, at [66]. I have previously sentenced Messrs Costa, Aouli, La Rosa, Pirini, Potrus, Eken and Kisicanin. 

84The offender's involvement in the incidents at both Gate 5 and the departure hall was greater than of those already sentenced for the same offences. It was only minimally more in relation to the affray, but more than minimally in relation to the manslaughter. Pirini played a small and reactive role in the fighting in the departure hall. La Rosa and Costa accepted that they were parties to a joint criminal enterprise but they were not active at all; rather, they were sentenced on the basis that they were willing to assist if required. Aouli was sentenced for being a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to intimidate, contemplating the possibility that an unlawful and dangerous assault might be committed. He did not, however, play any active role. 

85Unlike Aouli and the present offender, Pirini, La Rosa and Costa had either no, or no significant, record of previous convictions. La Rosa and Aouli were on conditional liberty at the time of the offences, whereas the offender, Pirini and Costa were not. Otherwise, generally favourable findings were made in terms of the subjective cases in respect of each of Pirini, La Rosa, Aouli and Costa. There was some differentiation in the reduction of their sentences on account of their pleas of guilty. 

86The foregoing factors, although not exhaustive, are some of the more significant similarities and differences that I have taken into account in an attempt to arrive at a sentence for the present offender which bears appropriate relativity to the sentences imposed upon the others. 

Special circumstances 

87It was submitted by Mr Stratton that there should be a finding of special circumstances. I accept that submission. It would be in the interests of both the offender and the community that there be a longer than usual period of parole supervision. The purpose of this is to ensure, as far as possible, that after the offender's release he re-establishes a stable life in the community, including settling back into employment, and importantly, remains free of alcohol and ilicit drugs. It is also important to ensure he avoids any further involvement with outlaw motorcycle gangs and their members. I expect that will be a matter of particular interest to the Parole Authority. 

Sentence 

Convicted. 

Affray: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years commencing 27 March 2009 and expiring 26 March 2012. 

Manslaughter: Sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years 8 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 3 years 6 months. The sentence is to date from 27 September 2009. The offender will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 26 May 2013. The total term will expire on 26 November 2016. 

That is an aggregate term of imprisonment of 7 years 8 months with a minimum period to be served of 4 years 2 months before parole eligibility. 

The sentence for the offence of manslaughter has been reduced from one of 8 years 6 months to one of 7 years 2 months on account of the offender's plea of guilty.

2758772,Cooper v Winter [2012] NSWSC 161,"Judgment 

1The plaintiff, Mr Cooper, sues his former solicitors for damages or equitable compensation in respect of loss which the plaintiff alleges he suffered as a result of the negligence or breach of duty of Mr Winter, the first defendant. 

2The plaintiff's case is that Mr Winter was retained by him as his solicitor and that he failed to act in his best interests and continued to act for other parties notwithstanding that there was a conflict between the plaintiff's interests and the interests of the other parties. The plaintiff also alleges that Mr Winter gave him certain assurances which caused him to act in particular ways and that the plaintiff lost various opportunities to make money as a result. 

3The defendants defend the proceedings on the basis that although Mr Winter did act for the plaintiff, he was retained by the plaintiff only for the following discrete matters: 

(1)acting for the plaintiff and his then wife, Kim Cooper, in October 1997 on their sale of vacant land at Ross Street Windsor ( the Ross Street Property ); 

(2)acting for the plaintiff and Ms Cooper in 1997 and 1998 in occasional communications with the Australian Taxation Office ( the ATO ) in respect of their tax debts; and 

(3)drafting the plaintiff's and Ms Cooper's wills in September 2002. 

4In June 2001, he also acted for Mrs Cooper, the plaintiff's mother, in respect of a mortgage to which Blamathon was also a party which was discharged in October 2003. 

5The defendants' case is that Mr Winter was, at all other times, and in all other respects, retained by Blamathon Pty Limited ( Blamathon ) and its principal shareholder, Kathleen Lockrey, the plaintiff's mother-in-law. Although at times other than those referred to specifically above, the plaintiff gave Mr Winter instructions, he did so in his capacity as director or employee of Blamathon, for whom Mr Winter acted. 

6The defendants abandoned their defence under the Limitation Act 1969. 

7In addition to various documents, the plaintiff relied on his own evidence and an expert report of Mr Mann on the issue of solicitors' duties to their clients. Mr Mann was not cross-examined. His opinion therefore stands or falls on whether the factual assumptions on which it is based can be established by the plaintiff. 

8In addition to various documents, the defendants relied on the evidence of Mr Winter and Ms Lockrey, both of whom were cross-examined. 

Background 

9The plaintiff was a builder. In 1991 he and Ms Cooper purchased the Ross Street Property with a view to developing it into 40 lots. This was to be done in two stages: the first stage was to comprise 12 lots and the second was to comprise 28 lots. By about 1995, Stage 1 was completed. By 1994, if not earlier, the plaintiff and Ms Cooper each had substantial tax liabilities for which inadequate provision had been made as well as other significant debts. 

10It is common ground that the plaintiff and Ms Cooper first consulted Mr Winter in 1994 to obtain advice on their taxation liabilities. The plaintiff says that he also sought advice from Mr Winter on how best to proceed with the Stage 2 development of the Ross Street Property. Mr Winter denies that advice was sought on this topic. 

11In 1995 Ms Lockrey caused Blamathon to be incorporated. From the outset and at all material times thereafter, Ms Lockrey owned at least 95% of its shares. The plaintiff introduced Mr Winter to Ms Lockrey and, from its incorporation, Mr Winter acted for Blamathon and Ms Lockrey, except on two occasions (which are referred to in more detail below) where he recommended that they seek legal advice from another firm. 

12The plaintiff gave evidence that Mr Winter advised him in about 1996 that he should transfer the Ross Street Property to someone he could trust, wait for two years and then go bankrupt. When he was discharged from bankruptcy, he could then ask for the property to be returned to him. Mr Winter denies ever giving such advice. 

13According to Mr Winter, in 1997 Ms Lockrey offered to assist her daughter and son-in-law by purchasing the Ross Street Property from them for its market value of $250,000. This amount would then be applied to discharge the first registered mortgage. There is no evidence to suggest that the $250,000 paid to the mortgagee was less than the market value of the property. Ms Lockrey and Mr Winter gave evidence that the purchase price was sufficient to discharge the existing mortgage but there was no surplus paid to the plaintiff or Ms Cooper. 

14Mr Winter prepared an agreement, dated 10 October 1997, between Ms Lockrey on the one hand and the plaintiff and Ms Cooper on the other ( the Ross Street Agreement ). The recitals record: 

""Cooper has sold to Lockrey the land comprised in Lot 1 Macquarie Street, Windsor... consisting of a subdivisible acreage having the benefit of a valid and subsisting development consent issued by the Hawkesbury City Council allowing for subdivision..."" 

15Mr Winter said that, in respect of the Ross Street Agreement, he acted on behalf of Ms Lockrey, the plaintiff and Ms Cooper. He gave evidence that he was uncomfortable that all parties wanted him to prepare the agreement and sign it in front of him. In oral evidence he confirmed the underlying facts of the agreement, which provides, at clause 5: 

""Each of the parties hereto acknowledge that they have been given the opportunity to seek legal advice with respect to these provisions and financial advice and that they have satisfied themselves with respect to the legal and financial obligations and meaning of these agreements."" 

16Mr Winter's memorandum of account to the plaintiff and Ms Cooper recorded that he charged them for two hours for: 

""Our professional costs on providing general advice with respect to financial position."" 

17The Ross Street Agreement contemplated that Ms Lockrey would herself develop and ultimately sell the Ross Street Property with the assistance of the plaintiff and Mrs Cooper who would have a contractual entitlement to share in the profits, if any, made from the development. 

18Although Mr Winter acted for Ms Lockrey in respect of the drafting of the Ross Street Agreement, he referred her to another solicitor, Mr Bellantonio, to act on the actual transfer of the property. The transfer to Ms Lockrey did not proceed as envisaged in that the Ross Street Property was transferred to Blamathon rather than to her. Ms Lockrey gave evidence that she accepted her accountant's advice that it would be better if the property was purchased in the name of Blamathon rather than in her own name. 

19Mr Winter accepted in cross-examination that he took no steps to ensure that the plaintiff and Ms Cooper had the same rights against Blamathon to the profits from the development as they would have had had Ms Lockrey purchased the Ross Street Property. However, it is clear from Mr Winter's evidence that he was not involved in either implementing the Ross Street Agreement once he had drafted it and witnessed the signatures of Ms Lockrey and the plaintiff or in implementing the changed arrangements to transfer it to Blamathon. Furthermore he regarded it as a ""family arrangement"". 

20Mr Winter's evidence was that Ms Lockrey ""habitually changed her instructions"" in relation to matters concerning the family, how the affairs of Blamathon would be conducted, who would be its directors and what legal relationships would apply. The change in the identity of the purchaser of the Ross Street Property was the first of these. The evidence reveals that several documents were drafted by Mr Winter on Ms Lockrey's instructions but either not executed, or only partly executed, and not implemented. Mr Winter summed up this situation in the following terms in cross-examination: 

""Q. What happened to this document sir? [the undated Deed of Arrangement, referred to below] 

A. I don't think - I think that was another document that was never actioned. Kath Lockrey was at pains to try to resolve these family situations over a long period of time and did many things and instructed me to do many things. But in the end it availed her nothing and the family situation was not recoverable. That's the reason for the plethora of documents that you have here."" 

21Mr Winter also said, in cross-examination: 

""Quite a lot of things that I did for Blamathon were prompted by emotions and were urgent as a result..."" 

22In May 1998, Mr Winter was again called upon to advise and act on behalf of the plaintiff and Ms Cooper, this time in their dealings with the ATO. The plaintiff and Ms Cooper had been served with statements of claim for tax debts amounting at that time to over $200,000 each. In October 1998, Mr Winter was party to communications with the plaintiff and Mrs Cooper and tax officers. He wrote a letter dated 20 November 1998 on their behalf in which he acknowledged that the ATO was entitled to bankrupt them for their tax debts. The letter contained the following passages: 

""The reason that our clients are without means is that the business which generated the income upon which these taxation assessments were made has collapsed and they now find themselves with a modest income, children to support and no assets. 

We have been requested to explain that all of our clients assets were sold some time ago in order to satisfy the demands of their major secured creditor, namely their Bank."" 

23On 3 August 1999, the plaintiff and Ms Cooper were made bankrupt. At the time of the commencement of the bankruptcy, each owed creditors in the order of $400,000. The principal creditor in each case was the ATO but there was also another substantial creditor associated with a previous development. The evidence reveals that sequestration orders were made as a result of the filing of debtors' petitions by the plaintiff and Mrs Cooper. According to the evidence, they were not required to make contributions to their trustees during their bankruptcies as their income did not exceed the threshold. 

24There was a conversation between Mr Winter and the plaintiff which the plaintiff says occurred in about January 2002. According to the plaintiff, the conversation was in the following terms: 

""I said to Ron Winter 'Ron my marriage is not going well. Kim and Kath are holding everything over my head. I want to start paperwork to get this sorted out. I have only six months to go until I come out of bankruptcy.' 

Ron Winter said to me 'It will only take two weeks to change it over. Kath has to sign it over. She holds it in trust.' 

I said to Ron 'They are saying that they're not signing it back over to me.' Ron said: 'Kath isn't saying that to me'."" 

25Mr Winter accepted that he had a conversation with the plaintiff which may have taken place in early 2002 in which he was told that the plaintiff's marriage was not going well but he denies the balance of the plaintiff's version. He denied that he was speaking to the plaintiff in his capacity as the plaintiff's solicitor. The following exchange took place in Mr Winter's cross-examination: 

""Q. Why would you see him to discuss his marriage, if it was not going well, if you did not take instructions from him? 

A. Why would I not see Peter Cooper? I dealt with him on a regular basis as a director of Blamathon."" 

26Although the plaintiff was not, at that time, a director of Blamathon, it is common ground that he managed the Ross Street Development for Blamathon and performed the building work. 

27In about June 2002, the plaintiff identified a property on the Bells Line of Road ( the Bells Property ) which he considered to be suitable for development. There is a substantial dispute of fact about the contents of a conversation between the plaintiff and Mr Winter concerning the acquisition of the Bells Property. 

28The plaintiff's evidence, in his statement made on 14 April 2010, was that in June 2002, in the course of a single telephone conversation, Mr Winter advised him to proceed with the purchase of the Bells Property in the name of Blamathon because it would be easier to borrow the funds needed to develop the property using that company structure. When the plaintiff raised with him the question whether he would be able to get the benefit from the Bells Property if it was owned by Blamathon, Mr Winter said: 

""...there would be no problems as Kath [Lockrey] owns Blamathon and Blamathon would hold the property in trust and would have to sign it back to you... We'll just put it all in Blamathon's name and then when you're discharged from Bankruptcy, it will all come back to you."" 

29The plaintiff's evidence was that Mr Winter had made this statement to him notwithstanding that it was the first time he had raised the acquisition of the Bells Property with him, and that Mr Winter had not had any opportunity in the course of that telephone conversation to consult with Ms Lockrey or obtain her instructions as to Blamathon's preparedness or otherwise to acquire the property and hold it in trust for the plaintiff's sole benefit. According to the plaintiff, in the same conversation, Mr Winter instructed him to approach Mr Godwin, Blamathon's accountant, to get the paperwork started for the transfer of Blamathon's shares ""back to"" him. There is, accordingly, an inherent inconsistency in the plaintiff's statement as to whether the shares in Blamathon, or the Bells Property itself, were to constitute the trust property. 

30The plaintiff gave a different version in examination in chief: 

""I rang Ron [Winter]'s office and left a message. He rang me back the next day and I said to him: 'I found a property at 39 Bells Line of Road'. I said: 'I want to buy it. Should we buy it in a new company?' His reply was: 'No, buy it in Blamathon's name. It's easier to get finance' and I said to him: 'Well I'm worried about Kath and Kim' and he said: 'It will come back to you. Trust me. I am in control'."" 

31At the time the alleged conversation occurred, it was probable that the plaintiff knew that Mr Winter was neither a director nor a shareholder of Blamathon and could in no sense be said to be ""in control"". When the inconsistency between what he said in his statement and what he said in oral evidence was put to the plaintiff in cross-examination, the plaintiff said: 

""Q. A few minutes ago, Mr Cooper... I asked you whether you drew a distinction between the property and the shares and you agreed? 

A. Correct. 

Q. Did Mr Winter say to you, in early June 2002, that the property would be held in trust or that the shares would be held in trust or something else? 

A. He just said, I'm in control and it all comes back to you, don't worry about Kath. 

Q. What did he tell you would be held in trust? 

A. Everything. 

Q. All right. Can you, doing the best you can, tell her Honour what Mr Winter said to you. That is, he said to me words to the effect of. 

A. I'm in control, it all comes back to you. 

Q. Right. I'm asking about that part of the conversation when he's talking about what would be held in trust. 

A. Everything. 

Q. What did he say to you, everything? 

A. Blamathon is held in trust for you and it all comes back to you. That is all I ever got out of him. 

Q. So you have no recollection of him saying that Blamathon would hold the property in trust for you? 

A. No. He just said, it all comes back to you. "" 

[Emphasis added.] 

32That a version is given for the first time in oral evidence tells against its reliability. As Campbell J (as his Honour then was) said in White v Shortall [2006] NSWSC 1379; 68 NSWLR 650 at 664-665: 

""Frequently, it is very damaging to the credibility of a plaintiff's case if important evidence relating to it emerges only late in the course of evidence. The reason for this is that the Court is usually justified in assuming that the legal representatives of a plaintiff embarking on something as significant and potentially expensive as Supreme Court litigation will properly proof their client, obtain from their client all relevant details of the story relevant to the case, and include that material in affidavits in chief."" 

33Mr Winter's affidavit evidence is that the following exchange occurred at about that time: 
""PC: There's a property at Bells Line of Road that I wouldn't mind buying. 
RWW: I don't see how you can do that, you are a bankrupt. 
PC: What if I form another company to buy it? 
RWW: I can't see how. You are a bankrupt. 
PC: Kath might buy it. 
RWW: As long as she is happy to do that and instructs me to do it. That's fine."" 

34Mr Winter rejected the proposition put to him in cross-examination that even if the conversation occurred as he recalled it, he was acting as the plaintiff's solicitor and denied that the conversation constituted a retainer. As far as Mr Winter was concerned the plaintiff had been his client ""some years previously in a disconnected matter"". Nonetheless, Mr Winter, in my view correctly, accepted that he had a duty, even absent a retainer, to give the plaintiff correct advice. 

35On 23 July 2002, the plaintiff wrote to Mr Batiste of AMP Finance purporting to provide an update on the future of Blamathon. The letter reads in part: 

""This is an update on the future of the company known as Blamathon Pty Limited, during the month there will be a name change from Blamathon Pty Limited to Minoan Constructions. Kathleen [Lockrey] will be resigning as a director of the company known as Blamathon Pty Limited. 

The charges will be changed into a trust for Nathan and Madison Cooper [the children of the plaintiff and Ms Cooper, and the grandchildren of Ms Lockrey]. Kim Cooper will become the director/ trustee of the company."" 

36Mr Batiste referred the letter to Mr Winter on the basis that the plaintiff was not a director of Blamathon and had no authority to request such changes. 

37On 4 August 2002 the plaintiff was discharged from bankruptcy. 

38By letter dated 21 August 2002, Mr Winter wrote to Mr Godwin, Ms Lockrey and Blamathon's accountant, to advise that he had been instructed to transfer Ms Lockrey's shares in Blamathon to Kim Cooper to be held on trust for Madison and Nathan Cooper, who will be the ""specific beneficiaries"" with Ms Cooper and the plaintiff as ""further general beneficiaries"". Although a sentence in the letter suggest that Mr Winter was not only acting for Ms Lockrey but also for Ms Cooper and the plaintiff, he said in evidence that this was a mistake since at that time he was acting only for Ms Lockrey, the transferor of the shares. 

39There is an undated draft document in evidence entitled ""Discretionary Trust Deed"" for a trust to be called ""The Cooper Family Trust"" which nominates Minoan Pty Limited as the trustee and Madison and Nathan Cooper as specified beneficiaries. Ms Cooper and the plaintiff are nominated as additional members of the class of general beneficiaries. The document does not reveal its date of preparation. Neither Mr Winter nor Ms Lockrey could put a date on it. However, the document does establish that the creation of a discretionary trust for Ms Lockrey's grandchildren was in Ms Lockrey's contemplation at some time. Having regard to the terms of the plaintiff's letter to Mr Batiste and Mr Winter's letter to Mr Godwin, both of which refer to such a trust, I infer that this proposal was in contemplation at least from 2002, although it was not acted on, beyond the preparation of draft documents. 

40On 30 August 2002 contracts were exchanged for the purchase of the Bells Property by Blamathon for $730,000. Mr Winter acted for Blamathon on the purchase. I accept Ms Lockrey's evidence that the plaintiff wanted Blamathon to lend him the money so that he could buy the Bells Property on his own account but Ms Lockrey refused to permit such a loan. 

41The plaintiff's evidence is that he would not have permitted the purchase to go through in the name of Blamathon had he appreciated that the shares of Blamathon were not held in trust for him. It is, however, difficult to imagine what the plaintiff could have done to stop the purchase given that he had no access to funds to purchase it himself. 

42Indeed, when it was put to Mr Winter that the plaintiff could have bought the Bells Property on his own account because contracts were not exchanged until after he had been discharged from bankruptcy, Mr Winter said that the plaintiff could not have done so ""because he had no ability to borrow money to buy it"". Mr Winter said further: 

""My recollection is that Blamathon borrowed from Terry Leckie at Balmain NB and that in the main it was Kath who did the talking to Balmain NB. Peter may have had some part of it, but the reason Blamathon was successful in getting that loan was because they had a track record and capability and assets."" 

43At about this time, Mr Winter was instructed to prepare deeds of indemnity whereby Ms Lockrey would be indemnified by Blamathon, the plaintiff and Ms Cooper respectively in respect of guarantees she had given and obligations she had incurred on behalf of the indemnifying party. Mr Winter gave evidence that he prepared these documents at a time when Ms Lockrey was endeavouring to extricate herself from Blamathon and hand it over to the plaintiff and Ms Cooper. He acted in respect of these deeds on behalf of Ms Lockrey and Blamathon. 

44On 21 November 2002, the plaintiff lodged a document with ASIC which indicated that he had been appointed, and Ms Lockrey had resigned, as a director of Blamathon on 9 October 2002. In cross-examination, Ms Lockrey accepted that she had signed a document dated 14 October 2002 in which she resigned as a director of Blamathon as of 9 October 2002, but said that she had signed it ""under duress"". This evidence was not challenged. 

45When Ms Lockrey was asked why the deeds of indemnity referred to above were never implemented she said: 

""Because I had found that Mr Cooper had changed my company over to his name without my knowledge and that's why I changed my mind on this."" 

46At a meeting of the shareholders of Blamathon on 28 November 2002, at which Mr Winter was appointed Chair, the plaintiff was removed as a director of Blamathon. At about this time the plaintiff and Ms Cooper separated. 

47In early January 2003, the plaintiff instructed Mr Weller, his current solicitor, to act on his behalf. He instructed Mr Weller to write to Mr Winter and ask for any trust deed or agreement between the plaintiff and Blamathon. Mr Winter's firm responded that there was no such document but Mr Weller sought further assurances and nominated 1998 as the date of such a deed. Mr Winter wrote the following response by letter dated 29 January 2003: 

""I confirm that no Trust Deed or Deed of Arrangement was prepared between the parties and no instructions were ever received to prepare such a Deed. 

Your client and his wife sold land to Blamathon Pty Ltd and no money in respect of that acquisition was ever provided by your client or his wife. 

Indeed your client and his wife subsequently declared themselves bankrupt. 

Your client to the best of my knowledge and belief has no claim whatsoever against the assets of Blamathon Pty Ltd other than perhaps as an employee of that corporation."" 

48This correspondence establishes that at least from January 2003 the plaintiff knew that neither Blamathon, nor Ms Lockrey, accepted that either its shares or its property were held on trust for him. 

49By letter dated 6 June 2003, Balmain NB, a finance broker, wrote to Banksia Financial Group with a view to refinancing the borrowings of Blamathon from both AMP Finance and Ms Lockrey and to provide some funds for future investment. The credit submission attached to that letter seeks a loan of $1,090,000 for 2 years. There is a comment about the Bells Property as follows: 

""Additionally the North Richmond property [Bells Property] is to be sold when D/A for mixed residential/ Commercial Development is achieved. This will substantially reduce loan amount and further improve the loan servicing."" 

50By letter dated 13 June 2003, Balmain NB wrote to the plaintiff and Ms Cooper as directors of Blamathon (although at that stage neither was) to offer finance to Blamathon, on behalf of Banksia Financial Group. The plaintiff and Ms Cooper accepted the letter of offer on behalf of Blamathon on 3 July 2003, by which time they had been appointed directors of Blamathon (see below). The loan was ultimately settled on 19 December 2003. 

51There is another document in evidence, which refers to 2003, but which is otherwise undated ( the 2003 Draft Deed ). It records in the recitals, that Ms Lockrey wants to retire as a director of Blamathon and appoint the plaintiff, Ms Cooper and Mr Winter as directors. 

52Recital B of the 2003 Draft Deed reads: 

""Blamathon is the Trustee of the Cooper Family Trust and holds real estate and other property in its capacity as Trustee under the Cooper Family Trust (hereinafter referred to as 'the Trust')."" 

53Clause 2 of the 2003 Draft Deed provides: 

""Upon receipt of a written loan approval which is satisfactory in all respects and which has the effect of discharging every personal guarantee previously given by Kath [Lockrey], then Kath will forthwith cause a meeting of Blamathon to be held at which Directors shall be elected, being Ronald William Winter, Peter Cooper and Kim Cooper and once these Directors have been elected then Kath will resign her Directorships of Blamathon."" 

54Mr Winter's evidence is that he acted for Ms Lockrey and Blamathon in relation to the preparation of the 2003 Draft Deed. He said that it was not ""actioned"" or dated. 

55The plaintiff and Ms Cooper were appointed directors of Blamathon on 17 June 2003, as was Mr Winter, who was appointed Chair. Ms Lockrey resigned as a director. Ms Lockrey explained that she had, by this time, become very busy with her farmstay business and felt that it might be better for the plaintiff and Ms Cooper to run Blamathon together as directors. 

56From time to time thereafter, the plaintiff gave instructions to Mr Winter on behalf of Blamathon, as he was authorised to do as a director of Blamathon. It was put several times in cross-examination to Mr Winter in respect of such occasions that the plaintiff had thereby become Mr Winter's client. Mr Winter rejected these propositions and confirmed that he was taking such instructions from Blamathon, which was his client, from the plaintiff as one of its directors. 

57Later in 2003 the relationship between the plaintiff and Ms Cooper deteriorated. On 27 August 2003, Ms Cooper obtained an interim Apprehended Violence Order ( AVO ) against the plaintiff. 

58On 15 September 2003, there was a board meeting of Blamathon at which various resolutions were made that, if implemented, would have had the effect of buying out Ms Lockrey from Blamathon. In part this would have involved the sale of one of the company's properties at 11 Tollgate Crescent, Windsor and the transfer of a property known as Lot 21 to Ms Lockrey. There is no reference to Ms Lockrey holding her shares in Blamathon in trust for anyone in these minutes. 

59Four days later, on 19 September 2003, Mr Winter wrote to Ms Lockrey and set out the terms of the settlement that had been resolved at the board meeting. His evidence was that he wrote the letter in accordance with what he understood her instructions to be. The last sentence of the letter reads: 

""We further note that the shares which you hold in Blamathon Pty Limited are held in trust for Kim Cooper and Peter Cooper [the plaintiff]."" 

60The foot of the letter has been signed by Ms Lockrey and by the plaintiff. 

61There is no evidence that this settlement was implemented. 

62In his oral evidence, Mr Winter said that Ms Lockrey: 

""...had held the shares in her own right and at stages she felt disposed to perhaps... have them held in trust for the two children of Peter and Kim but never in favour of the Peter and Kim."" 

63When the inconsistency between this oral evidence and the note in the letter of 19 September 2003 was put to him, Mr Winter said: 

""It was my expression of what I understood to be Kath Lockrey's intentions. My view is that since that time I was incorrect in making that assumption, because she never indicated that that was the case."" 

64Ms Lockrey was cross-examined about the last sentence of the letter: 

""Q. The question is: That was your belief at the time; that you held the shares in trust? 

A. Yes I don't remember, I'm sorry, but I have signed it, so it must have happened."" 

65Although Ms Lockrey at times in her cross-examination appeared to admit that she intended to hold her shares in Blamathon on trust for the plaintiff and Ms Cooper, I am satisfied that she did not intend that to be the case and that her instructions were incorrectly recorded by Mr Winter. Her evidence in cross-examination set out above, is in my view a reflection of her fading memory and her trust in Mr Winter, rather than an admission that she ever had an intention to create a trust in favour of the plaintiff and Ms Cooper. She agreed that she had at times wanted Kim to hold the shares in trust for Nathan and Madison (and this is reflected in the draft discretionary trust deed referred to above) but I do not accept that she ever intended the plaintiff and Ms Cooper to hold those shares, although she did nominate them as additional general beneficiaries of the discretionary trust that was proposed. 

66It would be wholly at odds with her consistent policy of providing for her daughter and grandchildren while also providing work for her son-in-law in a manner that did not put her assets at risk, for her to grant to the plaintiff an equitable interest either in her shares in Blamathon or in Blamathon's assets. 

67In September 2003 a Development Approval was granted by the Hawkesbury Council in respect of the Bells Property, the effect of which was to approve a change in the use of the police station to a restaurant and leave the second lot as vacant land. Ms Lockrey and the plaintiff had discussed further development that could be undertaken on the Bells Property, including the construction of a four-storey building with underground parking on Lot 2. However, this proposal did not proceed, either when Blamathon owned the property or subsequently. Photographs of the Bells Property taken more recently show a low-rise commercial development of one, or at most two, levels. 

68On 17 November 2003, the plaintiff was charged with a breach of the AVO. He agreed in cross-examination that during this period his relationship with Ms Cooper and with her mother, Ms Lockrey, was ""poisonous"". 

69In January 2004, at a board meeting of Blamathon, Mr Winter raised concerns about its solvency. By February 2004 these concerns were assuaged by the prospect that Blamathon had agreed to sell certain properties which would repay some of its loans, including the Bells Property. The plaintiff agreed that he had participated in Blamathon's decision to sell the property, the price and the identity of the purchaser and the decision to rescind the first contract (referred to below) and the time for completion. 

70The minutes of a board meeting of Blamathon on 29 March 2004, at which the plaintiff was present, record a resolution that ""all properties are to be sold in an orderly manner"". 

71On 23 April 2004, contracts were exchanged for the sale of the Bells Property for $950,000 on the instructions of the plaintiff as a director of Blamathon. By authorisation dated 27 April 2004, the plaintiff instructed Mr Winter to sign on his behalf as a director of Blamathon. The first contract was rescinded on 31 May 2004 and another contract for sale entered into with Dalco Pty Limited which had a completion date of 27 October 2004. 

72For the financial year ended 30 June 2004, Blamathon recorded a loss in the order of $37,000 in its profit and loss statement and its balance sheet showed that it had net assets of $925,000. Of the total assets of $3.18 M, $2.26 M were referable to the Ross Street Development and the balance, $920,000, to the Bells Road Development. The liabilities of $2.26 M were not segregated between developments. 

73On 5 July 2004 there was a board meeting of Blamathon, at which Mr Winter, on behalf of Ms Lockrey, put to Ms Cooper and the plaintiff that if they could not agree by 5 August 2004 on how the business of Blamathon ought be conducted, all assets would need to be sold. Ms Cooper took out another interim AVO, which the plaintiff signed, on 23 July 2004. 

74There is another undated document which was prepared by Mr Winter on the instructions of Ms Lockrey entitled ""Deed of Arrangement"". The only clue as to its date of creation are the terms of recital D, which recites: 

""Kim and Peter have up until the 1 st September 2004 been employed by Blamathon to carry out the objects of the corporation."" 

75The draft Deed of Arrangement appears to be another futile and aborted attempt to resolve matters between Blamathon, Ms Lockrey, Ms Cooper and the plaintiff. The matters to be resolved included any matrimonial disputes between Ms Cooper and the plaintiff. 

76In about August 2004, Mr Winter sought urgent contact with the plaintiff regarding the sale of one of the lots of Stage 2 of the Ross Street Development. Mr Winter's evidence was that he contacted the plaintiff in his various capacities as a director of Blamathon, an employee of Blamathon and as the builder who had been responsible for the construction of the houses that comprised the Ross Street Development. 

77On 9 September 2004, there was a meeting of Blamathon which was attended by Ms Lockrey, Ms Cooper, the plaintiff and Mr Winter. The shareholders (of whom only Ms Lockrey was present) proposed a resolution that all directors be dismissed and that the new directors be Mr Winter and Ms Lockrey. These resolutions were passed. Ms Lockrey explained that she took the company over again because the plaintiff ""wasn't doing the job properly"". 

78On 11 November 2004 the plaintiff lodged caveats against the real property of Blamathon, including the Bells Property. 

79Schedules 1 of the caveats read as follows: 

""Caveat AB83706M: 

The Caveator has an equitable interest in the whole of the land pursuant to a Deed of Trust and an Agreement dated 10 October 1997 between Blamathon Pty Ltd, Kathleen Mary Lockrey, Peter Joseph Cooper and Kim Michelle Cooper whereby the said Kathleen Mary Lockrey and Blamathon Pty Ltd held the said lands in trust for the benefit of Nathan Joseph Cooper and Madison Kate Cooper, the children of Peter Cooper and Kim Cooper. 

Caveat AB83724K: 

The Caveator has an equitable interest in the whole of the land pursuant to verbal agreement between the said Kathleen Mary Brook-Lockrey, Blamathon Pty Ltd and Peter Joseph Cooper whereby it was agreed that the said Peter Joseph Cooper in consideration for supply of work and expertise in the building trade was granted an equitable interest in the said lands securing the amount of his unpaid services in favour of the registered proprietor and the said Kathleen Mary Brook-Lockrey, such unpaid services now amount to $1,200,000.00."" 

80On 12 November 2004, the plaintiff was charged with breach of the interim AVOs. 

81On 18 November 2004, the plaintiff withdrew the caveats from the title of the Bells Property to permit settlement of the sale to occur that day. They remained on the other properties. 

82At about this time Blamathon commenced proceedings in the Equity Division of this Court against the plaintiff for removal of the caveats lodged in respect of Blamathon's other properties. The plaintiff filed a cross-claim seeking that the caveats be extended and also seeking an injunction to restrain Mr Winter from acting for Blamathon, Ms Lockrey, Ms Cooper or himself. At that time Mr Winter, who had been the solicitor on the record for Blamathon's proceedings, ceased to act because he became a party to the proceedings. At this point he referred Blamathon to independent solicitors to act for it in the Equity Division proceedings. 

83Barrett J refused to extend either of the caveats on the ground that the plaintiff had no equitable interest in any of the properties: Blamathon Pty Limited v Cooper (21 December 2004). Although Mr Winter was a cross-defendant to the plaintiff's cross-claim, the plaintiff did not seek any of the relief against Mr Winter that he claims in these proceedings, although at the time of the Equity Division proceedings he had known for almost two years that his claim to an equitable interest in the properties or shares of Blamathon was disputed. The plaintiff submitted that the proceedings concerned a different matter, namely whether Mr Winter ought be restrained from acting for Blamathon and Ms Lockrey in those proceedings. Nonetheless there are allegations of fact in the cross-claim which are relatively detailed about what transpired and yet no reference whatsoever was made to the June 2002 conversation that is said to have occurred. 

Findings about the disputed conversations 

84As appears from the narrative set out above, the principal matters in dispute are the conversations that are said to have occurred in January and June 2002 and the duration of any retainer of Mr Winter by the plaintiff. There is a contest of credit between the plaintiff and Mr Winter in respect of each of them. 

85I considered that both the plaintiff and Mr Winter gave their evidence in an apparently forthright manner. However, the plaintiff was unable to explain the discordance between his versions and the surrounding circumstances or the inconsistencies between his version in his statements and his version in cross-examination. He was also unable to explain why he had not made his present complaint against Mr Winter when he joined him as a cross-defendant in the Equity Division proceedings in 2004. There is a degree of opportunism in the plaintiff's claim against Mr Winter which appears to derive from certain draft, or ambiguous, documents, rather than from the plaintiff's true recollection of events. 

86Mr Winter was prepared to make appropriate concessions. For example, although it was his usual practice to document conferences and meetings, he admitted that he did not always have time to do so and was relying on his recollection. He maintained that he principally acted as the solicitor for Ms Lockrey and Blamathon but accepted, when it was put to him, that he had also signed a mortgage on behalf of Mrs Marie Cooper, the plaintiff's mother on a mortgage she had granted to Blamathon, on behalf of whom he acted and said: ""Perhaps I shouldn't have done that."" 

87Mr Winter impressed me as a solicitor who was mindful at all times of the identity of his client and his duty to protect the interests of that person. He was uncomfortable when called upon to act for both sides of a transaction as he was when he was asked to prepare the October 1997 agreement between Ms Lockrey, the plaintiff and Ms Cooper. He not only encouraged them to seek independent legal advice, but also included an acknowledgement to that effect in the agreement. He then referred Ms Lockrey to another solicitor to act for her, and, as it turned out, Blamathon, on the actual transfer. He exhibited some embarrassment when it was pointed out to him that he had signed a mortgage for Mrs Cooper, when he had also acted for Blamathon on the same transaction. As soon as he was joined as a party in the Equity Division proceedings he ceased to act on behalf of Blamathon. 

88Mr Winter was cross-examined to the effect that the sentence he included in a letter he sent to the ATO on behalf of the plaintiff and Ms Cooper was not correct since he said that they were ""without means"", when in fact they had the rights to the profits of the Bell Street Development. Mr Winter said that he had written the letter on their instructions. Furthermore there is no evidence that the Ross Street Development generated profits. Although Ms Lockrey in cross-examination agreed that it was ""successful"", there was no explanation of what she meant by the word. 

89The principal basis on which I prefer Mr Winter's version of both conversations and indeed his evidence as a whole is that, unlike the plaintiff's evidence, it is consistent with the objective circumstances and consistent with documentary evidence, including the various draft documents referred to above, which reflect Ms Lockrey various endeavours to resolve the disputes between Blamathon, the plaintiff and Ms Cooper and to extricate herself from Blamathon. 

90The defendants submitted that, as the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ) said in Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 at 129, the best guide on which to reason to my conclusions is to do so: 

""...on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events."" 

91The objective circumstances appear from the narrative above. They can be summarised as follows: 

(1)At the time the Ross Street Property was sold to Blamathon in late 1997, the plaintiff and Ms Cooper were in financial difficulties which ultimately led to their bankruptcy. 

(2)The purchase price of the Ross Street Property, $250,000, was commensurate with its market value. 

(3)Ms Lockrey was either unwilling or unable to assist the plaintiff and Ms Cooper to prevent their bankruptcies in August 1999. 

(4)By early 2002 the plaintiff and Ms Cooper were having matrimonial difficulties which continued for some years, although until 2004 they continued to participate in the developments undertaken by Blamathon. 

(5)Ms Lockrey was in a position to assist her daughter and had shown herself to be prepared to do so by causing Blamathon to buy the Ross Street Property for market value so as to pay out the mortgagee and derive such benefit as could be had from Stage 2 of the development. 

(6)The terms of the Ross Street Agreement did not confer an interest in the Ross Street Property on either the plaintiff or Ms Cooper. 

(7)Ms Lockrey was concerned to protect and provide for her grandchildren, Nathan and Madison. 

(8)Ms Lockrey, through Blamathon, was prepared to develop Stage 2 of the Ross Street Property and the Bells Property, but only on the basis that her financial interests and those of Blamathon were protected. 

(9)Ms Lockrey was prepared to employ the plaintiff's services in the development of properties. 

(10)Ms Lockrey contemplated various legal structures over time that would permit her to extricate herself from Blamathon and the development of the Ross Street and Bells Properties but none of these came to fruition. 

(11)Mr Winter principally acted for Ms Lockrey and Blamathon but he also acted for the plaintiff and Ms Cooper in that he: 

(a)gave them financial advice about the effects of bankruptcy in 1996; 

(b)acted for them in 1997 in respect of the agreement to transfer the Ross Street Property; 

(c)made some communications with the ATO on their behalf in 1998; and 

(d)drafted their wills in 2002. 

92In these circumstances, it is entirely contrary to the ""apparent logic of events"" that Mr Winter would advise the plaintiff that he should transfer the Ross Street Property to Ms Lockrey, wait for two years, go bankrupt and then call for the title to be transferred back to him once he had been discharged from bankruptcy. Even if such suggestion had not been fraught with risk, it was entirely unnecessary in any event since there is nothing about the transfer of the Ross Street Property to Blamathon which suggests that it was other than a commercial arrangement at fair market value. Indeed Mr Winter's evidence was that he sought an assurance from Ms Lockrey that it would be; this was presumably to ensure that it was not voidable at the suit of any trustee in bankruptcy of the plaintiff or Ms Cooper. Furthermore the unchallenged evidence is that Blamathon provided the funds for the development of Stage 2, in circumstances where there was no prospect that the plaintiff would be able to do so. 

93The allegation that Mr Winter advised the plaintiff to transfer property so as to defraud his creditors is a very serious one and requires me to be satisfied to the Briginshaw standard ([1938] HCA 34; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 361-362, per Dixon J). I am not satisfied that any such advice was given. 

94I am satisfied that Mr Winter spoke to the plaintiff about bankruptcy and what it entailed. After all, he was communicating with the ATO on the plaintiff's behalf and the ATO was proposing to, and did, serve Bankruptcy Notices on the plaintiff and Ms Cooper. There was obvious commercial sense in the Ross Street Property being owned by a company which would not sell it to discharge the mortgage and which would not only permit it to be developed, but also fund its development for its benefit and for the potential benefit of the plaintiff and Ms Cooper. Furthermore the circumstances that the transfer divested the plaintiff and Ms Cooper of any proprietary interest in the Ross Street Property and did not confer any proprietary interest on them meant that there was no risk that the development could be upset, given the likelihood, if not inevitability, of their bankruptcies. 

95I accept Mr Winter's evidence as to the conversation between him and the plaintiff in January 2002. If the conversation had occurred as the plaintiff deposed, it would have been inconceivable that the plaintiff would have placed trust in Ms Lockrey to hold her Blamathon shares in trust for him so that he could have the full benefit of the Bells Property Development, since she had, on his version, reneged on the arrangement they had had with respect to the Ross Street Development in respect of which there was at least a written agreement. The plaintiff would have me believe that he trusted Ms Lockrey and that Mr Winter gave him assurances in June 2002. I do not accept the plaintiff's version. 

96The plaintiff's evidence is replete with internal inconsistencies and does not accord with contemporaneous documents and circumstances. I have referred already to the January and June 2002 conversations and why I do not accept that they both could have occurred, even if I only had the plaintiff's versions of both. 

97Further, the plaintiff's version of the June 2002 conversation is, as he accepted in cross-examination, entirely inconsistent with what he wrote to Mr Batiste in July 2002. In addition, had the plaintiff genuinely believed that the shares in Blamathon had been held in trust for him, he would have identified an arrangement in 2002 (based on the conversations referred to above), rather than 1999 when he lodged the caveats on Blamathon's properties. In any event, any equitable interest created in 1999 would have had to be declared to his trustee in bankruptcy and it was not. 

98The plaintiff was unable to shed any light on why Blamathon would take the whole risk of the Bells Property Development, including the substantial borrowings which it would have to make to undertake it, and yet he would get the whole of the benefit since all the shares would be held in trust for him. This arrangement would, without more, be not only improvident but also inexplicable from Blamathon's point of view. When one takes into account that Ms Lockrey was essentially the sole shareholder and that the marriage between her daughter and the plaintiff had by this time degenerated to the point where they separated just months after exchange of contracts for the purchase of the Bell Property, the proposition that it was all to the benefit of the plaintiff strains credulity. 

99The plaintiff does not address these objective facts in his submissions. Rather, the plaintiff's written submissions ask rhetorically: 

""The plaintiff relied upon his solicitor, Mr Winter. Why would the plaintiff work for Blamathon for 5 years post the sale of the Ross Street development land to Lockrey in 1997, and then guarantee a substantial loan of $1,090,000 unless he acted in reliance upon his solicitor that his interests were protected? The advice of the solicitor was clearly wrong, as there was no trust instrument in place to protect the plaintiff."" 

100I consider the answer to the plaintiff's rhetorical question to be that the plaintiff had no better option than to work for Blamathon in a development that he expected to be profitable and for which he was remunerated from time to time, since he did not have access to funds to conduct the development on his own account. 

101In making these findings, I do not find that the plaintiff's evidence was deliberately untrue. The plaintiff impressed me as an opportunistic entrepreneur who through misadventure, and possibly mismanagement, was dependent on his then mother-in-law to supply the finance for the development projects in which he wished to engage. It is common ground that he did much of the building involved in the development. 

102He had little appreciation of the distinction between himself and Blamathon and did not seem to understand the extent to which Ms Lockrey, as majority shareholder, could control the composition of the board, the finances, and the conduct of the company. He also may not have appreciated that Mr Winter was not obliged to act in his interests, since Mr Winter was not his solicitor. 

103I consider the following passage of McLelland CJ in Eq in Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 to be particularly apposite to the plaintiff's evidence in the instant case. His Honour said, at 318-319: 

""Where the conduct is the speaking of words in the course of a conversation, it is necessary that the words spoken be proved with a degree of precision sufficient to enable the court to be reasonably satisfied that they were in fact misleading in the proved circumstances. In many cases (but not all) the question whether spoken words were misleading may depend upon what, if examined at the time, may have been seen to be relatively subtle nuances flowing from the use of one word, phrase or grammatical construction rather than another, or the presence or absence of some qualifying word or phrase, or condition. Furthermore, human memory or what was said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons, and ordinarily the degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time, particularly where disputes or litigation intervene, and the processes of memory are overlaid, often subconsciously, by perceptions or self-interest as well as conscious consideration of what should have been said or could have been said. All too often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which plausible details are then, again often subconsciously, constructed. All this is a matter of ordinary human experience."" 

104It was my impression that the plaintiff's changes in version were affected by self-interest and wishful thinking. He may have subconsciously converted a sense of entitlement to the wealth of Blamathon into assurances from Mr Winter that he was actually entitled to it, in circumstances where what Mr Winter actually said bore no relation to the plaintiff's wishes. 

Mr Winter's retainers 

105The question of whether a retainer arises is to be judged on an objective assessment of the state of affairs between the parties: Hendriks v McGeoch [2008] NSWCA 53 per Giles JA at [11], with whom Spigelman CJ agreed. 

106Once a retainer (to undertake a particular task) ends, there is no continuing duty of care, nor fiduciary duty. The only duty a solicitor owes a former client subsequent to the ending of a retainer is one of confidentiality. There is neither a continuing duty of care nor fiduciary duty: Kallinicos v Hunt [2005] NSWSC 1181; 64 NSWLR 561 at 582-583. 

107I accept Mr Winter's evidence that his retainers as the plaintiff's solicitor were limited to the three assignments referred to above. I do not consider that any of the conversations that were not referable to any of these three retainers were sufficient to give him a broader retainer or to give rise to any conflict which he was obliged to avoid. Mr Winter was entitled to accept instructions from the plaintiff when the plaintiff was a director of Blamathon. This did not make him the plaintiff's solicitor. 

108I do not consider that the plaintiff's allegations that Mr Winter has acted in breach of his duty of care, or his fiduciary duties have been made out. 

109In so doing I reject Mr Mann's evidence on the basis that the assumptions that have underpinned it have not been established: Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65; 108 CLR 642; Paric v John Holland (Constructions) Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 58; 59 ALJR 844. 

The extent of Mr Winter's duties, absent a retainer 

110A duty may arise (absent a retainer) if three conditions are met: 

(a)Mr Winter realised, or ought to have realised, that Mr Cooper would trust in his special competence to give that advice; 

(b)it would be reasonable for Mr Cooper to accept and rely upon that advice; and 

(c)it was reasonably foreseeable that Mr Cooper would suffer loss should the advice be unsound. 

( Mutual Life & Citizens Assurance Co Ltd v Evatt [1968] HCA 74; 122 CLR 556 at 569-572, per Barwick CJ, later confirmed in Tepko Pty Ltd v Water Board [2001] HCA 19; 206 CLR 1 at 16-17, per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ, and Kirby and Callinan J, with whom McHugh J agreed at 46, and summarised (as listed above) in San Sebastian Pty Ltd v The Minister [1986] HCA 68; 62 CLR 340 at 372 per Brennan J.) 

111Given that I accept Mr Winter's versions, there is nothing negligent or misleading about anything he said to the plaintiff. Accordingly although he owed a duty to the plaintiff not to mislead him or give him negligent advice I find that he was not in breach of that duty. 

112In finding that Mr Winter was not in breach of any duty, I am mindful that he, as I have found, misrecorded Ms Lockrey's instructions in the letter of 19 September 2003. As appears from the letter, both Ms Lockrey and the plaintiff signed the document. However, I do not consider anything flows from this. The document proposed a settlement which did not ensue. The notation about the trust was, as I have found, insufficient to amount to a declaration of trust, and when properly construed should, in my view, be read as part of the settlement. Although the plaintiff did not alleged any estoppel against Ms Lockrey (against whom no claim was made) I do not consider that any such allegation could have been proved in any event. 

113Further, the plaintiff appeared to submit that Mr Winter was in breach of the duty of confidentiality that he owed to him as a former client when he disclosed to Ms Lockrey and Blamathon that the Bells Property was for sale and would be suitable for development. There are at least two answers to this submission: first, the plaintiff was not Mr Winter's client when he told him that the Bells Property was for sale; and secondly, far from its being confidential, the information was only of use to the plaintiff if Blamathon was prepared to fund its acquisition since he otherwise had no access to funds. 

Causation of loss 

114The plaintiff bears the onus of proving causation on the balance of probabilities; in other words, that had the ""correct"" advice been given he would have done something such as purchasing the property: Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL [1994] HCA 4; 179 CLR 332 at 355, per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ. 

115Even had Mr Winter given the advice that the plaintiff says he gave, it is difficult to see how this could have caused any loss. Any equitable interest conferred on the plaintiff in 1997 would have been vested in his trustee in bankruptcy. There is no evidence to suggest that the plaintiff would have obtained the benefit of such interest since there is no evidence to show the value of such interest and that it would have produced a surplus on his discharge from bankruptcy. 

116As to the alleged conversations in January and June 2002, even if I had accepted the plaintiff's version, the plaintiff would have had no prospect of acquiring the Bells Property on his own account. Mr Winter's evidence that the plaintiff had no capacity to borrow money was not disputed. Although the plaintiff said that Balmain NB was prepared to lend him money, the terms of the offer from Balmain NB on behalf of Banksia Finance to Blamathon indicated, as one would expect, that the loan was conditional upon real property security and the financial record of the company. The only way the plaintiff could have participated in the Bells Property Development was what actually occurred: he provided some of the labour for Blamathon to develop it with its financial resources. 

117Mr Winter could only have made good the assurances that the plaintiff alleges he made if he had been able to persuade Ms Lockrey to create a fixed (rather than discretionary) trust of her shares in Blamathon in his favour. His prospects of so doing (even had he been minded to do so) were, in my view, non-existent. 

118Even had I accepted that the notation in the letter dated 19 September 2003 had truly represented Ms Lockrey's instructions (as distinct from being a misapprehension or mistake by Mr Winter), I do not consider that this would have been sufficient to create a trust in favour of the plaintiff. There is insufficient certainty about the terms of any trust and whether it is to be an express trust whereby Ms Lockrey held her Blamathon shares on trust for the plaintiff and Ms Cooper equally, or whether it was to be a discretionary trust of which they were specified or general beneficiaries. 

The measure of loss 

119On any view, even had I found for the plaintiff on liability there is no substantial evidence of loss. 

120The plaintiff seeks to overcome the paucity of evidence of loss by submitting that the net assets that are recorded in the financial statements of Blamathon for the year ended 30 June 2004 provide a suitable measure of what the plaintiff has lost by not being the sole beneficiary of a fixed trust of its shares. The plaintiff has made no attempt to distinguish between the liabilities incurred, and assets owned, by Blamathon prior to its acquisition of the Bells Property and those recorded in the financial statements. 

121There is, however, a more fundamental flaw in the plaintiff's claim for damages. Damages (whether in contract or tort) against a negligent solicitor are, absent a contractual warranty, measured on a reliance, not an expectation basis: Kyriakou v Hughes (1984) Aust Torts Reports 80-646; Thomas v Adam [2000] NSWCA 127. Therefore the plaintiff, were I to find Mr Winter liable in respect of the assurances the plaintiff submits he made in June 2002, would be entitled to be put in the position he would have been in but for the representation, not the position he would have been in had the representation been true. If Mr Winter had not made the representation, the plaintiff would, on his case, not have been deterred from purchasing the Bells Property in his own name. But the evidence not only does not establish that the plaintiff could have purchased the Bells Property, but it points to the fact that he would have been unable to raise the finance. 

122There is, in any event, no evidence of any of the following: 

(a) the development in respect of which Mr Cooper claims, would have proceeded; 

(b) that it would have received Council approval; 

(c) what that development would have cost; or 

(d) what that development would have sold for. 

123It follows that the plaintiff's claim must be dismissed. 

124The orders I make are: 

(1)Judgment for the defendants. 

(2)Order the plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs, unless within seven days any application is made for a different costs order.

		08 March 2012",2012-03-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758777,Kazeem OKANDEJI v R [2012] NSWCCA 30,"Judgment 

1McClellan CJ at CL : I agree with Rothman J 

2Johnson J : I agree with Rothman J 

3Rothman J : Kazeem Okandeji, hereinafter the applicant, seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court. The sentencing judge imposed a sentence on the applicant, being a term of imprisonment of 12 years with a non-parole period of eight years. The applicant had been convicted, by a jury, of one count of attempting to obtain possession of a prohibited import, namely cocaine, being not less than a trafficable quantity, contrary to s 233B(1)(c) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and s 11.1(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth). 

4The sentence was imposed on 20 September 2006 and commenced to run from 10 August 2004, from which time the applicant has been imprisoned. The non-parole period therefore expires on 9 August 2012. 

5The sentencing judge also imposed a sentence on the applicant for failing to appear in accordance with his bail undertaking, contrary to s 51(1) of the Bail Act 1978. This sentence has been completed. The applicant did not file a notice of application for leave to appeal (nor a notice of application for an extension of time for leave to appeal) until 29 April 2011. 

Facts 

6On 23 September 2003, the Australian Customs Service intercepted a package, containing a wall painting, which had arrived from Sao Paolo, Brazil and was addressed to a person called Greg Adam. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) seized the consignment. 

7On 30 September 2003, the package was deconstructed and revealed a wall painting, which concealed 774.3 grams of cocaine, that had been secreted in two wooden poles located on opposite ends of the painting. The package was reconstructed and the cocaine was substituted with an inert substance. 

8On 1 October 2003, at 9.45am, an AFP member posing as a DHL Customer Service Representative received a call from a person who identified himself as 'Greg Adam'. In cross-examination, the applicant stated that he had called DHL and when asked if he was 'Greg Adams' [sic], he responded 'Yes' (i.e. it was the applicant who made the telephone call). The applicant quoted the airway bill number and inquired about the delivery of the consignment. He was informed that delivery would take place between 10.00am and 1.00pm on 1 October 2003 at an address in Minto. 

9At 10.52am, on that day, the applicant was standing on the corner of Ohlfsen Road and Guernsey Avenue, approximately 200 metres from the initial delivery address. 

10At 11.46am, the applicant telephoned DHL from a public telephone located at Pembroke Road, Minto to inquire about the whereabouts of the package. The applicant provided a mobile phone number as a point of contact. 

11At 12.04pm, DHL telephoned the mobile phone number provided to confirm delivery of the package. The applicant answered and identified himself as Greg Adam. The applicant asked DHL to deliver the package to another address in Minto - premises recently vacated by his friend, Jude Agboma. 

12Immediately prior to delivery, the applicant had been loitering near the anticipated delivery address. 

13At 12.42pm, the DHL delivery van arrived at the second address in Minto. A Federal Agent, disguised as a DHL delivery driver, delivered the consignment. Jude Agboma approached the delivery van and stated that he was Greg Adam's friend. He initially signed the paperwork as 'Greg Adam', but when questioned, changed this to J. Shaw Agboma. 

14As soon as the delivery van had left, the applicant approached Agboma. Agboma entered the premises at the second address in Minto and the applicant followed shortly afterward. 

15Soon after that, Agboma and the applicant left the premises. The applicant was carrying the wall painting and Agboma was carrying the remnants of the opened package. 

16The applicant and Agboma walked to a nearby park where they were intercepted by police and arrested. The applicant was carrying three mobile phones on him - each of which were subscribed with false name and address details. 

17The consignment's airway bill number was listed under DHL in the phone book section of one of the mobile phones. The previously mentioned mobile phone number related to a mobile telephone that the applicant had in his possession at the time of the arrest. 

18The potential street value of the cocaine seized was estimated at $884,914.29 based on 774.3 grams of cocaine being sold at an average street level purity of 35 percent 


Grounds of Appeal As Notified 

19The applicant, who is self represented, relied upon two grounds of appeal, being: a failure of the sentencing judge to consider that it was the applicant's first offence; and, that the sentencing judge erred in classifying the applicant as the principal in the offence. 

20The first ground of appeal has no basis. The sentencing judge noted and considered all of the relevant subjective factors applicable to the applicant, including that this was a first offence. His Honour said, at page 4 of the Remarks on Sentence: 

""Mr Okandeji has no criminal convictions. He is aged 28."" 

21His Honour expressly took into account the applicant's personal circumstances. Further, the applicant's prior good character and lack of criminal activity, in this case, would have little impact, given both the nature of this offence and the sentence imposed: see R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238 at [72(j)], per Johnson J. 

22As to the second ground of appeal, there is abundant evidence, plainly accepted by the jury, and expressly accepted by the sentencing judge, that Mr Greg Adam was a pseudonym used by the applicant. That evidence includes, as summarised above, the use of that pseudonym by the applicant on a number of occasions and the possession of a mobile telephone in the name of Greg Adam. 

23Obviously, there would have been other parties to this offence at the location from where the parcel was sent. However, with regard to those persons who were connected with the attempted importation in Australia, the applicant was the principal. His Honour, the sentencing judge, found as a matter of fact: 

""This is not a case of Mr Okandeji being able to be regarded as some sort of courier. In regard to the circumstances outlined he could only really be categorised as a principal of obtaining the drug for the purposes of on-selling and making a profit. In that regard I do not accept, nor I am sure did the jury, that a person by the name of Greg Adams was involved in the importation."" 

24The foregoing finding of fact and the assessment of the role of the applicant were plainly open to the sentencing judge and no valid criticism of the findings is available. Even if this Court were deciding the questions of fact afresh, without regard to the findings of fact that were open to the sentencing judge and made by him, I would be inclined to take the same views as his Honour below. 

25The second ground of appeal has no factual basis on the material before this Court. 

Leave 

26Even taking into account that the applicant is representing himself and does not, therefore, have the benefit of legal assistance, the delay in filing the application for leave to appeal and the application for an extension of the time in which to apply for leave is manifest. Leave to appeal was filed four and a half years after the sentence was imposed. 

27Initially, the applicant relied upon the refusal of his Legal Aid application. In a written submission provided to the Court and counsel for the Crown, for the first time, on the morning of the hearing, other grounds were raised. Those grounds included family problems in Africa where both the applicant's mother and brother had passed away as a result of which the applicant did not consider it would be in his ""best interest to go ahead with the appeal at that particular time period, as I [the applicant] was not on [sic] the right frame of mind emotionally and physically."" 

28The further written submission, apart from fleetingly dealing with the extension of time, also sought to raise a number of other grounds of appeal. These other grounds of appeal included: the wrongful admission of evidence as to money transfer from the applicant to persons in Brazil, to which no objection was taken at trial; a restatement that the sentencing judge was in error in treating the applicant as the principal; a failure by the sentencing judge to take into account that the applicant ""was capable of learning and profiting from [his] mistakes, if given the chance"" and the applicant's ""fragile psychological state and financial situation""; the failure to take account of the applicant's youth; and the failure to take account, in sentencing, that an attempt is objectively less serious than the actual commission of the offence. 

29Each of these additional grounds, when investigated, either has no basis in fact or was appropriately taken into account by the sentencing judge and, therefore, cannot form the basis of an arguable ground of appeal. 

30The applicant has served seven and a half years of the sentence imposed upon him and has six months of his non-parole period remaining. I do not underestimate the remaining time in prison. From none of the submissions advanced could one conclude that the sentence is inappropriate or that the sentencing judge was in error and there has been no adequate explanation of the delay in filing an appeal. The grounds are not arguable. 

31I propose that leave to extend time for the filing of the application for leave to appeal be refused.

		09 March 2012",2012-03-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758779,R v Padovan [2012] NSWSC 204,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: On 24 May 2011, David Padovan was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to two charges of affray and one of riot. These are offences against ss 93B and 93C of the Crimes Act 1900. A jury was empanelled and a trial proceeded until the jury retired on 29 September 2011. On 2 November 2011 the jury returned with verdicts of not guilty in respect of each charge. 

2Shortly after his acquittal, Mr Padovan through his counsel, Mr Conwell, foreshadowed he may apply for a certificate under s 2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (the Act). The following day, Mr Conwell confirmed that an application would be made. The matter was not urgent and other matters were more immediately pressing. Ultimately, it was the agreed position of the parties that the matter could proceed by way of written submissions without the need for oral argument. I have received written submissions from Mr Conwell dated 19 January 2012 and written submissions from the Crown Prosecutor dated 20 February 2012. Mr Conwell indicated that he did not wish to make any submissions in reply. 

The legislation 

3Section 2 of the Act, relevantly, is in the following terms: 

2 Certificate may be granted 

(1) The Court or Judge or Magistrate in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may: 

(a) where, after the commencement of a trial in the proceedings, a defendant is acquitted ... 

... 

grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in section 3 and relating to those proceedings. 

4As to what must be established before any such certificate may be granted, s 3 provides: 

3 Form of certificate 

(1) A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Magistrate granting the certificate: 

(a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and 

(b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances. 

(2) (Repealed) 

5The reference to ""relevant facts"" in s 3(1)(a) includes ""the relevant facts established in the proceedings"": s 3A(1)(a). Although they were entitled to (s 3A(1)(b) and (c)), neither the applicant nor the prosecutor sought to establish any further relevant facts on the application. 

6The effect of granting a certificate is to enable the applicant to apply to the Director-General of the Department of Attorney General and Justice for payment of costs incurred in the proceedings. It is then a matter for the Director-General to determine whether the making of a payment to the applicant is justified and, if so, to determine the amount of costs that should be paid (s 4). 

Principles 

7McColl JA (Beazley and Hodgson JJA agreeing) usefully set out the principles relevant to the determination of applications for a s 2 certificate in Mordaunt v Director of Public Prosecutions [2007] NSWCA 121; (2007) 171 A Crim R 510 at [36]. Those that are relevant to the present application are as follows: 

... 

(a) [The Act] is reforming legislation with a beneficial purpose designed to confer valuable privileges upon persons who succeed in criminal prosecutions; its provisions should not be narrowly construed so as to defeat the achievement of its general purposes: Nadilo v Director of Public Prosecutions (1995) 35 NSWLR 738 at 743 per Kirby P; see also Allerton v Director of Public Prosecutions (1991) 24 NSWLR 550 (at 559-560) per Kirby P, Meagher JA, Handley JA; 

... 

(c) The ""institution of proceedings"" in s 3 refers to the time of arrest or charge not to some later stage such as committal for trial or the finding of a bill: Allerton (at 558); 

(d) The applicant for a s 2 certificate bears the onus of showing it was not reasonable to institute the proceedings; it is not for the Crown to establish, nor for the Court to conclude, that the institution of the proceedings, was, or would have been in the relevant circumstances, reasonable: Manley (at [15]) per Wood CJ at CL; R v Johnston [2000] NSWCCA 197 (heard concurrently with Manley ) (at [17], [29]) per Simpson J (Wood CJ at CL agreeing); 

(e) The task of the court dealing with an application under [the Act] is to ask the hypothetical question, whether, if the prosecution had evidence of all the relevant facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings: Allerton (at 559 - 560); the judicial officer considering an application must find what, within the Act, were ""all the relevant facts"" and assume the prosecution to have been ""in possession of evidence of"" all of them and must then determine whether, if the prosecution had been in possession of those facts before the proceedings were instituted, ""it would not have been reasonable to institute [them]; an applicant for a certificate must succeed on both the ""facts issue"" and the ""reasonableness issue"": Treasurer in & for the State of New South Wales v Wade & Dukes (Court of Appeal, 16 June 1994, unreported, BC9402561) per Mahoney JA (with whom Handley and Powell JJA agreed); Ramskogler (at 134 - 135) per Kirby P; 

(f) The hypothetical question is addressed to evidence of all of the relevant facts, whether discovered before arrest or before committal (if any); after committal and before trial; during the trial; or afterwards admitted under s 3A of [the Act]; all of the relevant facts proved, whenever they became known to the prosecution and whether or not in evidence at the trial, must then be considered by the decision-maker: Allerton (at 559 - 560); Manley per Wood CJ at CL (at [9]); the relevant facts include those relevant to the offences charged and the threshold question posed by s 3(1)(a); other facts will also be relevant and admissible going, amongst other things, to the question posed by s 3(1)(b) and to the ultimate question whether, assuming that the court is of the opinion required to be specified, it should exercise its discretion under s 2: Gwozdecky v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 65 A Crim R 160 (at 164 - 165) per Sheller J (with whom Mahoney JA and Hope AJA agreed); 

(g) Courts should not attempt to prescribe an exhaustive test of what constitutes unreasonableness for the institution of the proceedings within the meaning of s 3(1)(a): Fejsa v R (1995) 82 A Crim R 253 at 255; Manley per Wood CJ at CL (at [13] - [14], however the factors set out in (h) - (n) have been identified as germane; 

(h) The reasonableness of a decision to institute proceedings is not based upon the test that prosecution agencies throughout Australia use as the discretionary test for continuing to prosecute, namely whether there is any reasonable prospect of conviction, nor is it governed by the test in s 41(6) of the Justices Act 1902 [prior to its repeal] applied by magistrates, namely whether no reasonable jury would be likely to convict; the test cannot be a test of reasonable suspicion which might justify an arrest and it cannot be the test which determines whether the prosecution is malicious: R v McFarlane (Blanch J, 12 August 1994, unreported); app. Manley per Wood CJ at CL (at [12]), per Sully J (at [42]); Regina v Hatfield [2001] NSWSC 334; (2001) 126 A Crim R 169 per Simpson J; and adopted by Blanch AJ (with whom Spigelman CJ and Simpson J agreed) in Regina v Ahmad [2002] NSWCCA 282; 

(i) The fact a prosecution may be launched where there is evidence to establish a prima facie case does not mean it is reasonable to launch a prosecution; there may be cases where there is contradictory evidence and where it is reasonable to expect a prosecutor to make some evaluation of that evidence: McFarlane ; app. Manley per Wood CJ at CL (at [12]); 

(k) The fact that a court concluded the evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction is not necessarily indicative of unreasonableness: R v Williams; ex parte Williams [1970] 1 NSWR 81 (at 83) per Sugarman P (with whom O'Brien J agreed; cf Manning JA (at 85)); 

(l) The fact that a court enters a judgment of acquittal in favour of an accused does not mean that it was not reasonable to have prosecuted; sometimes that course is followed rather than to order a new trial if (for example) the accused has already served most of the sentence imposed upon him or her: Fejsa (at 255); cited with approval in Hatfield (at [9]) per Simpson J; 

(m) Section 3 calls for an objective analysis of the whole of the relevant evidence, and particularly the extent to which there is any contradiction of expert evidence concerning central facts necessary to establish guilt, or inherent weakness in the prosecution case; matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of the line of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially within the realm of the ultimate fact finder, whether it be Judge or Jury: Manley per Wood CJ at CL (at [14]); Johnston (at [26] [29]) per Simpson J (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Sully J agreed); it is not sufficient to establish the issue of unreasonableness in favour of an applicant for a certificate that, in the end, the question for the jury depended upon word against word; in a majority of such cases, it would be quite reasonable for the prosecution to allow those matters to be decided by the jury; it would be different where the word upon which the Crown case depended had been demonstrated to be one which was very substantially lacking in credit: R v Dunne (Hunt J, 17 May 1990, unreported); 

... 

(o) In considering an application for a certificate it is relevant to have regard both to the information in the possession of the prosecuting authorities, and the conduct of the defendant, bearing in mind the essentially adversarial nature of a criminal prosecution and the tactical decisions that are legitimately a part of the process: Manley per Simpson J (at [76]) (Wood CJ at CL agreeing); 

... 

(r) Before a certificate is granted, the judge must have formed an opinion specifying the matters in s 3(1)(a) and (b), and must also exercise the residual discretion, contemplated by s 2, to grant a certificate: Ramskogler (at 140) per Handley JA; (at 142) per Sheller JA; cf Solomons v District Court of New South Wales (at [50]) per McHugh J. 

8McColl JA continued: 

[37] In Manley (at [43]) Sully J referred with approval to Sugarman P's statement in Williams (at 83) that ""relevant facts"" did not mean ""'all' the relevant facts in any literal or absolute sense"" and that ""omniscience is not to be attributed to the prosecution in the hypothetical inquiry"" and: 

""'All the relevant facts' means, in my opinion, all the relevant facts as they finally emerge at the trial; the facts in the prosecution's case but, as well, the facts in the accused's case as these emerged from cross-examination of the prosecution's witnesses or from evidence called by the accused. That seems to me the nature of the hypothetical inquiry which is called for by s 3(1)(a)."" 

9Counsel for the applicant also referred to the joint judgment of Hunt CJ at CL, Smart and Badgery-Parker JJ in R v Pavy (1997) 98 A Crim R 396 in which it was stated (at 401): 

The legitimate interest which the community has in serious crimes being prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions is not disputed. That cannot, in our judgment, make it reasonable as between the Crown and the accused/applicant to prosecute in face of significant weaknesses in the Crown case of which the Crown acting reasonably, ought to have been aware. 

10Reference was also made to the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Manley [2000] NSWCCA 196; (2000) 49 NSWLR 203 at 206: 

[17] It was submitted by the Crown that, in determining whether it was or was not reasonable for the DPP to institute the proceedings, it was proper to take into account matters of public policy such as the necessity to ensure that justice is seen to be done in serious cases of criminality, and the necessity to secure public confidence in the justice system and in the Courts, and also to have regard to the prevalence of the offence being prosecuted and the degree of public concern in relation to it. In my view such considerations are irrelevant to the evaluation, by the hypothetical prosecutor of the evidence, the knowledge of which is imputed to the prosecution. 

[18] The independence of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the presence in office of a Director responsible for the institution of criminal proceedings in the interests of the State, must be preserved. Neither is threatened by a construction of the provision which directs attention to the evidence of the relevant facts in an individual case. It would be unacceptable to impose some qualification upon the section designed to encourage prosecutions in order to satisfy some ill defined community interest in bringing a particular accused, or kind of matter, before the Courts. Indeed, to do so may only serve to threaten the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions. 

Overview of the case 

11The trial was concerned with violent conflict between the Comanchero and Hells Angels outlaw motorcycle gangs at the Qantas domestic terminal at Sydney airport on 22 March 2009. Five Comanchero members, including their president, Mahmoud Hawi, and the president of the Hells Angels, Derek Wainohu, arrived on a flight from Melbourne. Before leaving Melbourne, Hawi directed that Comanchero members in Sydney be contacted and summoned to attend the airport. Wainohu did likewise by contacting Hells Angels members. 

12Seven Comanchero and seven Hells Angels members came to the airport. They included the applicant who was a Hells Angels member. Five of the seven Comancheros and two of the Hells Angels, the applicant and Tom Baker, went through security screening to Gate 5 where passengers from the flight disembarked. The remainder waited outside in the departure hall; the two Comancheros near the main exit from the secure area and the five Hells Angels towards the opposite end of the terminal, about 70 metres away from the main exit. 

13There was a confrontation between Hawi and Wainohu immediately after they had disembarked from the flight. Wainohu was punched to the ground. Comanchero members then chased and assaulted the applicant. He was brought to the ground where he was further punched and kicked. The Comancheros then regrouped and proceeded to walk out. The applicant returned to Wainohu and Baker in the vicinity of the gate. 

14When the group of ten Comancheros emerged into the departure hall they were joined by the other two Comanchero members. The twelve then walked quickly behind the check-in counters towards the other side of the terminal where the five Hells Angels members had been waiting. A violent fight broke out when the two groups came together. One of the Hells Angels (he was not actually a member but was the brother of a member) was pursued through the check-in counters to the front of the terminal building where he went to the ground and was stabbed and bludgeoned to death. I have indicated in various sentence proceedings that I am satisfied that the Comancheros were the aggressors who initiated the violence: see, for example, R v Eken; R v Potrus [2012] NSWSC 2 at [42]. 

15Nine out of the ten Comancheros who were at Gate 5 have either pleaded guilty or been found guilty of affray in respect of the first incident. Eleven out of the twelve Comancheros who were in the departure hall have either pleaded guilty or been found guilty of murder, manslaughter or riot. The twelfth Comanchero was acquitted of murder and the jury were unable to reach a unanimous or majority verdict on manslaughter. He is to be retried later this year. 

16In contrast, the applicant was the only one of the three Hells Angels present at Gate 5 who was charged (but acquitted). Three of the eight Hells Angels who were in the departure hall were charged. Two pleaded guilty to affray and have been sentenced in the Local Court. The third was the applicant (again, acquitted). 

17The approach I will take in examining the evidence will be to first look at that which the Crown relied upon in its closing address to the jury as supporting its case against the applicant in respect of each of the charges (T4157 - 4162). That seems to be an appropriate way to identify the case the Crown sought to make. It will then be possible to examine the cogency of that case in the light of all of the evidence in the trial. 

18There was an issue raised prior to the trial about witnesses being concerned, and some being in fear, about the prospect of giving evidence: see R v Hawi & ors (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 1648 and R v Hawi & ors (No 9) [2011] NSWSC 1655. Being mindful of this, and noting that there is nothing significant in the names of any witnesses for the purposes of this judgment, I propose to refer to witnesses by their initials. 

Purpose of attending the airport 

19The Crown relied upon an agreed fact in the trial (Exhibit GO) that there was on-going hostility between the Comancheros and the Hells Angels and that the accused (including the applicant) were aware of it. This provided a context in which to better understand the events that occurred at the airport on 22 March 2009. It said nothing directly about the question of whether any particular person participated in those events. Moreover, if there was evidence that a particular person did participate in some fashion, the antecedent hostility of which that person was aware had little relevance to the question whether the person attacked his rivals or was attacked by them. 

20A schedule of telephone calls and text messages was in evidence (Exhibit GF). It disclosed that Derek Wainohu had communicated from Melbourne with Tom Baker. Baker arrived at the airport with the applicant. Therefore, the Crown argued, it could be inferred that Baker had contacted the applicant after he had been contacted by Wainohu. That might explain how it came about that the applicant attended the airport. It did not shed much light on why he attended. It may be readily inferred that he was made aware that there was a need for Hells Angels members to meet their president because he was alone on a flight in the presence of a number of the Comancheros. There was, however, no evidence from which it could be discerned whether the purpose of attending was to engage in violence against their rivals, or to simply defend their president if attacked. 

The affray at Gate 5 

21It was the Crown case that the affray was started by the Comancheros, not by the Hells Angels. However, the Crown contended that the applicant was willing to fight with the Comancheros after Messrs Wainohu and Baker had been assaulted and were on the ground. 

22There were many witnesses called to give evidence about the events at Gate 5. The Crown Prosecutor referred to the evidence of some of them in support of the contention to which I have just referred. 

23Reference was made (T4158.2) to the evidence of MMcK who, the Crown Prosecutor submitted, said that Mr Padovan was being provocative and aggressive in his actions and his speech. She also described some taunting on his part. 

24The evidence of MMcK was this (T443 - 450). She was standing near a donut stand in the middle of the concourse near to Gate 5. She heard something and looked around. There were three men fighting who were almost upon her. She moved away to near the Watermark bookstore from where she continued to watch. She saw two men attacking another man. She was concerned for the man being attacked. Her description clearly indicated that this was a reference to Mr Padovan. She said that his shirt was in tatters and later it was completely off. She said: 

The fight was fairly powerful I will guess is the way to describe it. The young man who was receiving the blows and the kicks, they were very - I wouldn't like to receive one, I think they would probably take me out. They were fairly ferocious, powerful blows. 

Q. When you say ""blows""? 
A. Blows and kicks. 

Q. How many blows did you see? 
A. There were more blows than kicks, punches than kicks. I would say I saw probably five to eight punches and maybe three to four kicks. 

Q. What happened then? 
A. After - somehow the young man who was being beaten leapt to his feet which surprised, you know, given the power of the blows he had received. 

Q. Let me stop you there. When you say he leapt to his feet, what position was he in when you saw him do that? 
A. He was on the ground with his body in an arc curled towards me with the others punching him. 

Q. And he got to his feet? 
A. He sprang to his feet with obviously great fitness and he was then quite provocative and aggressive in his actions and his speech. 

Q. Can you describe for the Court what you saw and what you heard? 
A. I don't - I only remember one word which was repeated quite a lot and that was ""fuck"". I couldn't really say what else he said. His gestures were pretty much this (indicating), you know, very provocative. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: For the record the witness has put both her hands in a fist and raised them out to her side and her fists were parallel with her head. (T444-445). 

25After the fight concluded, Mr Padovan walked off with two men (Wainohu and Baker) and the two men ""who were doing the attacking"" walked off with a larger number of other men in the opposite direction. 

26In cross-examination by senior counsel for Hawi, MMcK agreed that when ""the man who was being attacked"" sprang to his feet, he became ""quite provocative in his mannerisms"" and that he was ""taunting his attackers"" (T448). She agreed in cross-examination by Mr Conwell that she had said in her police statement that after the fight, the man without the shirt was yelling at the two men who were about 5 metres away from him; he was ""taunting the men who had been attacking him"" (T450). 

27The next witness to whom the Crown Prosecutor referred was ID. She described his evidence as being that Mr Padovan approached two men, one being Wainohu, ""and that Mr Padovan had an open stance and it was aggressive and he had clenched fists"" (T4158.10). 

28ID's evidence (T553 - 558) was that he saw two men fighting near the donut stand. One was ""slumped"" on the ground (the Crown contending, correctly in my view, that this was Wainohu) and the other man was above him and was ""hitting [him] strongly with both hands"". A third man came in and swung a punch at the man on the ground which was ""very forceful"". A fourth man who was without a shirt (Mr Padovan) approached the vicinity of the two men ""with an open stance and perhaps aggressively"". ID thought (Mr Padovan) had clenched fists. ID demonstrated by indicating both arms slightly away from his sides, with clenched fists. He was not sure if the man on the ground was still being punched at that time. ID then retreated and did not see any more. 

29JD was ID's wife. The Crown Prosecutor referred to her evidence that she saw two men punching each other and that the shirt of the shorter of the two was coming off. It was submitted that this must have been a reference to Mr Padovan. 

30JD's evidence (T423 - 427) was that she left her husband sitting near Gate 5 while she had a look in some of the nearby shops. When she was in the Guess shop she heard a commotion and she came outside to look. She saw three men. Two of the men were fighting and one was standing nearby watching. She said the two men were punching each other. The shorter of the two removed his shirt (i.e. Mr Padovan). The taller man then walked off in one direction and (Mr Padovan) and the man who had been watching walked off together in the opposite direction towards Gate 5. Mr Conwell had her confirm that she had said in her statement that she ""saw a small male struggling with a bigger male"" and that ""the bigger male had hold of the smaller male's shirt and the smaller male shrugged out of his shirt and was bare-chested"". 

31Next, the Crown Prosecutor referred to the evidence of JS (T4158.21). She said that JS saw Hawi hitting Wainohu and then saw six or seven men pushing each other and hitting. If Wainohu and Baker were on the ground and did not fight back (as other evidence established), that meant that Mr Padovan was one of the six or seven men hitting or pushing (because the Comancheros would not be fighting amongst themselves). 

32JS was a Qantas employee who was at Gate 5. He saw men who had disembarked from the flight in the middle of the concourse near the donut stand having an animated conversation and then one man (Hawi) pushed and punched another man (Wainohu) to the ground. Then a fight broke out between two groups of men. He said ""the whole group of them began fighting"". They were ""just fighting""; ""just punching"". He was then distracted by making phone calls to summon security and the police. When he turned back, the fight had broken up and he saw ""some of them got up and started running towards the gate 6 area and the other group were chasing them"". There were ""about six - half a dozen to seven"" men that he saw ""pushing and shoving or hitting each other"". 

33RO was said by the Crown Prosecutor (T4158.35) to have heard running and hostile and angry voices and then saw a man fitting Mr Padovan's description shaking his fist at someone and shouting. 

34RO gave evidence (T670 - 674) that he was walking towards Gate 5 when he heard ""groups of men shouting at each other and there was some sort of pursuit going on"". He did not actually see this because of the large number of people on the concourse who were obscuring his view. He ""assumed they were men and they seemed to be cursing"". The tone of voice was ""very angry, hostile"". His evidence that the Crown relied upon concerning Mr Padovan was: 

[A]t one stage I was able to see through the crowd - you asked how many people were in the corridor, there were dozens and that meant I couldn't actually see the particular people, but at one stage there was a break and I saw through the break a - one man shaking his fist at someone, but that's the only person I actually saw who was I believe involved in that. (T671.47). 

35This was said to be Mr Padovan because RO described this man as having no shirt. In cross-examination he agreed that this man appeared to be by himself. He could not tell whether he was being pursued or was pursuing. He had told the police that the man appeared to be ""very angry"" and ""was shouting"". Although he could not make out what he was saying, he thought he was swearing. The entire incident, as far as RO was concerned, lasted about ten seconds and ""seeing the man would have been only a second or two"". 

36Finally, the Crown Prosecutor referred to the evidence of LY (T4158.38). She described his evidence as including that he saw ten men, four of whom were fighting. They were punching, kicking and swearing in Arabic. It was submitted that this must involve Mr Padovan because there was no evidence of Messrs Wainohu and Baker being engaged in the fighting. 

37LY's evidence (T633 - 647) actually was that he heard yelling and screaming and he turned around and ""was witnessed to a brawl"" (sic). He thought that it was around ten men, four of whom were actually involved in fighting. There was punching, kicking and swearing back and forth. One of the persons fighting managed to break free. He had his jumper taken off him and he got away from the fight. The fight then stopped. This man (obviously Mr Padovan) walked back in the direction of Gate 5 and the others walked towards the exit. As they each walked in their respective directions there was swearing back and forth. This included someone in the group (Hawi) yelling at the other man, ""You're a fucking dog, you're dead"" and ""Fuck you, we're gonna get you, you're a fucking dog"". In cross-examination by Mr Conwell, LY agreed that ""there were about five or six guys on the one guy and they were throwing kicks and punches"". He agreed that ""two guys tried to hold him but he broke free by the jumper being taken off him"". 

38After referring to the evidence of these witnesses, the Crown Prosecutor submitted to the jury that it established that Mr Padovan both used and threatened to use unlawful violence. She reminded the jury, however, that the Crown was only required to prove that he threatened unlawful violence to establish the charge of affray. She then turned to what she described as ""the real issue in relation to Mr Padovan's guilt of the gate 5 affray""; whether the Crown could prove that he was not acting in self-defence. 

39The argument presented on behalf of the Crown as to why it had established that Mr Padovan was not acting in self-defence was that: 

Mr Padovan did have a choice as to whether to run around and be involved in that fighting. Mr Wainohu and Mr Baker didn't get involved, but Mr Padovan did, and we say that was a choice on his part (T415925). 

40That represented the entirety of the Crown Prosecutor's argument as to how self-defence had been disproved. 

Consideration 

41Although it is not exactly the approach indicated in the authorities, taking the Crown case at its highest is sufficient in this case to establish that it was unreasonable for the Crown to have instituted proceedings against Mr Padovan in respect of the Gate 5 affray. 

42I refused an application for a directed verdict in relation to the charge of affray (as well as in relation to the charges concerned with the departure hall incident). At that point I was required to take the evidence in the Crown case at its highest. That involved allowing for the possibility that the jury might accept certain portions of what a witness said and not other portions. I was also required to allow for the possibility that the jury might interpret the evidence in the manner for which the Crown contended and might draw inferences as it saw fit. 

43One of the principles relevant to the determination of that application was that I should take into account evidence the Crown relied upon even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague: see the summary of principles conveniently collected by Whealy J (as his Honour then was) in R v Keli Lane [No 18] [2010] NSWSC 1545 at [3]. I am freed from those strictures when dealing with the present application and can make my own factual findings in the course of determining ""all the relevant facts"". Much of the evidence relied upon by the Crown in support of its case on affray is susceptible to the description of being ""tenuous or inherently weak or vague"". 

44The evidence as to prior hostility and the manner in which Mr Padovan was summoned to attend the airport is entirely neutral on the issue whether he was an aggressor or was acting in self-defence. 

45The evidence of MMcK was to the effect that Mr Padovan was on the receiving end of a powerful beating and when it was over he was angry with his attackers. ID's evidence was that Mr Wainohu was being seriously assaulted and was in a vulnerable position on the ground when Mr Padovan came to his defence. (If the Crown Prosecutor was correct in contending that this was at the beginning of the affray, it probably explains the Comancheros then turning their aggression on to Mr Padovan). The evidence of JD and JS does not permit any conclusion as to whether Mr Padovan was willingly fighting as opposed to being attacked and responding in self-defence. However, the manner in which Mr Padovan was outnumbered, the latter, if anything, is the more likely. The evidence of RO was completely neutral or, if not, favoured the notion that Mr Padovan was a victim, rather than an aggressor. LY's evidence, when viewed in its entirety is consistent with Mr Padovan being a victim who was set upon by at least three of the Comancheros. When he managed to break free when his shirt was torn off he immediately retreated to Gate 5. 

46The Crown Prosecutor's submission that, in contrast to Messrs Wainohu and Baker, Mr Padovan exercised a choice to involve himself in the fighting was, with respect, fanciful. It is unsurprising that the submission was not further developed because it could not be. The evidence simply did not support it. Wainohu and Baker were struck to the ground. Thereafter, the Comancheros turned on Mr Padovan, pursued him, brought him to the ground and punched and kicked him. Little wonder that when the Comancheros desisted and withdrew he seems to have got up and waved his fists and yelled out at them. 

47Mr Conwell set out in written submissions in support of the application for directed verdicts, and adopted in his written submissions on the present application, the evidence of a significantly larger number of witnesses than relied upon by the Crown at trial. Given I have reached a conclusion in the applicant's favour looking at only the evidence of witnesses the Crown relied upon, it is unnecessary to refer in any detail to the evidence of the others. Suffice to say, that body of evidence made a powerful case for Mr Padovan having been a victim of an attack upon him by the Comancheros. The written submissions for the Crown on the application accepted that the evidence of these witnesses provided a basis to conclude that ""the applicant's actions were those of the losing party in the fight, and demonstrated only frustration and/or self-defence but not intentional violence or threats of violence"". 

48In the light of my findings as to what the evidence relied upon by the Crown actually established, or failed to establish, I am satisfied that it was not reasonable for the Crown to have instituted the proceedings against David Padovan on the charge of affray concerning the incident at Gate 5. 

Riot, alternatively affray, in the departure hall 

49The Crown Prosecutor addressed the case against Mr Padovan on the charges of riot, alternatively affray, in the departure hall by arguing that they were made out by the following: 


Mr Padovan ran into the departure hall to join the fight soon after it had started. 

His blood was found in front of the check-in counters in an area where the fighting had been. 

The estimated number of men involved in the fighting was such that he must have been involved. 

A witness said that he saw a man whose description fitted Mr Padovan involved in the fighting. 

Mr Padovan subsequently fled the terminal out of consciousness of guilt. 

50The security camera footage showed that the Hells Angels (Messrs Wainohu, Baker and Padovan) walked down the corridor leading to the exit into the departure hall about a minute after the Comancheros had done so. 

51After the Comancheros entered the departure hall they walked behind the check-in counters towards where the five Hells Angels were waiting. Security camera footage showing them walking in that direction also indicated that it was only 31 or 32 seconds later that Mr Padovan could be seen running in the same direction. In other words, when Mr Padovan had emerged into the departure hall, he became aware that the riot was in progress and he ran to join it. It was submitted that he ran in that direction because the riot was still behind the check-in counters at that point and the reason he did so was because he was ""really annoyed about what had happened to him at Gate 5 and angry about that and so he ran over to join in another fight with the Comancheros"". 

52The Crown relied upon Mr Padovan's blood having been found in front of the check-in counters (counters numbered 12 and 13), and so he must have been in that location. 

53Next, there was the evidence of the witness, MC. The Crown Prosecutor dealt with MC's evidence in some detail. I will summarise it shortly. It was anticipated that Mr Conwell would submit that MC had got a number of things wrong. However, it was submitted that the jury should accept the evidence of MC because in a number of respects it was consistent with other evidence, including in particular, the security camera footage. 

54The Crown referred to evidence of some of the eyewitnesses who estimated that there were large numbers involved in the riot. One witness, RB put it as high as 12 to 16. This was said to support a proposition that Mr Padovan must have joined in the fighting because there simply were not enough Hells Angels to make up such numbers. 

55Finally, the Crown relied upon flight. Mr Padovan left the airport a few minutes after the riot had concluded in the company of Messrs Wainohu and Baker. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that this was not the conduct of someone who had been a victim of something at Gate 5 and did not do anything in the riot. Mr Peter Zervas, a fellow Hells Angels member, was very agitated at the time because his brother was lying on the terminal floor with very grave injuries. The Crown Prosecutor submitted, ""Mr Padovan did nothing to assist or wait around or console Peter Zervas, he just left"". So, the jury was invited to infer that Mr Padovan fled the airport ""because he was conscious of his guilt of what he'd done in the riot and the affray"". 

Evidence of MC 

56The Crown case in relation to Mr Padovan being involved in the fighting in the departure hall substantially depended upon the evidence of MC. For that reason it is worth spending some time on the detail of what he said (T3105 - 3114). Some comments will be interpolated. 

57MC was a passenger on the flight from Melbourne with Mr Wainohu and the Comancheros. As he was disembarking he noticed a man (accepted to be Mr Wainohu). MC went to the bathroom near Gate 5 immediately after entering the terminal. He said he was there for 3 to 5 minutes. When he emerged he noticed (Mr Wainohu) with two other men, one of them being without a shirt (Baker and Padovan). He walked behind them down the corridor leading to the exit into the departure hall. He said ""they appeared to be agitated"". He recalled hearing a discussion which included someone saying ""Is he here? Where is he"". (It was not established who said these things or who was being referred to). 

58MC then walked towards the front of the terminal because he was being collected by a friend who was going to take him to the international terminal on the opposite side of the airport. He was connecting to an international flight. As he came into the departure hall, he saw two of the men in front of him run in a direction behind the check-in counters (Baker and Padovan) ""and the other one [Wainohu] running towards the opposite direction"". 

59He said that he saw ""some type of affray that occurred which resulted in an individual lying on the ground"" (obviously the deceased). The fight was towards the main entrance, in front of the check-in counters. He saw punching, kicking, and he distinctly remembered seeing the use of a steel bollard in the incident. (He gave what may be regarded as a very accurate description of the bludgeoning of the deceased with a bollard). 

60MC said that he normally wore glasses, ""for long distance"". He was not wearing them at the time. He was asked about the clarity of his vision: 

Q. How clearly were you able to see that incident you've described? 
A. I'm certain it happened, I did witness it, an example of the clarity would be that I was legally able to drive without the spectacles, without the glasses, I just don't have the sharpness or absolute clarity, especially reading road signs and so forth, but I can quite honestly tell you I did witness that incident. (T3108.1) 

61MC was then asked about the man he had described as having no shirt (Mr Padovan) and whether he saw him at all in the area of the fighting that he had described. He said, ""he was part of the fight as well"". He saw him kicking and punching. ""He was part of the group also that was in the fight"". 

62As to what he saw next, he said that he saw ""them"" run out of the terminal. He saw two get into a taxi and some others running towards the public carpark. None of the Hells Angels did this; only the Commancheros). 

63MC continued on his path to the front doors of the terminal and he gave evidence of his observations of the deceased on the floor which are presently irrelevant. He continued on and was met by his friend who took him to the international terminal. 

64MC did not make his police statement until December 2009. 

65In cross-examination by Mr Conwell, MC said that in his statement he described the colour of the shorts of the man without the shirt (Mr Padovan) as being ""light coloured"". (Mr Padovan was wearing black shorts). 

66When he entered into the departure hall, he first saw the fight when he was within 10 metres of the door into the departure hall (according to the scale plans, a distance of about 65 metres). 

67He agreed that there were ""quite a few people in between [him] and the fight"". He agreed with a proposition that there were about 15 or 20 people. He also agreed that there were a number of the self-service check-in machines as well. 

68MC maintained that the ""man from the aeroplane"" (Wainohu) was involved in the fight (Clearly, and on the Crown case, he was not). 

69He readily agreed that not wearing his glasses would have affected the clarity of what he observed. He also agreed that he was unable to say who had the bollard in his hands because he did not have his glasses on. He maintained, however, that the man without the shirt (Mr Padovan) with light coloured shorts (not Mr Padovan) was in close proximity to (where the deceased was on the ground). This was at the time when the deceased was being struck with the bollard. 

70MC was unable to recall whether the man without the shirt had a hat on (Mr Padovan did). He then accepted, however, that he had said at the committal hearing that the man without the shirt did not have a hat. 

71It was suggested to MC that the man without the shirt was, in fact, wearing light coloured tracksuit pants (this was a suggestion that it was Peter Zervas he had seen, not Mr Padovan). He maintained that he recalled the man having shorts on. 

72MC was unable to say whether the man without the shirt was an aggressor or was defending himself. 

73MC said that the last time he saw the man without the shirt was when he was exiting the terminal and heading, with others, towards a taxi or the carpark. (Clearly Mr Padovan did not). 

74MC was then asked, and gave this answer: 

Q. Bearing in mind that you didn't have your glasses on at the time, bearing in mind the distance of your observations, if there was another man involved in the fight who appeared not to have a shirt, you could be mistaken, couldn't you? 
A. I could. (T3112.35) 

75MC was asked about the angle from which he observed the ""man without the shirt"". He said that he could not give a definitive answer about that but added that his observation was from a distance of ""maybe 30 metres"". 

76It was MC's recollection that the man he saw on the plane (Wainohu) was involved in the fight as well (clearly, he was not). He said that this man was ""also kicking and punching"". 

Consideration 

77Mr Conwell submitted that one matter to be taken into account was the ""exculpatory evidence"" of SP and the offenders Hawi and Menzies. The Crown submitted that it was not appropriate to take into account the evidence given in the trial by two accused persons. I do not think the point needs to be determined because the evidence was not exculpatory, it was neutral. Each of these men simply said that they did not see Mr Padovan in the departure hall. With all that was going on at the time, that is not surprising. It does not mean that he was not there. 

78The evidence of Mr Padovan's blood being found in front of check-in counters 12 and 13 is something of a mystery. There was no direct evidence as to how it got to be there. Mr Padovan did not, of course, give evidence. The Crown submitted that it was consistent with him fighting in that location. Mr Conwell submitted that Mr Padovan had to have, at some stage, gone in between the counters, from behind to the front, because he was not otherwise seen on security camera footage going around them. 

79Mr Conwell submitted that there was an alternative explanation for Mr Padovan bleeding. He could have been bleeding as a result of what occurred to him at Gate 5. There was no crime scene examination at that location so there is nothing to say whether he did, or did not, bleed there. Against that, it must be expected that if Mr Padovan was bleeding all the way from Gate 5 to the departure hall and in front of the check-in counters, there would be more than a single blood spot in a single location. But, regardless of that attempt to explain it, the point really is that if the blood came to be there because Mr Padovan was involved in the fighting at that location, there is nothing about it that would enable a choice to be made as to whether he was fighting as an aggressor or he was being attacked again, like he had been moments earlier. 

80Mr Conwell sought to provide an explanation for Mr Padovan running as he emerged into the departure hall. He submitted that at about the same time, there was a Comanchero member (AL) shaping up to a Hells Angels member (Peter Martin) behind the check-in counters. The timing on the security camera footage was said to support the coincidence of these two events. So, it was submitted, Mr Padovan was acting in self-defence (defence of another). This was an argument designed to meet the Crown's contention that Mr Padovan was running to join in the riot. 

81I am unable to find that this evidence supports one party's case to the detriment of the other party's case. It might be one, or the other. Like the blood, the only way of making anything of it is if there was other evidence of Mr Padovan being involved in the fighting. 

82In my view there was no merit in the point that the number of men involved in the fighting supported the proposition that Mr Padovan must have been involved. The witnesses were only able to make very broad estimates as to the number involved. There were 17 Comancheros and Hells Angels in the departure hall before Messrs Wainohu, Baker and Padovan came on the scene. There could well have been 12 to 16 men involved in the fighting without involvement of any of those three men. 

83Then there was the Crown contention that Mr Padovan fled the airport out of consciousness of guilt. Messrs Wainohu, Baker and Padovan did not leave immediately. They left, as the Crown Prosecutor conceded, a few minutes after the riot concluded. In the intervening period they were seen to be walking around the terminal. Mr Wainohu approached Peter Zervas who was in the vicinity of his brother and obviously distraught. A short time later the three Hells Angels walked out. In contrast, the Comancheros ran out of the building; some commandeered taxis and others ran a circuitous route around and then through the carpark, and then back out to the roadway in front of the lower level where their cars had been parked. More significantly, however, it was the Crown case that Messrs Wainohu and Baker were not guilty of the anything. Mr Padovan did exactly as they did. In my view, this evidence was entirely equivocal and could not advance the Crown case at all. 

84The evidence of MC was really the lynchpin of the Crown case that Mr Padovan was guilty of either riot or affray. The least the Crown needed to prove in relation to the alternative was that Mr Padovan threatened unlawful violence. There was no evidence that he merely did that. Necessarily, the Crown put the case on the basis that Mr Padovan was actually involved in the fighting. MC's evidence, in my view, was an utterly unreliable basis to establish that proposition. 

85The Crown accepted that MC was wrong in saying that Mr Wainohu ran into the departure hall and wrong in saying that he was involved in the fighting. He was wrong in saying that after the fight the man without the shirt ran out of the terminal towards a taxi or the carpark. He was wrong in saying that the man without the shirt wore light coloured shorts and no hat. 

86One thing MC was correct about was the concession he gave that if there was another man involved in the fight who "" appeared not to have a shirt"" , he could be mistaken. Peter Zervas fitted that description. He was involved in the fight and he pleaded guilty to affray. He was wearing light coloured pants (albeit tracksuit pants and not shorts), no hat and a singlet top which was badly torn. Depending on the angle, he could well have appeared to have no shirt on, particularly when seen from a distance (""maybe 30 metres"") with people and other obstacles intervening. MC was not the only witness who referred to the person who was obviously Peter Zervas as having no shirt (RK at T143.46; KT at T1344.45; AC at T766.44). 

87Even if MC was correct in identifying Mr Padovan as being involved in the fight, his evidence was incapable of establishing that he was willingly fighting as opposed to defending himself or others. He said that he saw this man ""kicking and punching"" but when asked whether he could say anything further about what he was doing he could only say, ""Just that he was part of the group also that was in the fight"" . 

Conclusion 

88The evidence to support the Crown's contention that Mr Padovan was involved in the fighting in the departure hall was inherently tenuous and weak. It was as unreasonable for the Crown to have instituted proceedings against him in respect of the charges of riot and affray in the departure hall as it was to have instituted proceedings against him for the affray at Gate 5. 

89There was no unreasonable act or omission by Mr Padovan that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings against him. 

Order 

90Mr Padovan is granted a certificate pursuant to s 2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act .

2758786,R v CHAN [2012] NSWDC 57,"Judgment


1HIS HONOUR: Wai Hung Chan appears for sentence after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, that offence relating to significant quantities, 3.6 kilograms of cannabis, that was found in his home when police executed a search warrant there. He also asked me to take into account when I sentence him for that matter another offence of being knowingly involved in the cultivation of thirty-two cannabis plants. I make it clear that the thirty-two cannabis plants are separate from the 3.6 kilograms of cannabis leaf, the subject of the primary offence. 

2These offences came to light when police executed a search warrant at the offender's home. They there found a hydroponic cannabis cultivation set up. I gather that nothing was actually growing at the time, the thirty-two cannabis plants had been recently harvested and the cannabis leaf was in two separate quantities, being found in one of the rooms that was being used for the hydroponic cultivation of cannabis. 

3The accused was arrested. He declined to say anything, but a subsequent fingerprint analysis revealed the accused's fingerprints on items of interest. A title search also revealed that the accused owned the home.

4The offender was born in China. He is now fiftythree years of age. He grew up in Guangzhou. He was separated from his family when he was sent to work on a farm and was subject to deprivations and restrictions of his liberty which he quite naturally resisted. He therefore escaped to Hong Kong after many unsuccessful attempts. There he worked as a labourer and studied English. After completing his English studies he began studying electrical engineering at college. He has worked in that area since. 

5He married a woman whilst in Hong Kong. They had two children, one aged twenty-seven and one aged twenty-one. The older child has a mental disorder whereby he cannot communicate. His relationship with his wife broke down for reasons which are set out in a psychological report of psychologist David Green. He then eventually moved to Australia after spending some time in quite sad circumstances. He has married again. This time to a Vietnamese refugee. They have three children - one is in Year 12, one is in Year 8 and one who is in Year 4. He has a good relationship with his children, but once again his relationship with his wife has broken down. They separated in 2004. I gather that the offender wants to resume living with his wife but she is avoiding the question. 

6He continued to work as an electrician in Australia and it was a dispute with a former employer after some thirteen years of employment there which led to the offender's mental state deteriorating and which, I gather, he blames, at least a little bit, for his present offending. The rights and wrongs of the dispute do not need to be determined but from the offender's point of view, he was asked to do something he should not have been asked to do, and when he refused he was subject to bullying to the extent that he ultimately resigned. That left him with what the psychologist said was a mood disorder. He was depressed and anxious.

7In these circumstances his cannabis use escalated. He had begun smoking cannabis in early 2009, buying the cannabis from a man known as Black Kung. Once his cannabis use escalated and once he began spending a large amount of money on the drug, he accepted a proposal from Black Kung that his house could be used for the hydroponic cultivation of cannabis. The deal was that the offender would then get his cannabis for free. It is said that the equipment to cultivate the cannabis and cannabis plants was installed by Black Kung in August 2010, but a very short time later the offender became worried about the cannabis in his house and asked Black Kung to remove it. Some of the cannabis plants and some of the equipment was removed but a quantity of cannabis leaf was left behind as well as some other hydroponic equipment. The offender said that he stopped using cannabis around this time because he was concerned about the effects on his health.

8The offender's conduct was of course seriously wrong. Cannabis, especially that cultivated hydroponically, is not accurately described as a soft drug by any means. Indeed the Parliament has responded to concerns about the effects of high grade cannabis produced through hydroponic means by creating specific offences. I, of course, immediately note that none of those offences have been laid against this offender, but I refer to that circumstance in order to deal with any suggestion, could it have been made, that this was minor criminality involving a drug which did not cause much harm to the community. The converse is certainly the case.

9The offender is, as I have mentioned, fiftythree years of age. He has no prior convictions. That is a substantial bank of good character on which he is able to rely. As well as the absence of convictions providing evidence of his good character, there is evidence regarding his good character in a more positive sense as well. He appears to have been industrious, working for the same company for thirteen years and working for a different company now, having obtained employment on 20 December 2010. He is therefore an industrious and, apart from this offending, a productive member of society. 

10I should say I note and I have not mentioned thus far that the offender pleaded guilty. That affects not only the length of the sentence but also the form it will take. He is entitled to the maximum discount suggested in Thomson and Houlton v R (2009) 49 NSWLR 383. I note also that the offender spent two days in custody until he was granted bail. I have taken that matter into account in formulating the appropriate sentence as well.

11It has to be said that he was not entirely frank with the author of the presentence report claiming, as he did, that the drug was cultivated for his own use. That is immediately obviously not true. The quantities involved preclude that suggestion as being regarded as anything other than fanciful, and in any case the offender is to be sentenced for supply not possession.

12This is a case where the offender needs to be punished, but as well, the efforts that he has himself made to rehabilitate himself should be encouraged. As it turns out both Mr Jones, who appears for the offender, and the Crown agree on the appropriate outcome in those circumstances. Fortunately for them and the offender, I too agree. 

13I am satisfied that a custodial sentence is required because of the seriousness of this offending. 

14So having satisfied myself that a custodial sentence is required, I am also satisfied that it is likely that it would be less than two years. Indeed I have in mind at this stage a sentence of eighteen months imprisonment. I consider it appropriate to refer the offender for assessment as to his suitability to serve the sentence by means of an Intensive Corrections Order. I therefore grant the offender bail until 11 May at 2 o'clock.

15ADJOURNED TO 11 MAY 2012 AT 2PM

2758797,R v Marsh [2012] NSWSC 208,"Remarks on Sentence 

1HIS HONOUR : Walter Ciaran Marsh, the offender has been found guilty by a jury of the murder of Michelle Beets on 27 April 2010. 

2Michelle Beets died as a result of the infliction by the offender of multiple knife wounds to her neck and chest. At the time of her death, Ms Beets lived in Holland Street, Chatswood. She was the nurse manager of the emergency department of the Royal North Shore Hospital. 

3The maximum penalty for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A standard non-parole period has been prescribed of twenty years imprisonment. Those two guideposts are to be borne in mind when the court comes to a consideration of the appropriate penalty, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of the offender: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 281 ALR 652 

4It is my duty to determine the facts relevant to sentencing the offender. My view of the facts must be consistent with the verdict of the jury and the findings of fact I make against the offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374. Matters of mitigation may be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202 at 204. 

5At the commencement of the proceedings on sentence, the Crown sought to place before the court, material that related to an alleged attempt by the offender to kill Tammy Marsh-Leland, his ex-wife and to two articles referred to at p 2.5 of the report of Dr Yvonne Skinner (ex B). The Crown subsequently withdrew that material and it has played no part in the sentence that is to be imposed upon the offender. 

6I should state from the outset that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence of Samantha Marsh, the offender's wife, of her husband's confession to her of the murder and of the preparatory steps that he took to kill Ms Beets, was honest and reliable. The detail of her testimony, included material that had not been made publicly available by police and could not otherwise have become known to Mrs Marsh, unless she had been told by the offender. I am also satisfied that the evidence given by XX XX, the offender's brother-in-law, was honest and reliable. The offender did not give evidence during the trial, but gave a statement to police on 4 May 2010 and entered into an electronically recorded interview (ERISP) on 10 May 2010. Simply stated, the offender maintained that he did not kill Ms Beets, which was rejected by the jury. 

7The offender, a citizen of the United States of America, commenced employment as a registered nurse in the emergency department of the Royal North Shore Hospital on 9 February 2009. He had been interviewed by telephone for this position by Ms Beets, and Karen Steinbergen, a nursing unit manager. A decision was made to offer the offender employment at the hospital for twelve months. The letter of offer dated 30 December 2008, confirmed that the offender's appointment was ""to the full time position for the sponsorship duration of one year, effective on and from 9 February 2009 until 9 February 2010."" 

8The New South Wales Department of Health had lodged on 8 October 2008, a nomination for the offender as a registered nurse, with the Department of Immigration, which that Department approved. On 4 February 2009, the offender applied for a 457 visa (business long-stay temporary visa) in conjunction with the approved nomination, which was granted on 19 February 2009. The 457 visa was valid for a period of four years. A condition of the visa was that upon the visa holder ceasing employment, new employment had to be obtained with an approved employer within 28 days. Samantha Marsh was granted a spouse dependent visa. Mrs Marsh is a Vietnamese citizen. 

9Whilst working in the emergency department, the offender developed animosity towards Ms Beets. He told his wife that Ms Beets had too much power and one day, she needed to go. He said that Ms Beets kept bullying staff and, he would not be able to forgive anyone, who had done that. 

10Around December 2009, the offender said to Peter Neave, a security guard at the hospital, that ""Michelle Beets is a fucking bitch [and] couldn't run an ED [emergency department] if she tried."" Mr Neave described the offender's tone of voice as being very angry. There had been other times that the offender had expressed negative views about Ms Beets to Mr Neave. 

11In early February 2010, the offender was informed by Ms Beets that his twelve month contract was soon to end and there was not at that time any chance of the contract being extended. The offender's employment at the Royal North Shore Hospital ceased on 9 February 2010. 

12The offender then applied for positions as a registered nurse at the Royal North Shore Hospital, at other hospitals and through various recruitment agencies, but without success. The offender came to believe that his inability to obtain an appointment was due to bad references given about him by Ms Beets. He told Samantha Marsh that Ms Beets would say bad things because she did not like anyone working with her. He said he was not surprised that she had given him a bad reference, but was annoyed and that one day, Ms Beets needed to be gone. 

13In February 2010, the offender owed $50,900.00 USD in child support payments for the daughter of his marriage in 1990 to Tammy Marsh-Leland. They had divorced in 1996 and an order had been made at the time of the final Decree of Divorce by the District Court of the Travis County, Texas that the offender was to make monthly child support payments to Mrs Marsh-Leland but he had fallen into arrears. He had asked Samantha Marsh and XX XX, to forward child support payments on his behalf to his brother Frank Marsh and to James Woodward, a friend, both of whom resided in the United States. The offender made these arrangements as he did not want the child support agency to ascertain where he lived. 

14Samantha Marsh and the offender had discussed living in the United States, but decided not to, as the offender was worried that the US authorities, would trace him over the arrears of child support as soon as they arrived in that country. They had discussed living in Vietnam, however, the salary for a registered nurse in Vietnam was too low. It was their intention to live in Australia for a further two years before returning to Vietnam. 

15The offender believed that the US government would seize his passport, as he was more than $2,500 (USD) behind in child support payments. He had one page left in his passport. The offender's apprehension was well founded. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act 1996 (USA) provided that, if an applicant for a US passport was in arrears of $2,500 (USD) in child support payments or more, a passport would not be issued. The policy also applied to a US citizen, whose passport was about to expire or could not be used as there were too many stamps in it. 

16On 25 February 2010, the offender travelled to the United States to resolve his child support issues but was unsuccessful. Whilst in the United States, the offender discussed his concerns about his passport with James Woodward. He told Mr Woodward that he had one page left in his passport and asked Mr Woodward if he knew of any method of obtaining more pages. He asked Mr Woodward to investigate his passport to see if there were any free pages that could be transferred into the offender's passport. There was discussion about unstitching the stitches in Mr Woodward's passport but Mr Woodward was uneasy about doing that and nothing was done. 

17Upon his return to Australia on 14 March 2010, the offender continued applying for positions as a registered nurse. He told Samantha Marsh that he was worried that, one day the immigration people would knock on their door and kick them out of the country. His anxiety increased when his attempts to obtain work proved fruitless. He told Alki Georgallis, a recruitment specialist, that he was desperate to look for work and had been off work for a month. During a further telephone conversation, Ms Georgallis asked the offender if a senior management person could be contacted. The offender responded by referring to the female as ""a bitch"". He had previously informed Ms Georgallis that his boss was a female. I have no doubt that the offender's derogatory reference was to Michelle Beets. 

18One of the difficulties that confronted the offender in successfully obtaining employment was that he did not name his previous ""line manager"", Ms Beets, in his applications as a referee. He tried contacting her. About three or four weeks prior to her death, Ms Beets told Alan Grochulski, a psychiatric nurse in the emergency department, that she was receiving phone calls from the offender and messages were being left for her to return the calls. Ms Beets said that she was distressed, that she did not know what she was going to do, that she did not wish to speak to the offender and had been avoiding him. 

19Initially, the offender intended to scare Ms Beets. He told his wife that he wanted to confront Ms Beets, by pretending to distribute Mormon books and by wearing a Mormon uniform to ""freak her out"" and scare her. However, his intention became an intention to kill. The offender said to Samantha Marsh that he had received permission from the organisation in Ireland to kill Michelle Beets. The reference to an Irish organisation was part of the offender's fantasy that he had an Irish connection. 

20Notwithstanding his dislike of Ms Beets, the offender's principal motivation for the murder was that he believed she was blocking his applications for employment as a registered nurse and his employment prospects would be enhanced by her removal. The offender understood that the retention of his 457 visa was in jeopardy. He considered that because of the child maintenance problems, a return to the United States was not an option, nor did he wish to return to Vietnam, as the salary for a registered nurse in that country was insufficient. The offender wanted to retain his Australian lifestyle. He went about planning her murder in a meticulous way. His careful preparation for the killing was not confined to its actual execution, but extended to the means of eliminating evidence that might incriminate him. 

21The offender commenced carrying out surveillance of Ms Beets. He rang her home phone number on different days and at different times to check her routine. Ms Beets' landline telephone number and home address were listed in the White Pages. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender rang Ms Beets' landline on 5 April 2010 at 17.15.49, on 15 April 2010 at 12.42.09 and 18 April 2010 at 16.48.52. The telephone calls on 5 April and 18 April were made from Telstra payphones located outside Grace Bros at Chatswood and the remaining call was made from a Telstra payphone in Victoria Street, Darlinghurst. 

22The offender told Samantha Marsh that he knew where Ms Beets lived, had ridden on a bicycle to her neighbourhood a few times and checked on the neighbourhood. He told her that the area was really quiet and he assumed only old people were living there. He said that there was a sensor alarm in the front of Ms Beets' house and the only way to escape detection was to either to spray black paint on the sensor or to turn off the electricity box, which was situated in the front of the house. He described a few kids' pushbikes being in the front of the house, which he did not think, had been used for ages. The offender told his wife that he knew Ms Beets' routine. He assumed that she was a lonely woman, who had neither a partner nor anyone else living with her. 

23The offender purchased clothes from the 'St Vinnies' store at Chatswood. He practised on Samantha Marsh and XX XX a technique of attacking a person from behind, with the cutting of the victim's throat, stabbing into the victim's chest and other parts of the body. Mr XX demonstrated to the jury the attack from behind that the offender practised on him. I found it to be so egregiously similar to the technique shown in US Marine Sergeant Tyler's demonstration video that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender learnt that technique during his service in the United States Marine Corps. 

24Mrs Marsh saw the offender opening and closing a flick knife, repeating it and making it fast, for over half an hour, whilst sitting on the couch in their apartment about a week before Ms Beets' death. She said that she saw this on more than one occasion before the death. XX XX described the offender, chopping with a folding knife, a cucumber that Mr XX had been asked to hold. Mr XX had seen the offender with this knife on other occasions when he was waving it back and forward. Although Mrs Marsh and Mr XX described the knife as a flick-knife or a folding knife, I am satisfied that they were referring to the same knife (the flick-knife). 

25On 23 April 2010, the offender spoke to Mr XX about going to the home of a nurse, to look around and tell him whether or not any person came in. It is plain that the offender was asking Mr XX to undertake surveillance of Ms Beets' home, which he did not do. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that all of these acts were taken by the offender to prepare for the killing of Ms Beets. 

26There was evidence in the trial of the offender modifying a Ka Bar knife and having it sharpened. The Ka Bar is a large knife used by the US Marine Corps. However, the Crown contended that the flick-knife was the murder weapon. In the first week after the murder, the offender told Mrs Marsh that he had thrown the Ka Bar away, as it was not good to have such a weapon in their home, if police came and checked. When Mrs Marsh drew his attention to a media article about a knife found by police, the offender said that the knife he had used, was not that big and whoever used such a big knife would be very stupid. During his ERISP interview, the offender told police that he threw the Ka Bar knife in a trashcan at his apartment complex about a week prior to 10 May 2010, but he did not remember which trashcan he threw it in. It is impossible to know precisely what knife was used in the killing, as the offender disposed of it, but neither Mrs Marsh nor Mr XX saw the flick-knife after the murder. About a month before the murder, the offender said to his wife that if someone else's blood was on a knife, it should be thrown away because the blood would be on the knife forever. 

27Five days before the murder, the offender demonstrated his dislike for Ms Beets in a conversation that he had with David Ellis, a security guard at the Royal North Shore Hospital. In referring to Ms Beets, he said, ""that bitch is useless, she couldn't run shit."" He told Mr Ellis, either that his contract had run out or it was running out, and ""that bitch won't give me a reference."" 

28The offender's presence in Holland Street had been noticed. Six days before her death, Ms Beets was asked by Katrina Kyneur, a nursing unit manager, had she given the offender a reference. Ms Beets replied, ""No, but I saw him the other day. He walked past me in my street."" She told Ms Kyneur that she put her head down and kept walking. 

29On the day of the murder, the offender went to Ms Beets' home before 6pm. In order to eliminate the sensor light, he turned off the power supply by moving the main switch in the electricity box to the ""off position"" at 6pm. He broke a glass panel in the laundry door to pretend that there had been an attempted burglary. He lay in wait for Ms Beets, who had been delayed by a flat battery in her vehicle at Chatswood Chase. He wore a beanie that only showed his eyes and had a hoodie over his head so that he would not be recognised. 

30When Ms Beets arrived at her home shortly before 6.15pm, she reversed her vehicle into the driveway, which was not her usual practice. It seems that she did so, to enable the vehicle's defective battery to be more easily attended to. Ms Beets went to the front door of her home, but stepped backwards as she realised that the light had not come on. The offender told Mrs Marsh it was then that he grabbed Ms Beets from behind and put her on the ground. He said that Ms Beets started screaming and he was unable to stop her, until he promised that if she stopped, he would not hurt her. Ms Beets agreed to stop, saying that she had been afraid she would be hurt. The offender said that as soon as she stopped screaming he took out a knife and cut her throat. 

31The offender's account to his wife of Ms Beets' screaming, is supported by the evidence of Emma Owens, a next door neighbour, who heard short, sharp high-pitched screaming that came out in two separate lots. She described hearing the first scream and then there was a gap for a couple of seconds before the screaming started again. Gordon Bevan spoke of hearing screaming, there was a break and then more screaming. Slapping followed the screaming, which he said, was intermittent as well. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that notwithstanding the offender's promise and Ms Beets' compliance with it, he showed no mercy whatsoever to her. The attack that followed was brutal. 

32The offender cut Ms Beets' neck with a knife and stabbed her in the area of her chest multiple times. The cuts to the neck were inflicted with such ferocity that when Dr Rebecca Irvine, the pathologist, attended at the murder scene, she could see that the neck had been cut through. She recounted being able to actually see the vertebral column through the defect in the front of the neck and the cut ends of the carotid arteries. 

33Dr Irvine said that the most significant finding, during the autopsy, was an incised wound across the front of the neck. Dr Irvine observed that there had been a complete transection of all of the soft tissues in the neck that would normally be in front of the vertebral column. The soft tissue of the neck and the larynx had been cut across. In addition, there was another cut that did not go completely across one of the carotid arteries and there were three cuts across the bone of the spine in the neck. There was another cut across the larynx, which indicated, Dr Irvine said that there had been multiple cuts across the neck. Dr Irvine was unable to say how many cuts there had been to the neck, other than there had been more than one. 

34The infliction of these hideous wounds upon Ms Beets was extraordinarily cruel. The offender told Samantha Marsh that he cut Ms Beets' throat many times, as he tried to pretend that it was the work of an amateur. He also said that the knife was not as sharp and as good as he expected. 

35Dr Irvine described a cluster of eight stab wounds on the upper left chest area. Six of these wounds went through the chest wall and some of them perforated into the chest cavity and into the left lung. There was a single stab wound of the lower central chest, which went through the skin and soft tissue, through the cartilage at the bottom of the rib cage, entered the sac around the heart (the pericardium) and incised the wall of the right side of the heart. Dr Irvine identified a total of 17 incised wounds to the deceased's hands, which, she said, were classic examples of ""defence wounds"". She also identified two stab wounds on the front of the deceased's left upper hand and superficial incised wounds underneath the clavicle and in the area of the left breast. 

36I have no doubt that the slapping sound heard by Mr and Mrs Bevan, who were walking their dog in Holland Street, emanated from the blows with the knife with which the offender struck Ms Beets. The multiple defensive wounds to Ms Beets' hands demonstrate her efforts to ward off the offender's ferocious attack. These last moments of her life must have been horrifying. It was an act of barbarity for the offender to kill Ms Beets in the manner that he did. 

37After becoming aware of Mr and Mrs Bevan, the offender ceased his attack upon Ms Beets. He left the verandah, picked up a backpack in which he had clothes to change into, and ran swiftly away from the scene of his crime. Ms Beets was still alive when he left, but died very shortly thereafter, whilst being held by Mr Bevan. 

38The offender told Mrs Marsh that it didn't take much time to change his clothes. He threw the knife into a stormwater drain and discarded clothing that he had been wearing as he made his way to Westfield Chatswood to meet his wife. It is evident from the CCTV footage that the offender placed a bum bag into a rubbish bin at Chatswood Chase and shortly thereafter disposed of his jacket. He was no longer wearing a backpack. The first thing that he said to Samantha Marsh when he met her outside Westfield at 6.58pm, was that, ""it was done, the bitch is gone. From now on I shouldn't have any more bad references, we should have a better future."" 

39On their walk home, the offender entered an apartment block in Mowbray Road, Chatswood, took off his clothes and jumped into a swimming pool for a quick wash. He previously had told his wife not to touch him, as he was ""dirty"". Upon reaching his apartment, the offender attended to the disposal of the clothes and pair of flip-flops that he had been wearing when he met Mrs Marsh. On the following day, he threw a backpack into a rubbish bin at the Chatswood Chase food court, after purchasing another backpack at K Mart. Two days later, the police located that backpack in a bin outside the offender's apartment block. On the same day, the offender purchased a further backpack at K Mart. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that all of this conduct was taken by the offender to avoid detection for the murder. 

40The callousness with which the murder was committed, is further disclosed in the CCTV footage, by the offender's calm and composed demeanour at the entrance to Westfield Chatswood, where he waited for his wife about half an hour after the killing, and the conversation with her that followed after they met, in which he expressed a concern that he had been unable to finish what he had planned and Ms Beets was still alive when he had left. 

41Viewed objectively, this is a terrible crime that is at the top of the range of the offence of murder. 

42The offender did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. His subjective circumstances are drawn from evidence in the Crown case and histories given to Dr Pauline Langeluddecke, Dr Stephen Allnut and Professor Bruce Brew, whose reports were tendered (exhibits 1-6). 

43The offender was born on 21 September 1960 in Pennsylvania in the United States of America. He was 49 years old at the time of the commission of the offence and is now 51 years old. He has no criminal convictions in Australia or the United States. He served in the United States Marine Corps from November 1978 until November 1984. His postings included being stationed with the infantry unit of the 3 rd Battalion, 1 st Marines in November 1980, attending the Marine Security Guard School in Quantico in March 1982 and service as a marine security guard in the US embassies in Argentina and China. It appears that the offender also served in the US National Guard and Air Force. The offender started nursing school in 1993 and graduated in 1996. He initially worked at the Health Care Rehabilitation Centre in Austin Texas. As I have previously mentioned, he and Tammy Marsh-Leland divorced in 1996. He commenced a relationship with Samantha Marsh in Vietnam in 2007. The offender suffered a head injury in a traffic accident in Vietnam in about May 2008, was hospitalised and a right parietal craniotomy was performed. In August 2008, the offender travelled to Sydney to meet Samantha Marsh, who was then studying at University and they married on 13 October 2008. 

44I do not propose to detail all of what is said in the medical reports tendered in the offender's case. Mr Chapple SC for the offender, said that these reports do not establish that the offender's head injury affected his actions at the time of the offence, but asked the court to take into account his epilepsy and future medical position in determining whether a sentence, less than a sentence of life imprisonment was appropriate. 

45An MRI brain scan was performed on 2 September 2011 that demonstrated a large area of encephalomalacia within the offender's right temporal lobe, which given the head injury in the traffic accident, was likely to be traumatic in origin. The offender also had mild diffuse cerebral atrophy. In a report dated 8 September 2011 (ex 4), Dr Langeluddecke, a clinical psychologist, noted that the offender was at high risk of long-term neurobehavioral/personality change and that injury to the temporal lobe carried significant risk of post-traumatic epilepsy. Dr Langeluddecke, considered that some of the offender's dysfunctional behaviour during the neuropsychological assessment on 7 April 2011, was due to his brain damage. She thought it was possible that his traumatic brain injury exacerbated long-standing perfectionist tendencies, compromised his social judgement and capacity to monitor and control his behaviour. Dr Langeluddecke believed the offender's short-term memory and executive functioning difficulties to be neurologically based and the offender was unlikely to show further significant improvement with the passage of time. 

46Dr Allnut, a forensic psychiatrist, in a report dated 16 September 2011 
(ex 4) considered that the offender's capacity for insight and judgement appeared to be adequate. The offender would not be regarded as suffering a major depressive disorder, anxiety or psychotic disorder. It appeared that his grand mal seizure disorder was attributable to a traumatic brain injury. Dr Allnutt reported that there have been numerous instances where the offender has been observed to experience grand mal seizures both in America and Australia by different people. Particular reference was made to the offender being brought to the Royal North Shore Hospital on 1 May 2011 ""following alleged seizures."" He noted that the offender was taking Tegretol 300mg twice daily. In a further report (ex 6), Dr Allnutt recommended that the offender should continue to accept Tegretol for the seizure disorder. 

47In a report dated 11 January 2012 (ex 7), Professor Brew, a consultant physician and neurologist, considered that the offender's traumatic brain injury was relatively mild. Professor Brew based that conclusion on the history provided, the fact that the offender was able to hold down a job and the neuropsychological report. Whilst noting there were several inconsistencies with what the offender mentioned to him as opposed to what had been previously recorded by other clinicians, Professor Brew opined that the cause of these inconsistencies was unlikely to be related to any significant traumatic brain injury. In relation to the offender's epilepsy, Professor Brew reported that there was no doubt that the offender has generalised seizures secondary to temporal lobe pathology from his traumatic brain injury. Nonetheless, the seizures themselves were not characterised by abnormal behaviour. Professor Brew expressed the opinion that the seizure disorder did not play any role in the murder. 

48There is little in the way of mitigation. The offender has no prior criminal convictions and has served his country in the military and the community as a member of the nursing profession. I have concluded, however, that the offender's prior good character is completely overwhelmed by the objective seriousness of his offending. He has neither expressed remorse or shown contrition for the offence. His sentence is not to be increased for that, but no allowance in mitigation can be made for remorse or contrition. 

49I do accept that the offender suffered a traumatic brain injury and, as a consequence, has generalised seizures secondary to temporal lobe pathology. Neither his traumatic brain injury nor seizure disorder contributed to the commission of the offence. Professor Brew's assessment that the traumatic brain injury is relatively mild appears to me, to be soundly based. There is no evidence that suggests the offender had any difficulty associated with the medical condition, coping with the demanding duties of a registered nurse in an emergency department of a public hospital. I appreciate that there is the likelihood of further seizures, for which he is taking Tegretol and the risk of neurobehavioral/personality change. There is, however, no evidence that the offender's reasonable needs for medical treatment will not be met while he is imprisoned, or that there is a serious risk of imprisonment having an adverse effect on his health or that his medical condition will make imprisonment more difficult for him: R v Vachalec [1981] 1 NSWLR 351. The offender has been in custody since 19 May 2010. 

50The Crown invites me to find that the offender poses a significant risk in the future to those who come into contact with him and who are seen as thwarting his prospects. The Crown placed reliance upon the following opinion of Dr Yvonne Skinner, a consultant psychiatrist, in her report (ex B p 10): 

""Mr Marsh does not present a risk to the general community. His behaviour demonstrates tendencies to manipulate situations by deception and fraud, to maintain control and plan carefully. He does present a risk to any person who occupies a particular psychodynamic relationship to Mr Marsh, whether in an institution or on release. The issue would be Mr Marsh's perception that the person had caused him serious harm or distress."" 


51I am mindful that some of the material upon which the opinion was founded, namely those documents said to have been related to an alleged attempt by the offender to kill his ex-wife and the articles at p.2.5 of the report, were withdrawn by the Crown. 

52Mr Chapple pointed out that the offender has no prior convictions and hence, no history of violence. He placed reliance on Dr Skinner's view only to the extent of her assessment that she did not consider the offender to be a risk to the general community. Mr Chapple pointed out that Dr Skinner had not had the opportunity of speaking with the offender. 

53I accept that the offender is not a risk to the community in general. It is, however, plain from all the circumstances surrounding the murder, that the offender has the real potential to violently harm a person who he perceives, might seriously interfere with his plans or who otherwise to his mind, causes him significant distress. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there is a risk that the offender could offend again by killing such a person. I consider that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are poor. 

54In not extending the offender's contract term, Ms Beets was doing no more than exercising her judgement as the nurse manager of the emergency department. Furthermore, she was exercising her duty of care to the health system and to the public, by not providing the offender with an undeserved reference. The community interest in protection and deterrence requires that it be made absolutely clear that people in management positions are entitled to make decisions about members of staff, without the fear of violent retribution. 

55The maximum sentence for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A person sentenced to imprisonment for life is to serve that sentence for the term of his natural life: s 19A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Section 19A(3) provides that nothing in s 19A affects the operation s 21(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 [the Crimes (SP) Act] which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than imprisonment for life. 

56Section 61(1) of the Crimes (SP) Act provides: 

""A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence"". 

57The maximum penalty of life imprisonment is intended for cases falling within the worst category of murder: Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-452; 27 A Crim R 465 at 468. The level of culpability of the offender in the commission of the offence and whether the case is one calling for a life sentence in the terms of s 61(1), is first to be considered, and if so, whether in the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 21(1), the subjective features relating to the offender justify a lesser sentence of imprisonment for a specified term: R v Harris [2000] NSWCCA 469; (2000) 50 NSWLR 409, R v Phuong Canh Ngo (No 3) [2001] NSWSC 1021; (2001) 125 A Crim R 495. The primary focus of s 61(1) is an assessment of how extreme the offender's culpability is: R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; (2004) 59 NSWLR 557 at [52]. The combined effect of the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence is critical to a conclusion that a life sentence is required. The absence of any one or more of the four indicia may make it more difficult for the conclusion to be reached that a life sentence is required, but will not be determinative: Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; (2006) 164 A Crim R 126 at [23]. 

58The Crown submitted that the offence falls within a range that in its upper extent includes circumstances, which would justify a life sentence and its lower range would fall just short of that. The Crown drew my attention to the sentences imposed in three cases that were said to have some similarities to the present case. Mr Chapple accepted it was a very serious murder, but contended that something less than imprisonment for life was appropriate. Mr Chapple pointed to the offender's ongoing medical issues, his lack of prior convictions and Dr Skinner's assessment that the offender was not a threat to the general community, as subjective features that would justify a lesser sentence. 

59The offender meticulously planned the murder of Ms Beets as he perceived that she was an obstacle to the retention of his 457 visa. The manner in which he killed her was cruel, merciless and abhorrent. The offender's crime falls within the worst category of murder. All four of the indicia in s 61(1) are present. There is nothing in the subjective circumstances of the offender, which justifies a lesser sentence. 

60I am satisfied that the level of the offender's culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met by a sentence of life imprisonment. A consideration of the cases referred to by the Crown supports my view that such a sentence is appropriate. 

61Walter Ciaran Marsh for the murder of Michelle Beets, you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment for life. The sentence is to commence on 
19 May 2010.

		09 March 2012",2012-03-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758806,Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Samisoni Volita Havili Kaufusi [2012] NSWSC 200,"Judgment 

1These proceedings constitute a customs prosecution, being proceedings for the recovery of penalties under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) (hereinafter, ""the Act""), s 244. 

2The defendant, Samisoni Volita Havili Kaufusi, has been charged with two offences: 

a) one (1) count of importing prohibited imports, in contravention of s 233(1)(b) of the Act, namely 3,949 kilograms of pure weight kava (Count 1); and 

b) one (1) count of causing a false statement to be made to an officer, in contravention of s 234(1)(d)(ii), or alternatively s 234(1)(d)(iv), of the Act (Count 2). 

3By amended statement of claim filed on 1 April 2011, the plaintiff, the Chief Executive Officer (hereinafter, ""CEO"") of Customs, seeks orders that the defendant be convicted of the abovementioned offences and that a penalty in accordance with s 233AB(2) of the Act be imposed in relation to offence (a) and a penalty pursuant to s 234(2)(d) of the Act be imposed in relation to offence (b). The plaintiff also seeks costs against the defendant pursuant to s 263 of the Act. 

4The offences with which the defendant has been charged require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, although, by specific provision (s 247) of the Act the prosecutions are conducted in accordance with the civil procedures of the Court (see CEO Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Ltd (2004) 216 CLR 161 at [2] (Gleeson CJ), [32] (Gummow J), [90] (Kirby J), [144] (Hayne J, McHugh J agreeing); Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service v Karam [2011] NSWCA 224 at [12] per Basten JA). 

Relevant Legislation 

5Section 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) sets out the relevant sentencing principles applicable to Commonwealth offences. As prescribed in s 16A(1), the Court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. In addition, the Court must give regard to the list of criteria set out in s 16A(2), namely: 

""16A Matters to which court to have regard when passing sentence etc. 
... 

(2) In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court: 

(a) the nature and circumstances of the offence; 
(b) other offences (if any) that are required or permitted to be taken into account; 
(c) if the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or a similar character-that course of conduct; 
(d) the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence; 
(e) any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; 
(f) the degree to which the person has shown contrition for the offence: 

(i) by taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; or 
(ii) in any other manner; 
(fa) the extent to which the person has failed to comply with: 

(i) any order under subsection 23CD(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 ; or 
(ii) any obligation under a law of the Commonwealth; or 
(iii) any obligation under a law of the State or Territory applying under subsection 68(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 ; 
about pretrial disclosure, or ongoing disclosure, in proceedings relating to the offence; 
(g) if the person has pleaded guilty to the charge in respect of the offence-that fact; 
(h) the degree to which the person has cooperated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or of other offences; 
(j) the deterrent effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have on the person; 
(k) the need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence; 
(m) the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person; 
(n) the prospect of rehabilitation of the person; 
(p) the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person's family or dependants."" 

6Those criteria described in s 16A(2)(d), (e), (f), (i) and (fa) of the Crimes Act are not relevant to the current circumstances. 

7In addition to the criteria above, s 16C of the Crimes Act provides that before imposing a fine on a person, a court must take into account the financial circumstances of the person. However, the financial circumstances of the person does not dictate what fine is imposed. The obligation in s 16C is to consider whether the person can actually afford to pay the fine. In some circumstances, the criminality is so serious that not to impose an extensive fine would undermine the need for general deterrence (Smith v The Queen (1991) 25 NSWLR 1 at 23 - 24; Environmental Protection Agency v Ableway Waste Management Pty Ltd [2005] NSWLEC 469; CEO Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Ltd [2006] QCA 558 at [95] - [98]). 

Applicable Penalties 

8The penalties made applicable to the offences with which the defendant is charged are prescribed in ss 233AB and 234 of the Act. The applicable penalty for an offence of import prohibited import is set out in s 233AB(2). Section 233AB(2) reflects an intention by Parliament to make the penalty for an offence of import prohibited import directly proportionate to the amount of money derived from the offence. Section 233AB(2)(a) states that where the Court can determine the value of the goods imported, a penalty not exceeding 3 times the value of the goods or 1000 penalty units (being $110,000) whichever is greater may be imposed. If the Court cannot determine the value of the goods, the maximum penalty is 1000 penalty units (see s 233AB(2)(b)). 

9The offence of making a false statement carries a penalty under s 234(2)(c) not exceeding 100 penalty units. 

10Penalties for customs offences are to be of a very high order (CEO of Customs v Coulton [2005] NSWSC 869 at [48] per Simpson J). Kitto J in L Vogel & Son Pty Ltd v Anderson (1967) 120 CLR 157 at 164; 41 ALJR 264 at 267 provides reasons for the severity of sentences for customs offences: 

""The Customs laws represent the judgment of Parliament upon an important aspect of the economic organisation of the community, and the object of the penal provisions is to make that judgment as effective as possible. It is important to remember that Customs Officers have of practical necessity to rely extensively upon the information supplied to them by importers, for the flow of commerce could not be maintained if every importation had to be fully investigated. Moreover, detection of fraud is not always easy. No doubt ordinary conceptions of honesty and of civic responsibility suffice to ensure a great deal of fair dealing with Customs, but for some people little seems to matter but fear of the consequences of discovery. The Customs Act 1901 (Cth) makes those consequences potentially drastic. It is for the courts to make them, in suitable cases, drastic in fact, for otherwise traders who are not saved by qualms of conscience from willingness to defraud their fellow citizens may weigh the profits they hope for against the penalties they have cause to fear and find the gamble worthwhile."" 

11The legislature has not indicated the method used to determine the value of the prohibited import. In its inclusion of a default provision, it has foreseen that circumstances may arise whereby the Court cannot place a value on a prohibited import. The default provision is activated when there is no evidence before the Court to assist with determining the prohibited import's value. It is by no means an acknowledgement that because the value of a prohibited import fluctuates over time according to varying factors, a value cannot be attributed to it. 

12The Court notes that ss 159, 160 and 161 of the Act do not apply to the present proceedings. A combination of the operation of ss 155, 159 and 161 of the Act makes clear that the value of the imported goods for the purposes associated with imposing duty is their customs value which is the transaction value of imported goods (see s 159(1) and (2) of the Act). Those provisions deal with the ""collector"" attributing a transaction value to the imported goods for the purpose of imposing duty, not a penalty. 

13The term ""collector"" is defined in s 8 of the Act as the CEO, the Regional Director, or any officer doing duty in the matter in relation to which the expression is used. To place the Court in the shoes of the ""collector"" for the purposes of ss 159, 160 and 161 would be inconsistent with the clear definition of a ""collector"" in the Act. 

14The inconsistency between s 159(7) and the penalty provisions contained in the Act further demonstrates that the Court is not to apply s 159 when determining the value of the kava. Section 159(7) states that where a collector cannot determine the transaction value, they should deduce a value (referred to as the ""deductive value""). Whereas, under the penalty provisions if the Court cannot determine a value the Court defaults to the penalty units provision, e.g. s 233AB(2)(b). 

The Valuation of Drugs 

15The conceptual and practical problems associated with determining the value of a particular drug are well recognised. In R v McCourt (1993) 69 A Crim R 151 at 156, Bollen J of the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal rejected the submission that the Court should take judicial notice of the value of cannabis crops. He said: 

""If Judges turn to stored information or evidence given in other cases they may use out of date information. The normal yield and value should be proved in each case. Of course, if there be no dispute, we may expect agreed facts to be told to the Court."" 

In this case, the parties have not agreed to a value of the kava. A member of the Police Force has provided sworn evidence which conflicts with the value that the defendant provided in his record of interview (see [35] - [36]). 

16The market value of a drug depends upon the quantity of the drug, the drug's purity, whether the wholesale or retail market is assessed and the potential purchasers' perceptions of the drug. Anyone with a basic understanding of economics will know that the market value of a certain product will fluctuate according to supply and demand and that the wholesale value of a product is a far less than its 'street value' (R v Majeric (2001) 121 A Crim R 451; [2001] VSCA 15 (about 15 percent) The Queen v Belbruno (2000) 117 A Crim R 150; [2000] VSCA 201 (12 - 20 percent)). It is a well-accepted principle that the street value is the value adopted when dealing with drug offences and is that price which is obtained in a hypothetical sale by a hypothetical, willing but not anxious, vendor to a hypothetical willing, but not anxious, purchaser. 

17The Court accepts the evidence of Constable Kenneth Bradshaw that kava sells for $20 to $30 per 15 to 30 gram 'deal' in the Northern Territory, where the most common market for the substance exists. The Court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that no less than $20 for a 30 gram deal is the value of kava and the Court will use that figure for the purposes of this sentence. 

The Objective Seriousness of the Offences 

18Although commenced by a civil process, the various elements of the above-mentioned charges must be established on the criminal standard of proof, that is beyond reasonable doubt: Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty at [2] (Gleeson CJ), [32] (Gummow J), [90] (Kirby J), [144] (Hayne J, McHugh J agreeing). 

19The relevant elements of an offence under s 233(1)(b) of the Act are:
(a)That the subject transported to Australia is a 'prohibited import';
(b)That importation has occurred; and 
(c)No exemptions apply. 

20For the sake of completeness, schedule 4 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (Cth) (as at November 2008) lists kava as a prohibited import (see item 112B) unless the conditions in regulations 5(1), (2) or (2A) of the Regulations are fulfilled. In this case, none of those conditions were met. Those conditions include that the law permits the importation of 2 kilos of kava for personal use. However, this exemption does not apply for kava imported by post, courier services or unaccompanied baggage. In those circumstances, an import permit is required to legally import 2 kilograms for personal use. 

21The Court accepts that the defendant was conducting a commercial operation. Considering the quantity of the kava imported and the division of kava into deal packets of 20 grams each, it is clear that the operation was not for personal use. 

22The relevant elements for charge 2 are self-evident. The Court is not required to discuss whether each of the above elements has been proved beyond reasonable doubt because the defendant has admitted to guilt. The subsequent discussion of the nature of the offences, to which the Court now turns, is relevant to the severity of sentence. 

The First Offence Charged 

23On or about 15 November 2008, the defendant arranged for a shipping container, allegedly carrying only innocuous frozen root vegetables to be transported from Nuku'alofa in Tonga to Sydney, Australia. The delivery address on the Bill of Lading (numbered TBUSYD129 -001) was the address and mobile number of the defendant. Concealed within the container was 3,949 kilograms of pure weight kava. 

24The defendant had made all necessary arrangements to effect the importation. In a record of interview dated 15 December 2008, the defendant admitted to travelling to Tonga between 9 October 2008 and 6 November 2008. He sourced the kava from two persons in Tonga between 9 October 2008 and 31 October 2008. 

25The defendant purchased 1120 kilograms from a person located in Vala'ava, Tonga. He paid $280 for that kava to be transported to Nuku'alofa by Air Chathams. The defendant later sourced an additional 2,374 kilograms from a farmer at Nuku'alofa. He was issued a commercial invoice numbered 443899 by Filipe Iongi, Fanga Nuku'alofa for 34 x Yam, 151 x Cassava, 54 x Taro Tarua, 264 x Giant Taro totalling $5470. The 151 x Cassava was in fact kava. 

26The defendant said in his record of interview that he planned to sell the kava to members of the Tongan Community for $20 a kilo. The defendant also said that he planned to sell the root vegetables to the community. However, this subsequent intention did not alter the overall purpose of the arrangement, which was to import kava into Australia. 

27The defendant engaged a Customs brokerage and freight forwarding company, UPS Supply Chain Services (hereinafter, ""UPS""). He provided the original Bill of Lading, the commercial invoice numbered 443899, a Phytosanitary Certificate obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Plant Protection Organisation of the Tongan Government and a Tongan Customs Export Entry to an employee of UPS. Based on these documents, UPS created a Nature 10 Declaration which was provided to the plaintiff on 14 November 2008. The Nature 10 Declaration contained details of the contents of the container as including ""other root or tuber vegetables (frozen)"" and ""frozen manioc (cassa)"", with no reference to kava. It also provided that customs duty amounting to $3828.09 was payable. 

28UPS issued an invoice to the defendant for an amount of $4983.38. The employee of UPS received various instalments of money from different persons between the months of November 2008 and September 2009 as payment of the invoice in entirety. The defendant had instructed those persons to pay the money to UPS. The payments were in relation to the innocuous frozen root vegetables. 

29The container was transported on the vessel, ""Capitaine Tasman"", which stopped in Brisbane before arriving in Sydney on 15 November 2008. The container disembarked on 19 November 2008 and was transported to a Customs Container Examination facility where it was X-rayed. On 20 November 2008, Australian Customs Service (hereinafter ""ACS"") officers physically inspected the container at which point 176 white Hessian bags containing clear plastic seal bags of kava were located at the bottom of the container, concealed by 327 plastic bags of innocuous frozen root vegetables. The total amount of pure weight kava in the container was 3,949 kilograms. 

The Second Offence Charged 

30The defendant admitted to supplying false information to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Plant Protection Organisation of the Tongan Government. In his record of interview, he stated that he lied about the contents of the container because he knew that he could not export kava from Tonga. 

The Interaction Between the Two Offences 

31The second offence of causing false statement occurred in the course of committing the first offence, importation of prohibited imports. Therefore, the criminality associated with the second offence will be subsumed by the larger criminal conduct of importing a prohibited import. The Court applies the principles in regard to the totality of sentencing, as explained in Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59 and Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 and intends to fix a penalty for the less serious offence, and, then, having regard to the penalty imposed already, impose a penalty for the more serious offence that takes account of totality. 

32The issue for this Court's determination is the appropriate sentence to be imposed. In determining that issue there are a number of matters with which the Court must deal, the most important of which, given s 233AB(2) of the Act, is the value of the imported kava. 


The Value of the Kava 

33Kava originates from the root of the pepper plant, Piper Methysticum, which grows to height of approximately 4 metres. The plant is cultivated in many Pacific Ocean island countries and has major symbolic and political significance in the Pacific region. Kava is used to facilitate rituals and in that sense, it strengthens the Pacific identity and traditions. However, it also has a desirable mood altering and relaxant effect which has led to its widespread dissemination, particularly during the 1990s. 

34The Court acknowledges that kava may be valued in a number of ways and that more than one value can be attributed to the kava. The plaintiff submits that the value of imported goods under a commercial operation is the street value because the street value is the value to which the offence relates. The court accepts that submission. The correct approach to determining the value of the kava is what a reasonable hypothetical purchaser would pay, in other words, the street value. 

The Evidence of Kenneth Bradshaw 

35The street value of a certain substance fluctuates. There may be times of oversupply due to drought or undersupply due to changes in drug taking fashions (Transcript at 25). However, the Court accepts the evidence of Kenneth Bradshaw that, in the Northern Territory, the street value for kava is $20 to $30 per 15 - 30 gram deal. In his affidavit sworn 8 November 2010, Mr Bradshaw states: 

""I have debriefed numerous offenders and remote community members involved in the trafficking and distribution of kava in the NT and on all occasions I have been informed that the kava sells for $20 to $30 per 15 to 30 gram deal. The kava is generally supplied to indigenous community members/co-offenders on credit in expectation of payment when the kava is sold"". 

36The Court regards Mr Bradshaw's evidence as credible given his involvement in the investigation of 25 to 30 kava offences in the Northern Territory since February 2009. His involvement in significant individual seizures of kava ranging from 20 kilograms to 294 kilograms whilst working at the Katherine Substance Abuse Intelligence Desk demonstrates his knowledge of the value of kava in the Northern Territory. 

37The plaintiff submits that, taking the least expensive price point in the range calculated on Bradshaw's figures, the value of the kava in the Northern Territory is $20 per 30 grams, or $666.67 per kilogram. Therefore, based on this valuation, the imported 3,949 kilograms of kava equates to a value of $2,632,666.60. 

38In paragraph 5 of his defence filed on 15 April 2011, the defendant did not agree with this valuation. In the record of interview dated 15 December 2008, the defendant states that he sells kava to the local community in Sydney at $20 per kilogram. At this rate, the total value of the imported kava (3,949 kilograms) would be $78,980. I do not accept the assertion by the defendant. That, of course, does not prove the opposite. Yet, here, there is evidence of a value in the Northern Territory. There is evidence of a large market amongst remote indigenous communities. There is, further, evidence of a history of the defendant selling in that market and no history of sales in Sydney. 

39The Court also relies upon the evidence of Kenneth Bradshaw that all kava seized in the Northern Territory has originated from either Sydney or Brisbane. 

The Expert's Report 

40The Court has also been provided with an Expert's report compiled by Associate Professor Alan Clough of James Cook University. On page 91 of the report, Professor Clough states that: 

""During the period of observation from 1990 - 91, the value of kava purchased from the wholesaler was $73,300; a total of 1446kg delivered to the community at a wholesale price of $50/kg...The known proceeds from sales for the year were at least $52,200. The investment in kava by consumers, therefore, was at least $125,500 (=$73,300 + $52,200) during 1990-91 with $73,300 leaving the community economic to the benefit of the wholesaler. This represents 11% of people's income for 1990-91 with at least another 8% ($52,200) of the profits concentrated or redistributed locally; at least 19% of the cash available to community members in all. By contrast, during 1989-90 the trade probably represented a cash drain of just 2% on the community's resources."" 

41This material is of little use for valuation purposes because it has measured the value of kava as at 1990 - 91. 

Other Relevant Considerations 

42The defendant admitted, at an early stage, that he was responsible for importing the container and did so for commercial purposes. He also voluntarily participated in a taped interview at Customs House at Sydney International Airport and admitted to importing the kava to Australia to sell it to the community for $20 a kilo. Given the objective evidence, there may have been little realistic alternative. The defendant later pleaded guilty in his defence filed on 24 June 2010 and agreed to facts which strengthened the prosecution's case. In this respect, the defendant is entitled to the benefits associated with his guilty plea, the fact of the plea (s 16A(2)(g) of the Crimes Act ) and his cooperation with authorities (s 16A(2)(h) of the Crimes Act ), all of which facilitated the course of justice: see Cameron v R [2002] HCA 6; 209 CLR 339. 

43The defendant has a number of previous convictions. Therefore, he is not entitled to leniency applicable to a person for a first offence. On 18 March 2009, he, with others, was charged in the Northern Territory with possession of 137 kilograms of kava, taking part in the supply of that same amount of kava and also unlawful possession of cannabis and supply of cannabis. The defendant was convicted and sentenced to an aggregate term of 9 months. 

44Later, on 13 May 2009, the defendant was charged with possessing a commercial quantity of kava and supplying kava without a licence. He was convicted and sentenced to an aggregate term of 12 months imprisonment, to be served concurrently with the sentence received on 18 March 2009, with a non-parole period of 9 months. 

45Details of the defendant's other relevant previous offences are listed below: 




Date 

Offence 

Result 


3 May 2004 

One (1) count of possessing a commercial quantity of kava 
One (1) count of supplying kava without a licence 

Convicted and sentenced to an aggregate term of 6 months imprisonment, suspended immediately on the condition that he was to be of good behaviour for 2 years 


3 May 2004 

One (1) count of entering Aboriginal land without a permit 

Convicted and fined $200 

46Given the defendant's previous drug offences, there is an obvious need for specific deterrence. The defendant's criminal record is evidence of the defendant's continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. It strengthens the need, in this case, for retribution, deterrence and protection of society (Veen v R [No 2] [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477). 

47Other than the plea of guilty, there is no direct evidence before the Court of his remorse or contrition. The plea of guilty does show a degree of remorse and/or contrition, in this case, but not to the degree required to substantially reduce sentence. Furthermore the defendant's conduct was planned and premeditated, despite the defendant's contrary submission. It is clear from the defendant's criminal history that he would have continued to import kava to Australia if he had not been caught. (See CEO Customs v Labrador Liquor, supra). 

48The Court is also required to consider a number of subjective factors, namely, the defendant's prospects for rehabilitation, his character, age, means and mental or physical conditions as well the effect of the sentence upon his family and dependants. The defendant's submissions raise matters relevant to the aforementioned considerations but there is no evidence testifying to the accuracy of those submissions or supporting them. The defendant has not made the Court's task easy in this respect. 

49It is unnecessary to make reference to every consideration listed in s16A(2) of the Crimes Act . The Court has only referred to those that are most relevant in the present case. In the defendant's submissions, it is alleged that the defendant lives with and financially supports his (at that time) pregnant wife. It is also alleged that the defendant has non-insulin dependent diabetes and high blood pressure. He is receiving medication. I reiterate, however, that no evidence verifying these facts was adduced but, notwithstanding that lack of assistance, I will attribute weight to those factors. Further, the defendant is an active member of the community and is involved in the community church, choir and fundraising activities . He has an interest in Rugby Union in Australia . 

The Imposition of Penalty 

50As I stated in CEO of Customs v Ozzy Tyre & Tube Pty Ltd & Anor [2005] NSWSC 948 at [96]: 

""It is essential... to impose condign punishment which properly reflects the denunciation of the conduct, the retribution that society needs to impose and properly establishes a 
deterrent for any other like minded entity or person from committing similar offences."" 

51The maximum penalty imposed, in accordance with s 233AB(2) of the Act, should be three times the value of $2,632,666.60 (see [35]), that is $7,897,999.80. This figure is different from the figure in the plaintiff's calculations on penalty dated 22 July 2011 ($7,885,999.98). The Court considers the figure of $7,897,999.80 as the appropriate maximum. 

52The Court has not been provided with any directly comparable cases or statistical information to assist with placing the defendant's offences within any hierarchy of offences of their kind. Therefore, the Court is unable to conclude that the offences are in the worst category of cases that attract the maximum penalty. The importation offences would cover a wide range of conduct including importation of relatively innocuous amounts. This is a large amount, imported in a container, involving significant long-term planning. It must at least be at or above mid-range in objective seriousness. 

53There has been significant social and socioeconomic damage of Aboriginal Communities in Arnhem Land caused by kava. According to Professor Crough, kava has a number of adverse health effects including seizures, extreme weight loss in heavy users and cardiovascular disease. Considering these widespread effects, there is a need for general deterrence. 

54In Smith v The Queen , Mahoney JA states at 23 that it: 
""...is the significance to others of the present punishment which has a particular importance...what is done to him should both mark, clearly and emphatically, the community's view of his offence and (if it may) deter other possible offences."" 

55The Court acknowledges that kava, like alcohol and hallucinogens, affects vulnerable communities. 

The Capacity for the Defendant to Pay 

56As at 15 December 2008, the time at which the defendant was interviewed by ACS Officers (see annexure J to Agreed Statement of Facts), the defendant was unemployed and had been for two years. The plaintiff submits that the defendant's occupation was importation and distribution of kava and root vegetables (Transcript at 15). 

57The defendant did not give evidence and there was no direct evidence before the Court of his financial position. According to the defendant's submissions (paras 53, 54, 62 and 63), he currently works as a truck driver and earns $600 - $800 per week, depending on overtime. The defendant supports his wife by paying her an allowance of $150 and pays rent to his sister amounting to $150 per week. His weekly expenditure is $397.70. Again, there is no evidence to this effect. 

58Nevertheless, there is scope for the operation of s 16C of the Crimes Act to perform a useful function (CEO Customs v Labrador Liquor , supra) , but its effect, because of the absence of evidence, must be based on impression . Following the proceedings the Court sought evidence of financial circumstances from the defendant. None was forthcoming. 

59The Court accepts the plaintiff's submission in this respect and grants limited weight to the defendant's perceived financial circumstances when determining the appropriate sentence. This poses a number of problems with the imposition of sentence given that, on the impression of the Court, it is unlikely that the defendant will be able to pay the fine. I refer to the comments I made in 2005 in CEO of Customs v Ozzy Tyres : 

""112 ...The difficulty with which Customs is faced is that by their very nature, a penalty which is confined to a pecuniary penalty will, in the case of impecuniosity, be problematic. It may be that the legislature needs to consider seriously the capacity, in the case of impecuniosity or inappropriateness of pecuniary penalty, for other penalties to apply. I do not here suggest that full time imprisonment would be appropriate, but some form of community service either with or without supervision and/or restrictions on movement, or other kind of penalty, should be included in the range of penalties available so that persons who perpetrate criminal offences of this kind can be the subject of a practical punishment which, in turn, would have the added benefit of repaying society with the assets of intelligence and hard work which, for example, the personal defendant in this matter, clearly has."" 

60If a pecuniary penalty were imposed in Queensland, non-payment could be enforced by a variety of means, including imprisonment. That is not the case in New South Wales and makes more obvious the extension of the available type of penalty for the offence in circumstances where it is anticipated that the offender may not be able to pay. 

61Nevertheless I must deal with the legislation as it exists. The objective circumstances are at least mid-range. There is little to be said for the defendant on subjective matters. This is the defendant's first importation offence. His other offences include kava dealing, particularly to the remote indigenous community. He is therefore entitled to some leniency but not to the same degree as if this were the first offence of any relevant kind. 

62Notwithstanding the Court's perception (albeit without evidence) of the defendant's financial capacity, a penalty must be imposed that takes account of the maximum fine, the value of goods (and profit that would otherwise have been obtained) and the need for deterrence. 

63Other than the plea of guilty, the fact of which I otherwise take into account in reducing the penalty by 25 percent, there has been no contrition or remorse. Nevertheless, the plea and the facts agreed by the defendant displays co-operation with the enforcement agency: see, generally, s 16A of the Crimes Act . 

64If the defendant's financial circumstances are that he is impecunious, then a large fine will have little or no impact on his ability to earn money as a truck driver and, therefore, on his family: s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act. It will affect his ability to continue to import kava and may, in that sense, act both as a punishment and a personal deterrent. 

Costs 

65The plaintiff submits that s 247 of the Act implies that costs should follow the event in a customs prosecution and that a successful party should not be deprived of a costs order unless there is material to justify a contrary order being made (Milne v A-G (TAS) (1956) 95 CLR 460 at 477). The Court accepts this submission. 

Orders 

66The Court makes the following orders: 

(1) The defendant is convicted of one (1) count of importing prohibited imports, in contravention of s 233(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901, namely 3,949 kilograms of pure weight kava 

(2) The defendant is convicted of one (1) count of causing a false statement to be made to an officer, in contravention of s 234(1)(d)(ii), or alternatively s 234(1)(d)(iv), of the Customs Act 1901 

(3) The Court imposes in aggregate a pecuniary penalty being: 


(i) A fine for Count 1 of $897,000; and 

(ii) A fine for Count 2 of $3,000 

(4) The defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of and incidental to the proceedings.

		09 March 2012",2012-03-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758808,Llavallol v R [2012] NSWCCA 29,"Judgment 

1BASTEN JA : The applicant, Mr Llavallol, was found by police on 5 May 2010 to be in possession of 3.21 grams of heroin, being a trafficable amount for the purposes of s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). He entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced by Freeman DCJ on 11 February 2011 to a non-parole period of one year and three months, with a balance of term of nine months, giving a full term of two years imprisonment. 

2On his application for leave to appeal, he asserted that the sentencing judge erred in two respects, namely in failing to: 

(a) apply the provisions of ss 16 and 17 of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008 (NSW), in respect of the discount for a plea of guilty, and 
(b) take into account the fact that the offence was capable of being dealt with in the Local Court. 

3I agree with the orders proposed by Schmidt J and, subject to what follows, with her reasoning in respect of the errors and the appropriate sentence. 

(a) Failure to specify discount for plea 
4The practice of allowing a ""discount"" for a plea of guilty, presumptively of 25% if entered at the earliest reasonable opportunity, has been accepted, at least since the commencement of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act ""), which provided for the court to impose ""a lesser penalty than it would otherwise have imposed"" in the case of a plea: s 22(1). The court retained a discretion in that regard, but if it declined to impose a lesser penalty it was required, without prejudice to any other requirement to state reasons, to indicate to the offender and make a record of its reasons for not so doing: s 22(2) and (3). The Court gave guidelines in that respect in R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. 

5When the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act commenced on 16 April 2008, it varied the existing requirements by specifying the amount of the discount to be given for a plea at any time before committal for sentence: s 17. Further, it expressly required the sentencing court to indicate to the offender and make a record of the penalty it would have imposed but for the plea: s 16(1). Although the Act had been in force for nearly three years at the time the applicant was sentenced, other cases in this Court referred to by Schmidt J, demonstrate that the present non-compliance is not a unique occurrence. That appears to reflect a degree of unfamiliarity with the legislation on the part of lawyers appearing for both the prosecution and the defence. One explanation may be that its operation is restricted to offences where the committal proceeding is to be heard in the Local Court sitting at the Downing Centre or at Central, in Sydney. Further, it was only originally provided to operate in respect of court attendance notices issued between 1 May 2008 and 1 May 2009: s 5. (That period was extended by regulation to 8 October 2011: Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Regulation 2008 (NSW), cl 6.) 

6In circumstances where neither party adverted to the statutory obligation and where there was no express compliance with it either by way of indication to the offender, or by way of record in the reasons for sentence, it should be inferred that the sentencing judge did not have the provision in mind when passing sentence. Further, there is no unequivocal basis for inferring that a 25% discount was given in this case. The trial judge stated in his judgment (p 2): 

""His plea of guilty was entered at the earliest opportunity and those facts are relied upon by Mr O'Brien who appears for the prisoner as evidence of his genuine acceptance of his guilt and remorse for his offending. I think there is force in that submission."" 

7What is missing in this passage is an express acceptance of the submission and of the consequence that a 25% discount should be provided. 

8There was little analysis in the course of the present application of the scheme for compulsory conferences, provided by Part 3 of the Act, their purpose in managing criminal proceedings or their relationship to the discounts for guilty pleas provided in Part 4. For present purposes, it is sufficient to conclude that the error has been established and that it is necessary for this Court to assess whether some other sentence is warranted in law, for the purposes of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3). 

(b) Relevance of proceeding in Local Court 
9The maximum penalties prescribed for a breach of s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act depend on whether the matter is disposed of summarily or on indictment. An offence may be disposed of summarily where the quantity of drug involved is less than the indictable quantity, being, in relation to heroin, 5.0 grams. In that event the relevant maximum period of imprisonment is two years. Although, in the present case, the amount of heroin was fractionally above the trafficable quantity (3.0 grams), being 3.21 grams, it was well below the indictable quantity. The matter could therefore have been dealt with in the Local Court: Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act , s 31(1)(c) and Sch 1, in relation to heroin. 

10The matter would not be dealt with summarily if the prosecution elected to proceed on indictment which, it may be assumed, it did in the present case. The basis for that decision of the prosecutor is not to be reviewed by the sentencing judge: however, he or she should consider whether the matter was one which, on the facts before the court, could properly have been disposed of in the Local Court and whether, therefore, the range of sentencing power available in the Local Court should be taken into account, although not limiting the jurisdiction of the District Court: R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [15]-[16] (Woods CJ at CL, Simpson J agreeing). 

11Although in the District Court the prosecutor tendered material which suggested the maximum penalty was two years, the basis for that calculation was not identified in the course of submissions in the District Court and, on sentencing, the judge made no reference to the possibility that the matter might properly have been dealt with in the Local Court. 

12On the basis of the circumstances of offending, as set out by Schmidt J, the prosecution may well have taken the view that this was a borderline case for disposal in the Local Court and therefore elected to have it dealt with in the District Court. However, for the reasons given by Schmidt J, I am satisfied that an appropriate sentence should not exceed the maximum jurisdiction of the Local Court and that the matter could have been properly disposed of in that Court. That view receives support from the sentencing statistics tendered by the applicant. 

13The sentence imposed in this case did not in fact exceed the jurisdiction of the Local Court but, it is at least arguable that, where the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act required that the Court indicate and make a record of ""the penalty it would have imposed but for the guilty plea"", that must be a penalty within its jurisdiction. On that approach, which was assumed to be correct on this application, the effective maximum sentence which the Local Court could have imposed, given the mandatory 25% discount for the plea, would have been 18 months imprisonment. Whether or not that approach is correct, and despite the fact that the District Court (and hence this Court) are not limited to the sentence which could have been imposed by the Local Court, I agree with Schmidt J that the appropriate sentence in this case was 18 months imprisonment, comprised of a non-parole period of 13 months with the balance of term being five months. 

14I agree with the orders proposed by Schmidt J. 

15RS HULME J : Basten JA and Schmidt J are of the opinion that the application for leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal allowed and the Applicant given a lower sentence than that imposed by Freeman DCJ. I disagree. 

16In particular do I disagree with the view that this matter could appropriately have been dealt with in the Local Court. At the time the Crown elected to have the matter dealt with in the District Court and at the time the Applicant was committed for trial, the evidence demonstrated as much and no more than that he was a drug dealer, walking the street in the vicinity of Kings Cross, possessed of 24 packaged drug deals weighing 3.51 grams and of a purity of 36.5%, $2,850 in cash which was presumably the proceeds of about 30 to 60 other such deals, and 2 mobile phones. He declined to be interviewed by police. Presumably the authorities also knew that he had no significant criminal record but given what they did know, it is perfectly understandable, and in my view the only appropriate course, that the Crown chose to proceed in the District Court on the drug supply charge. 

17A fortiori was this so when the Applicant was also facing, whether by way of charge or a Form 1, the further offence of dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime, an offence which, though almost certainly an incident of his drug dealing, was not connected with the offence of the deemed supply of the 3.51 grams so as to make any additional punishment inappropriate. 

18The happenstance that a street drug dealer has merely 3.51 grams of heroin on him at the time of his apprehension provides no grounds for concluding that a charge based on that possession should proceed in a court which has a 2 years limit on its sentencing power. While of course the fact that the power of the Local Court to deal with matters is defined by reference to weight means that weight is obviously relevant, to regard it as the determining factor in a decision whether to proceed summarily is contrary to the tenor of the remarks of the majority of the High Court in Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [67] - [73]. Rather should attention be given to an offender's criminality - R v Hanslow [2004] NSWCCA 163 at [21]; R v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [29] - criminality to which weight is but one relevant factor. 

19Nor do the Judicial Commission statistics to which the Court was taken persuade me otherwise. They contain no information as to whether or not the offenders reflected in them were active drug dealers or whether other offences were taken into account. 

20And lest it be thought that the matter has been overlooked, it is to be noted also that the evidence of what were found to be mitigating factors relied on before Freeman DCJ did not come into existence until, in part, the Pre-Sentence Report of 3 February 2011 and as to the balance later, when the Applicant entered the witness box on the day of sentence - long after the decision was made to proceed in the District Court. 

21While I agree with the other members of this Court that Freeman DCJ's silence on the topic leads to the view that he did not take into account the possibility that the Applicant could have been dealt with by the Local Court and, because that possibility was potentially relevant he should have done so, the remarks that I have made and the references to authority below indicate that that consideration was of no weight. 

22I agree with the other members of the Court that it should be inferred that Freeman DCJ overlooked the provisions of the Criminal Case Conferencing Act (2008) in his determination of the sentence to be imposed. 

23However, the fact that his Honour overlooked the provisions of that Act - an Act which, as Basten JA has pointed out, is restricted both in location and duration - provides no basis for inferring that his Honour also overlooked far more basic and well known sentencing principles reflected in s 21A(3)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (which includes as a mitigating circumstance that an offender has pleaded guilty and incorporates reference to a lesser sentence in consequence, and to which his Honour's attention was drawn in written submissions on sentence provided by the Crown), and in this Court's decision in R v Thompson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; 115 A Crim R 104. Freeman DCJ became a judge in 1986 and must have been referred to these matters hundreds of times. 

24In R v Thompson & Houlton Spigelman CJ, having said that the appropriate range for the discount for the utilitarian value of a plea should be in the range of 10 to 25%, continued at [155], "" The top of the range would be expected to be restricted to pleas at the earliest possible opportunity ..."". In his remarks on sentence in this case Freeman DCJ observed ""His (the Applicant's) plea of guilty was entered at the earliest opportunity and those facts are relied on by Mr O'Brien who appears for the Prisoner as evidence of his genuine acceptance of his guilt and remorse for his offending. I think there is force in that submission."" 

25Although the concluding portion of those remarks is directed to a different aspect of the plea, I find it impossible to accept that his Honour's reference to ""earliest opportunity"" was not an echo of the words used by Spigelman CJ, words that have become a standard expression in the field of sentencing. 

26Freeman DCJ did not in fact say expressly that he had allowed the Applicant any discount for the utilitarian value his plea, but given his Honour's experience and the elementary nature of any sentencing judge's obligation to allow such a discount, I see no basis for inferring that his Honour did not allow, not only a discount, but the 25% discount mandated by s 17 of the Criminal Case Conferencing Act. 

27Accordingly, though Freeman DCJ erred in both of the respects the subject of the grounds of appeal, I am unpersuaded that the errors had any effect on the sentence his Honour imposed. 

28But even if this view be wrong, there remains for consideration, s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which enjoins the Court to dismiss an appeal unless ""it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed"". 

29In R v Wong & Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420; (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 Spigelman CJ, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court referred to ""the exceptional threat to our society that is posed by large scale drug use"". In R v Markarian [2003] NSWCCA 8, with the agreement of the other members of the Court, I observed at [23]:- 

Much, if not most of the work of the courts is taken up with the consequences of the ravages drugs, particularly heroin, inflict on those who take it and, by them, on society. The survey of imprisoned burglars reported in ""The Stolen Goods Market in New South Wales"" conducted by the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research indicated a median expenditure by heroin users of $1,500 per week and the need to steal goods worth a number of times this amount to feed their habit. On average each such offender is thus costing the community through property losses and the like $200,000 per year. And that says nothing about the violence other offenders resort to, or the waste of life and degradation heroin inflicts on the lives of the tens of thousands of persons it comes to dominate. 

30In R v Khalad [2001] NSWCCA 169, Wood CJ at CL, sitting in a 2 judge bench, made an observation endorsed by all 3 judges in R v Giang [2005] NSWCCA 387:- 

(W)hat is important is to give full effect to the legislative policy that this section operate so as to provide strong deterrent to those who may be tempted to engage in an ongoing trade in heroin and, in particular, to deter those who are minded to stand in their shoes once they are apprehended and sentenced to imprisonment. This is necessary to combat the unfortunate reality that there seems to have been an almost endless supply of street sellers willing to move in once others of their ilk are taken off the streets. 

31His Honour was talking at the time of s 25A of the Misuse Drug and Trafficking Act but the last sentence I have quoted provides a strong, if not compelling argument for ensuring that sentences for street dealers provide a very substantial measure of deterrence. So do the other passages I have quoted. It is obvious that sentences imposed hitherto were not enough to deter the Applicant. 

32In evidence the Applicant conceded that he knew ""that heroin is an insidious drug. It really destroys your life"" and that ""in the two weeks that I spent dealing heroin every day I would kick myself and say look Esteban what are you doing, you know what the hell are you doing"". His criminality was deliberate. I find it impossible to regard the sentence imposed by Freeman DCJ as outside the legitimate exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion or to say that some other sentence should have been passed. 

33I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 

34SCHMIDT J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a sentence imposed upon him by Freeman DCJ on 11 February 2011. On 21 October 2010, the applicant entered a plea of guilty to a charge of supply a prohibited drug, heroin, (s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985). On sentencing, an offence of dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime, (s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900), was taken into account on a Form 1 (see s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years, with a non-parole period of 1 year, 3 months. He is eligible for parole on 10 May 2012. 

35The maximum penalty for the supply offence is a fine of 2,000 penalty units or imprisonment for a term of 15 years, or both. The traffickable quantity prescribed for heroin is 3 grams and the indictable quantity is 5 grams. This offence concerned 3.21 grams of heroin, analysed to have a purity of 36.5%. The maximum penalty for the proceeds of crime offence is 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both. 

Grounds 

36The grounds advanced were: 

""1. His Honour erred in failing to apply the provisions of the Criminal Case Conferencing Act. 

2. His Honour erred in failing to take into account that the offence was capable of being dealt with in the Local Court."" 


The sentencing Judgment 

37There was an agreed statement of facts in evidence to which his Honour referred. His Honour noted that the offender was the subject of a police surveillance operation. On 5 May 2010, when approached by police, he immediately disclosed that he was in possession of heroin. He was found to be in possession of a metal container containing, in total, 24 resealable bags containing heroin. 16 bags each contained 0.2 grams of heroin, (each identified to be a $100 deal) and 8 bags contained 0.1 grams of heroin, (each identified to be a $50 deal). The total weight of the heroin was 3.21 grams. The applicant was also found to be in possession of 2 mobile phones and a total of $2,950 cash, $2,000 of which was bundled into packages of $1,000 each, with the remaining sum loose. This amount was analysed to represent a number of deals ranging from 30 to 60. 

38His Honour found that while the applicant then declined to take part in a recorded interview, he later entered his plea in the Local Court, at the earliest opportunity. His Honour accepted that this evidenced the applicant's genuine acceptance of his guilt and remorse for his offending. 

39His Honour noted the then 40 year old applicant's subjective circumstances, which included that he had an Argentinean background; success at school, until he rebelled in his early teens, associated in his mind with his father's very strict discipline, with accompanying violence. He then commenced alcohol and marijuana use, before moving to heroin, to which he became addicted. His Honour noted the applicant's repeated efforts at abstinence and rehabilitation, and a pre-sentence report, which suggested that the applicant would benefit from entering a residential rehabilitation programme, to strengthen his resolve to abstain from drugs. This was supported by a psychologist's report. His Honour also noted that the applicant resisted a residential course, preferring to remain in the community to work and pursue his studies. 

40His Honour took the view that the applicant underestimated the risks associated with his attempted abstinence, given evidence of a transgression, but noted the encouraging steps which the applicant had taken. He also noted that the applicant had not previously been imprisoned and that his record led to the conclusion that there were special circumstances, justifying a variation in the statutory proportions, otherwise applicable to the sentence. 

41His Honour took the view that imposition of the bond urged for the applicant was not appropriate, given the significant supply in which the applicant had been involved, notwithstanding the applicant's justification that he had only supplied those already addicted and that he supplied a genuine product, not substitutes occasionally foisted on those desperate for drugs. His Honour referred to the approach of this Court in R v Clarke (Court of Criminal Appeal, 15 March 1990, unreported) and later cases, to notions of general deterrence and punishment for those involved in significant supply or trafficking of drugs. He took the view that supply by a user not solely for the purpose of financial gain, did not operate as an excuse, but may remove the offence from the worst class. 

42His Honour took the Form 1 offence into account in the sentence imposed. 

The evidence 

43The offender gave evidence. He said that he had grown up in a very violent household, but he had done well academically and socially as a child, until he started rebelling at about age 14, when he began experimenting with alcohol and marijuana, which he came to smoke habitually. He travelled overseas after completing high school and later worked in graphic design, publishing and advertising. At age 25, he began experimenting with heroin, while studying at university and working full-time. He became addicted, but later undertook detox, with support from some of his family members. He moved home and was involved in two car accidents, the second while recovering from the first. The result was an argument with his father, after which he left home and again began using heroin. 

44The applicant married in 2006 and again went through a programme to assist him to get off heroin. He succeeded and was able to obtain work and sustain a fulfilling life, until he was made redundant. He then decided to retrain as a teacher, but didn't succeed. He became depressed and took up heroin again, eventually beginning to sell the drug to satisfy his habit. The result was the destruction of his relationship with his wife. 

45The applicant explained that: 

""The people that I was selling to were people that I've known for many years and we would often help each other out in the search for heroin and the way that I could justify it is that at least if me giving them heroin they are getting heroin as opposed to being ripped off and at the same time I could sustain my addiction; 

46The applicant said that he had dealt only for two weeks and that even then he thought that what he was doing was 'ridiculous'. When giving his evidence, he was living with his mother, taking help from a psychologist, undergoing regular urine tests and seeking to live a full, fulfilling life without heroin. On the cusp of turning 40 he had succumbed again once, but since then had not relapsed again. He was working as labourer six days a week, and planned to continue counselling and to pursue further studies in film. In cross-examination, the applicant explained that he would prefer not to take up residential rehabilitation, preferring to work and study and bettering himself in that fashion, even though his psychologist had recommended residential rehabilitation. 

Ground 2 - His Honour erred in failing to take into account that the offence was capable of being dealt with in the Local Court 

47It is convenient to commence with Ground 2. By s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act a person found in possession of not less than the traffickable quantity of a prohibited drug, is deemed to have the prohibited drug in his or her possession for supply. It was common ground that the quantity of heroin involved in this offence, 3.21 grams, was more than the traffickable quantity, but less than the indictable quantity (5 grams) and that accordingly, the offence was capable of being dealt with in the Local Court, unless there was an election made (see s 31 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and s 260 of the Criminal Procedure Act ). In the Local Court the maximum penalty which could have been imposed was 2 years (s 31(3) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and s 267 of the Criminal Procedure Act ). It was common ground that these were all matters not drawn to his Honour's attention. 

48Indeed, his Honour was seemingly misled by the parties. The Crown's sentence bundle incorrectly referred to a maximum penalty of 2 years for the offence. When his Honour enquired about authorities where higher penalties had been imposed, the Crown drew attention to the maximum penalty for the offence of 15 years, but made no reference to the 2 year jurisdictional limit, if such an offence was dealt with in the Local Court. 

49Nor was there any explanation given as to why the charge had been pursued in the District Court. Further, the applicant's solicitor later incorrectly described the amount of heroin involved as 'just over the indictable quantity'. That quantity is 5 grams. That error was not corrected by the Crown. In the result, the sentence imposed by his Honour was the maximum penalty available, had the matter proceeded before the Local Court. 

50In R v Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349 it was observed by Hall J: 

""14 In dealing with ground 1, it is appropriate to make two preliminary observations:- 

(a) there is no specific statutory requirement or obligation to bring into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the fact that a matter may have been dealt with summarily had no election otherwise been made; 

(b) as the Crown, however, has observed, to the extent that the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 otherwise obliges a sentencing judge to have regard to the general law in determining the appropriate sentences (s.21A(1)), then a number of propositions may be taken from several judgments of this Court. 

15 The written submissions on behalf of the applicant and those also on behalf of the respondent refer to a number of decisions of this Court. For the purposes of this application, they are stated in short form as a series of propositions or principles as follows:- 

(a) The first is that a judge in the District Court is not bound by the jurisdictional limit imposed on the Local Court when dealing with an offence on indictment which was capable of summary disposal, but may have regard to that limit when the case is one which could appropriately have been disposed of in the Local Court: Regina v. Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [16]; Regina v. LPY (2002) 136 A. Crim. R. 237 at 240 and Regina v. El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [30]. 

(b) Secondly, the fact that a matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court, had the prosecuting authority not elected otherwise, remains a relevant consideration in the exercise of the discretion reserved to the sentencing judge: Crombie (supra) at [15]. 

(c) Thirdly, however, the relevant decisions that establish that principle do not go so far as to require the sentencing judge to proceed upon the basis that the maximum available sentence is that which could have been imposed in the Local Court. At most they establish that the circumstance identified is to be taken into account. Depending upon the objective and the subjective criminality of the offender, it may properly be regarded as calling for some mitigation of the sentence that would otherwise be imposed in the District Court for an offence prosecuted upon indictment. Where it appears that that circumstance has been entirely overlooked by the sentencing judge, it may properly justify the granting of leave to appeal: Crombie (supra) at [16]. 

(d) Fourthly, the significance of the loss of the chance of the matter being dealt with in the Local Court varies from case to case. In some cases it would contribute to mitigation of sentence. It is a matter to be taken into account, but is not a universal factor for the reduction of sentence: Regina v. Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115. 

(e) Fifthly, the failure by a sentencing judge to mention the matter in his or her remarks on sentence and the length of the sentence does not necessarily establish that the sentencing judge failed to have regard to the matter. In some circumstances the length of the sentence may not suggest that the matter was overlooked: Regina v. Depoma [2003] NSWCCA 382 at [17]. 

(f) Finally, in circumstances where a sentencing judge has made no reference to the summary disposal argument in his or her remarks on sentence, it is necessary to consider whether that omission is indicative of error. One way of testing that proposition is to consider whether the sentence itself appears manifestly excessive in all the circumstances of the case - if the factor had been taken into account and given appropriate weight, a substantially lesser sentence was appropriate in the case: El Masri (supra) at [45] per Johnson, J. (with whom Hunt, AJA. and Hulme, J. agreed)."" 


51In Bonwick v R [2010] NSWCCA 177 after referring to these principles, it was observed by Davies J: 
""42 This distillation of the principles has been followed more recently in Ciaron McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94 at [25] and in Collins v R [2010] NSWCCA 13 at [16]. 
43 Whilst it is clear that there is no obligation on the sentencing Judge to regard himself or herself limited by the maximum penalty available in the Local Court, two relevantly important principles emerge from the cases. The first is that the extent of the criminality is an important consideration in having regard to the Local Court penalty: R v Hanslow [2004] NSWCCA 163 at [21]; Regina v Said El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [29] and McCullough at [26]. Secondly, where it appears that the matter of the Local Court penalty has been entirely overlooked by the sentencing Judge that may properly justify the grant of leave to appeal: R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [16]. 
44 In the present case, it is likely that the matter was entirely overlooked by the sentencing Judge because it is accepted that neither counsel drew it to the Judge's attention. Further support for that inference derives from the omission of the sentencing Judge to make any reference to the fact that the offences could have been dealt with by the Local Court and from the length of the sentence imposed for each of the offences. 
45 This failure to refer to the Local Court limitation on sentence amounts to an error justifying the intervention of this Court. This is because, as the highlighted passages in Palmer make clear, the fact that the Local Court could have dealt with the matter is a relevant consideration to be taken into account."" 


52In R v Kean [2011] NSWCCA 136 at [37] a similar oversight occurred. There Adams J observed that the fact that the charge could have been dealt with in the Local Court 'in the normal course, is a matter of significance. Here, the fact that this issue was not raised by counsel and not referred to by the sentencing judge persuades me that it was overlooked. Nevertheless, it was concluded that in the circumstances of that case, the jurisdiction of the Local Court was inadequate; that that court was an inappropriate forum for the offence in question; and that the possibility that it could have been dealt within the Local Court, was ultimately a matter of no weight (see at [40] and [16] per Hulme J.) 

53In this case, while the Crown accepted that the fact that the charge could have been dealt with in the Local Court was relevant to the sentencing exercises and that it was arguable that it had been overlooked, it was contended that, given the applicant's criminality, his offence was too serious to have been dealt with in the Local Court. This was explained to be because while the quantity of heroin involved was not great, the purity of the heroin was high and it was packaged in such a way, as to make it clear that it was going to be sold at street level, in a significant number of deals. The applicant's evidence had also revealed that this was not an isolated occasion of supply, but that he had been engaged in trafficking for some time. In those circumstances, it was submitted that the matter could not have been appropriately disposed of in the Local Court. 

54None of these were matters addressed by the parties below. Nor were they mentioned by his Honour, who not only did not consider them, but who was incorrectly informed that the indictable quantity of heroin was 3 grams. 

55In the circumstances, it seems to me that it must be accepted that the fact that this offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court, was a matter which ought to have been drawn to his Honour's attention as a relevant consideration in the sentencing exercise. It was plainly overlooked by the parties, who incorrectly left the matter before his Honour on the basis that the quantity involved was the indictable quantity. This is a situation entirely akin to that considered in Bonwick v R, with the result that this ground of appeal must also be upheld in this case. 

56He pleaded guilty to the offence with which he was charged, an offence which could clearly have been dealt with by the Local Court, notwithstanding the purity of the heroin involved. The applicant was a street level dealer, found in possession 3.21 grams of heroin, packaged ready to be dealt, albeit by operation of s 29 he was in any event deemed to be involved in the supply of that amount of heroin, it being more than a traffickable quantity. That is at the lower end of the range of offences of this kind, as the Crown conceded. 

57The drug charge offence does not concern the cash with which the applicant was found, which is the subject of the separate Form 1 offence. As to that, the applicant's oral evidence was that he had been engaged in selling heroin for a period of 2 weeks, which explains the cash with which he was found on arrest, suggestive of the sale of 30-60 other deals. 

58The applicant said that at that time he was conscious of the wrongness of what he was doing and that he was then taking active steps to address his addiction, with the assistance of a psychologist. Toxicological reports suggested that he had been relatively successful in that endeavour, with the exception of one incident of relapse. 


59The result of his Honour's approach was a head sentence of 2 years, the maximum available sentence in the Local Court, perhaps after a discount of 25% for the applicant's early plea, as I will explain in relation to Ground 1. The sentencing statistics to which reference was made showed that only 2 offenders of the 384 dealt with in the Local Court received a 2 year sentence. It seems to me, in all the circumstances, that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive, given the objective seriousness of the offence to which the applicant entered his plea and the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors I have mentioned, which arose to be considered. 

60In my view this ground of appeal was made out. 

Ground 1 - Failing to apply the provisions of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008 

61There is no issue that the applicable provisions of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008 were not drawn to his Honour's attention. They entitled the applicant to a 25% discount for his guilty plea. Sections 16 and 17 provide: 

""16 Sentencing for certain indictable offences taking into account guilty plea 
(1) In passing sentence for an indictable offence on an offender who has pleaded guilty, a sentencing court: 
(a) must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the penalty it would have imposed but for the guilty plea, and 
(b) must allow a discount on the sentence for the guilty plea in accordance with section 17 (1) and may allow a discount in accordance with section 17 (2) or (4). 
(2) A discount for a guilty plea, in relation to an offence, means a discount for: 
(a) the saving in resources and time that would otherwise be expended in a trial for the offence but for the guilty plea, and 
(b) the avoidance of the additional trauma to the victim that might be caused by a trial for the offence, and 
(c) the contrition that the sentencing court considers that the offender demonstrates by pleading guilty, and 
(d) any other benefit associated with or demonstrated by the guilty plea. 
(3) Despite subsection (1), a sentencing court must not allow any discount for a guilty plea in the case of a sentence of life imprisonment. 
(4) This section does not apply to an offence excluded from the application of this section by section 18. 
(5) Subsection (1) (a) does not limit any other requirement that a court has, apart from that paragraph, to record the reasons for its decisions. 

17 Discount for guilty plea 
(1) If an offender pleaded guilty to an offence at any time before being committed for sentence, the sentencing court must allow a discount for the guilty plea calculated as follows: 
(a) if the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for a term-a term that is 25% less than the term the court would otherwise have imposed, 
(b) if the court imposes a fine-a fine that is 25% less than the fine the court would otherwise have imposed, 
(c) if the court makes a community service order directing the performance of community service work for a specified number of hours-work for 25% less than the number of hours the court would otherwise have ordered to be performed, 
(d) if the court imposes a good behaviour bond for a term-a bond for 25% less than the term the court would otherwise have imposed."" 



62In Do v R [2010] NSWCCA 182 a similar error occurred. There the Crown conceded that a material error had occurred, with the result that the sentences had to be quashed and the applicant re-sentenced (at [10]). There was a similar error dealt with on the same basis in Tran v R [2010] NSWCCA 183 and Greer v R [2011] NSWCCA 40. In LJ v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 289 it was held in respect of a similar error that: 

""30 The failure to apply the mandated discount is an error of such materiality as to justify the Court's intervention, having regard to the terms of s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. I am satisfied that ""some other sentence...is warranted in law and should have been passed."" The applicant is to be re-sentenced."" 


63In this case the Crown took a different position, submitting that even though his Honour did not expressly identify that he had given any discount for the applicant's early plea, he did refer to the plea having been entered at the earliest opportunity in the District Court. It was argued that as an experienced judge his Honour would have been aware that the applicant was entitled to a discount, either under the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act , or pursuant to the approach in R v Thompson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. A mere failure to expressly state that the discount had been given and to identify its quantum, did not necessarily mean that the required discount had not been granted. 

64The Crown submitted, that the sentence imposed itself suggests that the applicable discount was given, his Honour having adopted a starting point of 2 years, 8 months with a non-parole period of 20 months, discounted by 25% to arrive at the sentence imposed. In that event, it followed, on the Crown's approach, that the failure to comply with the requirements of s 16 was merely an error of process, which would not lead to the sentence being set aside as erroneous. 

65In my view it is not possible to say with certainty whether his Honour applied a discount to the sentence imposed, although that appears to have been likely, given that the sentence was imposed after his Honour had noted the early plea. His Honour's judgment otherwise shed no light on that question. It follows that, at the least, there is no issue that his Honour erred in not complying with the requirements of s16. 

66That is a proper basis for upholding this ground of appeal. On re-sentencing the applicant is entitled to a 25% discount. 

Re-sentencing 

67Sentencing requires consideration to be given to the objective seriousness of the offence. T here is no question that the applicant was engaged in trafficking, as he admitted. The offence to which the plea was entered involved 3.21 grams of heroin, packaged ready for supply. It was plainly a serious offence involving street level dealing. Since arrest, the applicant was making efforts to deal with his own addiction. On his own evidence, however, the applicant had recognised the wrongness of his offending, which continued nevertheless until his arrest. He entered a plea at the earliest opportunity. It must be accepted that this conduct was consistent with genuine remorse. 

68On the evidence there is a need for both general and specific deterrence to feature in the sentence imposed. The circumstances are such that a custodial sentence is necessary, as has been repeatedly discussed in the authorities in which reference has been made to what was said by Hunt J in R v Clark : 

"" This Court has, on occasions too numerous to mention, emphasised that sentences involving a substantial general deterrent are to be impose on drug traffickers, and it has indicated that only in exceptional circumstances will a non-custodial sentence be appropriate. 

That statement is not, as has been suggested, restricted to those cases in which it has been demonstrated that a profit has been obtained. What the statement is principally directed to is the trafficking, the dissemination of drugs to others. The position is worse when there has been a profitable commercial exploitation, but trafficking alone in any substantial degree should normally lead to a custodial sentence."" (Emphasis in the original) 


69There is no question that the supply in which the applicant engaged was for profit, as the applicant admitted in his evidence. His addiction is not a mitigating factor (see R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346.) Nevertheless, it is a factor relevant to assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, (see R v Liang (Court of Criminal Appeal, 2 June 1995, unreported); R v Ramos (2000) 112 A Crim R 339; R v Kalache (2000) 111 A Crim R 152; Nguyen v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 15). 

70That the quantity of heroin involved in the offence for which the applicant fell to be sentenced fell within the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court is also a relevant matter to be considered in fixing the sentence. The applicant's subjective circumstances must also be considered. They include the matters dealt with in his Honour's judgment, to which I have referred. Apart from certain driving offences, the applicant has no record and this is his first time in custody. The applicant's remorse and desire for rehabilitation must be accepted as sincere as his Honour found. His attitude to the value of assistance in his efforts at rehabilitation is something which he needs to reconsider, as his Honour observed. This, too, requires consideration in determining sentence. 

71The pre-sentence report referred to the applicant having a daily habit 18 months prior to arrest, spending $100 to $200 per day, but with employment and after arrest, successful abstention for 3 months, with one relapse during attendance for drug and alcohol counselling. The applicant explained missed attendances in his evidence. Concerns as to ambivalence to addressing causal factors relating to his offending behaviour and the refusal to consider residential rehabilitation resulted, however, in the applicant being assessed as not appropriate for supervision, having been assed as medium/low risk of re-offending and also unsuitable for a community service order, given his unresolved drug issues (s 86(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). Despite this view and the advice of his psychologist, in his evidence the applicant persisted in his view that he would not pursue residential rehabilitation. 

72The Form I offence must also be taken into account on sentence. The maximum penalty for this offence was 2 years imprisonment. It must result in an increase in the penalty that would otherwise be imposed, reflecting as it does the proceeds of further supply offences which the applicant admitted (see Re Attorney-General's Application under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at [42]). 

73The applicant is entitled to a 25% discount. But for his early plea the sentence I would impose is 2 years. With discount it is 18 months. His Honour found special circumstances. In the result I would impose a non-parole period of 13 months and a balance of term of 5 months. The applicant would be released to supervised parole as from 10 March 2012 and the balance of his term would expire on 10 August 2012. 

Proposed orders 

74I propose the following orders: 

1. Leave to appeal is granted. 

2. The appeal is upheld. 

3. The sentence is quashed and in lieu the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 13 months commencing on 11 February 2011 and expiring on 10 March 2012 with a balance of term of 5 months expiring on 10 August 2012. 

4. Direct that the applicant be released on parole subject to the standard conditions.

		09 March 2012",2012-03-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758811,R v Newbury [2012] NSWSC 34,"Judgment 

1Wayne Newbury (""the Accused"") is charged with one count of murder contrary to s 18(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 in relation to the death of Ross Andrew Tekampe (""the Deceased"") on 3 August 2010 at Kanwal. 

2The question of fitness of the Accused to be tried having been raised, on 6 February 2012 I conducted an enquiry under the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 as to whether the Accused was unfit to be tried for the offence of murder. 

The criminal case 

3At the time of his death the Deceased resided with the Accused at 9 Phyllis Avenue, Kanwal. The Deceased and the Accused were friends, having met each other in gaol at some stage. 

4The Crown case statement, which was tendered without opposition from those acting for the Accused, indicated that the Accused had a history of mental illness including schizophrenia. The Deceased was living with the Accused as the Accused's carer pursuant to a casual arrangement entered into with the Accused's mother. The Accused's mother provided the house (which was in the name of the family trust) and, in exchange, the Deceased was required to buy groceries, pay household bills and generally care for the Accused, including giving him his medication. 

5At 5.45am on 3 August 2010, the Deceased rang 000 asking for help. He said that he was at 9 Phyllis Avenue and had been stabbed. He told the 000 operator that the person who had stabbed him was the Accused. 

6The police and ambulance were dispatched. They arrived shortly after 6am and found the Deceased dead. He was lying on the front porch with the phone by his side, a trail of blood leading from inside the house. 

7At around the same time, a resident of 25 Phyllis Avenue called the police as a man was banging on the resident's window shouting ""mum"". This man was the Accused. The police found him at that house and arrested him. 

8The knife, allegedly used to kill the Deceased, was found in a stormwater drain outside 43 Phyllis Avenue. DNA matching the Deceased's was found on the blade of this knife. A resident of Phyllis Avenue saw a man standing near a stormwater drain outside 43 Phyllis Avenue shortly before 6:00am on the day of the Deceased's death. 
9The next day, having heard that the murder weapon was missing, this resident looked into the drain and saw a knife there. Police recovered the knife. It was identical to another knife found in the sink of 9 Phyllis Avenue. 

10The Accused had blood on his clothes when he was arrested. DNA extracted from the blood matched the Deceased's DNA. 

11A number of residents of Phyllis Avenue heard two males yelling beginning from about 5:33am. Some of them heard one of the males yell ""help"", and one of those residents knew that it was the voice of the Deceased calling out. 

Cause of death 

12The autopsy was conducted by Senior Forensic Pathologist Dr Samarasinghe at the Newcastle Department of Forensic Medicine on 4 August 2010. 

13He concluded that the Deceased died from a stab injury of the chest. The fatal injury was on the left side of the chest and had penetrated the left lung and a major branch of the pulmonary artery, resulting in internal haemorrhage. The stab injury track had a total depth of approximately 11 -15 cm. The mechanism of death would have been acute cardiorespiratory failure and hypovolemic shock. 

14In Dr Samrasinghe's view the degree of force used to inflict the injury was severe. 

15In addition to the fatal stab wound, the Deceased suffered a total of 12 other stab injuries. The injuries had serrated-like patterns on them, consistent with having been inflicted by a serrated knife. One of the wounds went through the face with a total depth of 8cm. There were five wounds on the Deceased's left hand, consistent with their characterisation as defence wounds. 

The legal test 

16The legal test on which unfitness is to be judged is not in doubt. It is to be found in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48, approved in Ngatayi v R (1980) 147 CLR 1 at 8 and Kesavarajah v R (1994) 181 CLR 230 at 246. 

17In Robinson v R ([2008] NSWCCA 64 RS Hulme J conveniently tabulated the criteria where he said at [24]: 

A person accused needs to be able: 

(i) to understand what it is that he is charged with; 

(ii) to plead to the charge; 

(iii) to exercise his right of challenge; 

(iv) to understand generally the nature of the proceedings, namely, that it is an enquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with; 

(v) to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all of the various court formalities; 

(vi) to understand ... the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; 

(vii) to make his defence or answer to the charge. 

The psychiatric evidence 

18The Accused was examined by Professor David Greenberg for the Crown on 22 December 2010 and again on 19 October 2011. Professor Greenberg had previously examined the Accused on both 27 July 2002 and 21 November 2002 at the Long Bay Prison Complex when he provided a psychiatric report for a magistrate at Wyong Local Court. 
19In his first report for the purpose of this present enquiry Professor Greenberg helpfully extracted portions of his 2002 reports. Those reports provide useful background, and clearly show that in 2002 the Accused was diagnosed with chronic schizophrenic disorder and poly-substance abuse. He was found in 2002 to suffer from personality problems and was assessed to be borderline to dull/normal intelligence. 

20In those 2002 reports Professor Greenberg noted that the Accused told him that he had been abusing cannabis since the age of 16 years and had experimented with amphetamines and heroin. As a younger child he had experimented with inhalants such as sniffing petrol. At that time he denied any alcohol abuse. That denial cannot be accepted given information in other reports. 

21Professor Greenberg noted in 2002 that the Accused had a history of chronic schizophrenia dating back to 1986. There had by 2002 been multiple admissions to psychiatric units as well as a number of attendances at out-patients departments of various hospitals in the Central Coast and Newcastle areas. 

22At the time of Professor Greenberg's examination in December 2010 the Accused was scheduled under the Mental Health Act 2007 and was being detained at G Ward at Long Bay Prison Hospital. He was then refusing his oral anti-psychotic medication. He was overtly psychotic and formally thought-disordered. Professor Greenberg said he was unable to complete a comprehensive psychiatric assessment because of this disordered mental state. The Accused was rambling and incoherent. He could not respond to questions in a meaningful manner and he laughed inappropriately to himself. 

23Professor Greenberg assessed the Accused with regard to the legal test earlier referred to from R v Presser and Kesavarajah v R. Professor Greenberg said: 

I assessed Mr Newbury with regard to Presse r (1958) VR 45 at 48 and Keseavarajah vs R (1994) 123 ALR 463 criteria. 

Mr Newbury has no understanding [of] the nature of the charges he is currently facing. When asked about how he planned to plead to the charge, he answered in a rambling incoherent response. His mood was labile and irritable. He laughed inappropriately to himself. He did not understand his right to challenge the jurors. I am of the view that he would not understand the general nature of the proceedings that it is an inquiry into the veracity of allegations against him. Because of his current persistent psychotic illness and the lability of his mood, Mr Newbury is currently unable to understand the nature of the proceedings at this time. I am of the view that he would not understand the course of the proceedings and the functions of the officers in court. I asked him about the role of his legal representative and he was unable to make an understandable response. When asked about the role of the Judge, the role of the jury, [how] many jurors there were and how they were selected, his responses were incoherent and thought disordered. At this time, given his acute psychotic state and impaired cognition, I am of the opinion that he would have difficulty appreciating the substantial effect of the evidence. At this time I am of the view that he cannot decide on what defence he should make and even with counsel he cannot at this time instruct his counsel and communicate his version of the facts. I am also of the view that he would be unable to give evidence given his current mental state. 

Mr Newbury suffers from a chronic severe psychotic mental illness and remains psychotic at this time. I am therefore of the view that on the balance of probability Mr Newbury is currently unfit to stand trial at this time. 

24When Professor Greenberg came to examine the Accused on 19 October 2011 he had available further material including medical records from Central Coast Medical Services. This material discloses two things that should be noted. The first concerned alcohol abuse by the Accused on a number of occasions resulting in him being taken to Gosford Hospital by the police. Secondly, the records from Gosford and Wyong Hospitals disclosed that from time to time he experienced hallucinations. 

25At his examination on 19 October 2011 Professor Greenberg was able to engage the Accused to some extent about the offence charged. The account the Accused gave, however, was not a coherent account of himself during the time period surrounding the alleged offence. He gave inconsistent answers saying at one point that he had not stabbed the Deceased, but at a later point saying that he had stabbed him to defend himself and his family. When asked about the knife used to stab the victim the Accused said he had never had a knife. When asked who the Accused thought had stabbed the Deceased he said that no one had. 

26Professor Greenberg again assessed him in accordance with the appropriate legal test. He reported as follows about that: 

Mr Newbury understood the nature of the charges he is presently facing. He did not understand the defence of mental illness, stating that he was ""Section 32"". He did however, in rudimentary terms, understand the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. He understood that his lawyer represented him but when asked about the role of the Crown, he stated ""a lady"" then paused; he then mumbled incoherently to himself. He did not understand the role of the Judge or jury. He did understand that he was the Accused and that witnesses give ""information"". I asked about the purpose of attending his current Court case and he stated that he was ""not murder"" and that he was ""not manslaughter"". He did not understand the role of the jury or his right to challenge the jurors. When asked about the nature of an oath, he stated, ""A Bible put in my hand on the Bible and swear no murder and no manslaughter"". He did not understand the concept of perjury even after I explained the concept in rudimentary terms. As stated, Mr Newbury could not give his version of the facts. In my opinion he would not able to give instructions or give evidence in Court at the current time. In my opinion Mr Newbury would not understand the substantial effect of evidence given in Court. 

Mr Newbury suffers from a chronic severe schizophrenic mental illness and remains impaired in his capacity to understand the various Presser criteria at this time. I am therefore of the view that on the balance of probability Mr Newbury is currently unfit to plead or stand trial at this time. 

27Dr Nielssen interviewed the Accused on August 2011 at the behest of Legal Aid. 

28Dr Nielssen was able to engage to a limited extent with the Accused about the circumstances of the Deceased's death. However, the answers provided by the Accused would have to be regarded as delusional. He said he intended to enter a plea of not guilty on the grounds that he was acting in self defence and also because the Deceased did not die in the house as alleged. Rather, he said, the Deceased was ""shot in the heart"" in Wing 13 of the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre. He said there were no fingerprints or other evidence to show he had caused the Deceased's death, and he denied having blood on his clothes at the time of his arrest. 

29Dr Nielssen had a similar difficulty to Professor Greenberg when interviewing the Accused because of what he described as a significant speech impediment that appeared to be of neurological origin, as well as the effects of an underlying schizophrenic illness which affected the Accused's capacity to communicate in a coherent or rational way. Indeed, before Dr Nielssen had finished asking what he wished to ask the Accused terminated the interview. 

30Fortunately, however, Dr Nielssen had assessed him at that stage by reference to the appropriate legal test. In that regard Dr Nielssen reported as follows: 

When taken to his understanding of the charges and the procedure followed in courts Mr Newbury said that he had some previous experience of going to court, but said that he had not been in prison since a period of between three and six months on remand in 1986. He was able to name the charge as murder, but was unclear as to how he would plead, because he initially said self defence, but then said that he did not cause his death and later agreed that he would raise his mental illness in his defence. 

He was able to name his solicitor, but did not know if a barrister had been appointed in his case. He said that a prosecutor ""says you're guilty"" and said that a judge ""hears the case ... if the jury says not guilty or self defence he lets you go"". He said that he thought a jury had ten or twelve people who he said were taken ""nationwide from various spots ... the Governor of the gaol can pick them"". When asked about the role of a witness he said ""he or she says what they know"" and that an oath was ""to say on the Bible not guilty"". He said that he did not know about his right to challenge jurors who might be against him, although he said ""it was never discussed"". 

31Dr Nielssen's conclusion about his fitness for trial was this: 

Mr Newbury was assessed to be unfit for trial because he is unable to provide rational or reliable instructions over the course of the proceedings. Moreover, his instructions that he was acting in self-defence appears to be based on a bizarre delusional belief. There is some chance that he will become fit for trial within the next twelve months if he were to receive treatment with treatment with an adequate dose of clozapine, although he has been receiving psychiatric care in a hospital setting for the best part of a year and remains quite unwell. 

32A report prepared for the Mental Health Review Tribunal by Dr Eugene Ho, a Psychiatric Registrar was also made available to me. Dr Ho's report was based on interviews with the Accused and a perusal of various records. That report merely confirms the diagnosis of schizophrenia and poly-substance abuse. Dr Ho was of the opinion when he examined the Accused on 21 October 2011 that he remained a mentally ill person as defined by the Mental Health Act 2007. 

33I also received an affidavit from the Accused's solicitor, Ms Amanda Coultas-Roberts. She has been practising in criminal law for over 20 years and she has acted for the Accused since June 2011. She has visited him a number of times. On these occasions she has found him very difficult to understand because of his significant speech impediment. She said that he seemed to understand that he had been charged with the murder but he also expressed the belief he had imparted to Dr Nielssen that the Deceased was shot in gaol and he, the Accused, was being set up. 

34When Ms Coultas-Roberts last saw him on 11 January 2011 she went through the very basics of the Crown case against him. She said that his responses indicated to her that he did not have the ability to understand in any meaningful way the Crown case or respond to it. 

35She said that his attention span was always extremely short and on that occasion, as on all previous occasions, he quickly decided it was time to leave the interview room before the conclusion of the interview. 



Conclusion 

36In forming my opinion and making my determination on the question of the fitness of the Accused I have had regard to the principles in R v Presser and the other cases to which I have referred. In the light of the opinions expressed concerning the Accused by Dr Nielssen and Professor Greenberg following their examinations of him, and assisted also by the observations and opinion of Ms Coultas-Roberts, I find on the balance of probabilities that the Accused is unfit to be tried for the offence with which he stands charged. 

37In those circumstances I make the following orders: 

1. I find that the Accused Wayne Patrick Newbury is unfit to be tried for the offence of the murder of Ross Andrew Tekampe on 3 August 2010. 

2. In accordance with s 14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I refer this matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 

3. Pursuant to s 14(b)(iii) of that Act, I remand the Accused in custody pending the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal under s 16 of that Act. 

4. I direct the Court Registry to provide the following documentation to the Tribunal: 

(a) A copy of this finding. 
(b) A copy of any orders made for detention or bail. 
(c) A transcript of these proceedings. 
d) A copy of any psychiatric reports tendered to the Court during these proceedings. 
(e) A copy of any additional reports tendered as evidence to the Court pertaining to the person's fitness to stand trial, and 
(f) The Crown Case Statement.

		09 March 2012",2012-03-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758816,R v Hogden [2012] NSWSC 24,"Judgment 

1On 21 April 2011 Debbra Hogden (""the Offender"") pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to murder in the Parramatta Local Court. She was then arraigned before this Court on 3 June 2011 where she pleaded guilty to the indictment presented against her for that offence. The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment. 

2I am also asked to take into account a Form 1 matter of larceny from Woolworths of food products worth $72.70. 



Facts 

3The following facts are taken from the Statement of Facts prepared by the Crown and agreed by the Offender. 

4The Deceased Kristi McDougall was a supplier of drugs, mainly crystal methylamphetamine (commonly known as 'ice') and also cannabis at street level quantities. The Offender and the person accused of her murder, Robert Best, were customers and friends of the Deceased. 

5During 2010, Best and the Offender were involved in a sexual relationship which developed after the Offender's boyfriend, Mario Vasquez, went into custody in early 2010. The Offender resided between her unit at 2/249 Kissing Point Road, Dundas, and Best's unit at 15/195 Spurway Street, Dundas. Despite having different street addresses those units were within the same complex and were approximately 30 metres apart. 

6On the night of 18 June and into the early hours of the morning of 19 June 2010 the Offender and Best spent time together at the Ermington Hotel. Whilst at the Hotel they spoke with the Deceased. The Offender and Best returned to Best's apartment at about 4am on 19 June. 

7The Offender said that when she woke later on 19 June 2010 she noticed she had menstruated and bled through her clothing and onto the bed sheets. The Offender returned to her unit and showered. She realised that she didn't have any tampons. 

8She rang the Deceased and asked if she could bring her some tampons. During their conversation the Offender said that the Deceased told her she was going to supply ""ice"" to Best later that day. Call charge records reveal the Offender, Best and the Deceased had significant contact with each other on 19 June 2010. 

9The Deceased came to the Offender's unit at approximately 2:00pm and gave her a tampon. The Offender said they then walked to Best's unit. When Best heard them approaching he called out for them to enter. The Deceased entered the unit first followed by the Offender. 

10The Offender said Best came from behind the Deceased and choked her with a thin rope by pulling it tightly around her neck. The Offender said she tried to escape from the unit but found the door was deadlocked. She saw the Deceased trying to free herself from Best. The Offender said she kicked Best so he would release his grip on the Deceased. The Offender said: 

I actually got scratched, he got bit, she bit him, he's got bite marks on his hand where she bit him, she fought, she fought she fought so well and I couldn't help her. Yelling didn't get me anywhere and I couldn't open the doors. It was all so friggin' quick and he's grabbn' me and kickin' me pulling my hair, hell I panicked...I was kicking him and hitting him trying to stop him...I don't know why I wasn't stronger. I know I was in shock ...I'm so disappointed"". "" 

11Best said to her ""she (the Offender) would be next"". The Offender screamed at Best to stop. The Offender said the Deceased was trying to scream. While Best was choking the Deceased he said ""that's for the children"". Police investigations confirm Best had been prevented by the Family Court from seeing his two young children. The Crown case is that Best blamed the custody dispute on the Deceased because she had been in contact with his ex-wife and had told her about his drug use. Call charge records confirm the Deceased had been in contact with Best's ex-wife. 

12The Offender said that during the attack a person called Robert Murley knocked on the unit door. Best told the Offender to answer the door and 'act normal'. She saw that Best had a walking stick with a knife protruding from the end. The Offender said Best was holding the Deceased behind the door who at that stage she believed to be unconscious. The Offender told Mr Murley the reason for the noise was because they (she and Best) were ""just having a bit of fun and playing games and tidying [scil. tying] up"". 
13Mr Murley told police he went to Best's premises after hearing some muffled noises. He said the Offender answered the door and the following conversation took place: 

Mr Murley said, ""I heard some commotion in there, where's BB? 

The offender said, ""We 're having some fun. I've got him tied up to the bed."" 

14Mr Murley did not see the Deceased or Best. Mr Murley asked the Offender for some Valium. The Offender gave him some Valium and closed the door. 

15The Offender said Best then held the Deceased's head by the back of the neck and forced it into a small plastic garbage bin which had been filled with water. The Offender saw blood and bubbles in the water. 

16Best then sexually violated the Deceased which caused the Offender to go into the bathroom to vomit. When she returned to the room the Deceased's body had been removed. Best said to her ""it's your turn"". The Offender said she was very scared of what Best might do to her. 

17The Offender saw the Deceased had bled onto the carpet as a result of the attack. 

18The Offender said Best then went through the Deceased's handbag before placing it inside a green garbage bag. He removed some money and some ice. 

19The Offender used her mobile phone a number of times and rang the Deceased's mobile phone in order to steer suspicion away from Best and her. 

20The Offender said that Best then drove the Deceased's motor vehicle away from the unit complex and left it in Jackson Street, Ermington. She said she then walked from the unit complex to Ermington and met up with Best at the Ermington Hotel. CCTV footage from the area depicts Best and the Offender walking from the vicinity of Jackson Street (near where the vehicle was found by police) towards the Ermington Hotel at 3:47pm. It is the Crown case that the Offender was in the vehicle with Best when it was abandoned. CCTV images depict the Offender and Best walking towards a garbage bin and Best placing something inside it. 

21Best and the Offender are depicted on CCTV arriving at the hotel at 3:50pm. While they were at the Hotel a further text message was sent from Best's mobile phone to the Deceased's phone. They remained at the Ermington Hotel drinking and playing poker machines. Best gave the Offender money he obtained from the Deceased's handbag to play the poker machines. They left the Hotel at 6:57pm. 

22The Offender told police that on the way home Best went into nearby Woolworths and purchased bleach and other items whilst she waited outside. She said that after Best purchased the items they walked back to his unit. CCTV footage depicts Best and the Offender both entering the Woolworths store at 7:04pm. They are seen inside the store purchasing a 2.5 litre bottle of bleach, tissues, tinned food and a barbeque chicken. Both are depicted at the cash register. However it is unclear who actually paid for the items. They are each depicted carrying items and leaving the store at 7:11pm. 

23The Offender told police that when she returned to the unit, in fear, she attempted to clean the Deceased's blood stain from the carpet. She believed she had to clean the carpet otherwise she could be hurt. The offender used a bottle of 'Spray and Wipe' she obtained from Best's unit. She dabbed at the stain with a tea towel. The Offender said she couldn't get rid of the stain so Best poured the bleach onto it and then covered the area with a coffee table. 

24They then used 'ice' sourced from the Deceased's handbag. Best injected 'ice' into the Offender's arm before injecting himself. They then smoked the remaining 'ice'. 

25CCTV depicts them returning to the Ermington Hotel at 11.41 pm on 19 June 2010. They remained at the Hotel drinking and playing poker machines with money removed from the Deceased's handbag until leaving together at 2:00am the next day. She said Best never let her out of his sight. They went to the Hotel because there were cameras present which would record their attendance and give rise to an alibi. 

26Call charge records for the 20 June 2010 reveal Best's mobile phone was used to send further text messages to the Deceased's mobile phone in which he was expressing concern for her welfare. 

27The Offender said Best later told her he had dumped the Deceased's body in the ""empty flat next to the faggot."" The Offender said she never went inside this unit and was unsure how he gained access. The Crown case is that this unit is 11/195 Spurway Street. This unit was vacant at the relevant time. During the investigation police conducted examinations of this unit and also seized screwdrivers from Best's unit. Expert examination evidence reveals marks on the door jamb of Unit 11 were made with the screwdrivers seized from Best's unit. The markings are suggestive of forced entry to Unit 11. 

28The Offender said Best later told her he dismembered the Deceased's body with a hacksaw which had been given to him by Kevin Hanson. 

29Kevin Hanson said that on an occasion when he was at Best's unit, Best asked if he had a hacksaw so he could ""cut up some equipment"". Mr Hanson told Best ""he did have a hacksaw but not with him"". Mr Hanson returned to his house and obtained a hacksaw. He returned and gave it to Best. Mr Hanson then drove Best and the offender to the Ermington Hotel. The Offender knew Best wanted to borrow the hacksaw from Kevin Hanson to dismember the Deceased's body. 

30Best then disposed of the body parts in different garbage bins. Best warned the Offender to ""be ready"" as the body parts may ""show up at the tip"". The Offender said Best also told her that he disposed of the Deceased's remains in 'Aboriginal parkland near Blacktown'. 

31On 24 June, 2010 the Offender and Best were contacted by police who were then investigating the Deceased's disappearance. Police had reviewed the Deceased's telephone call charge records and found there had been frequent contact between the Deceased, the Offender and Best at about the time of her disappearance. The Offender and Best were asked to provide a statement to police. The following is a summary of the Offender's statement. 

32The Offender said that on the afternoon of 19 June 2010 the Deceased drove her to Homebush to meet Best at a car yard. When they arrived the Deceased told her she was meeting Best later that day. Before leaving Homebush the Deceased told the Offender she was ""going to Auburn to re-load"" (source further drugs from her supplier). The Deceased then drove off. The Offender said she met with Best a short time later. They eventually went home by bus and train arriving at about 3pm. The Offender said that when the Deceased didn't arrive at Best's unit as previously arranged they made a number of calls and sent text messages to her. Because they received no response they went to the Ermington Hotel. 

33Best said he rang the Deceased's telephone at approximately 3pm but found that it was turned off. Best told police in his statement that he knew the Deceased had been arguing a few weeks ago with a ""deaf and dumb guy"" who lived in the Telopea area. 

34The Offender later said in her interview of the 18 August 2010 that she made the statement in fear of Best and that he had not let her out of his sight. The Offender said that the contents of that statement were formulated by Best when they were walking to the police station to make their statement. 

35The Offender said Best bought a vehicle from the ""man across the road"". Rodney Small told police that on the 4 July 2010 Best asked about buying his van and being able to take it for a mechanical inspection. He took possession of the van on that day. 

36On 5 July 2010 Best contacted Centrelink and requested an advance payment. The request was granted and money was deposited into the Offender's bank account on 7 July 2010 together with his fortnightly payment. The Crown case is that Best paid Mr Small for the van from these funds and that the van was purchased by Best in order to facilitate moving the Deceased's remains from the unit complex. 

37The Offender said Best had told her he had been to the Reserve to check on the Deceased's body. He told her ""it didn't smell"". David Best, the son of the accused Best, told police that on 10 July 2010 he accompanied his father to Charlie Bali Reserve, Doonside. It is the Crown case that Best went to the Reserve to check on the body. 

38At 5:30pm on Wednesday 11 August 2010 the torso of the Deceased was found by Suzanne Boole at the Charlie Bali Reserve. Police were subsequently contacted and a crime scene was established. Subsequent scientific examinations confirmed the remains as being those of the Deceased. 

39Forensic examination of the torso (no head, arms or legs) revealed that a large wound was caused to the Deceased's abdomen and her entire small bowel and part of her large bowel had been removed. The torso weighed 24 kilograms. To date no other body parts of the Deceased have been found. 

40Between the 11th of August 2010 and the 18th August 2010 there was significant publicity about the finding of the torso. 

41On Wednesday 18 August 2010 the offender rang Police. She told them Best was responsible for the killing of the Deceased and that she had witnessed the incident. The Offender agreed to meet with police at an arranged location where she was ultimately arrested and taken to Parramatta Police Station. The Offender agreed to be interviewed. The interview went for 2.5 hours in which she answered approximately 1,100 questions. 

42At the outset of the interview the Offender told police she was scared of Best but knew she was ""doing the right thing"" by telling police what occurred. She said ""the poor girl doesn't even rest and the family, her son I just can't live with it ... I'm not coping"". At the conclusion of the interview the Offender said ""I'm just so sorry that I didn't come (forward to police), I'm just you know, I wish, it's too late for wishes and ifs but I really wish I had of done this (Interview) straight off. 

43The Offender was later charged with the present offence. 

The acts of the offender 

44I find that the acts of the Offender which were done with the intention of assisting Best to evade justice are these: 

(i) She used her mobile phone to contact the Deceased's mobile phone in order to steer suspicion away from Best; 

(ii) She accompanied Best when he drove the Deceased's car and dumped it; 

(iii) She attempted to clean the Deceased's blood stain from the carpet with bleach purchased by Best for her that afternoon; 

(iv) When contacted by the police on 24 June 2010 she gave false information to the police concerning Best's and her involvement with the offence, and her knowledge of what Best had done. At the time she provided that information to the police she knew not only that Best had killed the Deceased but that Best had told her he had dumped the Deceased's body in an empty flat in the complex, that he had obtained a hacksaw from Kevin Hanson, that he had dismembered the body, that he had purchased the van to facilitate moving the Deceased's remains from the unit complex, that he had disposed of body parts in different garbage bins and had buried the Deceased's remains in Aboriginal parkland near Blacktown. 

45The Offender did not contact the police to tell them the truth about what happened until 18 August 2010, some 2 months after the Deceased was killed. The Offender claims that she did not contact the police until at that time because of her fear of Best. She agreed in evidence she gave before me, however, that her last contact with Best before she rang the police was sometime in early July. She explained that delay by reason of the fact that when Mr Vasquez had been released from custody in June or July, the Offender had told him what Best had done, and Mr Vasquez told her to keep quiet and not to say anything. That conversation with Mr Vasquez took place about 2 weeks before she rang the police. 

46It appears in a report from a psychologist, Dr Katie Seidler (to which I will come presently) that the Offender's relationship with Mr Vasquez has been an abusive one with her as the victim. The Offender does not say, however, that she did not contact the police out of any fear of Mr Vasquez but only that he had told her not to say anything, a direction which she followed for a 2 week period. 

47I accept that the Offender acted during the days immediately following the killing principally out of fear for what Best might do to her if she did not take the course which she in fact took. The Offender said that for some days Best did not let her out of his sight and she continued to be fearful of him because of what he said to her immediately after the Deceased was killed that she was next. 

48Nevertheless, when she does not appear to have had any contact with Best from early July, and she does not say that she remained silent for any fear of Mr Vasquez, I do not consider that there is an adequate explanation for why it took her until 18 August 2010 to contact the police to tell them the true position. She agreed with the Crown in cross-examination that she had the opportunity to go to the police at some stage in that 2 month period. 

49Whilst an inference is available that she only contacted the police because of the discovery of some of the Deceased's remains, I do not find that that was the reason for the contact. It seems likely that she did so out of a sense of guilt and remorse that had been eating away at her. 

Legal principles 

50In R v Cowen [2008] NSWSC 104 Buddin J said: 

[15] In R v Hawken (1986) 27 A Crim R 32, Thomas J observed that: 

...it is in the interests of the community that murderers should be completely isolated from support and deprived of assistance and that such crimes be not covered up. The severe penalty available against accessories after the fact is a way in which the community protects itself and it is an aspect of the law's general deterrence against homicide. (at 38) 
[16] Clearly the community has an interest in ensuring that offenders who have committed serious crimes be brought to account. Accordingly, endeavours made by those who seek to assist such offenders from avoiding detection must be strongly resisted and visited with appropriate penalties. In those circumstances, the nature of the assistance which is provided, the extent to which it assists the principal offender in avoiding detection and the reasons why the assistance was extended, are all factors which are relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 

[17] In R v Farroukh (CCA, unreported, 29 March 1996) Gleeson CJ, with whom Levine and Dowd JJ agreed, said: 

The maximum penalty is penal servitude for twenty-five years. There is, however, a wide variation in the possible degrees of moral culpability of persons convicted of this offence. The present was not a case, as sometimes occurs, where an accessory after the fact has been personally involved in a criminal enterprise, although the involvement falls short of participation as a principal, or where an accessory is associated with criminal elements and has become an accessory by reason of that association...(at 7) 

[18] In R v Scowen [2007] NSWSC 792 Grove J observed that: 

...there is a wide variation in possible degrees of culpability. This is reflected in some statistics collected by the Judicial Commission. The sample of offences of being an accessory after the fact to murder are small, but of sixteen cases three were sentenced to wholly non custodial terms, one served a term of imprisonment by periodic detention and the balance received sentences of full time imprisonment. The minimum term element of those who received full time imprisonment ranged in a sample of eleven cases between six months and thirty six months (at par 19). 

[19] An examination of a number of decisions bear out those observations. At one end of the spectrum are cases such as R v Galea [2003] NSWSC 465 in which an effective overall sentence of 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months was imposed upon an offender who assisted the principal offender in cleaning the flat in which the murder took place and who also assisted in mutilating and dismembering the deceased and in disposing of the body parts: see also R v Elsworth [2000] NSWSC 582 and R v Faulkner [2000] NSWSC 944. 

[20] At the other end of the spectrum are cases in which sentences falling short of full-time custody have been imposed. Fully suspended sentences were imposed in R v Leung [2000] NSWSC 824, in which the offender harboured the principal offender for a period of 48 hours by providing accommodation to him, and in R v Phan (2001) 126 A Crim R 257 in which the offender both withheld from, and also gave false information to, the police. It is to be observed however that that offender also provided significant co-operation to prosecuting authorities. For other instances in which offenders received suspended sentences after co-operating with authorities, see R v Culleton [1999] VSC 478 and R v Brown [2005] VSC 63. 

[21] A sentence of periodic detention was imposed in R v Tan Do (CCA, unreported, 7 May 1997) in which the offender agreed to provide the principal offender with an alibi and agreed to receive and retain on behalf of the principal offender the sum of $500 from the proceeds of the botched robbery which gave rise to the offence until such time as the principal offender wanted it back. A Crown appeal against sentence was dismissed. 

[22] A sentence of periodic detention was also imposed in R v Waters [1999] NSWSC 893 in which the offender agreed to drive the principal offender away from the scene, assisted in carrying the blood soaked bag containing the weapons to the principal offender's premises and then maintaining his silence about the events for a period of nearly 3 years. 

[23] In R v Dileski [2002] NSWCCA 345 Hidden J, with whom Adams J agreed, said: 

In many cases of this kind the offender's conduct is the product of emotional attachment or dependence, or a misguided sense of loyalty. No doubt, that accounts for most, if not all, of the cases in the Judicial Commission statistics which were disposed of otherwise than by fulltime custodial sentences. The present case cannot be explained in that way and, accordingly, it must be viewed as a more serious example of this type of offence. (at par [17]) 

[24] Although those remarks are apposite to the present case, none of this is to suggest of course that an offence which is committed out of a misguided sense of loyalty will inevitably lead to the imposition of a lenient penalty: see for example R v Ward [2004] NSWSC 420 at paras 49-51. 

[25] Nevertheless I accept that the offender's loyalty to her partner which prompted her to commit these offences, is borne of an emotional dependency which has its origins in her highly unusual and unstable early childhood. 

[26] It is true that the facts giving rise to the first count are rather more serious than those which relate to the second count. That is amply demonstrated by the difference in the maximum penalties which are available. Notwithstanding the fact that the offender lied to police on two separate occasions almost a week apart, it is my view that the objective gravity revealed by each of the offences falls towards the bottom of the range of offences of this kind. Her criminality would have been higher had she, for example, disposed of the deceased's handbag or witnessed the killings. In that respect I agree with the observations of Simpson J who said in R v Quach [2002] NSWSC 1205 that: 

assistance in the disposal of a body after a murder takes a crime of this kind into the upper echelons of [an offence of this kind) ... [and being] of considerably more seriousness than, for example, assisting an offender to clean himself or herself after the murder (at para 11). 

Subjective features 

51The Offender was examined by Dr Katie Seidler, a clinical and forensic psychologist, on 13 September 2011. Dr Seidler has provided a lengthy and very helpful report from which most of the evidence about the Offender has been derived. The Offender is now aged 44 years. She is the eldest of four daughters born to her parents. Her parents' marriage broke down when she was about 13 and she alternated between residing with her mother and her father after that time. 

52Both of her parents drank heavily. Her father usually drank to the point of intoxication on a daily basis and, in addition to alcohol, her mother abused prescription medications. 

53The Offender commenced consuming alcohol at or around the age of 15 years. She commenced using cannabis at about the age of 20 and smoked it heavily on a daily basis for some period of time. At least from the time she has been with Mr Vasquez she has used amphetamines, ice and cocaine on an intravenous basis. She has also experimented with heroin. However, she says that alcohol is her most serious problem. 
54All of her sisters have struggled with drug and alcohol problems over the years. 

55The Offender met her husband at the age of 20 and they married when she was 30. The marriage lasted for a further ten years. Her husband was a heavy alcohol abuser and gambler who assisted little with the family. They had 3 children, 2 daughters who are now aged 11 and 15 years and a son who is aged 4 years. When the marriage broke up the 2 daughters chose to live with their father. This devastated the Offender who turned heavily to alcohol abuse to cope. Subsequently her son was removed from her care by what was then the Department of Community Services because of her heavy alcohol abuse. 

56After her marriage ended the Offender entered into a relationship with a man who was a heavy drinker and gambler who was violent and abusive towards the Offender. She fell pregnant to him but had the pregnancy terminated. That relationship lasted 6 months. 

57She has been involved in a relationship with Mr Vasquez for about 18 months. He is a heavy drug user and is abusive and aggressive towards her as well as being involved in criminal activity. As noted, she met Best when Mr Vasquez was incarcerated, and commenced a sexual relationship (she claims it was nothing more) with him. 

58Having heard the Offender's evidence I accept that she is very remorseful for her actions. 

Plea and assistance 

59The Offender entered her guilty plea at the earliest opportunity. She should be entitled to the full discount of 25% for that early plea. 

60The Offender's ultimate disclosure to the police on 18 August 2010 was instrumental in securing the arrest of Best. The officer-in-charge of the investigation said that the information she provided to the police was significant and the evidence that she gave against Best was the majority of the evidence against him. He described her evidence as the foundation of the Crown's case. 

61The Offender has already given evidence at Best's committal hearing and she has signed an undertaking to give evidence at his trial in accordance with what she told the police in her interview of 18 August 2010 and the subsequent interview of 6 September 2011. 

62Because the information volunteered by the Offender on 18 August 2010 led to the virtually immediate arrest of Best, and because of the significance of the information provided and the evidence already given by the Offender there should be a discount for that assistance of 15% on the sentence that would otherwise be imposed. Further, because of the significance of the evidence that the Offender has undertaken to give at the trial of Best there should be an additional discount of 10% for that undertaking to assist. 

Other matters 

63The Offender has a minimal criminal record which, apart from 2 motor vehicle matters, consists only of 2 related matters in 2009 for which she was given s 9 bonds. That record entitles her to some leniency. 

64I consider that the Offender's prospects for rehabilitation are moderately good. She is unlikely ever to offend in the manner the subject of the offence charged. The concern for rehabilitation is her abuse of drugs and alcohol that appears to have been the background to the commission of all offences for which she has been convicted as well as the Form 1 offence. 

65She says that she can now see a pattern to her faults including dependency on unsuitable men. She says that she wants to go to live with her mother and her children on the Central Coast and not have contact with abusive men including Mr Vasquez. This is a change from what she told Dr Seidler in September 2011, and it may take time and some concerted therapy for her to get Mr Vasquez and the others out of her system. Dr Seidler felt that a longer period of supervision on parole was likely to be more beneficial for her rehabilitation. 

Sentence 

66Rothman J said in R v Jade Carly Fennell [2011] NSWSC 489 at [53] that murder is the most serious of crimes and assisting in its non-detection must be treated seriously by the courts. I agree and I have considered whether any sentence other than a sentence of imprisonment is appropriate. I do not consider any other sentence is appropriate. 

67I have had regard to the subjective matters I have mentioned. I have had regard to the acts done by the offender and viewed them in the light of what was said in the cases earlier referred to. The maintenance of the false position that she had related to the police on 24 June until 18 August means that this case cannot be regarded as one involving minimal culpability ( Cowen at [20]). However, it is not to be regarded as amongst the most serious (see Galea and Quach ). It falls somewhere between these two extremes. 

68I have had regard to the Form 1 matter but I am of the opinion that the sentence to be imposed for the primary offence should not be increased by reason of it. Were it not for the early guilty plea and the assistance, I would have imposed an overall sentence of 3 years. But for the suspended sentence I intend to impose, the sentence should be backdated to 25 August 2011 to reflect the time the Offender has spent in custody (197 days). 
69Debbra Hogden you are convicted of being an accessory after the fact between 19 June 2010 and 18 August 2010 to the murder by Robert Best of Kristi McDougall on 19 June 2010 in that you did assist Robert Best. 

70You are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing 9 March 2012 and expiring 8 September 2013, and I direct that the sentence be wholly suspended. My reasons for suspending the sentence are that you have not previously been sentenced to a period of imprisonment, you are unlikely to re-offend, your need for rehabilitation, and for the assistance you have given and will give. 

71You are to enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of 18 months commencing 9 March 2012 and expiring 8 September 2013. The bond is to contain conditions: 

(a) that you will be of good behaviour during the term of the bond; 

(b) that you are to appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond; 

(c) that you are to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and to obey all reasonable directions for counselling, educational development or drug and alcohol rehabilitation, and to report to the Gosford Probation office within 7 days. 

72My intention when sentencing the offender was to impose a period of imprisonment of 18 months. Were that term of imprisonment to be served in custody the sentence would date from 25 August 2011 and expire on 24 February 2013. As I have indicated, however, the sentence has been suspended. The result is that the sentence commences on 9 March 2012 and expires on 8 September 2013 and the bond will have a corresponding period. My intention in regard to this sentence is that if the offender is breached for the bond that she enters into her period spent in custody already of 197 days should be fully taken into account if she is required to serve out the balance of the term in custody.

		20 July 2012",2012-03-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758838,Billings v R [2012] NSWCCA 33,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant has been charged with the murder of Raymond Brown on 4 February 2007. He has also been charged with the commission of a large number of offences in various parts of the Sydney metropolitan area between 13 December 2006 and 14 February 2007. Apart from the murder, most of the events from which the charges arise are said to have been armed robberies or attempted armed robberies. 

2The Crown originally presented an indictment containing 40 counts. The applicant pleaded not guilty to each charge. The Crown has also served notice on the defence under Part 3.6 of the Evidence Act 1995 stating its intention to adduce evidence of tendency and coincidence in relation to some of the counts. The tendency evidence in respect of a count is said to arise from the evidence proposed to be tendered in respect of other counts.

3During some pre-trial hearings, the Crown recast the indictment and reduced the number of counts to 14, two of which are pleaded alternatively to other counts. The 14 counts comprehend 9 separate events.

4The counts on the recast indictment are as follows:

1. On 21 December, at Randwick, in the State of New South Wales, the applicant, being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a shortened rifle, did rob Alan Veney of certain property, namely a bag containing personal papers, and at the time of the robbery did wound Alan Veney. 
2. On 31 December 2006, at Greenacre, in the State of New South Wales, the applicant, whilst armed with an offensive weapon, namely a shortened firearm, did rob Ahmit Saini of certain property, namely a mobile telephone, two sets of car keys and a sum of money the property of Ahmit Saini.
3. On 31 December 2006, at Greenacre, in the State of New South Wales, the applicant, whilst in the company of another person, did assault Ahmit Saini with intent to take a motor vehicle, and took and drove a motor vehicle, namely, Mitsubishi Lancer YVG190, without the consent of Ahmit Saini. 
4. On 6 January 2007, at Surry Hills, in the State of New South Wales, the applicant, whilst in the company of another person, did assault Elie Stambouli with intent to take a motor vehicle, and took and drove a motor vehicle, namely, Mitsubishi Lancer UYB468, without the consent of the owner Elie Stambouli.
5. On 7 January 2007, at Liverpool, in the State of New South Wales, the applicant whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, namely, a shortened rifle, did attempt to rob Luke Ray. 
6. On 7 January 2007, at Miller, in the State of New South Wales, the applicant discharged a shortened rifle, with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Luke Ray. 
7. On 7 January 2007, at Liverpool, in the State of New South Wales, the applicant, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a shortened rifle, did attempt to rob Anthony Neale.
8. On 7 January 2007, at Miller, in the State of New South Wales, the applicant discharged a shortened rifle, with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Anthony Neale.
9. On 20 January 2007, at Redfern, in the State of New South Wales, the applicant did shoot at Constable Justin Knight, with intent to murder Constable Justin Knight. 
10. (in the alternative to 9) On 20 January 2007, at Redfern, in the State of New South Wales, the applicant did discharge a firearm at Constable Justin Knight, with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Constable Justin Knight. 
11. On 4 February 2007, at Canley Vale, in the State on New South Wales, the applicant did murder Raymond John Brown.
12. On 8 February 2007, at Cabramatta, in the State on New South Wales, the applicant, whilst armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a shortened firearm, did rob Judith Anderson of certain property, namely, approximately $225 in cash, the property of Woolworths Ltd, trading as BWS-Beer, Wine, Spirits, Cabramatta. 
13. On 14 February 2007, at Canley Heights, in the State of New South Wales, the applicant did shoot at Molitoni Vakauta, with intent to murder Molitoni Vakauta. 
14. (in the alternative to 13) On 14 February, 2007 at Canley Heights, in the State of New South Wales, the applicant did discharge a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Molitoni Vakauta. 

5An application was made to the trial judge pursuant to s 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 seeking to have the murder count severed from the remaining counts and, in the alternative, that there be a more limited severing of some of the counts on the indictment. At the same time an application was made seeking that his Honour rule that evidence of various counts would be admissible on other counts as tendency or coincidence evidence.

6Section 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides for the court to order a separate trial in the circumstances provided in sub-section (2):

""21 Orders for amendment of indictment, separate trial and postponement of trial

...

(2) If of the opinion: 
(a) that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or
(b) that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment,

the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment.

...""

7Both the primary application and its alternative were rejected by the trial judge. His Honour did not decide the issue of the admissibility of tendency or coincidence evidence. His Honour determined that, as the evidence was otherwise admissible, the issue of whether it could be used by the jury for coincidence or tendency purposes could await the receipt of the evidence during the trial.

8The applicant seeks leave to appeal his Honour's decision pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. He pleads that ""the learned trial judge erred in ruling that the 14 counts set out in the indictment filed by the Crown be heard together."" It was submitted to this Court that in rejecting the application his Honour had given too much weight to the prospect of inconvenience to witnesses if there were multiple trials rather than the one trial of the 14 counts.

9The trial judge had the benefit of a detailed discussion of the evidence which the Crown indicated it proposed to lead in relation to each count. He provided a summary of that evidence in his reasons. It is apparent that there is evidence which will be tendered in relation to counts 1, 7, 8, 13 and 14 which is relevant and probative in relation to count 11, the murder charge. With the exception of counts 5 and 6, there is evidence in relation to each remaining count which would probably not be directly admissible in relation to count 11, but would be relevant and admissible to at least one of counts 1, 7, 8, 13 and 14. 

10With respect to counts 5 and 6 there is no evidence proposed to be tendered in relation to that count which is relevant to any other count. However, it could be that evidence in relation to those counts is admissible as tendency or coincidence evidence. This has not yet been considered by the trial judge. There is evidence in relation to counts 5 and 6 which is proposed to be called from an informer who is also proposed to give evidence in relation to counts 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14.

11After summarising the circumstances relating to each count the trial judge considered s 29 of the Criminal Procedure Act. That section is in the following terms:

""29 When more than one offence may be heard at the same time

(1) A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to 2 or more offences alleged to have been committed by the same accused person in any of the following circumstances: 
(a) the accused person and the prosecutor consent,
(b) the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances,
(c) the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character.

(2) A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to offences alleged to have been committed by 2 or more accused persons in any of the following circumstances: 
(a) the accused persons and the prosecutor consent,
(b) the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances,
(c) the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character.

(3) Proceedings related to 2 or more offences or 2 or more accused persons may not be heard together if the court is of the opinion that the matters ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice.

12His Honour, exercising the power provided by s 29(1)(b) and (c), concluded (at [18]) that ""some of the counts charge offences arising out of the same set of circumstances and that all charge offences of the same or of a similar character."" Accordingly, his Honour considered s 29(3) to determine whether, in the interests of justice, any or all of the matters should be heard separately. His Honour said (at [19]-[25]):

""The Crown Prosecutor estimates that a joint trial on the indictment as it stands would last for three months. Mr Webb, for the accused, says at least three months. Even by today's standards, three months is a long trial and brings it own pressures on everyone concerned, not least on the members of the jury. A significantly shorter trial is to be preferred. But severing the counts would produce the need for multiple trials and, as I have indicated, evidence of a particular event may have to be heard as many times as there are trials. That would be oppressive for the witnesses concerned and would give rise to the undesirable risk of the differential treatment by different juries of the same subject matter. And although any individual trial would be significantly shorter than three months, the total length of all the necessary trials would substantially exceed that period.

This is not a case where the jury are likely to confuse the events, even though there are many and the facts are complicated. It is not a case where the jury, provided they are properly instructed, are likely to misunderstand how evidence going primarily to one count may possibly bear on another.

Mr Webb advanced some reasons why it would be in the interests of justice to sever counts. It was submitted that there was little utility in overloading a jury hearing a murder charge with a number of less serious offences. It was submitted that a joint trial would run together strong cases and weak cases.

It seems to me that even though the charges other than that the murder of Mr Brown are less serious, (sic) they are all serious charges. It may be accepted that the case on some counts is strong and others weak by comparison. But there is no reason to suppose that the jury, properly instructed, will be unable to differentiate between the evidence available to be used on any individual count.

Mr Webb made submissions about the similarity of some counts and the dissimilarity of others. The similarities and dissimilarities can certainly be identified, but such considerations do not seem to me to justify severing the counts and running the risks I have mentioned.

It was submitted that there were inconsistencies in Mr Jewell's evidence. It seems to me that such matters should be left for the jury.

I have decided, without considering the possible availability of tendency and coincidence reasoning that the counts should not be severed and that a trial should take place of the 14 counts in the Crown's indictment, Exhibit 22. I grant leave to the Crown so to amend the indictment.""

13Before this Court senior counsel for the applicant submitted that his Honour had erred and reminded the court of the discussion of these issues by the High Court, in particular in Sutton v The Queen [1984] HCA 5; (1984) 152 CLR 528; De Jesus v The Queen [1986] HCA 65; (1986) 22 A Crim R 375; Hoch v The Queen [1988] HCA 50; (1988) 165 CLR 292; KRM v The Queen [2001] HCA 11; (2001) 206 CLR 221 and Phillips v The Queen [2006] HCA 4; (2006) 225 CLR 303.

14The approach which this Court must take to the present application was considered in DAO v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 63 (2011); 278 ALR 765, in which it was held that an order providing for separate trials is an interlocutory judgment or order for the purpose of s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. Whether there should be a joint or separate trial of individual counts is a matter within the discretion for the trial judge, although that discretion must be exercised according to established principles: DAO and R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; (2005) 158 A Crim R 504. To succeed in this Court the applicant must establish error in that the trial judge acted on a wrong principle, was influenced by an extraneous or irrelevant matter, mistook the facts, or failed to take into account some material consideration. Where one or more of these difficulties is not apparent, error may nevertheless be identified if the decision is unreasonable or plainly unjust.

15In Sutton the High Court considered whether a number of sexual assault charges should have been tried together. The court identified that the problem with a joint trial was that unless evidence on one count was admissible on another count, the rule which excludes evidence of similar facts would be of little or no consequence. Brennan J said (at 541-2) that:

""When two or more counts constituting a series of offences of a similar character are joined in the same information, a real risk of prejudice to an accused person may arise from the adverse effect which evidence of his implication in one of the offences charged in the indictment is likely to have on the jury's mind in deciding whether he is guilty of another of those offences. Where that evidence is not admissible towards proof of his guilt of the other offence, some step must be taken to protect the accused person against the risk of impermissible prejudice. Sometimes a direction to the jury is sufficient to guard against such a risk; sometimes it is not. Where a direction to the jury is not sufficient to guard against such a risk, an application for separate trials should generally be granted.""

16Gibbs CJ recognised in De Jesus that sexual cases raise particular problems. However, the Chief Justice confirmed (at 378) that the remarks of Brennan J in Sutton were of general application. 

17In KRM McHugh J said at [38]:

""In some cases of multiple counts, however, some feature of the evidence may create a risk that the jury will use that particular evidence or a conviction in respect of a count to reason that the accused is the kind of person who would commit the crime charged in another count or counts in the presentment. If that risk exists, the judge is bound to direct the jury that they cannot use that evidence or conviction to convict the accused on the other count or counts unless, of course, the evidence is admissible in respect of that count or counts. An example of such a risk is the accused being charged on the one presentment with offences against different victims and the evidence in respect of one or more counts being inadmissible in respect of the other counts (T (1996) 86 A Crim R 293). Ordinarily, however, the court should order separate trials where there are different victims, where the evidence in respect of one victim is not relevant to the charge in respect of the other victims and where the joinder of charges creates a risk of prejudice (Sutton v The Queen [1984] HCA 5; (1984) 152 CLR 528 at 531, 541-542; De Jesus v The Queen [1986] HCA 65; (1986) 61 ALJR 1 at 3, 7, 8; [1986] HCA 65; 68 ALR 1 at 4-5, 12, 13). But in some cases, an application for the trial of separate counts may be refused on the ground that the convenience of trying the charges together far outweighs any risk of prejudice or, more usually, because a separate trial is not sought: see, for example, T (1996) 86 A Crim R 293. If that occurs, a propensity warning will almost certainly be required.""

18In Phillips v The Queen the court recognised that separate trials of several complaints made by different complainants adds to the cost of the prosecution and defence of an accused. However, again in the context of allegations of sexual assault, the court concluded that the evidence from the different complainants would not have the relevant degree of probative force to justify the counts being included in the one indictment. The court said (at [79]) that, accordingly, it was necessary that the allegations in the various charges ""be separately considered by different juries, uncontaminated by knowledge of other complaints.""

19There are decisions in Victoria which consider the problem in relation to an indictment containing a count of murder. In R v Pollit [1991] 1 VR 299 Beach J expressed the view (at 301) that it was highly undesirable to include any other count on an indictment that contains one or more counts of murder: see also R v Debs [2005] VSCA 66 (Vincent JA at [249] and [255]).

20In DPP v Coelho, Tabbit and SPA [2007] VSC 137 Teague J (at [12]) considered and applied what had been said in Pollit and Debs and concluded, in the circumstances of that case, that it was in the interests of justice to separate the trial of an accused for murder from other charges against that accused. His Honour took this course notwithstanding the inconvenience that it would occasion to a significant number of witnesses. His Honour concluded that unless the trials were separated there was a significant risk of unfairness to SPA which could not have been adequately diminished by appropriate warnings and would have substantially increased the complexities of the issues faced by the jury.

21In the present case it is plain that if count 11 was severed and tried separately it would nevertheless be necessary for significant evidence in relation to counts 1, 7, 8, 13 and 14 to be tendered at that trial. 

22In the incidents giving rise to each of these counts, used cartridges were found at the scene. The Crown will assert that these cartridges were fired from the same weapon. Similar cartridges were allegedly found at the scene of the murder. In three of these counts the Crown can also point to other evidence capable of showing that the applicant was the offender. A balaclava with the applicant's DNA was recovered from the scene of the incident giving rise to count 1. The victim in counts 13 and 14 identified the applicant from a photographic array as the person who resembled the person who shot him.

23The trial judge summarised the evidentiary links between some of the counts in the following terms: 

""(b) Mr Mario Burgueno's blue spray jacket was in his Ford Spectrum van when it was stolen and used in the attack on Mr Veney [count 1]. The jacket was found in the backpack thrown away by the man who shot at Constable Knight in Redfern [counts 9 and 10]. Constable Knight identified the accused as his attacker. There is thus a circumstantial link between the Veney and the Knight shootings, entitling the crown to call evidence of either in a case based on the other. 

(c) Also recovered from the backpack thrown away after the shooting at Constable Knight was a car key that proved able to start Mr Saini's taxi, stolen from him along with his Lancer YVG 190 [counts 2 and 3]. The link is between the Saini robbery and the Knight shooting. 

(d) The keys to Mr Stambouli's car stolen at Surry Hills [count 4] were found in the Celica WQN 598 impounded after the Vakauta shooting [counts 13 and 14]. There is independent evidence connecting the accused with that vehicle, not the least of which is a cigarette butt, which yielded DNA matching his. So evidence of the Vakauta event, or at least the impounding of the car after it, would be admissible at the trial of any charge based on the Stambouli robbery. 

(e) Also in the backpack thrown away at Redfern was a single right-hand knitted woollen glove. Its pattern and colours are distinctive. Going from the wrist to the fingertips there are seven transverse stripes, each in the same weave but of a different colour. The first is narrow and light pink. The second broad and light grey, the third broad and dark pink, the fourth, cutting across the base of the thumb but not the fingers, is broad and dark grey, the fifth, cutting across the base of the fingers, is broad and white, the sixth, wholly across the fingers is broad and pink and the seventh, on the ends of the first, second and third fingers, is narrow and light grey. It may be said, making allowance for dirt on the glove, that the light pink at the wrist and the light pink across the fingers are about the same shade. The five broad bands are of about equal width

The man who robbed Ms Anderson at Cabramatta on 8 February 2007 [count 12], about three weeks after the recovery of the glove at Redfern wore a distinctive glove on his left hand, as appears from an electronic video recording held on a disc, Exhibit 10. The glove is remarkably like that recovered at Redfern. At the wrist is a narrow band which might be pink, then broad light grey, pink and dark grey bands. The fingers are for the most part white and appear to have light pink ends. The colours do not exactly match those on the glove recovered at Redfern, but they are close. They might originally have been the same. Dirt and the differing reproduction of colour on the electronic recording might account for the differences. In my view the Jury would be entitled to conclude that the two gloves were a pair."" 

24Mindful of the evidentiary matrix in the prosecution evidence, providing the applicant can be protected from any unfair prejudice in the event that the counts are tried together, it seems to me to be appropriate that leaving aside counts 5 and 6, the other counts should be heard together. This was the conclusion reached by the trial judge. His Honour was mindful of, and his decision was influenced by, the inconvenience that would be occasioned to witnesses, the prosecution and the defence if the trials were separated. However, I cannot, in the circumstances, conclude that his Honour gave that issue excessive weight.

25In relation to counts 5 and 6, as I have indicated, there is no evidence in those counts which is relevant to any of the other counts, unless, of course, his Honour ultimately concludes that it may be used for tendency or coincidence reasoning. If his Honour concludes that evidence in relation to counts 5 and 6 may not be used for that purpose, and accordingly is not admissible in relation to any other count, I have some doubt as to whether those counts should be joined in the indictment. The fact that the informer will give evidence in relation to those counts and the other counts may not justify counts 5 and 6 being tried with the other counts if there is any reasonable likelihood that there would be significant prejudice to the applicant. However, as his Honour has not finally considered the purpose for which that evidence will be used, it would be premature to conclude that his Honour erred in relation to those counts requiring the intervention of this Court. Nevertheless, I would urge that the prosecutor give further consideration to whether counts 5 and 6 should be retained on the indictment. If they were severed, the indictment would continue to contain 12 counts of varying degrees of seriousness. It may also be that after considering these reasons, it would be appropriate for that issue to be re-agitated before the trial judge before the jury is empanelled.

26However, in my judgment the applicant has failed to establish any error by the trial judge requiring the intervention of this Court. Accordingly, I would refuse leave to appeal.

		18 April 2013",2012-03-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758840,Christian v R [2012] NSWCCA 34,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  The appellant was charged with seven counts of sexual assault of a child. In its amended form the indictment charged the following counts:
Count 1: between 5 February 1993 and 5 February 1994 commit indecent assault of the complainant, aged under 10 (namely 5 or 6 years old).
Count 2: between 5 February 1993 and 5 February 1994 commit sexual intercourse on the complainant aged under 10 (namely 5 or 6 years old).
Count 3: between 5 February 1993 and 5 February 1994 commit sexual intercourse on the complainant aged under 10 (namely 5 or 6 years old).
Count 4: between 8 February 1996 and 1 November 1996 commit indecent assault of the complainant, aged under 10 (namely 8 years old).
Count 5: between 8 February 1996 and 1 November 1996 commit sexual intercourse on the complainant, aged under 10 years (namely 8 years old).
Count 6: between 8 February 1996 and 1 November 1996 commit sexual intercourse on the complainant, aged under 10 (namely 8 years old).
Count 7: between 1 September 2000 and 5 February 2003 commit sexual intercourse on the complainant, aged above 10 and under 16 (namely 13 or 14 years old).
2The appellant pleaded not guilty but was convicted on all counts. The evidence against the appellant came primarily from the complainant. He said that when he was 5 or 6 years old (he was born on 5 February 1988) the appellant invited him into his home and sexually abused him by touching his penis and committing fellatio. He testified that the appellant told him not to tell anybody about what had happened because he would get into trouble.
3He testified that subsequently when he was 8 or 9 years old he again met the appellant. He said that the appellant again invited him into his home and on this occasion touched his penis, committed fellatio and anal penetration. Although he recalled that other sexual activity had occurred, he said that he was unable to be precise about the circumstances and these allegations were not the subject of any count on the indictment.
4He also testified that when he was about 12 years old he visited the appellant to obtain a copy of a pornographic magazine which he intended to show to his friends. He said that on this occasion the appellant had placed his erect penis in his anus.
5Finally he testified that when he was 18 years old he engaged in consensual homosexual activity with the appellant who by, this time, was living at a different location to the location where the complainant said that the earlier assaults had occurred.
6The complainant initially complained about the appellant's actions to the mother of a friend, Ms Lesley Thompson. He informed the police in 2006 but at first told them that he did not wish to proceed with the matter. However, in October 2008, he changed his mind and told the police that he did wish to proceed. At about this time he also told his parents about the alleged abuse.
7Ms Lesley Thompson gave evidence at the trial. She told the court of the complaint which she said was made to her in 2006. She said that the complainant told her ""that a guy was touching him"" and ""doing things to him that he didn't like."" He asked Ms Thompson ""does this make me a poofter?""
8The complainant's mother also testified. She gave evidence of the complainant telling her in October 2008 that the appellant had molested him when he was ""about 6 or 8."" She also gave evidence of confronting the appellant with the allegations. She said that she said to him ""you molested my child."" She testified that the appellant replied ""oh Chrissie"" while he ""bunched up the top of [his] shoulders"" and ""had his arms outstretched"" with ""both hands out"" before he turned around and shut the door.
9In the course of the investigation the police arranged for the complainant to have telephone conversations with the appellant which were recorded. There was also an occasion when they met and the complainant was fitted with a listening device. Recordings of these conversations were tendered in evidence. The recorded conversations are described as ""pretext"" conversations.
10In the course of these conversations the complainant said to the appellant that his recollection was that ""sex"" began when he was about 5 years old. The appellant denied this and on a number of occasions said that he did not know the complainant at that age and said ""I didn't even know you ... 12 or 14 or something ... when you used to talk to me out the front.""
11The complainant referred in the conversations to fellatio and anal intercourse occurring at a time when ""I'm not even hit puberty yet."" The appellant did not directly respond to this allegation but said on a number of occasions ""well the thing is, you gotta work out which way you're going to go now though."" This remark was made in the context where it was apparent that the complainant was troubled by his sexual orientation and said that he was seeking the assistance of the appellant in working out those issues.
12On 31 July 2009 the appellant said ""there really wasn't that much happened"" and ""you were about 15."" When the complainant said ""you fucked me in the bum and then made me suck your cock"" the appellant did not directly respond but said ""I went down exactly the same track ..."".
13Exchanges of this character occurred on more than one occasion. Later in the conversation the complainant referred to the appellant ""fucking me up the arse and making me suck your cock"" at which time the appellant said ""Well mate, you can only keep going the way you're going ..."" and ""if you're upset about something I apologise.""
14The appellant did not give evidence. However, he participated in an ERISP which was tendered in evidence. During the course of that interview he said that he did not know the complainant ""till he was probably 14 or 15"" and ""probably a year or two after that"" they engaged in ""a little bit of fondling and that"" which involved touching each other's penis. He denied ever having fellatio or ""anal sex"" with the complainant. He suggested that ""what I think has prompted all this"" was that ""in about October 2008 the complainant ""wanted to do"" things that the appellant ""didn't want to"" and the appellant told him ""I don't want you to come around here.""
15He said that he lived at one address until about 2004 or 2005 and then moved to another location in Sans Souci. The appellant did not dispute that the complainant on occasions came to his first home.
16With respect to the confrontation with the complainant's mother the appellant said that he said to her ""Well, it's, it's, it's not right, so I'm sorry, like, go away."" 
17There was other evidence which supported some aspects of the complainant's evidence. The complainant was able to describe the appellant's original home including an aviary. The presence of an aviary was confirmed by a subsequent owner of that property. 
18The complainant also said that the appellant had a dog at the time of the first alleged assault. The complainant's mother gave similar evidence. However, she did not testify as to the time that she observed the dog and her evidence was that she saw it ""out the front of the house.""
19As I have indicated, the complainant gave evidence that when he was about 12 years old he visited the appellant to obtain a pornographic magazine. One of the complainant's friends testified that when he was about 11 or 12 the complainant said to him ""I can get a porn mag off a man"" and went away on his bicycle before returning after ""approximately half an hour"" with a ""full frontal heterosexual pornographic magazine."" However, the witness could not confirm that the complainant obtained the magazine from the appellant.
20The defence case was made from the ERISP. On the appellant's behalf it was put to the jury that the first time the complainant visited the appellant's home was about 2003 when he was about 15. It was accepted by the appellant that there was sexual ""fondling"" on various occasions in 2006-2008 when the complainant was 18 to 20 years old. The appellant maintained that there was never any oral or anal intercourse with the complainant.
21The complainant was cross-examined. A number of issues were raised with him including his uncertainty as to his precise age when the first sexual abuse allegedly occurred. It was also suggested to him that he could not recall with precision the conversations which occurred at that time. He was also challenged about this assertion that he was scared by what the appellant had done with him but nevertheless had returned to the appellant's house.
22The complainant was also cross-examined in relation to his testimony with respect to count 7 in which he alleged that he had penetrated the appellant's anus when the appellant sat on his penis. In the course of the ""pretext conversations"" the complainant had referred to the fact that the appellant ""started fucking me.""
23The complainant was also challenged in relation to an occasion when he went to the appellant's house to complain in 2009. During the course of cross-examination he agreed that he had initially denied doing this to the Crown Prosecutor and had also lied about it to the police and a psychiatrist.
24The appellant emphasised and relied on the fact that he had no previous criminal record. 
25There are three grounds of appeal.
Ground 1: The trial judge erred in holding that certain cross-examination of the complainant would not be permitted on the basis that it sought to adduce evidence that was not relevant.
26The complainant commenced a civil action for damages against the appellant in 2009. During the course of cross-examination the appellant's counsel asked the complainant about ""instructions"" he gave to his solicitor in the civil proceedings in relation to a statement he had made to his solicitor ""concerning these matters"", which ""were not to be provided to the defence."" When this question was asked the prosecutor objected. The trial judge upheld the objection ruling that the question was ""not relevant.""
27The matter was argued in the absence of the jury during the course of which defence counsel said that the relevance of the question was to elicit an explanation from the complainant as to why he was claiming privilege. The exchange which occurred was in the following terms:
""HER HONOUR: What is the relevance of this Mr Flynn? (Mr Flynn appeared for the appellant).
FLYNN: Your Honour this goes to - just to give a bit of background - a subpoena for production for these proceedings was issued to the complainant's solicitors in a civil claim. An affidavit was filed by the solicitor for the complainant and it was sworn on 16 August. Paragraph 13 of the affidavit sworn by the complainant's solicitor reads this way:
'I am instructed by my client to maintain a claim of privilege over the documents which have been produced to court over which a privilege claim currently exists.'
Privilege is the privilege of the complainant. It can be waived by the complainant. It hasn't been waived by the complainant and what I was leading into, your Honour, was why it is that the complainant maintained a claim of privilege over his instructions to his solicitor concerning the events touching upon these matters.
HER HONOUR: What is the relevant of this?
FLYNN: Your Honour it may well be that there have been - it is akin to complaint evidence, if I can express it that way, because if he has given, which he obviously would have done, given a version to his solicitor, that is a complaint matter. That is the relevance.""
28Counsel who appeared for the appellant on the appeal acknowledged that the matter had not been well handled by defence counsel. I infer from his submission that he accepts that the question which was asked was rightly rejected having regard to the foundation which defence counsel said supported it. However, although counsel on the appeal submitted that defence counsel accepted that there was a ""privilege question"" in relation to the statement, he submitted that defence counsel's real purpose was to elicit an explanation from the complainant as to why he was claiming privilege, apparently on the basis that this would be relevant to his credibility.
29Before evidence can be admitted it must be relevant to a fact in issue in the proceedings: Evidence Act 1995 s 56. The law excludes the drawing of an inference adverse to a person from the fact that they have claimed client legal privilege: Wayne Lawrence Pty Ltd v Hunt [1999] NSWSC 1044 at [15]; McGuiness v State of New South Wales [2009] NSWSC 40; [2009] 73 NSWLR 104 at [147]-[148]. It follows that the reasons for the complainant's claim of client legal privilege was not a matter from which the jury could have drawn any inference. Questions directed to the complainant's reasons for claiming privilege were not admissible.
30Counsel for the appellant before this Court submitted that defence counsel should have approached the issue in a different manner. It was submitted that having established that the complainant maintained his privilege defence counsel could have legitimately asked him what he wrote in the statement: Evidence Act s 123. It was submitted that once privilege had been lost in respect of evidence of what he said it would follow that the usual prohibition on any adverse inference being drawn from claiming privilege in respect of the document would not apply and accordingly, the trial judge erred in prematurely closing off this line of cross-examination: Wakeley v The Queen [1990] HCA 23; (1990) 93 ALR 79 at 86-87.
31It is unnecessary to consider this submission. The simple fact is that trial counsel neither took this course nor indicated that this was the course he was proposing to take. No occasion arose for the trial judge to consider it. The question which was asked and rejected was plainly inadmissible. If counsel had sought to put the matter in a different manner the trial judge would have had the opportunity to consider it.
Ground 2: The trial judge erred in failing properly to direct the jury regarding alleged admissions by the appellant.
32This ground of appeal raises two matters for consideration. The first matter is the confrontation between the complainant's mother and the appellant. The second is the appellant's response in the recorded conversations with the complainant (the ""pretext conversations"").
33I have previously referred to the occasion when the complainant's mother confronted the appellant at his home. At the trial the prosecutor submitted to the jury that the appellant's response, as described by the complainant's mother, was ""another example of conduct consistent with, you might think, a guilty knowledge."" He continued: ""but was that behaviour to you, consistent with or at least a possibility of consistency, with someone who was innocent of anything, certainly innocent of anything beyond simply touching the penis on a number of occasions.""
34In his closing address defence counsel submitted that the evidence of the appellant's response to the complainant's mother was not capable of amounting to an admission. He submitted that at the time the appellant was unaware of any allegation of child sexual assault and, accordingly, his response could only have been directed to the possibility of the complainant's mother challenging him in relation to sexual activity with her son after he had reached the age of 16 years.
35In her summing up the trial judge referred to the evidence of the complainant's mother together with the Crown's submissions. Apart from describing the evidence her Honour did not give any further direction in relation to it. No further directions were sought by defence counsel. 
36Counsel for the appellant in this Court submitted that, notwithstanding that no request had been made by trial counsel, her Honour had erred in failing to give directions to the jury in relation to this exchange. It was submitted that the evidence from the complainant's mother was highly ambiguous and that the appellant had effectively denied it in his ERISP. The appellant emphasised that the trial judge made no reference in the summing up to the jury of the appellant's version of the occasion and did not refer to defence counsel's argument.
37It was submitted that if an inference of some kind of admission was to be drawn from this occasion, the admission could relate only to the sexual contact with the complainant that the appellant admitted to in the ERISP and not the sexual conduct in the charges against the appellant. It was submitted that the trial judge should have directed the jury that they should only use this evidence as evidence of ""guilty knowledge"" if they were satisfied:
(a) that the appellant had reacted in the way alleged by the complainant's mother rather than how the appellant said he reacted in the ERISP;
(b) that the circumstances were such that the appellant should have been expected to make a denial so that his reaction in failing to deny the allegation revealed that he had a guilty knowledge that he had ""molested"" the complainant; and
(c) that the ""molestation"" admitted related to the offences charged and not to the sexual contact admitted by the appellant in the ERISP.
38It was further submitted that the jury should have been directed that it would not be open to them to use the evidence as an admission of any particular count on the indictment - at the highest it could only be used as evidence that showed the nature of the relationship between the appellant and the complainant that placed the evidence of the particular conduct charged into context.
39I have discussed below the obligations which the law imposes on a trial judge when giving directions to the jury in relation to alleged admissions. The conversation with the complainant's mother is, to my mind, correctly described by the appellant's counsel as ambiguous. I do not believe it could amount to an admission, either of sexual conduct after the complainant had reached 16 years of age, or earlier. It certainly could not amount to an admission in relation to any of the individual charges.
40I am in no doubt that the parties at the trial accepted that the evidence ultimately had little, if any, evidentiary value and it was for this reason that trial counsel did not make a request for any directions in relation to it. Accepting the mother's version of the event as being accurate, the response of the appellant was entirely equivocal. Trial counsel did not see any need to raise the matter. To do so would only have given unwarranted significance to the exchange which may have been to the appellant's detriment.
41I would refuse leave to raise this issue pursuant to rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
42The pretext conversations raise quite different issues. It was submitted by the respondent that they fall into three broad categories. Some were said to be direct admissions, some admissions by silence indicating acquiescence or acceptance of propositions put by the complainant and the third category were denials of particular aspects of accusations put by the complainant. 
43Detailed submissions were made with respect to the nature of and the inference alleged to be available from each of the appellant's responses. The prosecution emphasised to the jury that during the course of the conversations the appellant never denied that oral and anal sex had occurred although, as the appellant emphasised, he did say that nothing happened until the complainant was older. The prosecutor submitted that the ""pretext conversations at the end of the day are capable of being admissions of guilt by the accused's assent or concurrence in what the complainant has put to him."" The defence argued that they provided no support for the prosecution in relation to any particular count.
44The relevant portions of the conversations and the respondent's particular submission as to the category into which it should be placed and the submission with respect to it are set out below.
Conversation
""...You know, having sex with me when I'm five, it doesn't, it's not a very good thing you know, like, and now it's playing with my head.""
""Five what was that, I don't, that's certainly not right mate...""
(Category (c) - tacit acceptance of the unchallenged part of accusation."")
45The respondent submitted that the appellant's denial is confined to the complainant's age. He does not deny the assertion of ""having sex"".
46The respondent relied upon this material as an admission, being a tacit agreement to the assertion by the complainant that the complainant and the appellant ""had sex"" and it was submitted supported the complainant's evidence that the appellant had sexual intercourse with him.
47In the ERISP the appellant only refers to fondling and specifically denies having had ""sex"" with the complainant. It was accordingly submitted that this evidence may be used by the court to assess the credibility of the appellant's denials in the ERISP of fellatio, anal penetration and his assertion that there was no sexual contact other than fondling.
Conversation
""Yeah, I just, I'm still having trouble with what happened you know, years ago, I think, you know, you having sex with me when I was only five and shit, but.""
""But Well you've got -""
""You know, how old, how old did you think I was then cause like I'm thinking I was five.""
""Mate you were older than that, you, I didn't, I didn't even know you, you, I don't, 12 or 14 or something, 14 or something when you used to talk to me out the front.""
(Categories (a) - direct admission; and (c) tacit acceptance of the unchallenged part of accusation).
48The respondent relied upon this response as evidence of a tacit admission of ""having sex"" and a direct admission that this happened when the complainant was 12 or 14. It was submitted that this evidence supports the complainant's evidence. It was submitted that this evidence also contradicts the appellant's ERISP evidence that the appellant did not (a) engage in sexual contact other than ""fondling"", and (b) have sexual contact with the complainant until a couple of years after he first met the complainant (ie when he was 17 or 18).

""You know 'cause like the way you used to do it with me, like, you fucking, you threw me around and everything, like, you would...fuck me is the arse for a fucking half hour on end and then you'd make me suck your cock, shit, you know, that's pretty hectic fucking crap...you're fucking me up the arse when I'm fucking, I'm not even hit puberty yet, haven't even had any idea what sexuality is and here you are...""
""Mate, you ... yeah you, well.""
(Category (b) - silence indicating acquiescence or acceptance of propositions put by the complainant).
49The respondent submitted that the complainant made explicit accusations of anal penetration by appellant and of the appellant making the complainant fellate him which the appellant did not deny. This was said to be in striking contrast to his quick denial that the complainant was 5 when they ""had sex"" (see first conversation).
50The respondent relied on the failure of the appellant to deny the accusation of anal penetration and fellatio as an admission that those acts took place. This was said to be evidence to support the complainant and contradict the answers given by the appellant in his ERISP.
Conversation
""Say I was 5 or 6 again and I came around to yours would you fuck me again?""
""Mate I didn't know you when you were, when you were even anywhere near that old.""
(Category (c) - tacit acceptance of the unchallenged part of accusation).
51The respondent submitted that this was an admission that intercourse had occurred.
Conversation
""Did you think I liked having sex with you""
""Mate, I, I, I don't really know, I don't really know why you're trying to head this way, you know, and I, it's, it's just not much point about things like that really.""
(Category (b) - silence indicating acquiescence or acceptance of propositions put by the complainant).
52The respondent submitted that the appellant's failure to challenge or deny the complainant's accusation of ""having sex"" could be relied upon as admission that sexual intercourse occurred. It was submitted that this supports the complainant and contradicts the appellant's evidence in the ERISP.
Conversation
""So why did you have sex with me so young?""
""Mate I didn't know you when you were real young so I don't know what ...""
(Category (c) - tacit acceptance of the unchallenged part of the accusation).
53The respondent relied upon this exchange as evidence of a tacit admission of ""having sex"". It was submitted that this evidence supports the complainant and contradicts the appellant's ERISP evidence.
Conversation
""What do I tell my kids, you know, if when I have kids I tell them that, you know, I was, I was sexually abused when I was fucking 10, you know, do I, do I say that to them or how do I tell them, like, what would you do?""
""Um""
""Like you've got kids as well don't ya, had you ever told them that you, you ever told tem that you've ever done anything with kids?""
""I-""
""I don't think you would""
""Mate, you were a lot older when you used to come round to my place, as I said to you the other day, you know, you're getting a bit jumbled up unfortunately but the thing is, look, you just got to, you, you, like you won't be happy until you look forward and not back.""
(Category (c) - tacit acceptance of the unchallenged part of accusation).
54It was submitted that the significance of this conversation was that the appellant denied that the complainant was 10 years old, but not the general accusation of ""sexual abuse"".
55The respondent relied upon the appellant's failure to deny or challenge the substance of the accusation as a tacit admission that ""sexual abuse"" occurred. The respondent acknowledged that this is a general term, but submitted that this admission supports the complainant's evidence and contradicts the appellant's evidence in the ERISP.
Conversation
""Mate you used to, you used to come round when I was cutting the lawn and that and have a soft drink and, on your bike and that, and you were about 15 then.""
(Category (a) - direct admission).
56It was submitted that in this case, the appellant was proffering information. The respondent submitted that this is an admission to sexual contact when the complainant was ""about 15"". It was submitted that this evidence demonstrates the appellant's readiness to correct the complainant on matters with which he disagrees (ie his age). This response is made in response to the complainant's assertion of ""sexual abuse"" and supports the complainant's evidence and contradicts the appellant's evidence in his ERISP.
Conversation
""You know, like, how, how did you deal with getting fucked when you were so young, 'cause you said you weren't that young, just before, like this, that's, it's sexual abuse you know, like, I've got to live for the rest of my life knowing that, from such a young age, fuck, you fucking, you fucked me in the bum and then you made me suck your cock and shit and, you know, you did the same to me and -""
""Well -"" 
""Yeah""
""I told you the track I took, I, I went down exactly the same track and I just got over it and put it behind me and just went on with life and really that's what you got to do.""
""So after you got fucked, you just, you just left it, you just-""
""Yep, yeah"".
(Categories (a) direct admission, and (b) silence indicating acquiescence or acceptance of propositions put by the complainant).
57It was submitted that the complainant made explicit accusations of anal penetration and fellatio and that the appellant indicated his agreement with his allegation by saying ""yeah."" It was submitted that this was a clear admission that he had had penetrative anal intercourse and fellatio with the complainant. It was submitted that the appellant did not deny any aspect of the complainant's accusation. It was submitted that this evidence supports the complainant's evidence and contradicts the appellant's evidence in his ERISP.
""Well what age do you say I was, what 10?""
""Well mate, from what I recall you were about 15 or 16 when you come round, first started to come round, around on a little push bike""
(Category (c) - tacit acceptance of the unchallenged part of accusation).
58The respondent relied on the appellant's response in this exchange as a tacit admission of the sexual activity asserted. It was submitted that this was a further demonstration that the appellant was capable and willing to correct the complainant and deny aspects of the accusation that he thinks are not true. This was said to be in striking contrast to his silence about the nature of the sexual acts that occurred between them.
Conversation
""Well, like, I remember it was like shortly after I broke my leg you know, I was only six.""
""Yeah, no you weren't"".
(Category (c) - tacit acceptance of the unchallenged part of accusation).
59It was submitted that this exchange was in response to the explicit accusation previously referred to.
Conversation
""I was 6 or 7""
""Mate you weren't that young""
60It was submitted that this is a further example of the appellant's readiness to correct and challenge the complainant and is relevant to the consideration of his repeated failures to deny other matters.
Conversation
""And you started doing it and like, all right, I came over a few times but you didn't really have to fuck me, like you could said to wait till I was older or something. Like...before fucken puberty, like I wasn't even in my teens, you know. 
""Yeah"" 
(Category a - direct admission).
61The respondent relied upon this statement as a direct admission that penetrative sexual contact occurred before the complainant reached puberty and before he was 13. It was submitted that this evidence supports the complainant's evidence and the appellant's failure to deny the accusation should be considered in light of the immediately preceding denial regarding the complainant's age. It was submitted that this evidence also contradicts the appellant's ERISP evidence as to the absence of penetrative sex.
Conversation
""Well, mate, if there was anything that you weren't happy with at that time, I'm prepared to say that, but I'm going to say, I'll still say that you're a little, you're out on your dates, because you weren't that young when I first knew you, honestly. But anyway -""
(Category (c) - tacit acceptance of the unchallenged part of accusation).
62The appellant's statement was in response to the complainant's assertion that the appellant ""fucked"" him before he was in puberty. The respondent relied upon this statement as a tacit admission that the appellant had penetrative sexual intercourse with the complainant before he was 13. It was submitted that this evidence supports the complainant's evidence and contradicts the appellant's evidence in the ERISP.
Conversation
""And I come around that afternoon and like you didn't fuck me that day, but you made me give you head and that and you were like saying all this stuff coming out of you, and it's happy stuff, its happy stuff. I'm like -""
""Mate, I - ""
""-I don't know what fucken happy shit was, you know""
""Yeah"".
(Category (b) - silence indicating acquiescence or acceptance of propositions put by the complainant).
63It was submitted that on this occasion, the complainant recounts the circumstances leading up to counts 1 to 3, which are not denied by appellant. It was submitted that this failure to deny should be considered in light of the appellant's previous repeated and robust denials regarding the complainant's age. It was submitted that the appellant failed to deny the complainant's reference to making the complainant fellate him and the words attributed to him ""happy stuff."" It was submitted that this exchange was evidence which counts 1 to 3 supported. This evidence was said to be evidence that contradicted the appellant's evidence in the ERISP.
Conversation
""How old did you think I was then, like you said I was 12 or something, I reckon I was fucking minimum, minimum of 8, you know, minimum. I know, like I had my first bike, the first time I came around yours.""
""You weren't that young, from what I recall...""
(Category (c) - tacit acceptance of the unchallenged part of accusation).
64It was submitted that this was another reference to the first incident (counts 1 to 3). It was submitted that the appellant again denies the age of the complainant, but nothing else.
Conversation
""Yeah, but why did you have to do it to me?""
""Well, mate, you kept coming around, around there, and I mean to say - ""
""But you kept doing it, you know, like once would have been all right, but for you to keep on doing it and keep, you know, to keep putting it on me as well, you know like, and it fucken, you know, I'd go home and I'd cry and I'd cry at school and shit-""
""Yeah""
(Category a - direct admission).
65This exchange is relied upon as a direct admission of the complainant's version of events forming counts 1 to 3. It was submitted that this is evidence which supports counts 1 to 3. This evidence also contradicts the appellant's evidence in the ERISP.
""I have my problems too... Mate I was about 13 or 14 when a couple of older blokes were playing around with me so its not unlike...""
""Yeah well I was still a little bit younger""
""It was the same sort of situation.""
(Category a - direct admission).
66It was submitted that this is a clear admission that the sexual contact occurred when the complainant was less than 13 or 14. It was further submitted that this evidence supports the complainant's evidence in general terms on all the counts and contradicts the appellant's evidence in the ERISP.
Conversation
""Like I can't, I can't masturbate without you fucken popping into my head, you fucken lifting my legs and fucking me up the arse and making me suck your cock, you know, and like the times when, and after we were finished and I went in the toilets and that at your place...[Background noise] when I was in the toilet and that, you know, I was thinking fuck, you know, what have I, what has he done to me?""

(Category (a) direct admission or (b) silence indicating acquiescence or acceptance of propositions put by the complainant).
67The respondent submitted that the complainant makes an accusation of anal penetration and fellatio and that the appellant indicates his acceptance of that statement by saying mmm and yeah. The respondent relied on this as a direct admission that anal penetration and fellatio occurred as asserted by complainant, or alternatively as silence as acceptance of the accusation. This is relied upon to support the complainant's evidence and contradict the appellant's answers in the ERISP.

(Category (a) direct admission and (b) silence indicating acquiescence or acceptance of propositions put by the complainant).
68It was submitted that in this exchange the complainant refers to the incident giving rise to count 7 and it was submitted that the appellant appears to agree with the complainant's accusation and fails to deny any part of it.
69The appellant's responses are relied upon as an admission of sexual intercourse in relation to count 7.
70The trial judge summarised both the prosecution and defence arguments in relation to this evidence. However, the appellant complained to this Court that no directions were given in accordance with the relevant authorities and that contrary to Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; (1993) 178 CLR 193 at 210-211 no attempt was made to give directions in respect of particular aspects of the pretext conversations relied upon by the Crown which would precisely identify the particular response of the appellant that was said to constitute an ""admission of guilt."" It was further submitted that there were difficulties arising from the fact that no directions were given in respect of the appellant's repeated assertion that nothing happened until the complainant was older. 
71The appellant told the police in his ERISP that he never had oral or anal sex with the complainant. It was submitted to this Court that one possible inference was that by these denials to the police the appellant impliedly admitted in the pretext conversations that they did have both oral and anal sex, but only after the complainant was older. This would not involve an admission in relation to any of the offences charged against the appellant. It was submitted that these matters raised a need for careful directions to the jury regarding how they might use what the appellant had said and did not say in the pretext conversations.
72The directions which the trial judge gave were in the following terms:
""The next area which again the Crown says supports the complainant and as you would be well aware, Mr Flynn on behalf of the accused makes the opposite suggestion and I will come to that shortly, the pretext conversations. Specifically the Crown suggested to you that in those recorded conversations the accused at no time denied what the complainant was alleging. His responses were not, the Crown Prosecutor suggested, his responses were not what you would expect from a person confronted by extremely serious allegations of sexual assault of a young boy. The Crown Prosecutor invited you to listen again to all those calls in exhibit E but placed particular emphasis on the call at tab C and the call recorded at the face to face meeting in tab E.""
73No complaint or request for further direction on these matters was made at the trial. 
74It was submitted that the trial judge should have given directions regarding the manner in which the relevant conversations could be used. The appellant emphasised that in Barca v The Queen [1975] HCA 42; (1975) 133 CLR 82 Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ said at 107:
""It is trite law that a statement made in the presence of a party is only evidence against him of the truth of the matter asserted if he has in some way admitted its truth. If an accused person denies the truth of a statement when it is made and there is nothing in his conduct and demeanour from which the jury, notwithstanding his denial, could infer that he acknowledged its truth in whole or in part, it would accord with accepted practice to exclude the statement altogether: R v Christie (1914) AC 545 at p 565. In any case, where evidence is admitted of statements made in the presence of an accused it is in general desirable that the judge should explain to the jury that they can only use the statements as evidence of the truth of what was stated if they are satisfied that the accused has by his speech, silence or conduct admitted their truth.""
75The appellant submitted that in the present case the prosecution was effectively relying on the appellant's conduct, his demeanour and, in particular, his failure to unequivocally deny what was alleged against him, when confronted by the complainant to infer an admission or consciousness of guilt in relation to the offences charged. It was submitted that in these circumstances very careful directions are required to be given by the trial judge even if not requested by defence counsel: R v MMJ [2006] VSCA 226, (2006) 166 A Crim R 501 at [29]-[37] and [85]-[97]; R v ON [2009] QCA 62 at [40]-[42]; DJF v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 6 at [10]-[11], [44] and [51]; see also R v Barrett [2007] VSCA 95; (2007) 171 A Crim R 315 at [36]-[46].
76It was submitted that the trial judge should have directed the jury that they should only use this evidence as an admission if they were satisfied that:
(a) in respect of any particular allegation made in the pretext conversation, the appellant had by his speech, silence or conduct admitted the truth of the allegation;
(b) to the extent that the Crown was relying on the appellant's silence or failure to deny an allegation, the circumstances were such that the appellant should have been expected to make a denial so that his reaction in failing to deny the allegation involved an admission of the truth of the allegation;
(c) the appellant's response in respect of any particular allegation was not explicable by such possible explanations as a desire to placate the complainant, or frustration, etc; and
(d) the admission related to the offences charged and not to the sexual contact admitted by the appellant in the ERISP.
77Finally it was submitted that the jury should have been directed that it would not be open to the jury to use the evidence as an admission of guilt in relation to any particular count on the indictment. At the highest it was submitted it could only be used as evidence that showed the nature of the relationship between the appellant and the complainant and placed the evidence of particular conduct into context.
78In response to the appellant's submissions the respondent submitted that it was apparent from both the submissions of counsel and the directions of the trial judge that the jury were not being asked to infer from the pretext conversations that the appellant admitted any particular offence. The respondent emphasised that the trial judge was careful to remind the jury on a number of occasions that they needed to be satisfied of all of the elements of any particular count before returning a guilty verdict on that count. In this respect the trial judge told the jury that the Crown case depended upon acceptance of the complainant as ""an honest and accurate witness in so far as the essential elements of these charges are concerned."" Accordingly, it was submitted there was no risk of the jury impermissibly using the evidence as capable of establishing any particular count on the indictment.
79It was submitted that the requirement for a trial judge to give directions of the kind described in Edwards should not be elevated to a rule of universal application whenever a response to an accusatory statement is capable of being treated as an admission of guilt. Although the respondent accepted that it may have been preferable for the trial judge to have directed the jury as to the specific admissions relied upon by the Crown, it was submitted that her Honour's failure to do so was not erroneous.
80Although the appellant's counsel did not raise the issue at the trial I am satisfied that in the circumstances of this case the trial has miscarried. It is apparent from the excerpts from the pretext conversations which I have included in these reasons that, both from the answers given, and the circumstances in which they took place, it was possible to infer that the appellant was admitting conduct which may have constituted an offence. The prosecution sought to rely on some of the responses by the appellant and his lack of denial of some allegations as evidence of his guilt of the counts in the indictment. However, the jury were given no guidance by the trial judge as to how the evidence could be utilised by them, in particular if it could be utilised in respect of any particular offence. If, as the prosecutor submitted, the utility for the prosecution case was confined to an admission of oral and anal sex on some occasion, this was not evidence of itself relevant to prove any particular count in the indictment. This should have been made plain to the jury.
81To my mind the trial judge was required to approach this issue in the manner that was endorsed by the Victorian Court of Appeal in MMJ. In that matter Warren CJ said:
""In R v Gallagher; [(1997) 96 A Crim R 300] this Court held that the silence of an accused to an implicating question over the telephone was admissible. Ashley AJA, with whom Brooking JA agreed, held that the trial judge was not asked to exclude the subject evidence and no exception was taken, therefore, the applicant could not in the circumstance rely on the point on an application for leave to appeal where it had not been raised below. Callaway JA took a different view [see R v Gallagher; (1997) 96 A Crim R 300 at 315]. Ashley AJA in Gallagher considered Salahattin and Alexander and characterised the silence of the applicant as falling into the domain of consciousness of guilt [R v Gallagher; (1997) 96 A Crim R 300 at 329].
In my view, the silence of the applicant to the question of B when watching television is properly characterised as a consciousness of guilt matter. The case against the applicant turned on the credibility of A. The silence of the applicant to B's question was, in effect, used by the prosecution to do two things; first, to corroborate A's evidence; secondly, to portray the applicant's silence as an admission or consciousness of his guilt. On the authorities, silence may constitute an admission [eg see R v Salahattin [1983] 1 VR 521; R v Alexander [1994] 2 VR 249; R v Gallagher [1998] 2 VR 671; (1997) 96 A Crim R 300]. It may be put on the same plane as a lie or post-offence conduct [eg see the discussion in JD Heydon, ""Silence as evidence"" [1974] 1 Mon. U.L.R 53, 56, 58, 60]. Consistently for some years now, the Courts have moved to treat silence as consciousness of guilt cases generally requiring appropriate directions to the jury [see R v Gallagher [1998] 2 VR 671 at 698-699; (1997) 96 A Crim R 300 at 329]. In R v Nguyen (2001) 118 A Crim R 479 Winneke P said:
'However, where the conduct is being used, and if capable of being used, to prove guilt, the trial judge must, in my view, be astute to the clear possibility that the jury will so use it, and to give such directions as are needed to ensure that it is not misused.'
Analogous to the Edwards [v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193; 68 A Crim R 349] situation, the silence of the applicant here was relied on by the prosecution to constitute an admission. The majority in Edwards  set out the obligation on the trial judge as to direction on a lie (and here I would substitute the conduct of silence, the turning and looking at B, then the turning away to resume watching television as requiring specific direction). Direction, it was said in Edwards was required on the circumstances and events constituting the applicant's conduct, instruction to take account of those matters only if satisfied that it reveals knowledge of the offence and that the applicant acted as he did because he knew he could otherwise be implicated. In my view, the case have revealed a clarification of the silence situation and development beyond the approach taken in Salahattin and Alexander.""
82As was made plain by the trial judge's directions, the prosecutor did seek to use the pretext conversations and the alleged failure of the appellant to deny the allegations the complainant put to him to support the complainant's evidence in respect of particular charges. The appellant's responses were described as ""not what you would expect from a person confronted by extremely serious allegations of sexual assault of a young boy."" However, to the extent that the appellant's responses, or lack of them, could be understood to be admissions, they could not amount to admissions of particular offences, particularly those which were alleged to have occurred when the complainant was less than ten years of age.
83In my opinion, the trial judge was required to give directions which identified the particular aspects of the pretext conversations which were relied upon by the Crown as constituting an ""admission of guilt"" of any of the counts. The jury should have been directed to consider those particular parts of the conversation in the context of the whole conversation. Careful directions were required to remind the jury of available alternative explanations for the appellant's answers including the implicit acceptance that on occasions they had had both oral and anal sex. The jury should have been reminded to consider whether or not those responses were in the context of a mature relationship rather than one in breach of the law and accordingly, whether they supported the complainant's evidence with respect to any particular alleged offence.
84Apart from these difficulties there was a risk that the jury would engage in tendency reasoning. This is a common problem in cases involving allegations of a number of sexual assaults over a period of time. The problems have been discussed in many cases: see HM v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 235 CLR 334; Qualtieri v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 95; (2006) 171 A Crim R 463. It may be, as the court said in Rolfe v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 155; (2007) 173 A Crim R 168, that where the defence is that there was never any sexual activity at all, evidence of such activity on an occasion other than that which has been charged may be relevant to prove the particular acts charged. In that case Giles J said that ""the jury could regard it as relating to, or at least encompassing, the charged sexual conduct and supporting that the charged sexual conduct occurred"" [67]. However, in the present case it was not in dispute that there had been sexual activity between the complainant and the appellant, although the precise nature of that activity and the occasions on which it occurred were disputed. In particular the jury had to decide whether the activity alleged by the complainant had taken place before he turned ten years or sixteen years. It may be, as the prosecutor asserted, that the appellant did not deny what the complainant was asserting. However, the nature of the assertions and the significance of the response and its relationship to any of the particular charges was not considered.
85Furthermore, although the trial judge did warn the jury about not using evidence which the complainant gave of other ""uncharged acts of a sexual kind"" as evidence of a tendency of the accused to commit offences of the type charged, her Honour did not warn the jury against this form of reasoning with respect to the pretext evidence.
Ground 3: The trial judge erred in failing properly to direct the jury regarding what was said by the complainant in the ""pretext conversations.""
86In support of this ground the appellant submitted that the jury should have been reminded that they could not use the complainant's statements, assertions or allegations in the various conversations for any purpose other than to provide a context for the answers given by the appellant. 
87Defence counsel in his final address had submitted to the jury that the mere repetition of the allegations did not make them true. However, the trial judge did not direct the jury not to use what the complainant said as evidence of the facts asserted nor give them a warning that repetition of the allegations did not make them more reliable.
88In my opinion this submission should also be accepted.
89The respondent submitted to this Court that the jury would not have misused the evidence in the manner contemplated by the appellant. It was submitted that the jury could not have been under the impression that the complainant's repeated accusations in the recorded conversations corroborated his evidence. The respondent emphasised that the prosecutor did not use the evidence in this way but rather told the jury ""the pretext conversations are ... not a substitution for (the complainant's) evidence."" The respondent emphasised that rather than there being a danger that the jury would treat the complainant's accusations as truth of their content, defence counsel pointed out the inconsistencies between the complainant's evidence at the trial and what he said in the recorded conversations and sought to capitalise on the repetition and nature of the allegations in the recorded conversations in challenging the complainant's credibility. It was further submitted that her Honour diminished the impact of the evidence in the conversations when she reminded the jury that the complainant knew he was being recorded during the conversations but the appellant did not.
90Notwithstanding the manner in which the prosecutor dealt with the evidence I am satisfied that there was a real risk in the present case that the jury would misuse the conversations. I have myself listened to the recording of the conversations and I am satisfied that unless reminded of the context in which they were put into evidence a juror would be likely to put considerable weight upon the assertions made by the complainant in the course of these conversations. Both the manner in which the assertions were made, and their repetition had the potential to distract the jury from the purpose for which they could be used. 
91The recorded conversations had the potential to impact the mind of a juror both because of the appellant's response but, and to my mind this would be more powerful, because of the manner and content of the assertions made by the complainant. The jury should have been warned that the complainant's assertions could not be used as evidence in the prosecution case.
The proviso
92The respondent submitted that in the event that the court was persuaded that an error had occurred this Court should not intervene. It was submitted that Rule 4 should be applied as the appellant failed to raise the points now taken at the trial. The respondent relied upon the often quoted remarks of McHugh J in Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37;(1999) 196 CLR 297 at [72]. It was submitted that the absence of a request for a further direction by counsel at the trial was a clear indication that in the context of the trial there was no reasonable basis for concern regarding the adequacy of the trial judge's directions. It was further submitted that this Court should apply the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It was submitted that no substantial miscarriage of justice actually occurred.
93When considering this issue it is important to appreciate that the case against the appellant was almost entirely confined to the evidence of the complainant. This is almost always the case in relation to allegations of sexual assault. Accordingly, it was important for the jury to be able to assess the credibility and reliability of the complainant's evidence. To my mind the challenge from the complainant's mother was of little consequence but the pretext conversations were likely, unless appropriately considered by the jury, to have a significant impact upon their preparedness to accept the evidence of the complainant. Unless proper directions were given in relation to those conversations there was a real risk that the jury may have reached its conclusion upon an inappropriate basis. Accordingly, I am satisfied that this Court should grant leave to appeal. It is apparent that the jury enjoyed an advantage in seeing the complainant give evidence which is not available to this Court. However, I am satisfied that there is a chance that the verdict may have been different if the jury had been given appropriate directions in relation to the pretext conversations: see Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [44]; AK v The State of Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; (2008) 232 CLR 438.
Time
94The appeal was lodged some months out of time. The explanation for the delay is founded in ignorance by the appellant's solicitor of the necessity to file a notice of intention to appeal. A notice of appeal was in fact filed very shortly after the transcript of the trial was available, which was necessary before counsel could give advice as to whether or not an appeal had any prospects of success. In these circumstances I am satisfied that this Court should grant leave to appeal out of time. 
Orders
95In my opinion leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal allowed, the convictions quashed and a new trial ordered.
96LATHAM J:  I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.
97HARRISON J:  I agree with the conclusions of the Chief Judge and with the orders that he proposes.

		30 April 2013",2012-03-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758843,R v Andrew Iskandar & R v Nita Iskandar (No. 4) [2012] NSWSC 149,"Judgment 

1On 28 November 2011 a jury convicted Andrew Iskandar of the murder of Mohd Shah Saemin on or about 21 February 2010. On 29 November 2011 a jury convicted Nita Iskandar of being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Mohd Shah Saemin in that between 21 and 24 February 2010 she did assist Andrew Iskandar. 

The facts 

2I find the following facts. Those facts which are found against the offenders have been found by me to be beyond reasonable doubt, and those in their favour on the balance of probabilities. 

3Nita Iskandar and Hazairin Iskandar were born in Indonesia. They were married in 1984 and moved to Australia some three months later. The marriage appears to have been an arranged marriage. There was only one child of the marriage being Andrew Iskandar. Andrew was born in Sydney on 16 May 1990. He was, therefore, 19 at the time of the offence. The family have lived at Croydon since about 1984. 

4Hazairin worked as a taxi driver and Nita came to work as a clerk in the Malaysian Consulate in Sydney in 2000. The marriage was not a particularly happy one. There is conflicting evidence about whether Hazairin behaved violently towards Nita but, if he did, it seems to have been of a relatively minor nature. Nita told the Clinical Psychologist, Terry Smith, that the marriage was a loveless one on her part because her husband could not communicate nor consider her relationship needs. She said he was very controlling in all aspects of her life. She said, however, that she believed he loved her. 

5The Deceased Mohd Shah Saemin (known as Shah) commenced employment with the Malaysian Consulate in 2006. He had a second job driving buses to and from the Airport. By early 2008 he and Nita appeared to have commenced having an affair. In the middle of 2009 Nita apparently requested a divorce from Hazairin but he refused because he still loved her. Hazairin was aware of the affair she was having and confronted the Deceased about it. 

6It appears that the affair became reasonably public within the Indonesian community in Sydney. 

7The Crown alleged a joint criminal enterprise between Hazairin and Andrew in relation to the killing of the Deceased. There was, undoubtedly, such a joint criminal enterprise and, as I shall make clear, such an enterprise was in existence by no later than the evening leading up to the death of the Deceased. What is more difficult to determine is precisely when, before that evening, the enterprise commenced. The evidence makes clear that Hazairin had set things in train to take some action against the Deceased at least a week before when he hired a rental car, but when Andrew became privy to and involved in what Hazairin seems to have planned is unclear. 

8On 14 February 2010 Hazairin and Andrew went to the Kings Cross Branch of Budget Car Rentals. Hazairin effected the hiring of a car whilst Andrew sat on one of the chairs in the office. Hazairin was asked by the Budget representative if Andrew was to be an additional driver, but Hazairin said that Andrew was his son and that he was too young. 

9At some time during the following week Hazairin and Andrew went in the rental car to the vicinity of the Malaysian Consulate in Woollahra. They parked the car in such a position that they could observe people and vehicles leaving the Consulate. Andrew took a photograph on his mobile phone from the front passenger seat of the car. The photograph depicts his father in the driver's seat, and the front of a property with a distinctive object on its front fence, probably only 100 metres from the Malaysian Consulate, can be seen in the background. 

10Andrew claimed that he took this photograph because his father had taken him for a driving lesson and was showing him how to reverse park. The photograph, he said, was to enable him to see where, as a driver, he should be looking when he was reverse parking. This explanation for Hazairin and Andrew's presence at this location and the photograph must be rejected for a number of reasons. First, when the Iskandars lived at Croydon it is difficult to understand why Hazairin would give Andrew a driving lesson in Woollahra unless they were there for some other reason. Secondly, the car was a rental car and Andrew was not entitled to drive it whether because he was not approved as an additional driver or because he was a learner. Thirdly, contrary to Andrew's evidence, the photograph does not show Hazairin looking in the position Andrew described as demonstrating a reverse park. 

11I find that the purpose of the presence of Hazairin and Andrew in the vicinity of the Malaysian consulate on that day was to spy upon either the Deceased or Nita or both of them. That finding necessarily carries with it the conclusion (which I also find) that at that time Andrew knew that his mother was having an affair with the Deceased. There is not sufficient evidence to find, however, beyond reasonable doubt that there was a joint criminal enterprise at that time to kill the Deceased or commit grievous bodily harm upon him. 

12During the late afternoon and evening of 21 February there were a number of telephone calls and/or text messages passing between Andrew and Hazairin including a text message from Andrew to Hazairin which simply said ""?"". The Crown case was that this text concerned the planned murder and an enquiry from Andrew to Hazairin when it was to happen. It is not possible to reach a concluded view about what that message meant. 

13Andrew and Hazairin left their home at some time late on the night of Sunday, 21 February 2010 in the rental car. They were both wearing similar clothing being dark hooded jackets. In the car was a knife and a hammer, possibly a crowbar and possibly a tool box. Andrew's explanation of how those implements were in the car was that Hazairin's taxi had broken down in Arncliffe on 20 February, Hazairin had rung him to say he needed Andrew to accompany him to help fix the taxi, Hazairin had then travelled to Croydon, put the tools in the rental car, taken Andrew with him in the rental car to the taxi, fixed the taxi with no help from Andrew, and then they had driven home in the taxi leaving the rental car in Arncliffe which Hazairin later retrieved. The explanation was that the tools must have been left in the rental car from that time. Andrew said, however, that he did not know any of the tools were in the car until the altercation with the Deceased began. I do not accept this account of how the weapons came to be in the car. I find that Andrew knew they were in the car before he and his father left home that night because they intended to use them on the Deceased. 

14They drove over to the vicinity of Cromwell and Marion Sts in Leichhardt to wait for the Deceased to arrive home from his night job as an airport bus driver. When the Deceased arrived in that vicinity he parked his car on the western side of Cromwell St a short distance north of an electricity utility box. 

15Either immediately before, or at the same time as, the Deceased alighted from his car, Hazairin drove the rental car at the Deceased's car and hit it at the rear. Thereafter both Hazairin and Andrew alighted from the rental car. Hazairin had a knife and Andrew had a hammer. They proceeded to assault the Deceased. The Deceased ran in a south-easterly direction towards Marion St passing close to the eastern corner of Cromwell St where it adjoins Marion St. He then ran across Marion St in a diagonal fashion in a south-easterly direction towards his house at number 2/24 Marion St. Hazairin and Andrew chased him. 

16At the time the Deceased parked his car he was speaking on his mobile phone to Nita Iskandar. She heard the crash when Hazairin drove into the Deceased's car. She heard the Deceased cry out for help. The phone line remained open during the time the Deceased ran across the road because at one point Nita heard a woman's voice screaming out something about a hammer. That voice must have been the voice of Nada Bailey who came upon the scene where Hazairin and Andrew were attacking the Deceased. 

17Nada Bailey was walking down Marion St from Norton St on the southern side. As she approached the intersection with Cromwell St she saw three men who were running across Marion St from the direction of Cromwell St. The two men on either side of the man in the middle appeared to be kicking him very hard. The man in the middle was trying to get away. He ran over towards Ms Bailey, and he was calling out ""help, help me"". She said the man tripped over the gutter as he approached her, and he fell to the ground outside number 28 Marion Street. She noticed his shirt was all wet. 

18She shouted to the other two men to leave him alone but they continued to run after him. When he fell she tried to cover him with her body but one or both (she was not sure) of the two attackers kicked her out of the way into the gutter. One of the men was bashing him with a hammer like bashing a piece of meat. The other man stood to one side holding a small black object like a small bar. I am satisfied from other evidence that this object was the knife used to stab the Deceased. 

19Whilst this was happening Janine Cahill was walking down the southern side of Marion Street. She saw what she thought at first were two men running across Marion St from Cromwell Street. As she continued walking she saw two men attacking a third man who was on the ground. She also saw Ms Bailey trying to protect the man on the ground. When she was about level with 18 Marion Street she rang 000 and asked for the police. She then yelled at the attackers telling them she had rung the police. She saw one of the men striking the Deceased very hard with a weapon a number of times. Then the two men ran off in the direction of Cromwell Street. 

20The police were first notified at 11.53pm and arrived at the scene a short time afterwards. In the meantime Ms Cahill was performing CPR on the Deceased but she thought he was dead. Constable Hickey took over performing CPR until the ambulance arrived within minutes. The Deceased was pronounced dead at 12.05 am. 

21The police had noticed the Deceased's silver Volvo in Cromwell St with the door open. Nita Iskandar later told Constable Hickey that it looked like the car the Deceased drove. Inspection of that car and its surrounds determined that it was the Deceased's car. It was damaged at the back where it had been struck by the rental car driven by Hazairin. A clump of what turned out later to be the Deceased's hair was found, and there was a trail of blood leading from that car across both Cromwell and Marion Sts. The police also located a hammer lying on the ground near the car. That hammer was later found to contain the DNA of Andrew Iskandar. 

22The Post Mortem report makes it clear that the Deceased was both struck with a weapon consistent with being a hammer, and stabbed with a long-blade knife. The cause of death was a stab wound to the chest area which pierced his Vena Cava, the main vein carrying blood back to the heart. I find that it was Andrew Iskandar that struck the Deceased repeatedly with the hammer but it was Hazairin who stabbed him. 

23Andrew gave evidence which can be summarised as follows. His father took him out on the night of the killing for a driving lesson in the rental car. After they ate dinner at about 11.00 pm at an Indian restaurant in Marion St, his father drove the car round and round in Leichhardt and then they parked in Cromwell St. When the Deceased arrived and parked his car in Cromwell St a short distance in front, Hazairin drove into it. Hazairin then alighted from the rental car and told the Deceased not to ""walk with my wife again"". The Deceased, after verbally abusing Hazairin, then physically attacked him. Up until this time Andrew had repeatedly asked his father what he was doing driving around, parking and crashing into the Deceased's car, but Hazairin told him to be quiet. Andrew then alighted from the car to go to his father's assistance. At one point his father handed him a hammer from the car and when the Deceased started punching Andrew Hazairin told Andrew to hit the Deceased with the hammer. Andrew did so once, striking him on the forehead, and then he dropped the hammer. 

24Hazairin then tried to get something from the toolbox in the back of the rental car but the Deceased slammed the door on Hazairin's arm, dislocating it. 

25The Deceased then ran across towards the flats on the corner of Cromwell and Marion Sts, and thereafter across Marion St. Hazairin chased him with Andrew following 15 metres behind. Then Andrew observed the Deceased lying on the ground. Hazairin was holding a knife in his left hand and a hammer in his right hand. He saw his father stab the Deceased with the knife and hit him with the hammer. Andrew was standing back holding a crow bar. While he was standing there a woman (who must have been Nada Bailey) came onto the road and pushed him. He then ran back to the rental car. 

26The jury must have rejected this account of the events. I find, beyond reasonable doubt, that it is false. As to the events on the southern side of Marion St, the account is not only inconsistent with the evidence of Nada Bailey and Janine Cahill, but also of other witnesses who saw the events from vantage points in surrounding properties. It is also inconsistent with what Andrew Iskandar said to Victor Lau the following morning when he endeavoured to get him to agree to give a false alibi, and with what he told Esau Maiava in prison. 
27Although Mr Maiava's evidence must be treated with some care I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Andrew told Mr Maiava that he and his father planned to kill the Deceased, that they had to wait until they knew when the Deceased arrived home from work, that they went to the vicinity of the Deceased's house on the night in question to await his arrival, that when he arrived home Hazairin drove into the Deceased's car, that the Deceased got out of his car to run away, and that both Hazairin and Andrew attacked and killed him, Hazairin with a knife and Andrew with a hammer. I accept that Andrew told Mr Maiava that he did it because his mother was having an affair and he couldn't handle that fact. I accept that Andrew told Mr Maiava he intended to beat the case by blaming it all on his father. 

28I accept this evidence of Mr Maiava for a few reasons. First, the detail of it is such that it could only have been told to him by Andrew. Secondly, Mr Maiava made a contemporaneous note in his diary of the substance of what he said Andrew told him. Thirdly, some parts of it including Andrew's concern over his mother's affair and that he and his father acted jointly is corroborated by what he said to Mr Lau when trying to get him to provide a false alibi - that is, ""me and my dad killed some guy...we chased him...we crashed his car ... smacked him with a hammer and a knife"". 

29The concern Andrew expressed to Mr Lau and Mr Maiava about his mother's affair was also consistent with evidence Andrew gave, that it was Andrew's religious belief that someone committing adultery is a big deal for someone from an Islamic perspective, that it was a terribly shameful thing from an Islamic point of view, that the woman involved was doing the wrong thing, and that the man should not be doing it. 

30I find that by no later than when Andrew and Hazairin left home that night they were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise to kill the Deceased. Their motive in doing so was to punish him for being in a relationship with Nita Iskandar. It is clear from the evidence of Mr Lau and Mr Maiava that the planning must have preceded the night of the killing and that there was a joint criminal enterprise from earlier than that night, but the evidence does not allow me to say how much earlier it began. 

31At this point I should say something about Nada Bailey and Janine Cahill. They were exceptionally brave and selfless women. Without any concern for their own safety they came to the aid of a man being viciously assaulted by two men who had, and were perceived by these women to have, lethal weapons. It was very late at night and there were apparently no other persons in the vicinity. Ms Bailey even attempted to protect the man with her own body from further assaults, and was herself assaulted by being kicked into the gutter. It is my recommendation that the appropriate authorities give consideration to recognising these women for bravery. 

32I turn now to consider Nita Iskandar's involvement. The Crown pointed to two matters which were said to constitute the assistance Nita provided to Andrew in an endeavour to help him evade justice for what he had done. First, the Crown asserted that she lied to police when she told them Andrew was at home at the time of the killing. Secondly, the Crown asserts that she did various things, including the provision of money to Andrew, to enable him to flee to Indonesia a few days after the killing. 

33I return now to the facts. Having heard what she did whilst on the telephone to the Deceased, Nita realised that something was wrong. She immediately drove from her home to the Deceased's house in Marion St. She arrived within minutes of the Deceased's being pronounced dead. She tried to get near to the Deceased, telling the police that it was her brother, but she was restrained. She told the police that she had been on the phone to him at the time he was attacked, and that she heard him yelling ""Somebody help me"". 

34Before she returned home that morning Nita spoke to Detective King. When he asked her if she should ring anyone as a support person before he interviewed her, she said that her husband was working and Andrew was at home asleep. She maintained that position about Andrew in her ERISP on 23 February, although she then elaborated by saying that she had actually seen Andrew asleep in bed when she left the house to go to Leichhardt after she heard the attack on the phone. 

35In my opinion on the night of the killing Nita honestly believed that Andrew was in bed at home when she left to drive to Leichhardt. A few things suggest that. First, she left a note on the bottom of a tissue box for Andrew telling him where she was going. Secondly, the first telephone call she made to Andrew from Marion St, after she knew the Deceased was dead, was to the Iskandar home phone to speak to Andrew. It was only when that call went unanswered that she rang Andrew on his mobile moments later. Those things were spontaneous acts for which the only alternative explanation could be that, knowing before she left home that Andrew was involved in the murder, she contrived to give him an alibi in those ways. Since she told no-one of the attempted phone call to Andrew on the home phone, she would have to have realised that phone records might be examined and would support her false alibi. That is fanciful. There is no evidence which provides any support for that alternative explanation. 

36Further, it is true that Nita had seen Andrew in his bedroom earlier in the evening. She then retired to her own room, and the layout of the house makes it perfectly possible that Andrew could have left the house through the back door without her knowing it. On the night of the killing she held an honest belief that Andrew was at home at the time the Deceased was attacked and killed. 

37At some time thereafter Nita realised that Andrew was involved in the killing. This must have been no later than at some point during Nita's ERISP because that concluded at 11.00pm on 23 February, and in the early hours of 24 February, not long after she returned home, Nita rang a friend who was a travel agent to try to organise plane tickets to Indonesia. 

38There is another event which might suggest Nita knew earlier of Andrew's involvement. At 7.06am on 22 February she spoke to Hazairin on the telephone. Andrew said that he heard her say ""You have poisoned the child"". That is a remark strongly suggestive of knowledge in Nita that Andrew was, at the very least, present when Hazairin killed the Deceased. 
Its significance is that her ERISP was conducted on the following day, and she told the police in that interview that she had seen Andrew in bed on the night concerned when, clearly, he was not there, even on his own sanitised account of the events. 

39Mr Price of Counsel, who appeared for Nita, addressed the jury on the statement about poisoning the child. He said what it must have meant was that by what he had done Hazairin had poisoned Andrew's life, a young man due to start University that week. When regard is had to the two telephone calls between Nita and Hazairin after his arrest, this explanation of the statement is not entirely far-fetched. In those telephone calls the concern of both parents was for Andrew's protection and welfare, including protection from the embarrassment that publicity about Hazairin's involvement in the killing of the Deceased would bring to Andrew. Those calls could be interpreted as planning for his flight from Australia but they might have had an innocent purpose, namely, his general welfare in the light of what, by that time, Nita knew Hazairin had done. In those circumstances I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the statement about poisoning the child demonstrated knowledge on Nita's part of Andrew's involvement in the killing. I do not find, therefore, that Nita lied in her ERISP about where Andrew was on the night of the killing. 

40In my opinion her assistance to Andrew is confined to the provision of money to leave Australia and relatively minor associated acts such as endeavouring to arrange tickets for him through her travel agent friend. 

41Andrew Iskandar's evidence was that his father rang him from custody and told him he should go to Indonesia to bring some of his father's relatives to Australia. His father told him there was money for all the airfares under a pillow in the bedroom. Andrew's evidence was that that was where the money came from. 

42The jury must have rejected this evidence. This was not at all surprising because the jury had seen the DVD of the execution of the search warrant at the Iskandar home. It was clear beyond doubt from that DVD that there was no money under or in any pillow in the house. The DVD further demonstrated from the thoroughness of the police search that there was no money elsewhere in the house. The jury must have concluded, and I so find beyond reasonable doubt, that the source of the money given to Andrew to enable him to fly out of Australia was Nita Iskandar. 

Subjective features 

(1) Andrew Iskandar 

43Andrew Iskandar was examined by Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist, on 20 October 2011 during the course of his trial. He was examined by Mr Sam Borenstein, a clinical psychologist, on 31 January 2012. Andrew told both the psychiatrist and the psychologist that both his parents disciplined him physically. Hazairin appears to have been a controlling, demanding and strict father. Andrew claimed to be fearful of him and fearful of not complying with his father's demands because a failure to comply led to verbal and, at times, physical abuse. 

44Both of these professionals make reference to Andrew suffering from depression although Dr Neilssen thought it was in partial remission. Mr Borenstein considered that Andrew Iskandar was depressed when he saw him. Of course, by that time, Andrew had been convicted of murder. 

45To the extent that the history given by Andrew to each of these professionals was the basis for their conclusions, I have some concerns because of the inconsistencies in those histories. He told Dr Neilssen that he had witnessed violence between his parents but said the police and child welfare agencies were never called. On the other hand he told Mr Borenstein that his parents frequently fought and there were occasions when police were called to the house as a result of the fighting. 

46He told both Dr Nielssen and Mr Borenstein of a suicide attempt he made in gaol which was prevented by his cellmate. He also described a suicide attempt at the age of 16 to Mr Borenstein but said nothing at all about this to Dr Nielssen. 

47He told Dr Nielssen that his parents were sociable and were involved in the Indonesian community in Sydney but he told Mr Borenstein that he and his family had few social outlets. 

48He told Dr Nielssen that he had never had a girlfriend because his father, who was a strict Muslim, did not permit him to socialise with girls. He told Mr Borenstein that it was his mother who told him he was not permitted to have a girlfriend and was not permitted to socialise with the opposite sex. 

49What is consistent in these reports is that Andrew was brought up by two strict parents both of whom inflicted physical punishments on him when they considered it appropriate. If he is to be believed, those physical punishments went beyond what ordinary people would consider appropriate discipline. Further, it is apparent that his parents' marriage was not a happy one, and his father was a very controlling individual as far as Andrew was concerned. 

50Andrew also recounted to the professionals intrusive behaviour on his mother's part when he was aged between 10 and 18, where she would regularly examine his genitals to see that they were in working order, and she would make enquiries about his bodily functions. It was difficult to reconcile this with the obvious strong rapport between Andrew and his mother throughout the trial and the way he spoke about her in his evidence. Whilst I note this matter in relation to Andrew, the professionals do not draw any conclusions from it. Nor can I. I do not have any regard to it as far as Nita is concerned. 

51What he told the professionals about his mother generally does not sit easily with the evidence he gave in Court where he described his mother as a good mother who just encouraged him to do well in his schooling. He told the professionals that she made him study all of the time, indeed watching over him for hours whilst he studied, and that he was expected to undergo a considerable amount of extra tutoring. He also told Mr Borenstein that once when he fell asleep whilst studying she hit him with a broomstick which left bruises. He also recounted an incident where he said she punched him in the head without explanation when he was purchasing fish and chips for lunch. I note these matters when considering Andrew's background but I do not use them against Nita who has had no ability to respond to them. 

52Despite the inconsistencies in the histories I accept the conclusion of Dr Nielssen and Mr Borenstein that Andrew has suffered from a depressive illness for which he is still being treated. Mr Borenstein attributes this largely to the verbal and physical abuse he was subjected to as a child. 

53The significant conclusion to which Dr Nielssen came was that, based on the account provided by Andrew: 

It seems likely that he committed the offence in part because he was obliged to his father and afraid of him. 

Mr Borenstein said that he concurred with this observation. 

54The difficulty about this conclusion is that it was not consistent, for the large part, with the evidence that Andrew gave during the trial. Certainly he was in the car with his father at Cromwell Street, Leichhardt, although, on his account of things, that was by a mutual arrangement for a driving lesson, at least up until the time his father commenced driving after dinner. Thereafter the only evidence he gave of doing anything at his father's behest was hitting the Deceased with the hammer after he (Andrew) had voluntarily come to his father's assistance, and ringing Victor Lau to arrange a false alibi. He gave no evidence that his father required him to take part in the killing of the Deceased nor to do other than strike him the one blow with the hammer. He did not suggest in any way to Mr Lau nor Mr Maiava that he had acted at his father's behest when he described to them what had happened. Indeed, what I conclude from their evidence is that he (Andrew) wanted to deal with the Deceased because he could not handle the idea of his mother having an affair with the Deceased. 

55I can accept, however, that his father is likely to have been the moving influence in what was arranged and perpetrated. On all of the psychiatric and psychological evidence his father was a dominant and controlling man, and Andrew was to some extent scared of him, and certainly scared of incurring his displeasure. On the balance of probabilities I find that Andrew followed his father's lead in what was done by reason of the unequal relationship. Nevertheless, I find beyond reasonable doubt that Andrew's own motive in acting as he did coincided with his father's motive. 

56Nothing that appears in the reports of Dr Nielssen and Mr Borenstein justifies the conclusion that they reach. The conclusion is contrary to all of the evidence in the case. I find beyond reasonable doubt that Andrew's involvement in the murder was not as a result of any direction, order or pressure from his father or any feeling of obligation to him. 

57Andrew is the only son of his parents. He was born in Sydney and attended Croydon Park Public School, Sydney Technical High School in Bexley and then Ashfield Boys High School. He left high school in year 11 but returned to finish his Higher School Certificate over 3 years at TAFE with an ATAR of 69. He completed his HSC in 2009. He had enrolled in a Bachelor of Business and Commerce degree at the University of Western Sydney which was to commence on 9 February 2010. By reason of his flight to Singapore and his subsequent arrest he did not commence that course. 

58I was informed at the sentencing hearing that he has enrolled in a university degree in prison which I assume he is doing through distance education. No more details were provided. 

59But for one answer he gave in cross-examination at the trial I cannot find that Andrew has shown any remorse for what he did. He was asked by the Crown Prosecutor if he regretted that the Deceased died, and he said ""I wish he was still alive"". 

60It is noteworthy that, although Mr Borenstein expresses agreement with Dr Nielssen's observation that it seems likely Andrew committed the offence in part because he was obliged to his father and afraid of him, there is no mention in Mr Borenstein's reports of the offence itself or any response of Andrew to the killing. (Dr Nielssen's examination of Andrew took place during the trial, so I would not have expected any comment on the facts of the case in his report.) Andrew did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. The account of the night in question he gave at the trial did not contain any acknowledgement of his involvement in the offence apart from the one blow he struck with the hammer which he said was in self defence. 

61At the sentencing hearing a Statement by Detective Sergeant Munro, the Investigating Officer in relation to the Deceased's murder, was tendered in evidence. The Statement recorded an incident that Sergeant Munro said occurred on 16 November 2011 during the course of the trial. He was sitting in the public area of the Court with Janese Campbell, the ex-wife of the Deceased. 

62The Statement went on to say: 

[4] The jury retired for their luncheon break at the usual time of 1pm at the direction of His Honour Justice Davies. The accused was escorted back to the dock area and stood beside his mother. As the Jury members were still walking out of the Courtroom, the accused turned and looked at Janese Campbell and I. The last of the jury members were almost out of the Court and as such had their backs towards those remaining in the Courtroom. We were the only two people sitting at the rear of the Court, there were no other persons between Andrew Iskandar and us. When he turned and looked at us, he smirked, then laughed in an evil unremorseful way whilst still looking at us. Janese Campbell appeared shocked, as did I at his attitude towards the murder of Mohd Shah Saemin. Janese Campbell then mouthed the words ""You liar"" towards Andrew Iskandar. He then turned back, and was shortly after escorted out of the Courtroom by Corrective Services Officers. During the luncheon break I made notes in my diary on the A4 page allocated to the date of 16th November. 

63Sergeant Munro said on that day that Andrew Iskandar was giving evidence. Sergeant Munro was cross-examined about this statement and he said that he relayed the matter to the solicitor instructing the Crown Prosecutor on the day it happened. The solicitor gave evidence also that Sergeant Munro had spoken to her and related the events recorded in his Statement. 

64Sergeant Munro was cross-examined about his memory of this event. It was apparent from an examination of the transcript that he was mistaken about the fact that Andrew Iskandar was giving evidence on 16 November. On that day the transcript discloses that the Crown Prosecutor was giving her closing address to the jury. 

65Sergeant Munro is undoubtedly mistaken about what happened in Court on that day in terms of whether Andrew Iskandar gave evidence. However, the contemporaneous note made by Sergeant Munro in his diary for 16 November of the matters in his Statement together with the evidence of the instructing solicitor from the DPP satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that Sergeant Munro saw Andrew Iskandar doing what Sergeant Munro described as laughing and smirking at him and Ms Campbell on that day. 

66The question is what impact this behaviour should be regarded as having on any question of remorse. 

67In my opinion I should not attach any significance to this event. Drawing particular conclusions from the fact that somebody laughed is always fraught with danger. Concluding that a laugh is a smirk is a subjective matter. A statement that someone laughed in an ""evil, unremorseful way"" itself bespeaks a very subjective inference. Some people laugh when they are nervous and not for any malicious purpose. What is a smirk to one person might be a wry, ironic smile to another. Although Sergeant Munro honestly believed Andrew was behaving in a malicious fashion by his facial expression, I do not think that I can draw any such conclusion, at least beyond reasonable doubt. Had I seen it for myself it would have been inappropriate for me to draw such a conclusion, a fortiori, when I am hearing it from someone else. 

68The fact nevertheless remains that, apart from the one answer by Andrew in his evidence, I have no evidence upon which I can find that Andrew Iskandar has demonstrated any remorse. I note that Mr O'Sullivan of counsel for Andrew Iskandar informed me at the sentencing hearing that Andrew maintains that he is not guilty and is not expressing any remorse. 

(2) Nita Iskandar 

69Nita was born on 20 March 1963 in Indonesia. She is now aged almost 49 years. I have noted earlier her marriage and their coming to live in Australia. She had obtained a Bachelor of Teaching in Indonesia but she did not teach after settling in Australia. She worked in a factory here and undertook an advanced certificate of Accounting at TAFE. She commenced working at the Malaysian Consulate in Sydney as a clerk/typist in August 2001. She subsequently became Accounts Clerk at the Consulate. 

70Nita was examined by Terry Smith, a clinical psychologist, on 30 January 2012. What is apparent from the history taken by Mr Smith is that Nita appears to be in denial about a number of matters including Andrew's knowledge of her affair with the Deceased at the time he left for Indonesia after the killing and Andrew's involvement in the death of the Deceased. She denied that Andrew disclosed anything about his involvement in the Deceased's death before leaving for Indonesia, and she said that he went there only because Hazairin requested him to do so. She said that her husband got the money to pay for his departure, and she let Andrew go because he did not know about the affair and did not want him to find out about it from the media. She still maintained that Andrew was sleeping in the house when she left to go over to Leichhardt having heard the Deceased's cries for help on the telephone. 

71Her evidence to Mr Smith about her relationship with her husband did not sit easily in all respects with what she told the police in her ERISP. She told Mr Smith that there was no violence or trauma in the marriage but that her husband was very controlling. She told the police that he had hit her and that he spat at her. 

72She made clear to Mr Smith that the important thing in her life was to be there for Andrew. She also said: 

I did not lie: I believed my son was asleep at home when it happened, and that is what I believe to this day and I will believe it forever ... he did not know about my relationship with this man; all he knew we worked together ... I am very sorry a man has lost his life because of the jealousy of my husband: my heart grieves for his family and I have lost the man I love ... my sin to have a relationship has punished my family too much: I just want my son home. 

73Since the murder she said her life had been very bad. It led her to consult a psychiatrist and she has been prescribed with the antidepressant Mirtazapine. Mr Smith considered that she suffered a range of depressive and anxiety symptoms in relation to the anticipated difficulties about the refusal of her husband to grant a divorce and of her pursuing a highly desired relationship and marriage with the Deceased. He said, however, that these symptoms did not impair her capacity to function in her personal or vocational life. 

74Mr Smith said that Nita remains mortified that her son is apart from her care, and that she expressed suicidal intention if he is not returned to her care. She believes that her world will return to normal when her son is released from custody. Mr Smith expressed the opinion that if Andrew was incarcerated there might be a period of risk of self harm but once this passes it is expected she will steel herself and work to maintain the family home waiting for his return. 

75Mr Smith says the prognosis of Mrs Iskander appears to be based in the protective behaviours she can and will exhibit for the need of her son. He said her offending relates to protecting her son rather than to any positive criminal intent to breach any law. Her distorted logic and myopic emotional constriction about the needs of her son dominates her perceptions, and she could perhaps be convinced by him to say or do irregular things for him. This is a relevant matter for what sentence should be imposed. 

76Nita was also assessed by the Probation and Parole Service on 2 February 2012. The brief history she provided to them was consistent with what was provided to Mr Smith. She reiterated that she was certain that Andrew had been unaware of her extramarital affair. She said also that she did not believe that he had been involved in the death of the Deceased and, therefore, she did not believe that she was committing an offence by assisting him to leave the country. 

77The report disclosed that Nita has been under the care of a psychiatrist and also an occupational therapist. No reports were tendered on the sentencing hearing from these persons. The Probation and Parole report made telephone contact with the psychiatrist who reported that Nita presented depressive disorder and symptoms of post-traumatic stressors for which she has been prescribed Mirtazapine (as Mr Smith had noted). The dosage of this has been increased from 30mg to 45mg. 

78The report indicated that Nita was assessed as unlikely to require or benefit from supervision by the Probation and Parole Service because she was seeking psychological intervention of her own volition. It was said that there was little the Service could offer her beyond monitoring her attendance and compliance with its intervention. 

79Nita has no prior criminal record. 

Legal Principles 

(1) Nita Iskandar 

80Cases involving accessories after the fact to murder embrace a wide range of offending. Buddin J conveniently collected extracts from the relevant cases in R v Cowen [2008] NSWSC 104 at [15] - [26]. It is not necessary to set out all of those paragraphs. I draw attention, however, to what was said in R v Dileski [2002] NSWCCA 345 where Hidden J (with whom Adams J agreed) said: 

In many cases of this kind the offender's conduct is the product of emotional attachment or dependence, or a misguided sense of loyalty. No doubt, that accounts for most, if not all, of the cases in the Judicial Commission statistics which were disposed of otherwise than by fulltime custodial sentences. 

81Buddin J went on to point out that those remarks should not be taken to suggest that an offence which is committed out of a misguided sense of loyalty will inevitably lead to the imposition of a lenient penalty, and he referred to R v Ward [2004] NSWSC 420 at [49] - [51]. The reason for this is that, as Thomas JA observed in R v Hawken (1986) 27 A Crim R 42 at 38: 
... it is in the interests of the community that murderers should be completely isolated from support and deprived of assistance and that such crimes be not covered up. 

In that regard I cannot ignore the fact that the maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment. 

82What Nita did in this case was a serious act of assistance by enabling Andrew Iskandar to flee the jurisdiction. The result was that the authorities were put to the trouble and expense of having to fly to Singapore and to bring him back to Australia. It was assistance of the clearest kind with at least one of her intentions being to enable Andrew to evade or escape justice. 

83Nevertheless, as wrong as they were, her actions are understandable, if not excusable, as the actions of a mother to assist her only child. That must also be seen in the context of a loveless marriage. The impression I have from the reports of the professionals is that she lived only for her son. I cannot overlook the mixed emotions that must have influenced her actions. Her lover had been brutally slain even while she was on the telephone to him. She found out, relatively quickly, that her husband was one of the perpetrators. Her concern at that point was only for her son and how the events would impact upon him. He was due to start University that very week. When she came to realise that Andrew had some involvement her continuing thought was how she can protect him. If he was taken from her (by being imprisoned) she would have nothing to live for, as the report of Mr Smith makes clear. 

84In my opinion, the offending was low on the scale of objective seriousness. 

85I note s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides the Court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. Because of the nature of the offending, its success in enabling his (temporary) escape (see R v Mackett [2012] NSWSC 166 at [22]), and in the light of the fact that Nita Iskandar shows no evidence of remorse for the acts she committed (because she appears to be in denial about her son's involvement in the murder), I do not consider that any other sentence other than a period of imprisonment is appropriate. I consider that the appropriate period of imprisonment is for two years but that that sentence should be wholly suspended. I take that course for these reasons. First, Nita Iskandar has no prior criminal record. Secondly, subject to one matter she is unlikely ever to offend again. Thirdly, she has already undertaken treatment and counselling to deal with her emotional needs which might be thought to have brought about the offending in the first place. 

86The one matter concerning reoffending is the conclusion of Mr Smith that she could be convinced by Andrew to do irregular things for him. One consequence of the suspended sentence is that Nita will be subject to a bond for the period of the sentence. In my opinion, that period will be sufficient to enable Nita to adjust to Andrew's incarceration (as Mr Smith said), so that by the conclusion of the sentence her chances of reoffending will be very unlikely. 

87I note that Nita spent 15 days in custody after her arrest until her release on bail, such bail having been continued up to the present time. She is entitled to a credit of 15 days on the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed. 

(2) Andrew Iskandar 

88The starting point is that the death of a human being by any unlawful killing is one of the gravest offences against an ordered society: R v Bolt [2001] NSWCCA 487; (2001) 126 A Crim R 284 at 293. It is the responsibility of the Courts to protect and preserve human life and to punish those who unlawfully take it: R v Dawes [2004] NSWCCA 363 at [31]. 

89The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period in the present case of 20 years. I note what was said in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 at [17], [20], [25] - [27] and [29] of the way the standard non-parole period is to be dealt with. What remains unclear from Muldrock is whether any assessment should be made of where in the range of objective seriousness the offence lies: R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [19]. Nevertheless, since the High Court discussed how the objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed, that is without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders (see at [27]), it may reasonably be inferred that what appears to be a general proscription at [25] is more particularly directed to the two-stage approach to sentencing criticised in the judgment. 

90In assessing its objective seriousness wholly by reference to the nature of the offending, the murder in the present case must be regarded as a serious and brutal one aggravated by the weapons used, the fact that it was committed in company, and the extended period of the assault. 

91If one adds into the synthesis the motive for the murder its overall seriousness is increased. This murder has been described as an honour killing. So to describe it invests with it a degree of legitimacy that it does not, and can never, have. No society or culture that regards itself as civilised can tolerate to any extent, or make any allowance for, the killing of another person for such an amorphous concept as honour. Further, the whole basis and origin of honour killings is the notion that a woman is the chattel or possession of a man, whether her father, her husband, or some other patriarchal figure. Such a notion has no place in this country. 

92The motive for this murder means that general deterrence assumes some importance in the determination of the sentence. 

93Matters which I take into account as mitigating factors are Andrew's age at the commission of the offence, his relationship with his father, and the fact that he does not have any prior criminal record. 

94As to the first of these, in KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51 McClellan CJ at CL reviewed the authorities relating to sentencing juveniles. He said: 

[24] Although accepted to be of less significance than when sentencing adults, considerations of general deterrence and retribution cannot be completely ignored when sentencing young offenders. There remains a significant public interest in deterring antisocial conduct. In R v Pham & Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 Lee CJ at CL said (at 135): 

""It is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court's function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes , particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes... 

[25] The emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders, may be moderated when the young person has conducted him or herself in the way an adult might conduct him or herself and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity ( R v Bus, unreported, NSWCCA, 3 November 1995, Hunt CJ at CL; R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [9]-[10]; R v TJP [1999] NSWCCA 408 at [23]; R v LC [2001] NSWCCA 175 at [48]; R v AEM Snr, KEM and MM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [96]-[98]; R v Adamson (2002) 132 A Crim R 511 at [31]; R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182 at [16]). In determining whether a young offender has engaged in ""adult behaviour"" ( Voss at [14]), the court will look to various matters including the use of weapons, planning or pre-meditation, the existence of an extensive criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the offence ( Adamson at [31]-[32]). Where some or all of these factors are present the need for rehabilitation of the offender may be diminished by the need to protect society. 

[26] The weight to be given to considerations relevant to a person's youth diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity ( R v Hoang [2003] NSWCCA 380 at [45]). A 'child-offender' of almost eighteen years of age cannot expect to be treated substantially differently from an offender who is just over eighteen years of age ( R v Bus, unreported, NSWCCA, 3 November 1995; R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182 at [15]). However, the younger the offender, the greater the weight to be afforded to the element of youth ( Hearne at [27]). 

95Mr O'Sullivan has provided me with a summary of a number of cases involving young offenders aged between 15 and 20 sentenced for murder. 
I have had regard to this summary and noted the sentences, but ultimately every case must be judged on its own facts. 

96This was a grave crime committed with pre-planning and considerable violence, with weapons, and in company when Andrew was 19 years of age. His relative youth entitles him to some, but not great consideration, for the purposes of rehabilitation. 

97As far as his relationship with his father is concerned, I have discussed this earlier. It is, to a small degree, a matter of mitigation. 

98Mr O'Sullivan submitted that Andrew's involvement was such that I should see his conduct as less culpable than that of Hazairin, and that that was particularly so because it was Hazairin who was responsible for his death by stabbing him. Reference was made to R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49, and I note what is said there at [158] - [167]. In the light of the facts that I have found, including the repeated blows that were struck by Andrew with the hammer, I do not consider that there was less culpability simply because it was Hazairin's action that ultimately killed the Deceased. That may have been serendipitous. 

99Mr O'Sullivan also drew attention to the assessment of the psychiatrist and the psychologist that Andrew suffered and continues to suffer from a depressive illness. He submitted that general deterrence had a lesser role to play by reason of that illness. Those professionals do not, however, make any link between his depression and his involvement in the killing. Indeed, their only partial explanation of his involvement is the influence of his father that I have earlier discussed. 

100Mr O'Sullivan has urged upon me that I should find special circumstances because of Andrew's age, lack of criminal record and his prospects for rehabilitation. In R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 Spigelman CJ (with whom Mason P, Grove J, Newman A-J agreed, and Sully J in substance agreed in a short additional judgment) said: 

[59] ... The sentencing context in which [ the words ""special circumstances""] appear in the present legislation must be understood against the background of a long-standing line of decisions in the High Court, commencing with Power, [ Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623] which emphasises that the non-parole period is to be determined by what the sentencing judge concludes that all of the circumstances of the case, including the need for rehabilitation, indicate ought be the minimum period of actual incarceration. The proposition that the fixing of a non-parole period is a matter that is to be determined solely, or primarily, by reason of considerations of rehabilitation has long since been rejected. 

101I consider that there should be some small adjustment to the statutory ratio by reason of the special circumstances including Andrew's age, his lack of a criminal record and his prospects of rehabilitation. 

102Taking all of these matters into account I consider that the appropriate non-parole period is a period of 18 years with an additional term of 7 years. He has been in custody since his arrest in Singapore on 21 May 2010. His sentence will commence on that day. 

Sentence 

103Andrew Iskandar for the murder of Mohd Shah Saemin I sentence you to a minimum term of 18 years imprisonment commencing 21 May 2010 and expiring 20 May 2028 with an additional term of 7 years expiring 20 May 2035. 
104Nita Iskandar for being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Mohd Shah Saemin I sentence you to imprisonment for 1 year 11 months and 15 days commencing 16 March 2012 and expiring 28 February 2014, such sentence to be wholly suspended. You are to enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of 1 year 11 months and 15 days commencing 16 March 2012 and expiring 28 February 2013. The bond is to contain conditions: 

(a) that you will be of good behaviour during the term of the bond; 

(b) that you are to appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond; 

(c) that you are to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and to obey all reasonable directions for counselling and to report to the Burwood Probation office within 7 days.

		27 June 2012",2012-03-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758853,RM v R [2012] NSWCCA 35,"Judgment 

1WHEALY JA : This is an application for leave to appeal brought pursuant to s 5F(3)(a) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against an interlocutory judgment of her Honour Judge Woodburne SC (I shall for convenience refer to her Honour as ""the trial judge"" notwithstanding that the proceedings before her, as will be seen, were not a trial) refusing to permanently stay certain criminal proceedings. The application for a permanent stay was made on behalf of the applicant at the conclusion of the evidence on a special hearing without a jury, ordered pursuant to s 19 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW). The special hearing canvassed evidence in support of allegations that the applicant had sexually assaulted his young female cousin on repeated occasions between 1989 and 1992 when she was aged between about eight and twelve years, and the applicant was aged between eighteen to twenty-one. For the purposes of this judgment I shall refer to the applicant where it is necessary to do so as ""RM"" and the complainant as ""DB"". Other family witnesses in the case will be referred to by their initials. 

2I shall first briefly trace the history of the matter. The complainant first reported the alleged sexual incidents to the police in September 2009, that is, some twenty years after their first occurrence. The applicant was interviewed by police on 13 October 2009. On 12 October 2009, the complainant had telephoned the applicant and confronted him, in a general sense, with the allegations she had made. This telephone conversation was the subject of a lawful telephone intercept and during the conversation certain admissions, again of a general nature, were made by the applicant. 

3He was charged with a number of offences relating to sexual incidents involving the complainant and subsequently committed for trial from Parramatta Local Court on 16 July 2010. The matter was listed in the District Court for arraignment on 15 December 2010. A fitness hearing was held before his Honour Judge Peter Johnstone. The applicant was found unfit for trial by reason of intellectual disability and was also found unfit to plead to the counts in the indictment. There was common agreement between the medical practitioners whose reports were tendered at the hearing that the applicant was unfit for trial and would remain so. 

4The Mental Health Review Tribunal had to assess the probability of the accused being found fit to plead within twelve months. This hearing took place on 22 February 2011. The Tribunal, by its Deputy President, advised the District Court on 4 March 2011 that the Tribunal had found that there was no probability that the accused would be fit to plead, or fit for trial, within twelve months in respect of the offences in the indictment. The Director of Public Prosecutions was notified. He then indicated, pursuant to s 19 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act that further proceedings would be taken in respect of the offences alleged in the indictment. 

5An indictment alleging some twenty counts of sexual intercourse with a minor and indecent assault on a minor came before his Honour Judge Armitage in the District Court on 1 August 2011. An application was made on that day by the applicant for a permanent stay of proceedings on the charges in the indictment. His Honour refused the application. There was no appeal from that decision. 

6The special hearing was re-listed before the present trial judge on Friday, 5 August 2011. The matter proceeded to hearing before her Honour over some twelve days in August 2011. On 25 August, submissions were made both by the Crown and on the applicant's behalf. These addressed a number of issues. First, as to whether the Court, on the limited evidence, should find that the offences were committed. Secondly, whether the accused had demonstrated that, at the time of the alleged offences, he did not know right from wrong. Thirdly, the appellant renewed his application for a permanent stay. 

7On 14 October 2011, the trial judge gave her decision in relation to the stay application. She determined that the application for a stay should be refused. Her decision dealt with two broad topics. These were, first, whether that delay in the proceedings had resulted in an acceptable level of unfairness for the applicant in relation to the issue as to whether the offences had or had not been committed. Secondly, there was the issue whether delay had resulted in unfairness concerning the issue as to whether the applicant could demonstrate that he had not known right from wrong at the time of the commission of the alleged offences. Her Honour's view, in relation to both issues, was that the delay that had undoubtedly occurred did not justify the extreme step of permanently staying the proceedings. 

8On 4 November 2011, her Honour determined that, in light of the fact that leave to appeal had by then been sought against her earlier decision, she should defer delivery of her ultimate judgment in the special hearing until after the outcome of the application for leave to appeal. 

9The Amended Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal against the trial judge's interlocutory judgment contains seven grounds and one paragraph containing particulars. These are as follows: 

""2.1 The defect in the special hearing of alleged historic sexual offences, said to have been committed approximately twenty years ago, by an intellectually handicapped person, was such that nothing that the judge could do in the conduct of the special hearing could relieve against its unfair consequences. 

2.2 There was nothing the trial Judge could do in the conduct of the trial that could relieve against the uncertainty as to the accused's ability to tell right from wrong as at the time of the commission of the alleged offences. 

2.3 There was nothing that the trial Judge could do in the conduct of the trial that could relieve against the unfair consequences of the absence of the witness, SM. 

2.4 There was nothing that the trial Judge could do in the conduct of the trial that could relieve against the unfair consequences of the absence of the witness, AM. 

2.5The test applied by her Honour as to whether to grant a permanent stay was whether the case was an extreme or singular or exceptional one such that the continuation of proceedings would involve unacceptable injustice or (sic) fairness. 

2.6Her Honour applied an incorrect test, the correct test being, not whether the case can be characterised as extreme or singular or exceptional, but whether the apprehended defect is of such a nature that nothing a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences. 


PARTICULARS OF PREJUDICE 

3.1 Intervening death of [SM], who had given a computer to the accused. 

3.2 Substantial modifications to the complainant's family home. 

3.3 Absence of documentary records of complaint to the Department of Community Services (DOCS). 

3.4 Absence of records in respect of cars owned or used by the accused as at the time of the alleged commission of the said offences. 

3.5 Absence of the records of complaint from Cerdon College. 

3.6 Difficulty of recollection of [Mrs BM], the accused's mother. 

3.7 Intervening death of [AM], the accused's father. 

3.8 Uncertainty as to the accused's ability to tell right from wrong as at the time of the alleged commission of the offences. 

3.9 Intervening death of the accused's general practitioner at the time of the alleged commission of the offences. 

3.10 Absence of two schoolteachers to whom the complainant made her initial complaint. 

3.11 Deliberate decision by the complainant and her family not to report offences when first became known to the complainant's family. 

4. Even if the apprehended unfair consequences of the above individually could be relieved by the judge in the conduct of the special hearing by thorough and appropriate directions, the cumulative effect of the above matters was such that there was nothing that the judge could do in the conduct of the special hearing that could relieve against its unfair consequences."" 

10As can be seen, the particulars in support of the appeal grounds referred in detail to the absence of witnesses and documents, all of which had been relied upon before the trial judge at the time of the application for permanent stay. There was also reliance placed upon the fact that a deliberate decision, it appears, had been made by the complainant and her family in about 1995 not to report offences after they had first been revealed by the complainant to family members. This was apparently on the basis that the complainant and her family felt they owed respect to the applicant's father. This decision, it also appears, was maintained until after the appellant's father's death in November 2001 and then for some further time thereafter. 

11For completeness, I should record that during the hearing her Honour had heard submissions about a number of matters relevant to the conduct of the special hearing. These included matters relating to the admissibility of admissions alleged to have been made by the applicant, and to the related issue as to whether her Honour should admit the electronically recorded interview which had taken place on 13 October 2009. On 18 October 2011, her Honour determined that she would admit the intercepted telephone conversation of 12 October 2009. Her Honour, however, determined that she would reject the tender of the electronic interview. Her Honour gave reasons in respect of each of these matters. 

12On the hearing of the application for leave, a number of documents were tendered by consent before this Court. These included the following: 




Exhibit A 

Transcript of ERISP recording with the applicant 

13.10.09 


Exhibit D 

DVD containing ERISP interview and inter-cepted telephone conversation 

12.10.09 


Exhibit C 

School reports relating to applicant 

various 

13The ERISP interview, as I have said, was rejected by her Honour as evidence in the special hearing. It was, however, tendered by consent on the present application as relevant to the issue of the applicant's understanding of whether his actions some twenty years ago had been right or wrong. Care has to be taken, of course, in relation to this material as the interview occurred many years after the alleged sexual incidents. Moreover, care is required for the further reason that, strange as it may seem, the police apparently were unaware at the time of the interview in October 2009 that the applicant was labouring under an intellectual disability, as indeed he had been all his life. 

14During the special hearing, a number of amendments were made to the charges in the indictment. In the end, of the twenty or so counts finally alleged against the applicant, there were verdicts entered in his favour in respect of counts 11 to 15. In relation to the remaining counts, the Crown prosecutor submitted at the conclusion of the evidence that there was sufficient evidence available for the Court to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of these offences had been committed. The Crown placed particular reliance on admissions made by the applicant to the complainant's family, to his family and especially those admissions contained in the intercepted telephone conversation of 12 October 2009. In relation to all these admissions, the Crown conceded that they did not relate to any of the specific counts in the indictment, but generally were relevant as admissions of the applicant's misconduct towards the complainant during the relevant years. 

15The limited evidence adduced by the Crown in presenting its case included evidence from the complainant, her mother, father and sister. There was also brief evidence from a counsellor (Karen Horsley), who had been employed at the college attended by the complainant in 1994. There was also evidence from Dr Olav Nielssen on the issue relating to the applicant's ability to know right from wrong. I shall refer to this evidence in a little more detail at a later point in these reasons. 

The defence position 

16Notwithstanding the difficulties facing the legal representatives for the applicant, given his mental disability, Mr McAuley, his counsel, mounted a relatively substantial case attacking the reliability of the complainant. This attack focused on the improbability that certain events occurred when and as she said they did. It focused as well on the substantial delay in reporting the matter to the police and the family decision not to take the matter to that authorities when the alleged complaints were first revealed to family members. Mr McAuley also relied on the effects of delay in relation to the significant forensic disadvantages flowing to the applicant's legal representatives in assembling and presenting evidence. It was this latter topic that was relied on for the purposes of the stay application. There were, in that regard, two principal areas of complaint. These were, first, the difficulties encountered by the applicant in adducing evidence on the issue as to whether he had committed the offences. Secondly, there were the difficulties confronting the applicant in relation to the issue where he bore the onus, namely, proof on the balance of probabilities that he did not know, at the time of the alleged offences, the difference between right and wrong. 

Prejudice in relation to whether the offences were committed

18On this issue (as to whether the offences were committed), the applicant elaborated a number of areas of prejudice in relation to individual counts in the indictment. In relation to Counts 2 to 4, the death of his uncle SM, who had given the computer to the accused as a birthday present, meant that the defence had been hampered in proving definitively that the computer had not been placed in and used in the applicant's home until well after the point in time ascribed to the incidents by the complainant. She had described a time-frame following the applicant's eighteenth birthday, whereas the computer was not installed until after the applicant's twenty-first birthday. Prior to that time, the room was used as a bedroom. 

19In relation to the Counts 16 to 17, which related to incidents which were said to have occurred in the dining room of the complainant's home, there had been at some point of time substantial modifications to this house. Records relating to the nature and timing of those modifications were no longer available. Finally, in relation to Counts 18 and 19 (which related to incidents said to have occurred in a car or cars owned or used by the applicant), there was an absence of documentary records regarding car ownership and their usage, brought about by the effluxion of time. 

20Generally, in relation to all the allegations there were other matters said to demonstrate prejudice. These included the absence of documentary records in relation to a complaint to DOCS, the absence of records of complaints at the college where Ms Horsley had been a counsellor, the death of the applicant's father (who had been the dominant member of the applicant's household), and the impaired recollection of his mother, Mrs BM. 

21The applicant's case was that, while there had been some admissions made by him of some general misconduct towards the complainant, none of the admissions related to any specific events. Moreover, there was outright denial of the allegation in Count 10 and also in relation to the incident alleged in Count 20. 

Prejudice in relation to defence of mental illness 

22It was acknowledged throughout the proceedings that the applicant bore the onus in relation to this issue. There was no contest that the appellant suffered from a mild to moderate intellectual disability. This was accepted by all the practitioners who had examined him. Equally, as I have said, all the practitioners considered that he was unfit for trial and would be likely to remain so. 

23However, in his August 2011 report, Dr Olav Nielssen (who provided evidence for the Crown) expressed an opinion as to whether the applicant had a disease of the mind and also whether he had the ability, at the time of the alleged offences, to appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions. This opinion was expressed in the following terms: 
""[The applicant] has mild mental retardation, which is not usually considered a disease of the mind unless there is an additional mental illness giving rise to false beliefs or other symptoms of mental illness. Mental retardation alone would not typically leave open the defence of mental illness. 

With regards [his] ability to understand that his actions were wrong, clearly his intellectual disability reduced his capacity to consider the legal consequence of his actions or the effect of his behaviour on his cousins. 

However, I believe he would have had some capacity to recognise that his behaviour was wrong on the basis of his overall level of social performance. He kept the offences secret, he has not committed other similar offences for lack of recognition that the behaviour was wrong and generally adhered to other rules, for example, the road rules."" 

24Mr Marcelo Rodriguez, a psychologist, had made an earlier assessment of the applicant's degree of mental retardation. He said: 
""In terms of his global intellectual function, [RM] currently functions at the extremely low range of intellectual function. This performance was not surprising given his account of his educational attainments and longstanding low intellectual functioning. [His] Full Scale IQ fell in the Extremely Low range of intellectual function according this administration of the WASI. His intellectual function falls in the bottom 1% of individuals his age."" 

The psychologist expressed the view that this level of intellectual functioning meant that the applicant met the criteria specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th Edition (DSM-IV, American Psychiatric Association 1994). 

25In a subsequent report (28 July 2011), Mr Rodriguez addressed the issue of mental illness. He said that: 
""Assuming that the allegations against Mr [RM] are true and correct, I have a number of comments to make. Mr [RM's] mental age was younger than his chronological age, based on his ability to use average intellect, reason and cognitive flexibility in the face of novel and uncertain contexts. It is therefore highly probable that he could not manage his emerging sexuality, as would a young man with average intelligence. It is likely that he did not receive sexual education and if he did, it is more likely than not that he did not fully appreciate what constituted appropriate sexual behaviour, i.e. courting behaviour and consent. ... 

On the balance of probability, in my opinion, which is based on multiple assessments and documentation, Mr [RM] was incapable of understanding that any improper sexual behaviour was morally wrong."" 

26Professor Susan Hayes, a clinical psychologist and a professor of behavioural sciences in medicine, provided a report in July 2010. It was her opinion that RM, aged thirty-eight at the time of the assessment, had a mild/moderate intellectual disability which, in her view, meant that he had been incapable of understanding the police caution and his right to remain silent at the time of the ERISP. (It was this opinion that had been the focus of the trial judge's finding that the ERISP should be excluded.) Professor Hayes thought that the applicant's functional age equivalent was seven years and six months for oral, reading and written language. It was eight to nine and a half years for everyday communication skills. 

27Both Dr Nielssen and Mr Rodriguez gave evidence at the special hearing. Dr Nielssen, in his evidence in chief, adhered to his opinion that the applicant's disability had only partly deprived him of the knowledge as to whether his actions were morally wrong (AB Vol 4, 772). He referred once again to the reasons he had given in his written report for this opinion. In particular, he referred to the fact that, at least on the complainant's evidence, there had been some attempt to distract others from seeing what was occurring and attempts had been made, for example, to keep the incidents away from other people's eyes. These actions demonstrated ""some capacity"" to recognise, at the time, that the behaviour was wrong. He added: 
""Yes, I mean I agree that [RM] does have an intellectual [sic] and that his understanding of the extent to which behaviour might be wrong would be less than another person's, and also his capacity to restrain himself, perhaps, or to consider the consequences of his behaviour would also be lower than other persons. Although I don't think there was a complete inability to recognise that the action was wrong."" 

28In the final portion of his evidence in chief (AB Vol 4, 774, 20-30) Dr Nielssen gave the following evidence: 
""Q. To the extent that you give your opinion that because of his limited intellectual capacity Mr RM would have had some limitation on his capacity to understand what he was doing was wrong but not complete lack of such capacity, is it your opinion that that lack of capacity to the extent that it arises does not arise in the context of his having a 'mental illness'? 
A. That's right, not a mental illness, certainly not as defined under the NSW Mental Health Act , which comprises basically of a psychotic illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, or some combination thereof, and not a psychotic illness as I understand has generally been accepted to be a mental illness under the McNaughton Rules, resulting in a defect of reason in the form of either a delusional belief or a gross disorganisation of thinking."" 

(It might be noted that this categorisation by Dr Nielssen does not accord with the legal test.) 

29In his cross examination, Dr Nielssen conceded that, in forming his opinion as to RM's capacity to know right from wrong at the time, he was handicapped by the lapse of time. He said (AB Vol 4, 775, line 5): 
""A. Yes. It's a sort of - it's a guess really as to what his moral - ability to moral reasoning was like at that time. 

Q. Why do you say that? 
A. Well, I've only met him now getting on to twenty years later and everybody, including people with intellectual disability, matures over time and learns more about, you know, social rules over time. So I'm really just guessing what he was like at that time."" 

30The trial judge asked Dr Nielssen whether he had had access to letters by a neurologist, Dr King, and whether he had considered a report of an MRI scan of the applicant's brain. Her Honour asked the witness whether there was anything in that material that would indicate or cause him to conclude that Mr RM did not have the capacity to recognise that his behaviour was wrong. Dr Nielssen indicated that there was nothing in the MRI scan which indicated anything other than normality, but he conceded that Dr King's letters could not cast much light on the applicant's mental function at the earlier point in time when these offences were alleged to have been committed. The treatment Dr King was describing was for grand mal epilepsy and seizures in about 2000. 

31Mr Rodriguez, in his evidence in chief (AB Vol 4, 781) gave the following evidence: 
""Q. Now, just assuming for the purposes of argument that those allegations are in fact correct, are we at any disadvantage in assessing RM's understanding of right and wrong as at the period 1989 to 1992? 
A. As I understand it, RM was between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one. There are clear records that he had experienced a number of educational and social problems, problems with learning. There are records from family and school that he had difficulties. In my opinion his capacity for reasoning, to use high order judgment because of his development disability, was not the same as someone who had an average intelligence. In a sense he was not bestowed with an average intelligence and that, in my opinion, has prevented him, or had prevented him from using moral reasoning to a high degree which suggests that he was impaired in his ability to understand right from wrong. He may have had an understanding of what he was doing from a bodily perception in the sense that the sexual contact was arousing, but he did not have the capacity to understand the moral reasoning. 

Q. Now just to elucidate that, on the balance of probabilities, what is your opinion assuming the twenty allegations, assuming RM permitted [sic] those acts on the balance of probabilities in your opinion did he know right from wrong in committing those acts? 
A. On the balance of probabilities I don't believe he knew or understood the consequences."" 

32In cross examination, he conceded that he did not know, one way or the other, whether the applicant had received sexual education at the relevant time, but insisted that the applicant, more likely than not, did not fully appreciate at the time what constituted appropriate sexual behaviour. He was asked questions relating to the evidence of the complainant that the applicant had placed pillows or cushions over his lap and her lap when the incidents had taken place. He said (AB Vol 4, 788, lines 1-10): 
""A. I have an opinion that in society children are taught that everything to do with sexual matters, sexual anatomy, is naughty. In my opinion it is entirely probable that he had an understanding that playing with sexual organs was naughty. That does not necessarily constitute right from wrong."" 

33He was asked other questions which suggested that, on the basis of the complainant's evidence, the applicant had sought to distract her younger brother while he ""played with"" the complainant sexually. Did this suggest to him, the prosecutor asked, that the applicant may have had ""some understanding"" of the wrongness of the actions he was carrying out. He said 
""... but I'm still of the opinion, given his psychometric results and his educational vocational achievements thus far, and his IQ falling almost in the moderate retarded range, that he is incapable of telling right from wrong at the standard you are suggesting."" 

34Mr Rodriguez agreed with the trial judge at the end of his evidence that he had not given evidence in a court before on the issue of mental illness. He accepted that the expression of such an opinion in the court usually fell within the domain of psychiatric expertise. However, he said that he had, on a number of occasions, provided evidence on the defence of mental illness in the Mental Health Review Tribunal on the issue as to whether a forensic patient should remain in the community based on that patient's level of risk to the community. 

35As might be expected, the parties took opposing positions in relation to the medical evidence. The Crown argued that the evidence was sufficient to enable the trial judge to find that the applicant did know right from wrong. The applicant submitted that the opinions of Mr Rodriguez should be accepted on the issue, even though he was not a psychiatrist. Moreover, it was argued that Dr Nielssen's opinion was, in his own terminology, based on what he frankly conceded was ""guess-work"" in relation to the applicant's ability to know right from wrong at the time of the alleged misconduct towards the complainant. 

36Beyond these competing submissions however, the applicant, in support of the stay application, referred to a number of areas in which the passage of time had brought about a situation where the applicant was significantly prejudiced in relation to the mental illness issue. The matters on which reliance was placed included the death of AM, the applicant's father, and the unusual difficulties his mother had in her inability to recollect many matters that might have been of assistance to the applicant. In addition, there was the evidence to be gleaned from the affidavit of the applicant's solicitor, Pierre Hawach, sworn 1 August 2011. This showed that the medical notes kept by Dr Beaini, who had been the applicant's general practitioner at the time of the alleged incidents, were no longer available and Dr Beaini was now unable to provide any useful information because of the lapse of time. Another general practitioner who had been responsible for the applicant, Dr Tadros, had died. Attempts had been made to obtain other medical records from the earlier period of time, but none of these was available, despite diligent attempts to obtain them. Attempts to locate pupils and teachers who had known the applicant at the time were also completely unsuccessful. 

The decision refusing the stay 

37The trial judge dealt with the stay application in two blocks. The first related to each of those matters that was said to go to the issue as to whether the offences had been committed. In this regard, her Honour examined each of the matters sought to be relied on by the applicant and gave careful consideration to the evidence that was said to be lacking and its likely impact on the issues in the special hearing. In relation to the computer issue, for example, her Honour said that the death of SM did not mean that evidence had been unavailable to the applicant. In this regard, she referred to the fact that the applicant's mother and sister had been able to give evidence on this issue. As to the fact that the donor of the computer was now deceased, she said that any disadvantage that arose could be dealt with by an appropriate direction recognising the forensic disadvantage thus accruing to the applicant. Her Honour said (AB Vol 1, 79): 
""I do not consider that unfairness by reason of delay has been established and certainly not unfairness to a degree that would justify the extreme step of permanently staying the proceedings in respect of those counts [Counts 2 to 4] or, indeed, on the remaining counts on the indictment because of the relevance that the evidence may have in relation to an evaluation on those remaining counts."" 

38Her Honour then considered each of the other matters in the table which I have set out above and, in relation to each of them, either individually or globally, her Honour acknowledged that, in some areas, the applicant was at a disadvantage and in other areas he was not. She instanced the shortcoming in the applicant's mother's evidence, but noted that this was compensated, to some degree, by the evidence given by the applicant's sister. Her Honour thought that even if the applicant's mother's memory problems ""could properly be attributed to delay"", there was no warrant for taking the extreme step of permanently staying the proceedings. As to the applicant's father, her Honour noted that generally there is a degree of speculation about what it might have been that the father could have addressed in his evidence, although she acknowledged that he may have been able to give evidence relevant to the mental capacity of the applicant. On the basis of the material before her, the trial judge concluded that the applicant's special hearing was not necessarily unfair by reason of the unavailability of the evidence of the appellant's father. 

39In relation to the issue as to prejudice on the mental illness issue, her Honour said: 
""Mr McAuley accepts that the onus of proving this defence is on the accused on the balance of probabilities, but says he is deprived of effectively mounting such defence by reason of the delay which has resulted in an absence of evidence as to the accused's mental state at the time of the offences. ... It is that matter upon which the accused places principal reliance in support of the application for a permanent stay of proceedings."" 

40Later (AB Vol 1, 87), her Honour said; 
""It is the defence case on the stay application that the difficulty faced by the accused is highlighted by the evidence given by Dr Nielssen in the special hearing, particularly that he was really just guessing what the accused was like some twenty years ago (T 464). It was my view at the time Dr Nielssen gave this evidence that he clearly meant he was making an educated guess."" 

41Her Honour then referred to information pertaining to the applicant's health and state of mind at the time of the incidents. This was a reference to the school records and the information the applicant's sister had been able to give to Dr Nielssen. Her Honour also noted that Dr Nielssen was able to have regard to evidence concerning the complainant's accounts of the accused's conduct in the commission of the offences. Her Honour then concluded (AB Vol 1, 88), for the reasons she gave, that the stay should not be granted on this ground. I shall refer to her Honour's detailed conclusion at a later point in this decision. 

Resolution of grounds of appeal 

42It is convenient first to deal with Grounds 2.5 and 2.6 in the Amended Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal. There is an overlap between these two grounds and they may be summarised as follows: the applicant asserts that the trial judge applied an incorrect test, namely, whether the case was an extreme or singular or exceptional one, such that the continuation of proceedings would involve unacceptable injustice or unfairness. Her Honour ought to have applied the correct test, that is, whether the apprehended defect was of such a nature that nothing a trial judge could do in the conduct of the trial could relieve against its unfair consequences. 

43The trial judge dealt with the legal principles applicable to a stay in brief terms: 
""[A] special hearing is to be conducted on the limited evidence available, but that does not mean an application of the present type is precluded ( Subramaniam v R (2004) 211 ALR 1, R v WRC (2003) 59 NSWLR 273, Agoston v R [2008] NSWCCA 116). 

The power to grant a permanent stay of proceedings is, in essence, a power to refuse to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon the Court. As such, the power is only to be exercised in exceptional cases ( Jago v District Court of New South Wales & Ors (1989) 168 CLR 23 per Mason CJ at 31, 34; per Brennan J at 50). 

In determining whether, in all the circumstances, the continuation of the proceedings would involve unacceptable injustice or unfairness, it is necessary to look at the evidence of actual prejudice in the conduct of the defence. Such evidence is to be considered in light of the powers of the trial judge to relieve against unfairness; such powers include: the giving of appropriate directions and warnings, rulings as to admission of evidence, and control of procedures of the court, generally. Regard must be had to the requirements of fairness to the accused, the legitimate public interest in the disposition of the charges of serious offences, and the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice ( R v RWO [2002] NSWCCA 133; R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 605; Jago per Mason CJ at 33, 34; per Brennan J at 47)."" 

44Mr McAuley argued that her Honour's reference on a number of occasions to the fact that the power to stay should only be exercised ""in exceptional cases"", or in a situation where there was ""unacceptable injustice or unfairness"", postulated a wrong test. Similarly, where her Honour had spoken of the ""extreme step of permanently staying proceedings"", the same error, it was said, was revealed. Mr McAuley argued that the correct test to be applied was as stated by the High Court in Barton v R (1980) 147 CLR 75, Jago v District Court of NSW and more recently Dupas v R (2010) 241 CLR 237. Mr McAuley placed reliance on the following passage in Dupas (at 250) where the Court said: 
""Characterising a case as extreme or singular is to recognise the rarity of a situation in which the unfair consequences of an apprehended defect in a trial cannot be relieved against by the trial judge during the course of a trial. There is no definitive category of extreme cases in which a permanent stay of criminal proceedings will be ordered. In seeking to apply the relevant principle in Glennon , the question to be asked in any given case is not so much whether the case can be characterised as extreme, or singular, but rather, whether an apprehended defect in a trial is 'of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences'."" 

45In reading this passage, however, it is necessary to point out that the appellant there had sought to uphold the findings of Nettle and Ashley JJA that the case was ""an extreme or singular case"": 249 at [30]. The High Court was dealing principally with a contention that ""the balance of authority in the High Court has approved a concept of unfairness such that it might arise irrespective of its source and whether or not it was controllable by Court processes"": 249 at [30]. The particular matter at issue was the claim that the accused had been irredeemably harmed by circumstances of prejudicial media publicity so that he could not obtain a fair trial and was therefore entitled to a stay. The trial judge had taken the view, subsequently approved by the High Court, of giving extensive directions to the jury and, in those circumstances, declined to grant a stay. 

46At 251 [38], the Court said: 
""The apprehended defect in the appellant's trial, namely unfair consequences of prejudice or prejudgment arising out of extensive adverse pre-trial publicity, was capable of being relieved against by the trial judge, in the conduct of the trial, by thorough and appropriate directions to the jury. Because that is so, it is not necessary for the purposes of this case to undertake any broad enquiry into the full extent of the Court's inherent power to grant a permanent stay of criminal proceedings in order to prevent unfairness to an accused. ... There was no error of principle in the application of Glennon by Cummins J in deciding that the appellant's trial, if allowed to proceed, would be fair. ... A stay permanently or until further order was not warranted."" 

47The High Court endorsed the following statement by Mason CJ and Toohey J in Glennon : 
""[A] permanent stay will only be ordered in an extreme case ( Jago v District Court ) and there must be a fundamental defect 'of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences' ( Barton v R ). And a court of criminal appeal, before it will set aside a conviction on the ground of a miscarriage of justice, requires to be satisfied that there is a serious risk that the pre-trial publicity has deprived the accused of a fair trial. It will determine that question in the light of the evidence as it stands at the time of the trial and in the light of the way in which the trial was conducted, including the steps taken by the trial judge with a view to ensuring a fair trial."" 

48I conclude, accordingly, that there is nothing in the High Court's decision in Dupas which casts any doubt on the accepted principles to be applied where a permanent stay is sought in a criminal trial, those tests being variously stated and discussed in Barton v R , Jago v District Court and R v Lennon . Dupas does not represent a departure from those well-established principles. 

49In Jago , Mason CJ said at [33]-[34]: 
""The factors which need to be taken into account in deciding whether a permanent stay is needed in order to vindicate the accused's right to be protected against unfairness in the course of criminal proceedings cannot be precisely defined in a way which will cover every case. But they will generally include such matters as the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the accused's responsibility for asserting his rights and, of course, the prejudice suffered by the accused. ... In any event, a permanent stay should be ordered only in an extreme case and the making of such an order on the basis of delay alone will accordingly be very rare. 

To justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings, there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial 'of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences'': Barton [76] per Wilson J. Where delay is the sole ground of complaint, an accused seeking a permanent stay must be 'able to show that the lapse of time is such that any trial is necessarily unfair so that any conviction would bring the administration of justice into disrepute'."" 

50To like effect at p 50, Brennan J said: 
""The victims of crime, who are not ordinarily parties to prosecutions on indictment and whose interests have generally gone unacknowledged until recent times, must be able to see that justice is done if they are not to be driven to self-help to rectify their grievances. If a power to grant a permanent stay were to be exercised whenever a judge came to the conclusion that prejudice might or would be suffered by an accused because of delay in the prosecution, delay in law enforcement would defeat the enforcement of the law absolutely and prejudice resulting from delay would become a not unwelcome passport to immunity from prosecution. ... If permanent stay orders were to become commonplace, it would not be long before courts would forfeit public confidence."" 

51In Jago , at 77, Gaudron J said: 
""The limited scope of the power to grant a permanent stay necessarily directs an inquiry whether there are other means by which the defect attending the proceedings can be eliminated or remedied. And the purpose directs attention to the legal propriety of the process or proceeding, as distinct from any broad consideration of the general merits of the case. ... 

The exercise of the power to reject evidence, either alone or in combination with a trial judge's other powers to control criminal proceedings, will often suffice to remedy any feature of the proceedings which might otherwise render them unjust or unfair. The existence and availability of these powers, when considered in the light of the necessarily limited scope of the power to grant a permanent stay, serve to indicate that a court should have regard to the existence of all its various powers, and should only grant a permanent stay if satisfied that no other means is available to remedy that feature which, if unremedied, would render the proceedings so seriously defective, whether by reason of unfairness, injustice or otherwise, as to demand the grant of a permanent stay."" 

52Although the trial judge in the present matter referred to the relevant authorities, albeit briefly, and did not cite extensive extracts from them, it is quite clear, to my mind, that her Honour recognised the correct principles to be applied and, subject to the question of mental capacity discussed later, applied them appropriately to the task before her. I would reject the two grounds of appeal that suggest that her Honour has applied the wrong test to the question as to whether a permanent stay should be granted. 

53I should add that her Honour clearly recognised that a particular problem in the present matter was that there was not only an issue of delay but there were also the difficulties attending the fact that she had embarked on a special hearing following upon the procedures allowed for in the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act . In that regard, her Honour referred (again briefly) to the relevant authorities that recognised the limitations inherent in such a special hearing, particularly those arising from the inability of the applicant to give proper instructions. 

54It is next convenient to consider Grounds 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4. These are inter-related and concern the major complaints of delay that were said to have prejudiced the applicant's position in relation to the issue as to whether he had committed the offences. The particular grounds focus on the fact that the occurrences occurred some twenty years ago, that the applicant is an intellectually handicapped person and was so at the time and, in particular, the death of the applicant's father, AM, and his uncle, SM. 

55The trial judge acknowledged the various matters of concern. They are those matters that are in brief referred to in the table set out in these reasons at para 17. These may be summarised as the computer room issue, the renovations to the complainant's family home, the absence of DOCS' records, the absence of details of the applicant's car ownership, the absence of records from the college at which Ms Horsley was a counsellor and the other matters set out earlier. 

56As I have recounted, the trial judge dealt with each of these in quite a detailed fashion. Her overall conclusion was that, particularly given her ability to direct herself on issues such as delay, prejudice and the like, the asserted prejudice did not rise to such a level as to warrant the extreme step of granting a permanent stay. 

57In my opinion, no error has been shown in relation to her Honour's dealings with any of these matters. 

58The computer room issue is a good example to demonstrate the correctness of her Honour's approach and conclusions. As has been explained, the issue is whether the complainant was correct in saying that the particular sexual incidents occurred in the computer room of the applicant's home in 1989. Behind this issue is the broader issue as to whether these incidents occurred at all. The applicant's family gave evidence that the computer was not brought to the household until about 1993 when it was given by SM, the applicant's uncle, as a present following the applicant's twenty-first birthday party. The computer room had originally been the bedroom of one of the applicant's sisters who had married at some time in 1992. The complaint about delay was that SM had died in Lebanon in 2008 and therefore he was not available as a witness to testify that he had in fact given the computer as a present to the applicant in 1993. 

59In dealing with this issue, the trial judge reminded herself that forensic disadvantages are not uncommon in cases such as this and are always the subject of a direction and warning to juries. Her Honour was well aware of the need to direct herself as to any particular forensic disadvantage that may have been suffered by the applicant. In addition to noting the forensic safeguard afforded to the applicant by the capacity to give warnings and directions, her Honour explained that evidence had been given by the applicant's mother and sister that was capable of proving, if accepted, that the computer had been given to the applicant some years after the year alleged by the complainant as the date of the incidents. To that extent, this evidence filled the gap arising from the unavailability of the deceased uncle. 

60There is no need for me to detail the manner in which her Honour has dealt with each of the other complaints on the issue as to whether the offences were committed. Her Honour was uncertain of the actual disadvantage relating to the dining room incidents at the complainant's home. She accepted that there may have been renovations, but was unclear as to the importance of that fact in the trial. Her Honour noted that, apart from the complainant, both her parents and her sister gave evidence. Her Honour noted that as it was their home, and as renovations were carried out while they were there, it might be assumed that they were able to give any relevant evidence on this issue. Yet no relevant questions were, apparently, directed to them in that regard. 

61The other matters such as the absence of detail about car ownership and other records which were unavailable were, as Mr McAuley fairly conceded, not particularly significant matters in themselves although he maintained that, in a global sense, they contributed to forensic disadvantage. 

62Her Honour paid particular attention to the apparent impaired memory of the mother of the applicant and to the death of the applicant's father, AM. In relation to the latter, her Honour noted that it was not alleged that he had witnessed any of the alleged sexual assaults. Undoubtedly he would have been at the home when the complainant was there. Moreover, her Honour concluded that it was ""purely speculative"" to endeavour to anticipate any area where his evidence might have been of some relevance. Her Honour accepted that he was the head of the household and handled the business dealings of the family, but she was not satisfied that his death presented any real unfairness, at least on the issue as to whether the offences were committed. 

63In his Amended Grounds of Appeal, the applicant lists under section 3 a number of matters which are said to detail the absence of witnesses or documents important to his case. Under the heading I have considered, I have left aside for the moment the issue about the absence of witnesses and documents relevant to the applicant's ability to tell right from wrong at the time of the alleged commission of the offences. I shall deal with those separately. For the moment, it is sufficient to say that in relation to all the remaining particulars in paragraph 3 of the Grounds, I am satisfied that the trial judge made no error in relation to her decision that none of these matters, either considered individually or globally, warranted the grant of a permanent stay. 

64Importantly, her Honour recognised that by the giving of appropriate directions and warnings to herself in case of any asserted forensic disadvantage due to delay, she would be able to avoid unfairness to the applicant. The existence of these procedures and powers had the consequence that a permanent stay was not warranted on the issue as to whether the offences had been committed. In relation to that issue, I reject Ground 4 that the cumulative effect of the matters listed in paragraph 3 of the Grounds was such that there was nothing the Judge could do in the conduct of the special hearing that could relieve against its unfair consequences. To the contrary, I accept that her Honour correctly identified her ability to ensure that the special hearing would be conducted fairly. 

The issue as to whether the applicant knew right from wrong 

65The applicant sought to prove in the special hearing that if he were found to have committed any of the offences in the indictment, he should be found not guilty on the ground of mental illness. The applicant argued before the trial judge that he had suffered from a defect of reason at the relevant time arising from his disorder and that, as a consequence of his mental handicap, did not know that what he was doing was wrong, having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people: R v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182, 189-190; Stapleton v R (1952) 86 CLR 358 at 368 per Dixon CJ; Reg v S [1979] 2 NSWLR 1 at 42 per O'Brien J. 

66In relation to this issue, the applicant accepted that he bore the onus of establishing on the balance of probabilities that he did not know right from wrong at the time of the commission of the alleged offences. As the authorities make clear, this question falls to be decided in the light of the moral standards of reasonable people. Plainly enough, that reasonable person is someone with the moral judgment of an adult. A child's sense that particular behaviour might be naughty, so as to earn the disapproval of adults, would not meet that test. It is for this reason that the evidence of Mr Rodriguez, referred to at [32]-[33] may be regarded, if accepted, as significant. 

67This aspect of the applicant's case (in which he bore the onus) placed reliance primarily on the medical records and reports and, in particular, on the opinion expressed by Mr Rodriguez. The Crown placed reliance on the opinion of the only qualified psychiatrist called at the special hearing, Dr Nielssen. Mr McAuley had sought to deflect the force of Dr Nielssen's opinion by the concession he obtained during cross examination that the expert's opinion on this point was largely ""guess-work"". 

68The Crown, however, also placed reliance, it will be recalled, on a second body of material that suggested that the applicant had appreciated that his ""misconduct"" had been morally wrong. This included the complainant's evidence as to the apparent secretiveness and evasiveness engaged in by the applicant in carrying out a number of the indecent actions. It included the concessions the applicant had made during the intercepted conversation that what he had done (whatever it was) was wrong. Reliance was also placed on school reports and related matters that showed the applicant's ability to appreciate basic concepts of right and wrong and his ability to function relatively normally during his late teenage years. For example, he had been able to obtain a driver's licence and to drive a motor vehicle in accordance with the road rules. 

69It was against the background of these competing arguments that the applicant renewed his stay application before the present trial judge. Put simply, the argument was, as Mr Hawach's affidavit showed, that the passage of time, the death or unavailability of certain witnesses, and the inability to obtain relevant records placed the applicant at considerable disadvantage in proving the matter on which he carried the onus. Those people who might be expected to attest to his then inability to appreciate the difference between right and wrong were no longer available. For example, his father (who was clearly an important figure in his life), his treating doctors, his teachers and classmates. Records relating to (or possibly throwing light on) the issue were no longer available. Again, put simply, if the case he was attempting to mount on the mental illness issue was not as strong as it might have been, this was precisely because of the disadvantages he now encountered based on the twenty year delay. This was why the experts were reduced to ""guess-work"" and speculation. 

70The trial judge identified the issue in these terms (AB Vol 1, 85): 
""In addition to these matters, it was contended that the significant delay in the case resulted in the accused suffering irremediable prejudice in terms of the defence of mental illness. In this regard, it is the accused's case that even if, after taking appropriate account of all matters raised on behalf of the accused including the forensic disadvantage suffered by reason of delay, I were to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed any or all of the offences on the indictment, I would nevertheless find him not guilty by reason of mental illness. ... Mr McAuley accepts that the onus of proving this defence is on the accused on the balance of probabilities, but says he is deprived of effectively mounting such defence by reason of the delay which has resulted in the absence of evidence as to the accused's mental state at the time of the offences; that is when he was aged about eighteen to twenty-one years."" 

71Her Honour then gave consideration to the material which was said to be absent. In particular, she gave consideration to the unsuccessful endeavours made by Mr Hawach to obtain material to assist the applicant on the mental condition issue to which I have earlier referred. Her Honour expressly took into account Mr McAuley's submission that the difficulty faced by the applicant was, as I have indicated earlier, ""highlighted"" by Dr Nielssen's reference to ""guess-work"". Her Honour said that it was her view that, at the time Dr Nielssen gave his evidence, he ""clearly meant he was making an educated guess"". 

72Having considered the applicant's submissions, her Honour then concluded that a stay should not be granted on this ground. In that regard, her Honour said (AB Vol 1, 87-88): 
""It is not the case that there is no information pertaining to the accused's history in the time period of the charges. Police did obtain school records of the accused from 1989 and 1990 which were admitted as Exhibit A, and which were provided to Dr Nielssen (see also Mr Rodriguez at T504). Additionally, [the applicant's sister] provided information about her brother to Dr Nielssen. Dr Nielssen also had regard to evidence concerning the complainant's account of the accused's conduct in the commission of the offences. It is relevant to note, in terms of the ability to assess the accused's mental capacity at the time of the offences, mild mental retardation or intellectual disability is a lifelong condition, usually evident in early life (T462). Mr Rodriguez gave evidence of that factor (T507.38). In giving his opinion, Dr Nielssen took into account the fact that a person with an intellectual disability can mature and learn more social rules over time (T464). 

In the whole of the circumstances, I am not persuaded that the absence of Dr Beaini's records, and the inability to obtain further medical reports as might have been available had the matters been brought immediately to the attention of police, or the inability to obtain information from the accused's former teachers and classmates, means that the special hearing would involve an unacceptable unfairness to as to justify the extreme step of permanently staying the proceedings. 

As the High Court stated in The Queen v Edwards ([2009) 83 ALJR 717 at [31]), trials involve the reconstruction of events, and it happens on occasions that relevant material is not available; documents, recordings and other things may be lost or destroyed. Witnesses may die. The fact that the tribunal of fact is called upon to determine issues of fact upon less than all of the material which could relevantly bear upon the matter does not make the trial unfair."" 

The argument in this Court 

73Before this Court, the arguments took a somewhat unusual path. Initially Mr McAuley argued that the applicant had been disadvantaged in the special hearing because he was unable, due to the passage of time, to locate and adduce historical evidence that may have thrown light on his ability to know right from wrong at the time of the alleged offences. This was the same argument as had been presented before the trial judge. However, this argument later broadened into an assertion that this Court should itself find persuasive the medical evidence adduced on behalf of the applicant, especially the evidence of Mr Rodriguez on the topic. 

74The Crown responded by arguing that there was a good deal of evidence before the trial judge bearing on the mental illness issue. This included the intercepted conversation, evidence of the complainant and members of her family, and the details of the school reports. In addition, the Crown asked this Court to place reliance on the ERISP even though it had been excluded in the special hearing. The Crown argued that the ERISP could be used on the issue as to whether the applicant knew right from wrong. She pointed to a number of occasions in the ERISP where the appellant admitted that he had been wrong in relation to his actions with the complainant. These were in similar terms to statements he had made to the complainant during the intercepted telephone conversation. 

75The Crown submission ultimately was that all this evidence (with the exception of the ERISP) had been before the trial judge. Consequently, she therefore had the capacity to make a decision on the mental illness issue without any difficulty. The reasoning appeared to be that it must follow that any disadvantage sustained by the applicant in obtaining evidence from the earlier period could not be significant because of the overwhelming nature of the available evidence to which I have made reference. Although not precisely articulated by the Crown, it may be that the reasoning extended to the proposition that the case advanced by the applicant on the mental illness issue was so weak or so deficient, having regard to the bulk of the evidence relied on by the Crown, that this Court could itself determine there was no warrant for a stay. As I have said, with no disrespect to the Crown, it was not entirely clear which of these arguments was being pursued. 

76Quite apart from the fact that the police interview was excluded at the special hearing, the ERISP itself poses a number of specific problems. Firstly, it occurred twenty years after the event. What insight could it throw on the applicant's mental state twenty years earlier? Secondly, although there are some clear admissions made by the applicant to suggest that he knew right from wrong (e.g. questions 836 to 838) there are other answers given which suggest that that realisation only came to him at a later period of time (questions 970 to 985). Indeed, in this section of the interview, the applicant plainly maintained that he did not know it was wrong at the time. Thirdly, there is the problem of a mentally handicapped person being interrogated by police officers who were, it seems, ignorant of his disabilities. 

77The admissions made by the applicant to the complainant and her family are also equivocal on the point. For example, the applicant is alleged to have told the complainant's sister (AB Vol 4, 733): 
""He said 'Alright, I did it,' 

And I said 'You did what?' 
And I said 'Are you saying that you sexually abused [the complainant]?' 
And he said 'Yes ...' 

I said 'You're admitting that you sexually abused [her]?' 
And he said 'Yes.' 

'Well it's a very good thing that you're admitting it.' 
And he said 'Yes, I did it. What do I do now? What happens now?'"" 

78Variations of these statements were alleged to have been made to the complainant's mother and father. However, in each case the statements were made nineteen or twenty years after the incidents had occurred. In addition, they do not unequivocally illuminate the difficult question as to whether the applicant knew right or wrong at the time when the incidents were said to have occurred. Of course, they hardly assist the applicant but, in a real sense, they beg the central question in the special hearing. 

Resolution 

79I confess that I am troubled by the direction the parties' arguments have taken on this issue. There are two reasons. First, this Court is invited, in effect, to make a finding on the whole of the evidence, including evidence that was excluded by the trial judge, as to whether the applicant knew right from wrong. At the very least, on the Crown argument, we are invited to reason that the applicant's case on the mental illness issue is bound to fail, or likely to fail, because of the preponderance of the Crown evidence, to which I have referred. 

80Secondly, I am concerned that these arguments, on both sides of the record, overlook the primary matter arising on the applicant's case for a stay: the proposition that the weakness in his position in the special hearing arises directly from the fact that there is no historical evidence (or at least very little) of a medical or objective kind to address the central point. This is precisely because of the passage of some twenty years or thereabouts. The applicant (with his disabilities) cannot attest to the situation. His father - who might be thought to be in an authoritative position to say something on the subject - is dead. There are no teachers or close friends or school mates who can assist. His treating doctors at the time are either unavailable or at least their records from that time are unavailable. His mother's evidence is unhelpful on most issues, for what reason, this Court is not to know. There was a muted suggestion during the leave application that the applicant's mother may have been prevaricating to assist her son, but no such suggestion, it appears, was made before the trial judge. It would be inappropriate for this Court to countenance such a finding, especially since an evaluation of the evidence on the mental illness issue is yet to be made. The appellant's younger sister is not a qualified medical expert and, in any event, her evidence did not address the question. 

81As to the first matter, I do not consider that it is this Court's task to make any finding as to whether the evidence establishes, or fails to establish, that the applicant did not know right from wrong at the time of the alleged commission of the offences. To express an opinion, even a tentative opinion on that subject, would prejudice the task confronting the trial judge. It is to be recalled that all the evidence has been completed. The submissions have concluded. The trial judge is now in a position to make findings on the limited evidence as to whether the offences were committed and as to whether the applicant has proven, on the balance of probabilities, that he did not know right from wrong at the relevant times. It would be quite wrong for this Court to cut across, anticipate or hint at any conclusion in those regards. 

82As to the second matter, it raises the question as to whether the reasons of the trial judge for refusing the stay on the mental illness issue demonstrate error. 

83What is not revealed in the Court's decision on the stay is whether critical consideration was given to the fact that, on this issue, the applicant bore the onus. In such a situation could there be a fair trial of the issue because of the limits on obtaining relevant material due to the passage of time? 

84It is one thing, of course, on the issue as to whether the offences were committed, to note a number of forensic disadvantages due to the passage if time. It is one thing to argue in a special hearing that the applicant's disabilities, coupled with the passage of time, may pose problems which, in extreme situations, might warrant a stay. For the reasons I have given earlier, I do not think that any error has been shown in relation to her Honour's refusal to grant a stay on either of those issues. Where the Crown bears the onus of proof and where the trial judge can give directions or warnings which caution against the use of evidence or point to the danger, due to unacceptable delay, of a finding adverse to the applicant, it may very well be accepted that a stay should not be granted, except in an extreme case. 

85Where, however, the onus falls squarely on the applicant and he is disadvantaged by the passage of time in the sense that he simply is unable to locate the evidence that might (if it existed) assist in the proof of the issue on the balance of probabilities, what then is the situation? 

86I have read her Honour's decision dealing with the proposed stay on the mental issue carefully. Her Honour correctly identified the issue but I do not see in her Honour's concluding remarks any reference to the onus point and the distinction it brings to the considerations that were brought to bear on the stay application relating to the commission of the offence issue. Of course, I accept that her Honour well understood that the onus fell upon the applicant to demonstrate that he had satisfied the mental illness test. There can be no doubt about that. However, I do not detect in her Honour's findings (or for that matter in the submissions that were made to her) a critical evaluation of this point. Indeed, her Honour refers to the passage in R v Edwards ((2009) 83 ALJR 717): 
""The fact that the tribunal of fact is called upon to determine issues of fact upon less than all of the material which could relevantly bear upon the matter did not make the trial unfair."" 

87But is that necessarily the case where the onus falls upon the applicant to prove the central issues at trial in circumstances where, because of the lapse of an exceedingly lengthy period of time, the evidence necessary to discharge that onus cannot be located? Edwards involved a prosecution under the Civil Aviation Act 1988 (Cth) where the onus of proof lay squarely on the prosecution. It was not, I would respectfully suggest, a compelling analogy for a trial in which the onus or the central issue lay on the accused. 

88I have reluctantly concluded that this issue (but no other) should be remitted to her Honour for further consideration. I bear in mind that in most criminal trials where mental illness is raised as an issue, psychiatrists usually have access to the accused's contemporaneous account of his state of mind. In this case, however, the only account by the accused is the evidence in his interviews from twenty years later, evidence which, in any event, has properly been excluded in the special hearing. 

89Accordingly, I would order that the application for leave be dismissed with the exception of the issue as to the accused's ability at the relevant time to tell right from wrong on that issue. I would grant leave on that issue and uphold the appeal to that limited extent. I would remit the matter to the trial judge for further consideration. 

90I am conscious of the fact that her Honour is, in effect, poised to give a decision and make findings as a consequence of the evidence in the special hearing. When her Honour reconsiders the limited issue remitted to her, she may either grant a stay or decline to do so. It will be entirely a matter for her Honour to determine the outcome of the stay application. If the decision happened to be adverse to the applicant, he would, of course, have the opportunity to seek leave to appeal from that decision on an interlocutory basis. Without derogating in any sense from that right, I would respectfully suggest, however, given the history of the matter, that it may be plainly desirable, in the overall interests of justice, that her Honour proceed to give a decision on the limited evidence without further delay. Of course, once again, that would be entirely a matter for her Honour. The point I am making, perhaps an obvious one, is that the parties to these proceedings would, in any event, each have rights available to them to protect their position whatever the ultimate outcome of the special hearing. 

91I propose the following orders: 

(1) Leave to appeal granted on the limited basis as to whether stay should be granted in relation to the mental illness issue. 

(2) In relation to that issue, the appeal is allowed and the matter remitted to the trial judge to consider afresh whether a stay should be granted. 

(3) Otherwise, in relation to all other issues, leave is refused. 

92R.S. HULME J : I agree with Whealy JA. 

93I would add only this. I do not understand anything in his Honour's reasons to suggest that the fact that the onus of proving a matter lies on an accused means that whenever the accused can point to the prior existence of possibly or certainly relevant material and an inability to ascertain the detail of that material, a stay should be granted. To use the words of Mason CJ and Toohey J in R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 606, there must be a ""serious risk"" that the absence of the material has deprived the accused of a fair trial. Obviously relevant to the assessment of the extent of any risk is the nature and quality of the evidence that is available and which bears on the topic. 

94HIDDEN J: As noted by Whealy JA, the issue raised by the defence of mental illness in this case is that expressed by Dixon J in Porter (supra) at 189-90. Speaking of the accused in that case, his Honour said: 

""We are not dealing with right or wrong in the abstract. The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by 'wrong'? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people."" 

95The question in the present case is whether delay has led to irremediable prejudice in the litigation of that issue, given that the applicant bears the burden of proof in respect of it. That is a matter properly to be remitted to her Honour for further consideration and, of course, I would not presume to express any view about it. I agree with the orders proposed by Whealy JA and with his Honour's reasons. I also agree with the approach to the matter suggested by his Honour at [90] of those reasons.

		19 March 2012",2012-03-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758858,Environment Protection Authority v Truegain Pty Ltd [No 2] [2012] NSWLEC 55,"EX TEMPORE Judgment 

1On 16 March 2012 I upheld the defendant's objections to the summons as then particularised and held that the summons as amplified by the particulars furnished by the prosecutor was bad for duplicity. The prosecutor now states that it relies upon only two of the particulars in the summons, namely: 

(c) 
(iv) Failing to adequately treat liquid waste at the Premises; and /or 

(v) Failing to adequately store liquid waste at the Premises 

2The prosecutor has also furnished the defendant with further particulars of the two failures upon which it now relies. 

3The defendant submits that the two particulars now relied upon by the prosecutor remain bad for duplicity. Moreover, the defendant submits that the particulars now furnished in relation to each failure are themselves bad for duplicity. 

4The prosecutor has this morning explained the processes which occur on the defendant's property to show that both the treatment and storage of liquid waste at the premises forms part of the one activity. What has been described, however, is a continuing process of treatment which includes decanting, pumping and treating liquid waste. The storage of liquid waste, it seems to me, is a separate activity - the liquid is simply stored. 

5A failure to treat adequately and a failure to store adequately gives rise, in my opinion, to separate or discrete omissions each of which, if established, gives rise to an offence. 

6To repeat what I said in my previous judgment, ""only one offence can be proved under one charge"", as Dixon J said in Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 487. Moreover, as Dixon J also said at 489: 

... evidence of more than one offence cannot be admitted, and under one charge to take evidence of a number of separate instances of the commission of the same offence ... is to pursue a course contrary to law. 

7In the present case each of the particulars (c)(iv) and (v) in the summons would constitute an offence. The case is indistinguishable from Byrne v Baker [1964] VR 443, Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd [1988] VR 411 and Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill (1995) 37 NSWLR 150 where in those cases the legislation is in material respects similar to that with which we are concerned here. 

8As in those cases, the particulars now furnished in the present case allege separate and distinct failures each of which would be a contravention of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997. As Hill J said in Boral Gas at 179: 

In my view, these alleged failures involve at least two alleged contraventions ... and therefore two offences. The nature and content of each failure is separate and distinct. 

9The prosecutor must therefore elect as to which of the two particulars it has now identified it wishes to pursue. 

10The defendant complains about a further difficulty with the particulars that have been supplied in that they identify the offence as occurring at different pieces of equipment at different locations within the licensed premises and identify acts or omissions which, in the case of the storage of liquid waste, involve also treatment of that waste. The defendant relies upon the judgment of Hungerford J in Boral Gas at 206: 

... each represent significant and separate categories of conduct by an employer to ensure the stipulated condition of a safe workplace. Of course, a failure to observe any one of them will be a breach, but a multiple failure must surely lead to multiple breaches. If that were not so and only one breach was regarded as having occurred then, I think, the importance of one or other of the requirements would be negated. It would be a fortiori where each failure occurred at a different location at a workplace or, even at the same location, arose out of different circumstances. The point may be illustrated by referring to a building site - if at the same time on the same day an employer failed to provide a safely insulated power tool and failed to provide a safe electrical system for the workplace, how could it be said only one offence was committed? I would think clearly there would be two separate and distinct failures by the employer in relation, first, to equipment, and, secondly, to the system of work ... 

11As I understand the defendant's submission, it is said that the nature and content of each alleged failure is itself separate and distinct. I do not require the prosecutor at this stage to respond to this complaint until it makes an election as to which of the particulars (c)(iv) or (v) in the summons it wishes to pursue as its submissions may vary depending upon its election.

2758870,R v Palmieri [2012] NSWDC 279,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Warren Palmieri pleaded guilty, at a somewhat late stage, to an offence of supplying a prohibited drug. Despite living up near Newcastle he was found at 3 o'clock in the morning at Artarmon. He drew attention to himself through his manner of driving. Police stopped the vehicle and when Mr Palmieri passed a roadside breath test police formed the not unnatural opinion that he may have been influenced by drugs. His behaviour was suspicious so they searched the car and discovered a bag containing white crystals. They also discovered a number of smaller resealable bags with a residue of crystal, some notebooks, and more than one mobile phone, with the notebooks containing what were later admitted to be drug ledgers. The white crystal powder was weighed and its purity assessed. There was 6.89 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of seventy-three per cent.

2For a while the accused maintained that the drugs were all for his own use. Indeed, he told the Probation and Parole Service that as they were preparing a pre-sentence report. But the accused now admits that some of those drugs were to be sold.

3The offender was born in 1964, so he is getting a bit old for this. He has had a problem with drugs for many years, although he does not really, I think, recognise it. He in fact was on bail for driving whilst under the influence of drugs at the time of this offence and he committed another offence of a similar kind in more recent times. The offender seems to think that because he can work at the same time as using drugs then things are okay. I doubt very much that he recognises the danger he represents to the community, his family and himself. Indeed, the evidence would suggest that his partner developed psychosis through her amphetamine use. This has led to her losing the custody of her own children. Yet still the offender does not seem to understand how dangerous these drugs are. I am satisfied that there is in this case a significant component of personal deterrence required.

4The offender, as I said, was born in 1964. He went into his father's business of concreting and has constantly been employed over the years. References from employers were tendered in Court today and they speak highly of him. I mentioned before that the offender's partner has lost custody of her children. They are cared for by either her parents or his parents. She is not allowed to have the children stay overnight with her unless the offender is present. Although Mr Jauncey, who appeared for the offender, sensibly did not suggest that this was exceptional hardship, he did ask me to take into account that if the offender was returned to custody his partner would suffer and her children would as well. I will take that into account as part of the general mix of subjective features.

5The offender has spent two months and eight days in custody and after being released on bail has been reporting daily and subject to a curfew. The curfew meant that he could not go to family functions such as weddings and twenty-first.

6The starting point for the sentence in this case is, the authorities would suggest, that in the case of trafficking to a substantial degree, a full-time custodial sentence is required. One significant impediment to making a finding that the offender was trafficking to that level has been the lack of evidence regarding what was contained in the drug ledgers, what the amounts of money were, whether there were quantities referred to, how many names were in the drug ledgers and so on. All I know is that there were ledgers and the offender had a relatively small amount of quite a pure drug. In deciding whether it has been demonstrated that he was trafficking to a substantial degree, I of course take into account his age and the lack of any other offences involving drug supply. I am not satisfied that he was trafficking to a substantial degree and so the offender need not demonstrate exceptional circumstances before a sentence of other than full-time custody maybe imposed.

7Mr Jauncey concedes, however, that a custodial sentence of some description is required. Once more that is an appropriate concession. The circumstance that the offender has spent slightly more than two months presentence custody and has been on bail with reasonable restrictions on his liberty thereafter, have meant that the length of the sentence I have decided to impose is such that some alternatives to full-time custody are available. Mr Jauncey suggests that I should impose upon his client a suspended sentence. The Crown says that such a sentencing option is just, I emphasise the word ""just"", within the range. I agree. I fully recognise that a suspended sentence can in many cases say very little by way of punishment. However, I hope that the offender will understand that if, having received a very lenient sentencing outcome on this occasion, he commits any further offence at all, I will have no hesitation in sending him back to gaol full time, no ICO, no home detention, but full time back into custody.

8I should have mentioned the relatively late plea of guilty as another matter which has led to me imposing a sentence on the offender which is of a duration which enables a suspended sentence to be imposed.

9The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of two years. Under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the execution of that sentence is suspended on condition that the offender enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for the period of the sentence. Conditions of that bond are that the offender is to commit no further offences at all. He is to not use any illicit drugs. He is to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service and he is to undergo regular and frequent testing to detect whether he has complied with other conditions of this bond regarding drug use. He is to attend and satisfactorily complete the SMART program. He is to advise the registrar of this Court of any change in his residential address and he is to appear before this Court if called upon to do so at any time.

10Mr Palmieri, it is important that I explain to you what I have done. I have decided that your case requires that you be sentenced to imprisonment for two years. But if you are of good behaviour and comply with the conditions of the bond, you will escape having to go back to gaol. I can quite frankly say to you that my initial impression, Mr Palmieri, was that I would send you back to gaol. It is only the submissions of Mr Jauncey and the concession by the Crown that is seeing you walking out that door rather than the door behind you. 

11That means that if you breach this bond I will not have the slightest hesitation in putting you in custody; that is something I do fairly regularly. And if you come back before me, it will not be another judge it will be me, and if you have breached the bond you will go to gaol I promise you. It will not be a question of Mr Jauncey saying ""can he have an intensive corrections order, can he have home detention?"" Mr Jauncey might ask but I can tell you now he is not going to be successful. 

12So if you commit the slightest offence, and that involves even using drugs, and you are detected, you are going to gaol. I should tell you one more thing just in case you think I might forget. When you are brought back before me, if you are, what I have just said to you is printed out on a piece of paper and it is put in front of me and I read it and I remind myself of the promise I made to you that you would go to gaol. So your future is in your hands.

13I note that the s166 charge is withdrawn.

2758872,R v Louie PUCARIELLO [2012] NSWDC 70,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Operation Schoale, a joint investigation by New South Wales Police and the New South Wales Crime Commission, resulted in the arrest of a large number of people associated with the importation, distribution or warehousing of cocaine and profits of illicit drug sale. 

2The operation and the matters that resulted from it indicate the enormous profits which such crimes can generate. Louie Pucariello, the Offender, was an associate of the two principals in the importation, Luke Sparos and Alan Moradien. He was not a close associate, he just knew them. Mr Sparos is presently serving a sentence of fifteen years and Mr Moradien is serving a sentence of sixteen years and nine months. 

3The agreed facts, Exhibit A1, reveal the police executed a search warrant on the Offender's home in Moorebank. I have seen the video of that search, Exhibit A7. Over $1.5 million in cash was found and just under 320 grams of cocaine was found. 

4The matter has a lengthy history. It was listed today to resolve a factual dispute. The Offender has wisely chosen not to contest the agreed facts which are tendered as part of the Crown brief. Those facts can be reduced to a series of simple and basic facts, which reflect the critical elements of the two offences, for which he must be sentenced. The offender, by his plea, has accepted the elements of each offence have been proved and admitted his guilt to them. I propose, as is only proper, to sentence on the basis of the agreed facts. 

5The cocaine was found in two areas of the kitchen. That in the pantry appears clearly to have been warehoused for return to those who the offender knew would supply it. Another smaller quantity was found in the kitchen with scales, bowl and spoon. There are a number of possible explanations for this: The first, it is a separate quantity, unrelated to the offence, available for his own use and, given s29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act also for supply; the second, it is part of the larger warehoused quantity which he had expropriated for his own use and which could have been disposed of to others, the balance of which was to be returned; or,a third, the drugs were his payment for involvement in this matter, which could only have been realised by its subsequent sale. 

6The agreed facts do not assist. They simply note that this smaller quantity was for the purpose of supply. That term is vague. I apply so far as I can what is set out by the High Court in Olbrich (1999) CLR 270. I cannot find matters of aggravation proved unless they were established beyond reasonable doubt, and despite the Crown submissions, I am prepared to give the offender the benefit of those doubts I do feel are available to him. 

7Explanation 2 seems to me, the most likely of the three simple explanations, but here I simply must sentence him on the basis that some of the drugs found were to be returned, to his principals for ultimate supply in the community and others were held by him for the purpose of supply. The way they were held does indicate that there had been some use of the smaller quantity of those drugs by the offender or perhaps others with whom he was associated. 

8I note that the Offender told Mr Tim Watson-Munro, his psychologist, that he did not use illicit drugs. He said in evidence today that he told Tim Watson-Munro that he did not use illicit drugs, but I note that he has a prior conviction from 1987for use of illicit drugs. 

9Returning to the agreed facts, the offender admitted to police that he had possession of the drugs and money. It is agreed that he was warehousing both money and drugs. At the relevant time police were closing in on Mr Sparos and members of his criminal group. This offender clearly agreed to hold the drugs and money and, if it had been successful, he would have enabled those persons to avoid police detection and prevent seizure of the drugs and money. 

10I find that he well knew that the sale and possession of drugs was illegal and that when he returned them they were to be sold. He well knew that the money came from profits derived from supplying illicit drugs. He is not a naive man. He is not an ignorant man. He had the personal experience of serving time in jail for being involved in the supply of prohibited drugs. He is not to be sentenced again for those offences but they disentitle him to the leniency often shown first offenders. He also, as I have indicated, committed these offences knowing full well the true consequences of what would happen to him if he was caught. 

11My use of the term ""warehousing"" should not be taken as minimising the seriousness of these offences. As the statement of Detective Sergeant Bailey (Exhibit A6) makes clear, the drugs found, if sold as packaged, could result in profits of between $65,000 and $100,000. If reduced to street deals considerably more money could have been made. The offender was helping others to avoid detection to allow the sale of cocaine to continue and to preserve the group's profit. That could be the only consequence of what he was doing. He was low in the hierarchy and only involved for a few days, but in that time what he did was play a crucial role which, had Operation Schoale not been so well executed, could have allowed the group's trade to continue. 

12The distribution of illicit drugs causes considerable harm, not just to those who purchase and ingest such drugs, but to the community in general. The illicit trade in drugs is one of the principal sources for crime in the community. It is not just the sale of drugs, it is the crimes that are committed by those who seek to obtain funds for drugs and the destruction to family life and personal life that drugs cause. I am not here to give this offender or anyone else a lecture about the use of illicit drugs but it must be made perfectly clear, that those who involve themselves in any way with the sale of drugs for profit will almost inevitably end up in goal if caught. The seriousness of the supply offence is reflected in the maximum penalty of twenty years and fact that Parliament has sought to fix a standard non-parole period of ten years for these offences. 

13Here the facts and personal circumstances of the offender provide many reasons for a significant departure from that standard non-parole period. So far as the proceeds of crime offence is concerned the offender acted to warehouse the money. There is no evidence that he shared in any benefits provided by that large sum of money but I cannot accept he acted out of pure altruism. He must have expected or received some reward. 

14The amount of drugs and money alone, however, indicate the seriousness of these offences. As I have noted in relation to other related sentences I have imposed, the immense sums able to be taken from users by drug traders are clearly illustrated by this case. Like the trade in drugs, black money in the community also causes immense harm. It undermines the community's economic wellbeing. To willingly assist in this process knowing what he was doing and knowing the source of money was illicit, all matters which are elements of this offence, makes this when one considers the sum involved a very serious crime indeed. Despite the very strong subjective case, only full-time custody would reflect the objective circumstances of the two offences. 

15I have to date sentenced a number of offenders caught following Operation Schoale. I cannot ignore the fact of those sentences nor can I ignore the fact that Sparos and Moradien exploited friends, relatives and associates in their attempts to hide their ill-gotten gains and their drugs. The sentences I have imposed for related matters range from a twelve months suspended sentence for recklessly dealing with $200,000 (Georges [2011] NSWDC 61) to three years and nine months for recklessly dealing with $10 million (Peisley (2010) NSWDC 240) and three years nine months for knowingly dealing with $4.5 million (Natasha Youkhani [2011] NSWDC 204). Tania Youkhani received a two year sentence for knowingly dealing with $2.5 million of the syndicate's money (Tania Youkhani [2011] NSWDC 63). 

16All these offenders received the full benefit of a 25% reduction for their early pleas of guilty. Each offender, however, committed individual and different offences and each offender's personal circumstances differed significantly. I have regard to what fell from the High Court in Postiglione v The Queen [1997] 198 CLR 295 and more recently Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49 about proportional sentences and the justice that must be achieved when sentencing those involved in the same criminal enterprise even where the actual offences differ. But, as I have said, each sentencing exercise is different and each offender an individual. 

17 Sentences, however, should be applied to each offender, and each offence with consistent principles, but this does not require numerical or mathematical equivalence. Sentencing is not a mathematical exercise. It is a synthesis of competing features which attempt to translate the complexity of the human condition and human behaviour to the mathematics of units of punishment usually expressed in time or money see (Weininger v The Queen [2003] 212 CLR 629). 

18Critical to the sentence here are the purposes of sentencing. A sentencing must by its severity seek to ensure others are not tempted to risk punishment for the rewards the trade in illicit drugs offers. The Offender too must learn not to succumb to temptation in the future. I am prepared to accept that he has learnt his lesson. 

19 The Offender was arrested on 2 March 2007 and given Supreme Court bail on 5 April 2007. He served a period of one month and three days, thirty-four days for which he will be given credit. The Offender was committed for trial on 7 July 2010. His trial was listed to commence on 28 March 2011. The guilty plea was entered on 25 March 2011. Thereafter the offender has dismissed his lawyers and was for a period unrepresented. 

20The matter was adjourned to enable fresh representation and could not be finalised because court time was not available. Despite the delay, as with all Operation Schoale's matters, the plea had utilitarian value. I am conscious of the points set out by Howie J in Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32]. While the timing of the plea is a critical factor no one factor can determine the exercise of a judge's sentencing discretion (see Howie J Thawer [2009] NSWCCA 158 at [46] and Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39). 

21Here I propose to allow a reduction in sentence of 12.5%to reflect the plea's utilitarian value. 

The Offender

22The Offender was born on 5 November 1953 and raised in Italy until he came to Australia with his family in 1970. He is presently in a long-term and solid domestic relationship. An early marriage broke up while he was in custody in the early 1990s. There are two surviving children from that marriage. After his release from jail, until he was injured in 2004, he worked hard with a pool finishing company. He has since that date been receiving, as I understand, modest workers compensation benefits. 

23A pre-sentence report (Exhibit B) notes the Offender has benefited from a supportive relationship with his de facto and children, and that he has a son to that relationship. It notes, however, that there are unresolved mental health and financial burdens and that these appear to have contributed to his involvement in the matters now before the court. Supervision is not recommended as he is currently engaged in appropriate intervention services within the community. 

24In the Offender's case, Mr McCrudden tendered a report from Mr Watson-Munro, psychologist (Exhibit 1) and medical reports and records relating to the 2004 work injury and its consequence. He also called the offender and the offender's partner, Ms Marchetta. 

25The medical reports (Exhibit 2) are helpful and detail the considerable negative consequences of the work injury. Dr Prior's report (3/8/11) notes that he has a significant adjustment disorder with anxious and depressed mood, chronic pain perception, concern for his wife, who also suffers a serious cancer condition, and sleep apnoea.

26Dr Bodel, in his report of 3 February 2011, makes a comprehensive analysis of the consequences of the shoulder injury and the disability that this Offender suffers, which includes ongoing pain requiring constant medication. 

27There are, in the other reports and assessments, which provide more than sufficient evidence to indicate the significance of the physical disability and its psychological consequences on this Offender. In his evidence today, the Offender said that recently a thrombosis has been discovered which will require observation and possible hospitalisation and medical intervention. He gave evidence of the impact of his sleep apnoea and his need to use a sleep machine every night. He gave evidence of the complex medication which he is taking. It is absolutely clear that any custody imposed upon this offender will be served much harder than would be served by a younger, fitter man. 

28Mr Watson-Munro reports what I also noted from the time the offender appeared before me unrepresented, ""he presents as an highly agitated and loquacious man"". Today I note that he was much calmer and restrained. Although Mr Watson-Munro finds no indication of gross psychiatric disturbance he states: ""it is clear that this man suffers substantial cognitive intrusions. These appear to be referable to self-reported symptoms such as memory loss, disorientation and anxiety about criticism"". In Mr Watson-Munro's opinion his chronic pain has had a dramatic impact on him which in combination with other stresses has led to a high level of psychological distress requiring in future considerable psycho-therapeutic support. 

29Not of all of what Mr Watson-Munro states as his opinion can be supported by the other material which is Exhibit 2 or in the evidence before me. I find it hard to accept his evidence that the mental distress which this offender clearly suffered as a result of his injury caused him to commit this offence, but it is clear as was given in evidence by his partner, that he is on occasions confused, he does interrupt and his manner of speech can be confusing and argumentative, often against his own interests. 

30The material, particularly the evidence of Ms Marchetta, confirms he is a poor decision maker, and this is obvious from the history of this matter which I have summarised. It is confirmed in a number of his prior appearances before me and I am comforted to note that his appearance, manner and behaviour today has changed for the better. 

31Ms Marchetta indicated the valuable assistance which the offender gives her around the home. She has suffered from cancer for many years. She is presently in remission but requires treatment including chemotherapy. It is clear that she needs this offender to provide support both material and personal and that his custody will cause her considerable hardship. It will also cause hardship to their son who suffers from ADD. 

32The reports in Exhibit 2 confirm the offender has been receiving treatment not only for the physical effects of his work injury and the chronic pain that accompanies it but also for an adjustment disorder. There is a constellation in his life of significant stresses. As his prognosis for recovery from the shoulder injury and chronic pain resulting is guarded, and given other stresses such as his wife's illness, and the inevitable consequences of his criminal behaviour the offender presents as a man with long-term psychological problems for which treatment is required, and I will take that matter into account. 

33It is apparent that although he will have support in the community he will require assistance in adjusting to normal community life and this compels a finding of special circumstances. His medical condition and the hardship he suffers also provides a special circumstance and all of the material here indicates a significant reduction of the non-parole period is warranted (see Hili [2010] HCA 45)). 

34It is also clear that both his physical and psychological condition, especially pain management and sleep apnoea and psychological problems, will make his time in custody more onerous than that of other prisoners. It is a factor I take into account in reduction both of the sentence and consequently the non-parole period. I have tried to be careful in not double counting these matters. 

35Comprehensive submissions were provided by the Crown and the defence. I have taken them into account. I am prepared to accept, from all the material before me that it is highly unlikely that this offender will ever on release commit a further offence. 

36Mention must be made of the delay. He has been reporting very regularly to police, and that has a considerable impact over the years, but I have to note that this matter could have been resolved by the offender many, many years ago. His time on bail has proved his capacity to rehabilitate.

37I do not accept what is set out by Mr McCrudden in his submission in MFI 2 at page 19. It is clear that while this offender did not involve himself in any significant planning in the offence and it only took place over a few days, he was to a degree involved in what was clearly a planned long term illicit conspiracy.

38His role, however, was a very minor one, which had it not been for the amount of drugs and money may have reflected his own personal assessment of the matter.

39I do not find that his illness played any role in the commission of the offence given his age and experience, it is clear that he should have known better despite his attempts to minimise the seriousness of what was done.

40I accept what was set out in the pre-sentence report as to being the most likely motivation for his involvement, that is, a lack of judgment brought about by his psychological condition, and the need to attempt to alleviate the financial stresses he and his family were under.

41He was able to live a law abiding life since 1994 until this offence. He was able to lead a law abiding life while on bail. I suspect if it had not been for the stresses that flowed from the injury he would not have offended on this occasion. 

42His injuries and psychological conditions do not, however, mitigate the offence. He well knew what he was doing and its consequences. He must be held to account for his criminal activities. Nevertheless, all of these matters compel a reduction in the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate based on the objective circumstances of the offence. It also compels a non-parole period which shall be 50 percent of the ultimate sentence imposed.

43Sentencing is not, however, simply about an offender. The sentences must reflect the fact that two serious crimes were committed and most of all the potential impact of those offences on the community.

44Both carry high maximum penalties; 20 and 15 years. The supply count has a non parole period of 10 years. 

45Sentences must try by their severity to deter this offender and more importantly others from involving themselves in the drug trade. Even those low in the hierarchy who are involved only for days can expect a term of imprisonment.

46I also have to consider, as I have indicated, the sentences imposed on others and ensure there is some proportionality.

47What this offender did must be denounced and the harm to the community recognised. I must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and ask what is the appropriate sentence for all that was done (Mill (1998) 166 CLR 59 at 63). 

48Although separate offences were committed involving drugs and money there is considerable overlap in the offences objective circumstances and the subjective case in relation to each is the same.

49This is a matter which is suitable for the imposition of an aggregate sentence. What then is an appropriate sentence? Had it not been for the plea of guilty, sentences of 3 years 6 months for the drug matter and 3 years for the illicit cash matter would have been imposed. I allow, as I said, 12 and a half percent.

50I propose to impose an aggregate sentence. In relation to both matters you are convicted. In relation to Count 1, the supply of cocaine, as it carries a standard non-parole period, I indicate a sentence of 3 years with a non parole period of 1 year and 6 months.

51In relation to Count 2, the proceeds of crime matter, I indicate a sentence of 2 years and 7 months.

52I take into account the matter is noted bail and the fact that he has spent 34 days in custody. I take into account totality in my finding of special circumstances. I impose an aggregate sentence of 3 years and 6 months consisting of an aggregate sentence and non parole period of 1 year and 9 months to commence on 18 February 2012 and expire on 17 November 2013.

53You will be eligible for consideration for release to parole on the 17th of November 2013.

54The aggregate sentence parole period of 1 year and 9 months will commence on 18th November 2013 and expire on the 17th August 2015.

55That is total sentence of 3 years and 6 months backdated with a non parole period of 1 year 9 months.

2758875,Calleija v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 37,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY JA: Michael Joseph Calleija faces trial on the following two charges of alleged fraudulent taxation deductions between 1997 and 2006 against the Commonwealth: 

Between about 1 January 1997 and about 23 May 2001 at Sydney, New South Wales, did defraud the Commonwealth, in that he participated in a scheme by which false claims for tax deductions were made, contrary to the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 29D;

And that he:

Between about 24 May 2001 and about 30 June 2006 at Sydney, New South Wales, did participate in a scheme by which false claims for tax deductions were made with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to the Commonwealth, contrary to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), s 135.1(3).

2The scheme in which Mr Calleija allegedly participated involved two aspects: first, falsely inflating otherwise legitimate tax deductible expenses of his company, Outboard World Pty Limited (OBW), thus dishonestly reducing the amount of income tax properly payable; and secondly, by disguising OBW's income as loans from an overseas entity upon which interest was paid, also reducing the amount of income tax otherwise payable by the company. Although the scheme allegedly involved Mr Calleija and his company, it is not necessary in these reasons to differentiate between their alleged participation in the scheme, save occasionally for the purposes of clarity. 

3Following an Australian Taxation Office (ATO) audit of Mr Calleija's books and records, Mr Calleija voluntarily approached the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in June 2006. Over the succeeding months, he gave three separate induced statements to the AFP. However, he was not charged with any offences arising from his participation in the scheme until October 2009 and the indictment was not filed until 15 February 2011. 

4On 28 February 2011, Mr Calleija applied for a permanent stay of the prosecution. That application did not proceed to completion and a second application for a permanent stay was made on 27 May 2011. On 11 August 2011, Frearson DCJ refused the application. 

5Mr Calleija now seeks leave to appeal from his Honour's determination pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 5F. Section 5F provides as follows:

""5FAppeal against interlocutory judgment or order

(a)proceedings (including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court ...

(3)Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings: 
(a)if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal ...""

6The grant or refusal of an application for a permanent stay has been held by this Court to fall within the meaning of the words ""interlocutory judgment or order"" in s 5F: see R v King [2003] NSWCCA 399; 59 NSWLR 472 at 477 [22] per Spigelman CJ. As the decision to refuse or grant a stay is discretionary, the principles in House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 apply to the determination of an appeal from any such decision which is discretionary in nature: see Jago v District Court of NSW [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23 at 31 per Mason CJ. 

7Given the importance of the matter to Mr Calleija and the serious nature of an application for a permanent stay, I am of the opinion that leave should be granted. My reasons hereafter deal with the appeal.

8Mr Calleija's notice of grounds of appeal contained the following seven grounds:

""Main ground:
1.That the proceedings are an affront to the public conscience.

Supported by sub-grounds:
2.That [Mr Calleija] has discharged the required onus upon him.

3.That the indictment is bad for duplicity.

4.That the Crown has used [Mr Calleija's] induced statements in a derivative manner.

5.That oppression and undue hardship has been caused to [Mr Calleija] by the delay in bringing the prosecution.

6.That the Commonwealth Prosecution Guidelines have not fairly been adhered to.

7.[Mr Calleija] seeks leave to introduce new materials being 'Initial Briefing Paper to Australian Federal Police re Vanuatu Based Scheme Promoter' dated 11 November 2005 on the basis that it would have affected the decision of his Honour in relation to grounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 above.""

Background facts

9Mr Calleija was introduced to the scheme by his accountant and tax agent Owen T Daniel & Co (Owen T Daniel). Another alleged key participant in the scheme was a Mr Robert Agius. Insofar as Mr Calleija's participation is concerned, it is alleged that payments of approximately $2,350,000 were made from various of his company's bank accounts to three nominated New Zealand bank accounts during the period specified in the charges. The transfers were characterised in the books of the company as ""interest, management or consultancy fees"", or were subsumed in expenses of the company when there had been no real expenditure. Over the same period, funds of approximately $2,300,000 were transferred to the company's bank account and to Mr Calleija's personal bank account from a number of different New Zealand companies. The incoming transactions were usually close in time to the outgoing transactions. The Crown case is that the outgoing and incoming transactions constituted a series of round robins involving the circulation of similar amounts of money, supported by a document trail intended to create a false impression that the incoming and outgoing transactions were unconnected. 

10Mr Calleija came to the attention of the ATO in the course of an investigation which has become known as Project Wickenby. On 29 April 2003, the ATO wrote to Mr Calleija's accountants requesting information in respect of transactions involving Vanuatu and offshore superannuation arrangements. The accountants drafted the replies to the ATO on Mr Calleija's behalf, assuring Mr Calleija that everything was in order. In September and October 2004, the accountants provided documents to the ATO relating to Mr Calleija's involvement with the Vanuatu scheme. According to Mr Calleija's solicitor, Mr Calleija had not seen these documents prior to their being provided to the ATO. Subsequently, the ATO commenced an audit at Mr Calleija's company's office. 

11Mr Calleija made two further monetary transfers in November and December 2004 respectively. At the time of making the transfer in November 2004, Ms Abi Badra, an employee within the accountant's office working on Mr Calleija's accounts, assured him that everything was above board and legally covered by their lawyers. The Crown contends that in December 2004, Mr Calleija received the round robin return transfer, although the amount received was $20,000 less than he expected. 

12Mr Calleija sought legal advice in early 2005. The advice he was first given would appear to have been entirely inappropriate and Mr Calleija did not act upon it. In about mid-2005, Mr Calleija heard news reports about Project Wickenby. He subsequently obtained professional advice from new accountants and legal advisers, including a barrister, Mr Michael Inglis, who is a tax specialist. 

13As a result of this new legal advice, Mr Calleija made contact with both the AFP and the ATO. He offered to repay any moneys owing and to provide assistance to the AFP in relation to the Vanuatu scheme. Mr Calleija subsequently paid the outstanding tax in full together with interest and penalties. He was required to sell his house in order to do so. He also paid in excess of $350,000 in legal fees to his then solicitor and Mr Inglis. Leaving aside the payment of tax in the amount of approximately $1M, the financial burden on Mr Calleija has been significant.

14In fulfilment of his offer to provide assistance to the AFP, Mr Calleija made three induced statements. Each induced statement commenced with the following series of questions and answers:

""Q1.Mr CALLEIJA, do you agree that prior to this taped record of conversation being commenced I explained the procedure of what would be happening today?
AYes.

Q2.Okay. Mr CALLEIJA, this record of conversation is being conducted on the basis that it will not be used in evidence against you in any court proceedings other than proceedings in respect of the falsity of any evidence you may give during this record of conversation. Do you understand this?
AYes. Yeah.

Q3.Further, this record of conversation is made on the basis that it will be used to support an application to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for an indemnity for you from prosecution for any offences disclosed herein. Do you understand this?
AYes.

Q4.Michael, do you acknowledge that no insurances or guarantees have been given to you in relation to the grant for such an indemnity?
AYes, I do.

Q5.Okay. And Mr CALLEIJA, are you prepared for this record of conversation to be used as the basis for the preparation of an induced statement?
AYes.

Q6.Okay. Do you agree that you have decided to participate in this taped record of conversation of your own free will?
AYes, I do."" 

15Following the first induced statement, the AFP executed search warrants on the business premises of Owen T Daniel and subsequent search warrants were conducted on most of the 19 clients of the accountants, who had been identified as being involved in the scheme. 

16On 20 April 2010, Detective Superintendent Moerman of the AFP provided a letter containing an ""Assessment of Assistance"" in respect of the AFP's dealing with Mr Calleija for the purposes of use in any criminal proceedings brought against Mr Calleija. The letter briefly outlined the operation of the scheme; recorded that in June 2006, Mr Calleija approached the AFP; stated that he provided induced statements to the AFP; and noted that during the interviews, Mr Calleija provided ""a full and frank admission regarding his involvement in the scheme"". Detective Superintendent Moerman added that Mr Calleija also ""provided valuable information as to how the scheme was promoted, how it was marketed to him, and how it worked in practice"".

17Detective Superintendent Moerman recorded that as a result of the information given to the AFP during the first induced statement, the police shifted the focus of their investigations from the clients of Owen T Daniel to the accountants of that firm as being the persons instrumental in facilitating the scheme. He said that:

""The information provided by [Mr Calleija] contributed significantly to the success, to date, of the AFP investigation."" 

18Detective Superintendent Moerman evaluated the assistance provided by Mr Calleija as follows. He reiterated that the AFP used the information provided to focus the direction of the investigation and stated the AFP were intending to use the information in the briefs of evidence in the prosecutions of Mr Agius and a number of accountants from Owen T Daniel. He reported that Mr Calleija was willing to give evidence in court if required and expressed the view that Mr Calleija had provided all the information that he had to the AFP. Detective Superintendent Moerman rated Mr Calleija's assistance ""as being of a high level of assistance"". The letter concluded that it had been ""prepared for consideration by the court in sentencing"" Mr Calleija. 

Evidence on the application for a permanent stay

19Detective Superintendent Moerman confirmed the matters he had discussed in his letter of 20 April 2010 in his evidence on the hearing of the application for a permanent stay. It is relevant, for the purposes of the arguments advanced on behalf of Mr Calleija, to have regard to that evidence in some detail. 

20Detective Superintendent Moerman first gave evidence in March 2011. That application did not proceed. However, the transcript of that evidence was tendered in evidence on the hearing of the application before Frearson DCJ. Relevantly, Detective Superintendent Moerman's evidence dealt with the following topics which were essentially interrelated, namely, the assistance he had provided to the police; the AFP's wish, if possible, to use Mr Calleija as a witness in the trial of Mr Agius; the AFP's application made to the DPP that Mr Calleija be provided with an indemnity from prosecution; and the fact that and reasons why Mr Calleija was not charged until 2009. 

21Detective Superintendent Moerman reiterated in his evidence that the information provided by Mr Calleija in the induced statements had been of assistance in relation to the whole investigation. In this regard, Mr Calleija's first induced statement was of particular assistance to the AFP as it explained how the whole scheme worked. This made it possible for the AFP to link the way in which the scheme operated. 

22Detective Superintendent Moerman gave evidence that in his view Mr Calleija would be ""invaluable as a witness against Mr Agius"". Given his view of Mr Calleija's value as a witness, Detective Superintendent Moerman gave evidence that he considered Mr Calleija should be granted an indemnity from prosecution and informed the Court he made an application to that effect to the DPP. He said that he supported the grant of indemnity:

""Because of the amount of assistance that [Mr Calleija] had provided to [the AFP] throughout the investigation that resulted in the success of the investigation that took place ..."" 

23Detective Superintendent Moerman also explained why there had been a delay in charging Mr Calleija:

""Q.Okay, then any reason why [Mr Calleija] wasn't charged in 2008?
A.Because we had only decided to charge the others. We weren't going to charge him in relation to this matter, until the matter had been put before the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.

Q.Yes, but why charge the others and not him? He was first in line.
A.Because, at that point of time, he had come to us and provided an induced statement, and I had agreed that I would use that to make an application for an indemnity. So therefore I had to wait until that application could be considered by the Commonwealth DPP before any matters could proceed."" 

24He was asked further questions about this, as well as questions relating to grant of indemnity:

""Q.All along I think you said that it was not your job to give him or guarantee him any immunity, is that correct?
A.That's correct.

Q.However, he was not charged by the Federal Police at all?
A.That's correct. 

Q.Of course you had authority to charge him if you wanted to, didn't you?
A.Yes.

Q.You didn't charge him, did you?
A.No.

Q.Why?
A.Because that was a decision where I was asking for him to be used as a witness in the matter of the promoters.

Q.Did you think he was an important witness?
A.I believed he was, yes.

...

Q.But he was the first in line and his scheme was over a longer time, and certainly did you ever give him - in fact I suggest to you that what you said you didn't charge him and were there conversations where you believed - you believed he wouldn't be charged, didn't you?
A.No, there was conversations saying that I would apply to the DPP. They were the ones who would make that decision. But the AFP was not charging him in relation to this matter at that time.

...

Q.You never gave him the impression that he wouldn't be charged or told him that he wouldn't be charged, did you?
A.I informed him that it would be a decision to be made by the Commonwealth DPP, not by us.

Q.But certainly you indicated to him that the Federal Police were not going to charge him?
A.That's correct.

Q.That everything you were taking from him was to be used on the basis that he was to be a witness for the prosecution, is that correct?
A.It was on the basis that we would make application to the Commonwealth DPP for him to be used as a witness, yes.

...

Q.Just in relation to the chronology, you initially - how was it that you requested formally an indemnity or an immunity from the DPP? So far as the AFP was concerned, was it a written application?
A.It was a written application, yes.

Q.Was that at a time when a brief of evidence had been prepared in respect of Mr Calleija's alleged involvement himself?
A.It was at the time we submitted his statement and that we wished for him to be used.

...

Q.That being in 2009 at some stage, is that right?
A.Yes.

Q.Whereas he'd seen you on a number of occasions before 2009?
A.That's correct.

...

Q.During that period from the time when he made his first induced record of conversation, that was about late 2006, is that right?
A.He first came to us June/July 2006 and the first interview was September 2006, yes.

Q.So from that time, 2006 until some time in 2009, it was the Federal Police's intention or idea that he would be used as a witness, is that right?
A.It was, yes.

Q.Rather than that he would be charged?
A.That's correct.

Q.But when the formal request for a decision as to whether or not he would be charged was made, that only occurred in 2009, is that right?
A.That's correct.

Q.In the meantime, what had happened in relation to the investigation and/or charging of other people?
A.We had gone to resolution at the end of April 2008 where there was 13 - I think 17 people charged at that point of time.

Q.Some of them being clients of [Owen T Daniel's] practice?
A.That's correct.

Q.The accountants as well?
A.And the accountants and Mr Agius, and they were charged, yeah, April 28th [2008].

...

Q.What about between that time and when the request was made for Mr Calleija's indemnity or immunity some time in 2009? What was happening during that period?
A.We were preparing all the briefs of evidence, all the submissions of the statements, and then finalising the statement of Mr Calleija, which we then submitted at the end.

Q.With the request for him to be indemnified?
A.Yes, that's correct.

Q.That request was rejected it seems?
A.Yes.

Q.Then the Federal Police sought to discuss that with the Director of Public Prosecutions and his officers, is that right?
A.That's right.

Q.Was that opportunity provided?
A.Yes. 

Q.Did you believe that your views were taken into account?
A.I gave my views to the Commonwealth DPP, yes.

Q.They were listened to, at least, is that right?
A.Yes.

...

Q.Then charges were laid sometime around that time, is that right?
A.Yes."" 

25Mr Calleija's wife also gave evidence. She said that she and Mr Calleija were ""very much under the impression that nothing further would happen"", given that Mr Calleija had worked with the police and helped them. She said that the pressures on Mr Calleija and his family had been tremendous and had ""blown [the family] apart"". In this regard, Mr Calleija's first wife had died tragically, leaving him with four children. He and his second wife had another child, aged about one and a half at the time of her giving evidence.

Application refusal

26Frearson DCJ found that Mr Calleija had not demonstrated that the prosecution was an abuse of process and thus dismissed the application for a permanent stay. However, in a passage upon which Mr Calleija's counsel placed considerable emphasis on the appeal, his Honour added:

""I accept that any decision made by the DPP not to prosecute [Mr Calleija] in all the circumstances would have been perfectly reasonable and there was much to recommend that course. Indeed many people would think that was an appropriate course. But that is not the test. The Director made a different decision. It was his decision. It is not my task to directly review his decision. I do not have that power of course. But I am entitled to look at the consequences of the decision and to examine and have regard to the circumstances that prevailed when the decision was made. 

It seems to me that the circumstances and the consequences do not justify the court in declining to exercise jurisdiction in the matter and accordingly the stay is refused."" 

27It will be necessary to return to this and other aspects of his Honour's reasons later in this judgment.

General principles as to the grant of a permanent stay of criminal proceedings

28It is well established that the grant of a permanent stay of criminal proceedings is one that should be ordered only in an extreme case. The central principle governing the granting of a stay was stated by Mason CJ in Jago v District Court of NSW, at 34, in the following terms:

""To justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings, there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial 'of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences'."" (citation omitted)

29Mason CJ considered that underlying the power of the court to grant a permanent stay was the court's inherent jurisdiction to prevent abuses of process. In this regard, his Honour adopted the reasoning of Richardson J in Moevao v Department of Labour (1980) 1 NZLR 464 at 482, where his Honour stated:

""It is not the purpose of the criminal law to punish the guilty at all costs. It is not that that end may justify whatever means may have been adopted. There are two related aspects of the public interest which bear on this. The first is that the public interest in the due administration of justice necessarily extends to ensuring that the Court's processes are used fairly by State and citizen alike. And the due administration of justice is a continuous process, not confined to the determination of the particular case. It follows that in exercising its inherent jurisdiction the Court is protecting its ability to function as a Court of law in the future as in the case before it. This leads on to the second aspect of the public interest which is in the maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice. It is contrary to the public interest to allow that confidence to be eroded by a concern that the Court's processes may lend themselves to oppression and injustice.""

30Mason CJ had noted, at 33, that ""the touchstone in every case is fairness"". His Honour pointed out that the relevant test of fairness involved a balancing process having regard to the interests of the accused, as well as the community's right to expect that persons charged with criminal offences are brought to trial. In this regard, an essential consideration in the balancing exercise is the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice: see Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77; 177 CLR 378 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ at 395-396. See also Petroulias v R [2007] NSWCCA 154; 176 A Crim R 302 per Ipp JA at [17]. 

31In Moti v The Queen [2011] HCA 50; 283 ALR 393 the plurality (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) identified three basic considerations necessary to determine before making a decision as to abuse of process. Their Honours observed, at [57]:

""The third basic proposition is that, as pointed out in the joint reasons of four members of this Court in Williams v Spautz, two fundamental policy considerations affect abuse of process in criminal proceedings. First, 'the public interest in the administration of justice requires that the court protect its ability to function as a court of law by ensuring that its processes are used fairly by State and citizen alike'. Second, 'unless the court protects its ability so to function in that way, its failure will lead to an erosion of public confidence by reason of concern that the court's processes may lend themselves to oppression and injustice'. Public confidence in this context refers to the trust reposed constitutionally in the courts to protect the integrity and fairness of their processes. The concept of abuse of process extends to a use of the courts' processes in a way that is inconsistent with those fundamental requirements."" (citations omitted)

32In Australia the common law has not recognised the existence of a right to a speedy trial, or even to a trial within a reasonable time based upon any concept of presumptive prejudice. However, there may be circumstances when delay is such that a permanent stay should be granted. When the question of delay is in issue, matters that need to be considered include the length of the delay, the reasons for it, the accused's responsibility for asserting his or her rights and any prejudice suffered by the accused. However, even when those factors are taken into account, ""a permanent stay should be ordered only in an extreme case and the making of such an order on the basis of delay alone will ... be very rare"": per Mason CJ in Jago at 34. In Jago, Mason CJ observed at 33:

""Because there is no constitutional guarantee of a speedy trial, the remedies are discretionary and necessarily relate to the harm suffered or likely to be suffered if appropriate orders are not made.""

33In Jago Brennan J, at 47, commented upon the obstacles to a fair trial that are often encountered in the administration of criminal justice, such as adverse publicity, witnesses becoming unavailable and the lack of competent representation. His Honour observed, however, that those matters did not give rise to the need for proceedings to be permanently stayed. As his Honour noted, ""[u]nfairness occasioned by circumstances outside the court's control does not make the trial a source of unfairness"". When an obstacle to a fair trial occurs, a trial judge has the responsibility to the parties to avoid the unfairness. However, that responsibility was not discharged by the court refusing to exercise jurisdiction. Rather, it was the trial judge's responsibility to control the procedures of the trial so as to ensure that the trial was ultimately fair. 

34Brennan J also acknowledged, at 47, that ""[m]ore radical remedies may be needed to prevent an abuse of process"". His Honour then defined an ""abuse of process"" as occurring when:

""... the process of the court is put in motion for a purpose which, in the eye of the law, it is not intended to serve or when the process is incapable of serving the purpose it is intended to serve. The purpose of criminal proceedings, generally speaking, is to hear and determine finally whether the accused has engaged in conduct which amounts to an offence and, on that account, is deserving of punishment. When criminal process is used only for that purpose and is capable of serving that purpose, there is no abuse of process.""

35The category of case in which a stay may be granted is not closed. In Walton v Gardiner at 392-393, Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ, in the context of an application for a stay of civil proceedings, observed that the court has jurisdiction to grant a stay where its processes and procedures are converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness contrary to their intended purpose of administering justice with fairness and impartiality. Their Honours stated that the categories of cases where a stay may be granted included proceedings which were doomed to failure and the employment of the court's processes in a manner which gave rise to unfairness. Their Honours rejected the notion that a permanent stay may only be ordered where an improper purpose was established or there was no possibility of a fair trial: see Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34; 174 CLR 509 at 519-520.

36These principles were confirmed by the High Court in Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20; 241 CLR 237. The Court confirmed, at 250, [35], that there was ""no definitive category of extreme cases in which a permanent stay of criminal proceedings will be ordered"": see R v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; 173 CLR 592. Their Honours reconfirmed the need to consider, in the balance, the substantial public interest in having those charged with criminal offences brought to trial. As the plurality (Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ) had stated in Williams v Spautz, the confidence in the proper administration of justice requires that the court protect its ability to function as a court of law by ensuring the processes are used fairly by State and citizen alike. In Dupas, the Court, at 251, [37], characterised a permanent stay as ""tantamount to a continuing immunity from prosecution"". It followed that fairness to the accused alone was not the only relevant consideration when determining whether a trial should proceed. Rather, the Court pointed out that the decision whether to prosecute requires an evaluation of the particular circumstances of the case weighed in the context of a number of public interest considerations including public confidence in the administration of justice: see Walton v Gardiner at 395-396; Dupas at 251, [37]; Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [172].

The grounds of appeal

Ground 1: that the proceedings are an affront to the public conscience

37The principles governing the grant of a permanent stay are entrenched in notions of ""abuse of process"", of there being ""a fundamental defect that goes to the root of the prosecution"" and in ""fairness"" involving a balancing of considerations relevant to the accused person and the public interest, particularly in having persons charged with criminal offences being brought to trial. However, counsel for Mr Calleija invoked different terminology, namely, that the proceedings are an ""affront to the public conscience"", a phrase used by Cox J in the Supreme Court of South Australia in R v Vuckov and Romeo (1986) 22 A Crim R 10. 

38Vuckov and Romeo involved an application for a stay based on alleged entrapment of the accused by police. Cox J stated, at 30-31, that if the grant of a permanent stay could be used where police had acted illegally to bring a defendant before the court, there did not seem to be a basis to refuse to grant a stay in other cases of serious police oppression. His Honour acknowledged that such circumstances would be rare, but considered that there was no good reason in principle for denying the court's power to order a permanent stay in an entrapment case. His Honour noted that a trial judge could properly exclude evidence obtained as a result of entrapment and thus effectively bring the case to an end. There seemed no reason in that circumstance not to grant a permanent stay where, as his Honour stated:

""...the evidence shows that it would be unfair to the defendant or an affront to the public conscience to permit the prosecution to proceed."" 

39In the present case, the Court questioned Mr Calleija's counsel as to the principle he was seeking to invoke in relying upon the notion of ""affront to the public conscience"". Counsel accepted that this was no more than a different way of stating that a stay of proceedings will only be granted in an exceptional case. Counsel's argument then proceeded to explore what was meant by an ""exceptional case"". He submitted that such a case would be identified having regard to the following factors: what a fair-minded and reasonable person would think; the administration of justice being brought into disrepute; maintaining public confidence in the legal system; oppression and hardship to the accused; a fair trial; avoiding detriment to the accused; and weighing up the competing interests between prosecuting an allegedly guilty person and deciding not to prosecute such a person in the interests of justice, if and when circumstances commended that course. Counsel then submitted that the ""practical test to be applied"" was:

""... 'what a sound-minded and right-thinking person would reasonably consider to be 'an affront to the public conscience' in the context of the interests of justice, provided the circumstances were determined to be exceptional enough so as to warrant such a consideration."" 

40Mr Calleija's counsel submitted that when regard was had to the way that Mr Calleija was treated by the prosecuting authorities, a sound-minded and right-thinking person would consider his prosecution to be an affront to the public conscience. In support of this submission, counsel relied upon the following undisputed facts. Mr Calleija had approached the AFP. In other words, it was not the case that the AFP had sought him out. He had provided them with induced statements upon which the AFP had acted in their investigations and in the prosecution of other participants in the scheme. The AFP had indicated to Mr Calleija that he would be used as a witness in the case, such that his hopes were built up that he would not be prosecuted. Notwithstanding this, the police had charged him and steps have been taken to prosecute him to trial. In short, the submission was that the prosecuting authorities had used Mr Calleija and then, in the face of his reasonable expectation that he would not be charged, proceeded to charge him. 

41The present case is not one of entrapment, as was the position in Vuckov v Romeo, or of illegally obtained evidence. Nor are the prosecuting authorities able to use information obtained from the induced statements in the prosecution of Mr Calleija. Some confusion in the case arose when the DPP served Mr Calleija's legal representatives with an overview and summary of evidence, which expressly referred to and incorporated information from the induced statements. It appears that this summary had been effectively copied from the summary prepared for the trial of Mr Agius. Whilst the service of this summary can only be described as inept, it was withdrawn by the DPP when this matter was brought to their attention. Shortly thereafter, the DPP served a fresh overview and summary of evidence in which the prohibited material from the induced statements was removed. The new summary was based entirely on information obtained other than from Mr Calleija's induced statements. In my opinion, there is nothing in the manner in which the Crown proposes to adduce evidence at trial that constitutes an abuse of process. 

42Nor can Mr Calleija's hopes or expectation that he would not be charged amount to an exceptional case such that the prosecution ought to be stayed. This question is dealt with in more detail below, under ground 4. However, in circumstances where Mr Calleija was told expressly that no assurances or guarantees were being given that he would be granted an indemnity, there is no affront to the public conscience or any abuse of process in bringing the present prosecution. 

43Ground 1 should be rejected.

Ground 2: Mr Calleija has discharged the required onus upon him

44There was no dispute that Mr Calleija bears the onus of establishing that there has been an abuse of process or that the circumstances are such that a permanent stay should be granted: see Williams v Spautz at 529. In his written submissions, counsel for Mr Calleija made reference to comments that have been made in certain authorities that the onus on a defendant seeking a permanent stay is a heavy one. He suggested that more judicial guidance is needed to clarify the standard of proof required to discharge the necessary ""heavy onus"" and the evidence that must be adduced to meet that threshold. 

45There are two problems with this ground of appeal. First, Mr Calleija's counsel has not pointed to any aspect of the trial judge's reasons in respect of which his Honour made an error in relation to the question of onus. Accordingly, he has not demonstrated error in accordance with the principles in House v R. 

46Secondly, the manner in which the question of onus operates in circumstances such as these has been well articulated in the case law. In R v Petroulias [2005] NSWCCA 75; 62 NSWLR 663 Mason P, at [103], 688, noted an accused seeking a permanent stay of proceedings, assumes ""the high burden of seeking to establish irremediable abuse of process"". This statement was made in the context of the proposition that a permanent stay will only be exercised in the most exceptional circumstances: see Jago at 34. 

47Statements such as ""heavy onus"" and ""high burden"" are well grounded in the judicial understanding of what is required when proof of a serious matter is in issue. It was explained by Dixon J in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34; 60 CLR 336, at 361-362, in the following terms:

""The truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. It cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. No doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty; and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. Fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. Except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. In such matters 'reasonable satisfaction' should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences.""

48Dixon J then referred to comments made that an issue such as fraud must be proved ""clearly"", ""unequivocally"", ""strictly"" or ""with certainty"". His Honour pointed out, at 363, that this did not mean there was some intermediate level of satisfaction required, floating somewhere between the criminal and the civil standard of proof. Rather, it meant that ""the nature of the issue necessarily affects the process by which reasonable satisfaction is attained"". 

49In my opinion, it is clear what the courts have meant when making such comments and more judicial guidance is not needed. 

50For the reasons I have given, the fact that Mr Calleija gave assistance to the police does not render this an exceptional case. The fact that a decision not to prosecute would have been reasonable does not alter what I have said. The trial judge was not reviewing the decision of the DPP to prosecute. His Honour had no power to review that decision, as he pointed out in his reasons. More fundamentally, it is simply not correct to state that it is an abuse of process to prosecute where assistance has been provided. The fact of assistance in such cases is appropriately taken into account on sentence.

51I would reject ground 2. 

Ground 3: that the indictment is bad for duplicity

52The terms of the indictment have been set out above. 

53Mr Calleija contended that the indictment is bad for duplicity, as it wrongly pre-supposes that he was knowingly part of the conspiracy with the accountants, Robert Agius and others, to commit an illegal act even though Mr Calleija has not been charged with the offence of conspiracy. 

54This submission confronts two problems. The first is that duplicity is not a ground for granting a stay. Rather, even assuming that the indictment was bad for duplicity, this could be remedied by the Crown being put to its election as to the charge to be preferred: see Stanton v Abernathy (1990) 19 NSWLR 656 at 668 per Gleeson CJ; Mackay v R [1977] HCA 22; 136 CLR 465 at 471-472 per Jacobs J. In other words, it would be within the power of the trial judge to make orders in relation to the indictment that would relieve against any unfairness to the accused: see Jago v District Court of NSW at 34. That alone is sufficient to dispose of this ground. 

55In any event, I am of the opinion that the counts in the indictment are not duplicitous. The Crown case alleges a continuing offence, the essential nature of which is the entry into a number of transactions involving payment for fictitious services and interest payments for amounts said to be in respect of loan transactions, where there was no legitimate underlying transaction to support the claim for interest. The Crown case is that this is a classic round robin, the effect of which was to create the opportunity for illusory taxation deductions in circumstances where Mr Calleija knew the transactions did not represent the true position. In short, what is alleged is a single criminal enterprise: see Regina v Moussad [1999] NSWCCA 337; 152 FLR 373. 

56In Moussad the charged offence was in relation to moneys received by the accused pursuant to claims she submitted to the Department for the nine individual financial quarters commencing in 1991 and ending in April 1993, contrary to the Crimes Act, s 29D. Section 29D provided: ""a person who defrauds the Commonwealth ... is guilty of an indictable offence"". This is the same section with which Mr Calleija was charged in the first count on the indictment. 

57The accused in Moussad had contended before the trial judge that the count was duplicitous. The trial judge rejected that application. His Honour accepted that each of the quarterly returns claiming Childcare Fee Relief constituted an individual offence. Nonetheless, the trial judge was satisfied that there was a single criminal enterprise of a continuing kind. Notwithstanding that each claim was lodged separately and was in a different amount, the claims for Fee Relief were linked by a common purpose. His Honour considered that it would present an unreal picture of the activities of the accused if the acts were broken up into nine different counts. His Honour was also satisfied that it was not unfair to allow evidence of the nine quarterly fee relief claims and the supporting documentation to be led as evidence supporting that continuing enterprise. His Honour held, therefore, that the indictment was not bad for duplicity. 

58On appeal, the accused argued that three consequences flowed from the trial judge's ruling. First, the Crown was not required to elect upon which act of dishonesty it relied to prove that element of the charge. Secondly, the ability of the Crown to adduce evidence of the nine individual claims potentially constituted prejudicial evidence of tendency and/or coincidence contrary to the Evidence Act 1995, Pt 3.6. Thirdly, it was impossible to deduce from the jury's verdict convicting the accused of the offence whether they found dishonesty on the basis of one act, or the total number of claims or any number in between.

59Smart AJ (Wood CJ at CL and Bell J agreeing) made the following observations in respect of an offence under s 29D, which are particularly useful, as they specifically address a number of matters that Mr Calleija's counsel raised in the present case. His Honour said, at 377, [25]:

""Section 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) uses words of general import, namely, 'Any person who defrauds the Commonwealth'. That does not indicate that the section is dealing with a single act. In many cases of social security fraud, medical benefit fraud, nursing home fraud, family benefit fraud and child care fraud practised on the Commonwealth, all of which come before the courts with frequency, there is often an initial agreement or arrangement between the Commonwealth and the recipient governing an ongoing position under which the Commonwealth makes payments, often in advance and there is a periodical accounting and acquittal under which adjustments are made. What is telling in such circumstances is not the odd error which may be due to an honest mistake but the pattern which emerges and makes it plain that there is in existence a fraudulent enterprise. Sometimes the individual acts relied upon involve small sums of money. This is such a case. To take the individual acts one by one does not reveal the true overall situation.""

60Smart AJ in Moussad noted it has been accepted in New South Wales that ""enterprise"" counts have their place in fraud cases where the overall criminality is the central allegation. His Honour considered that the allegation against Ms Moussad was of systematic defrauding over a period of time, such that separate counts were not appropriate. Smart AJ concluded that the acts complained of and particularised formed part of the same criminal enterprise and were linked by a common purpose. It followed that there was no unfairness to the accused being charged with one count only and his Honour held that the duplicity point failed. 

61The basis for and permissibility of charging one offence where a number of separate acts have been considered is well established. In R v Hamzy (1994) 74 A Crim R 341, Hunt CJ at CL (Abadee and Simpson JJ agreeing) after reviewing the authorities stated, at 349:

""I see no reason why the concept of the one criminal enterprise or one criminal activity should be interpreted narrowly. Obviously enough, the fewer the number of individual acts, the fewer people and the shorter the period of time involved, the less likely that there could be any unfairness to the accused, but the issue of unfairness is dealt with separately from the issue as to whether the individual acts could fairly and properly be so identified. In the present case, it would have presented a totally unreal picture of the activities alleged against the appellant if anything less than the total picture had been presented to the jury. According to the evidence, the appellant was constantly involved in the one criminal enterprise of dealing in heroin. Even if the individual acts of supply had been divided up into different counts, each count relating to the acts of supply to a different Crown witness, there would have been no real justification for separate trials relating to each count. Again, a totally unreal picture would have been presented. And, as the defence was one of denial of any involvement in the supply of heroin, the evidence of similar facts may well have been admissible in any event to meet the attempted exculpatory explanations by the appellant for the presence of the different Crown witnesses at his home.""

62Hamzy has been consistently followed in this Court in appropriate cases.

63In Moussad, Smart AJ observed that ""duplicity is a matter of form, not evidence"". In this regard, the decision in Taylor v The Queen (1997) 93 A Crim R 1 is instructive. That case involved three charges under s 29D covering separate periods. In each, the allegation was that the accused obtained payment of a sole parent pension to which she was not entitled. The Crown relied on 31 separate occasions of making false claims. Underwood J observed that s 29D does not create a separate offence for each payment. However, in that case, the indictment and the particulars provided did not allege a continuous deceitful failure to disclose the correct state of affairs. Rather the indictment, as a matter of form, related to each alleged false representation, each made with the intention of obtaining a benefit. In other words, as the indictment was framed, the jury was required to decide whether each statement was false at the time it was made. As the Crown had alleged 31 separate instances of defrauding conduct, there should have been a separate charge for each occasion. It followed that the indictment was bad for duplicity.

64Counsel for Mr Calleija contended that this is a completely different case from Moussad. He submitted that in Moussad, the accused was the instigator and had control over her deceptive conduct in relation to the Centrelink fraud. This case was different, in that it was the accountants who initiated and controlled the scheme and who prepared the relevant documentation, including Mr Calleija's tax returns in each of the years covered by the alleged offending. For this reason, he submitted it would be impossible for a jury to discern the relevant intent required for it to be satisfied that Mr Calleija was guilty of the offence charged and also difficult, if not impossible, for the jury to be properly directed in relation to intent. 

65Counsel submitted that as Mr Calleija's participation in the scheme was reliant upon him signing a tax return prepared for him by his accountant each year, his intention in claiming the allegedly false deductions could only be inferred from each document on a yearly basis. In raising the difficulty with the jury being properly directed as to intent, counsel raised the rhetorical question:

""... how is the jury to be directed if some believe that there is no required intent for the first year 1997 but there is the required intent for the last transaction in 2004, when more information was available after the [ATO] audit."" 

66Counsel contended that the unfairness of this position was patent by posing the further rhetorical question:

""... what does a jury do if it is satisfied only of a guilty intent for one year, but not for the other years."" 

67Counsel submitted that the unfairness was of such a nature that a permanent stay should be granted. 

68The question whether, in circumstances where an alleged fraud involves more than one transaction, a person may be charged with one offence or, as a matter of fairness should be charged with an offence relating to each transaction depends on at least the following two matters. The first is the specific terms of the offence with which the person is charged. The second is, as already discussed, the form of the indictment. There are fraud offences which, it has been held, only relate to a single transaction. The Crimes Act 1900, s 178BB is an example. That section provided:

""Whosoever with the intent to obtain for himself or herself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage ... which he or she knows to be false or misleading in a material particular ... shall be liable to imprisonment ..."" (emphasis added)

69In R v Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53; 104 A Crim R 416, Spigelman CJ, Abadee and Adams JJ agreeing, held that s 178BB related to an offence in respect of each transaction. The language of the section and, in particular, the use of the word ""any"" indicated a degree of singularity. By contrast, it has been long accepted that pursuant to s 29D, it is legitimate for the Crown to allege a case of a criminal enterprise constituted by a number of specific transactions, entered into on different occasions, with different amounts of money involved, on the basis that the transactions were linked by a common purpose. In such a case, the relevant intention is the entry into the overall scheme or enterprise. More importantly, for the arguments raised on behalf of Mr Calleija, particularly relating to the question of intent, it does not matter if, within the totality of transactions, there is an occasional honest mistake. Nor is it relevant that Mr Calleija may not have had an intent to defraud in respect of one particular income tax return. What is relevant is the pattern of transactions which makes it plain that, taken as a whole, the transactions were entered into as part of a fraudulent enterprise. 

70The approach in Moussad has been approved and followed in New South Wales: see R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 1) [2006] NSWSC 788; 177 A Crim R 153 at 246 per Johnson J; Hakim v Waterways Authority of New South Wales [2006] NSWCCA 376; 149 LGERA 415, especially at [83] per Spigelman CJ (Grove and Bell JJ agreeing).

71It follows that I would reject ground 3. 

Ground 4: that the Crown has used the induced statements in a derivative manner

72This ground of appeal requires an examination of the procedural history in the matter. 

73The DPP advised Mr Calleija's solicitors by letter dated 8 December 2010, that his application for the charges against him be ""no billed"" had been rejected. The DPP also advised that it proposed to proceed upon 11 separate charges. This was in contrast to an earlier position taken by the DPP when Mr Calleija's then legal representatives were engaged in plea negotiations with the DPP. It appears at that time, it was indicated that only two counts were to be preferred. 

74The DPP provided, in draft form, the proposed indictment containing 11 charges. At about the same time, the DPP provided Mr Calleija's solicitors with an overview and summary of evidence. This was the summary that was based upon and expressly referred to Mr Calleija's induced statements. A second overview and summary of evidence was then served. This document contained no reference to the induced statements. Nor was it based upon information obtained by the prosecuting authorities from the induced statements. At the same time, the Crown advised that it intended to rely upon the evidence of 11 further witnesses. 

75By letter dated 23 February 2011, Mr Calleija's solicitors objected to the proposed reliance upon these witnesses. The solicitors contended that Mr Calleija was severely prejudiced by the late service of the witnesses' statements and that, in any event, the proposed evidence of the new witnesses was irrelevant and prejudicial and of no direct probative value in the prosecution of Mr Calleija. The DPP did not withdraw its intended reliance upon the 11 witnesses. However, Frearson DCJ ruled that the evidence of those witnesses was inadmissible. There has been no challenge by the Crown to that ruling.

76Mr Calleija complains that although there will be no direct reliance upon the material in the induced statements, that material is to be used in a derivative way and he submitted that was unfair, giving rise to an abuse of process. In essence, Mr Calleija contended that the DPP's preparation and its proposed manner of conducting the prosecution has been fashioned having regard to the information contained in Mr Calleija's induced statements. Counsel submitted that the Crown case has been derived from the information in the induced statements so that the Crown was now aware of Mr Calleija's defence, namely, that he believed his accountants when they told him the scheme was legal. 

77Mr Calleija asserted that the Crown has thus derived an advantage from its knowledge of the content of the induced statements, which it would not have, had those statements not been made. He contended that the Crown, being so armed with this material, has a tactical advantage over him, particularly in relation to knowing what his defence will be. Mr Calleija contended that no fair-minded person would consider this to be ""fair play"". 

78The trial judge accepted that the induced statements had expedited and focused the investigation into the tax fraud. His Honour also accepted that the induced statements assisted the police and the DPP in understanding how the scheme had operated. However, his Honour concluded it had not been demonstrated that the prosecution had derived some unfair advantage resulting from the use of the induced statements such that any trial would be unfair.

79I have already referred to the ineptness of the Crown in serving a statement based on information contained in Mr Calleija's induced statements. It undoubtedly caused very real dismay and concern to Mr Calleija and his legal representatives. However, the position has been remedied and the present overview and summary of facts has been prepared from documentation and material upon which the Crown is legitimately entitled to rely in the prosecution of Mr Calleija. 

80Counsel for Mr Calleija submitted that this would not overcome the prejudice. Mr Calleija argued that if he was called to give evidence in his defence, the Crown would have the advantage of the material in his induced statements for the purposes of cross-examination. He referred, by way of example, to paras (254) and (255) of the abandoned summary, which refers to information provided by Mr Calleija in his induced statement that he thought that one of the companies within the scheme, was a bogus company set up by Mr Agius. He also said that to him it was all a sham. He also admitted, in his induced statement of 20 April 2009, that he had initially given false answers to the ATO when they first questioned him about the matter. 

81The Crown accepted that the prosecution cannot use any information from the induced statements in any trial of Mr Calleija. It also accepted that the first overview and summary of facts was wrongly served on Mr Calleija. It submitted, however, that that overview and summary of facts, upon which the Crown now relies, is based upon information, none of which has been derived from the induced statements. The fact that the Crown is in possession of information from Mr Calleija, obtained from the induced statements does not render, by that fact alone, the prosecution against him an abuse of process. Mr Calleija's counsel conceded as much. However, he relies upon an accumulation of factors relating to and flowing from the making of the induced statements to support his argument. In this regard, he raised five specific points. 

82First, there was not one but three induced statements given over a period of two and a half years. Secondly, Mr Calleija was the first person of those involved in the scheme to provide information to the authorities. Other persons in the scheme were charged using the material obtained from the induced statements. In that regard, of the 11 persons linked to the scheme, nine had been successfully prosecuted and two had been granted an indemnity from prosecution. Thirdly, as late as April 2009, Mr Calleija, on the assumption that he was to be a witness in the trial of Mr Agius, had provided a statement preparatory for use in that trial. Fourthly, in October 2009, when his reasonable expectation was that he would not be charged, he was informed that charges were to be brought against him. Finally, Mr Calleija's counsel also reiterated that the first summary of facts although abandoned, had nonetheless been used to structure the Crown case against Mr Calleija. 

83Mr Calleija's counsel submitted that these factors demonstrated this was a very unusual case. He submitted that the taking of an induced statement was not meant for a case like this, where a person had assisted the prosecution authorities in a way that had enabled them to mount other prosecutions.

84As is apparent from the summary of facts to be used at trial, the case against Mr Calleija is based upon documentation including Mr Calleija's personal and company tax returns, bank documentation of entities alleged to be involved in the scheme and other documentation which has come into the Crown's possession in the course of the investigation. In other words, it is a circumstantial case. The Crown does not and cannot rely upon any information or documentation that was obtained in the course of Mr Calleija giving the induced statements. 

85Mr Calleija's counsel next contended that the documentation upon which the Crown proposes to rely cannot speak for itself. Counsel reiterated that Mr Calleija had linked the various aspects of the case together for the police. Counsel contended it was as a result of that linkage that the prosecuting authorities were able to ""[prepare] a game plan"" for Mr Calleija's prosecution. It was submitted that without the understanding of the scheme that Mr Calleija had provided, the Crown would not be able to successfully prosecute him.

86Mr Calleija's counsel re-emphasised that the induced statements had allowed the Crown to look at the whole of the defence case, so it would know every aspect that Mr Calleija might raise in his defence. He submitted that the Crown was therefore in a far superior tactical position in the preparation of its case than Mr Calleija. Mr Calleija's counsel was not able to point to any specific disadvantage arising from the Crown being in possession of his induced statements, other than that the information was used to structure the prosecutions against the other participants and must have been used to structure the case against Mr Calleija.

87Mr Calleija's counsel submitted that prejudice of this type had been recognised as giving rise to unfairness: see R v M [2010] NSWDC 200. In that case, Berman DCJ stated, at [74], that one of the most obvious factors in determining whether an accused person was prejudiced or would otherwise suffer a detriment by having given an induced statement was whether the person gave the police information beyond that which they already knew. His Honour stated:

""In other words, the question of detriment or otherwise could only really be determined by comparing what the accused said in his induced statement with the other evidence the Crown had available against him.""

His Honour observed that in the case he was determining, neither the Crown nor the accused had provided him with material that would enable that comparison to be made. 

88The Court requested Mr Calleija's counsel to identify any information in the induced statements that was replicated in the summary of facts upon which the Crown proposes to rely at trial. Not only did counsel not do so for the benefit of this Court, he had not done so in the course of the application before Frearson DCJ. I infer that there was no such replication of material.

89Mr Calleija's counsel refocussed his submission to point out that as a result of information provided to them by Mr Calleija in the course of the first induced statement, the police were able to execute search warrants upon the accountant's premises. Mr Calleija had drawn a plan of the premises including of a shed in which documents were stored. In effect, Mr Calleija had directed the police to where the books could be found. However, Mr Calleija's counsel was not able to inform the Court whether Mr Calleija was the only client who knew where the books were kept. 

90Mr Calleija's counsel further submitted that when regard was had to the present summary of facts, which he accepted was a factual expose of the documents proposed to be used in Mr Calleija's trial, Mr Calleija had explained each of those documents ""chapter and verse"" in his induced statement, indicating that he had transferred the funds and how and why he had done so. The Court sought to test this submission by having Mr Calleija's counsel deal with a number of the asserted factual statements in the overview and summary of facts. This was done by reference to the following statement in the summary of facts: 

""Between 13 May 1997 and 26 October 2004, fifteen (15) outgoing payments totalling $2,349,298 were made from OBW's various bank accounts, mainly from the OBW account between May 1997 and June 2000, and then from the OBW Overdraft account between September 2000 and September 2002, to the NZ accounts of UNITON, BILLBURY and SECURITY LIFE. A total of $1,110,000 was transferred to the UNITON account, $475,000 to the BILLBURY account - and $753,493.72 to the SECURITY LIFE account. These were characterised in the books of OBW, most likely by [Owen T Daniel], as interest, management or consultancy fees, or subsumed in expenses of OBW when there had been no real expenditure ..."" (emphasis added)

91Mr Calleija's counsel eventually conceded that the characterisation, ""interest, management or consultancy fees"" were either statements derived directly from the books of account or, alternatively, inferred from entries in the books of account. Counsel submitted, however, that the derivative use for which he contended arose from the fact that prior to Mr Calleija's induced statements, the police were not making the necessary links in the documentation and thus had not been able to work out how the scheme operated. 

92Mr Calleija's counsel finally appeared to accept that the trial will be conducted by the Crown on the basis of the material that was known to it before Mr Calleija gave his first induced statement or which came into its possession during the course of the ongoing investigation, from sources other than Mr Calleija. He then reverted to his submission as to the unfairness of the Crown in prosecuting Mr Calleija when he had provided it with such valuable information in circumstances where he believed he would be granted an indemnity. 

93In my opinion, Mr Calleija has not made out ground 4. The Crown is confined in the evidence that can be adduced in the prosecution to material obtained other than from the induced statements. It will also be constrained in any cross-examination of Mr Calleija should he decide to give evidence. To the extent that the prosecuting authorities may seek to prepare for any defence Mr Calleija may advance, any prosecutor in a case like this would anticipate a number of possible defences. These would include an accused's contention that he did not sign the documentation that was integral to the operation of the scheme or that he relied upon the advice of his accountants, a defence which might be thought to be contestable in any event. Another possible and even more likely scenario is that an accused might rely upon putting the Crown to proof especially given that in this case, the relevant income tax returns were filed electronically. 

94These possible defences will each involve different considerations for the Crown. For my part, I cannot see that the Crown has any unfair advantage in having been provided with information in the induced statements. This is particularly so when Mr Calleija's counsel was not able to point to any material in the summary of facts that was derived from the induced statements. Nor do I consider that the Crown has been shown to have a tactical advantage in being able to anticipate any defence Mr Calleija may seek to raise. 

95I consider that ground 4 should be rejected. 

Ground 5: that oppression and hardship has been caused to Mr Calleija by the delay in bringing the prosecution

96Mr Calleija contended that in circumstances where he was charged three years after he went to the police, it was oppressive for the prosecution to proceed and it should be permanently stayed. I have already referred to the principles that apply when a permanent stay is sought based on delay: see at [32]-[36]. These principles were confirmed in more recent times by the High Court in R v Edwards & Anor [2009] HCA 20; 255 ALR 399. That case involved a delay of two years and three months before the complaints were laid. It was argued that that delay had occasioned prejudice in that the applicants had lost the opportunity to obtain the early recollection of witnesses. The High Court (Hayne, Heydon, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) held, at [34], that there was no feature of the delay that justified the extreme step of permanently staying the proceedings. The plurality also noted, at [34], that it had not been established that any prejudice arising by reason of the delay could not be addressed by an appropriate direction by the trial judge. 

97In my opinion, there is no substance in the complaint based on delay. 

98Mr Calleija's counsel next submitted that the police had made an implied representation to Mr Calleija that he would not be charged. Mr Calleija's counsel acknowledged that this submission was advanced notwithstanding the express statements to the contrary (the disclaimer) made to Mr Calleija at the commencement of each induced statements. However, counsel submitted that, for the Crown to rely upon the disclaimer was ""to fly in the face of what was really happening in the real world"": see R v Mohi [2000] SASC 384; 78 SASR 55. 

99In Mohi, the applicant sought a permanent stay of the prosecution brought against him in respect of the offence of ""Assist Offender"". The assistance allegedly provided was to two persons who had been charged with murder. A permanent stay of the prosecution was granted in circumstances where the interviewing police officer had said to the applicant, ""you are a witness, you are not going to get charged"". Further, prior to taking a statement from the applicant, the police officer told him that he was a witness and any statement he gave to the police would not be used in evidence against him. 

100In Mohi, the DPP had resisted the application for a permanent stay on the basis that the Director had not given these assurances and ought not to be bound by the conduct of the police, who it submitted, were not authorised to give any such assurances. 

101Martin J referred to R v Croydon Justices, Ex parte Dean [1993] QBD 769. In that case, the applicant was formally charged with an offence approximately five weeks after he had given a statement to the police in which he admitted the offence. Throughout that period, he had been treated by the police as a witness and had made three further statements in respect of which he was neither cautioned, nor offered legal advice, nor told that he was to be charged. The police had told the applicant he was to be used as a prosecution witness and he would not be prosecuted for offences associated with the murder. 

102Staughton LJ, with whom Buckley J agreed, stated, at 778, that:

""... the prosecution of a person who has received a promise, undertaking or representation from the police that he will not be prosecuted is capable of being an abuse of process."" 

His Lordship considered, at 779, that the representations made to the applicant over a five week period, during which he gave repeated assistance to the police, in circumstances where he was not given an appropriate warning or legal assistance, was quite exceptional and the Court was bound to treat it as an abuse of process. 

103The Court in R v Croydon Justices emphasised the statement made by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in Chu Piu-wing v Attorney-General [1984] HKLR 411 where the Court observed, at 417-418:

""... there is a clear public interest to be observed in holding officials of the State to promises made by them in full understanding of what is entailed by the bargain.""

104Martin J accepted there were some circumstances in which the DPP would not be bound by an unauthorised undertaking given by investigating police officers. His Honour also considered, at [44], that the mere fact a person was initially treated as a witness by investigating police officers and given assurances to that effect, but was later charged after evidence unfolded over the course of an investigation, would not, in ordinary circumstances, successfully ground a claim that the continuation of the prosecution was an abuse of process. 

105His Honour considered, however, that the combination of facts and circumstances in the case before him made it both unusual and exceptional. It is not necessary to refer to all the circumstances that his Honour considered relevant. It is sufficient for present purposes that the case was one where the applicant was expressly told he would not be charged and that any statement he gave to the police would not be used in evidence against him. It was only after he received those assurances that the applicant cooperated and provided a detailed statement. He was not cautioned before giving his statement. After having given his initial statement, the police officers reconsidered the status of the applicant and decided to continue to treat him as a witness. The argument advanced by the police, that they had not made a final decision as to whether to use him as a witness, was no answer to the exceptional unfairness in subsequently charging the applicant. 

106This case is strikingly different from Mohi. Here, Mr Calleija was expressly told that no guarantee could be given as to whether he would be charged. The statements made to him were clear, unambiguous and given prior to each occasion he made an induced statement. One can readily accept that Mr Calleija would have been disappointed when he learned that he was to be charged. Indeed, he may have been profoundly disappointed having regard to the assistance he had provided and the application made to the DPP by the investigating police that he be granted immunity. Profound disappointment does not, however, constitute a basis for establishing that there has been an abuse of process. The matters that have led to his disappointment and, in particular, his assistance to the police, would be a powerful consideration on sentence, should Mr Calleija be found guilty of the two offences upon which he is to be tried. Delay may also be relevant to sentence in this case. That will be a matter for the sentencing judge, should Mr Calleija fall to be sentenced. However, there was no promise, express or implied, made to Mr Calleija that he would not be charged and there are no other circumstances in the case that constitute an abuse of process.

107In my opinion, ground 5 should be rejected.

Ground 6: that the Commonwealth prosecution guidelines have not been fairly adhered to

108The Commonwealth has a published ""prosecution policy"" (the policy). The policy was first presented to Parliament in February 1986. It was revised in 1990 and further revised in 2008. The 2008 revised policy remains the prosecution policy of the Commonwealth. In his forward to the current policy, Mr McClelland, then Attorney-General of Australia, noted that it would continue to serve two main purposes: first, to promote consistency in the decision-making involved in the institution and conduct of prosecutions and secondly, to inform the public of the principles upon which the DPP performs its statutory functions. 

109In its statement of general principles, the policy states:

""The Policy is a public document based on the principles of fairness, openness, consistency, accountability and efficiency that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) seeks to apply in prosecuting offences against the laws of the Commonwealth.

The Policy does not attempt to cover all questions that may arise in the prosecution process and the role of the prosecutor in their determination. It is sufficient to state that throughout a prosecution the prosecutor must conduct himself or herself in a manner which will maintain, promote and defend the interests of justice. In the final analysis the prosecutor is not a servant of government or individuals - he or she is a servant of justice."" 

110Chapter 2 of the policy relates to the decision to prosecute. Under the heading, ""Criteria governing the decision to prosecute"", cl 2.10 specifies factors which may arise for consideration in determining whether the public interest requires the bringing of a prosecution. Counsel for Mr Calleija said that the factors the DPP may consider under cl 2.10 include that the person concerned had no criminal record; whether there had been an oppressive delay of time; and the degree of culpability of the alleged offender. It appears that these factors would fall under cls 2.10(d), (e), (f), which provide, respectively:

""(d)the alleged offender's antecedents and background;

(e)the passage of time since the alleged offence when taken into account with the circumstances of the alleged offence and when the offence was discovered; 

(f)the degree of culpability of the alleged offender in connection with the offence ..."" 

111Counsel for Mr Calleija conceded that these factors may not be enough to suggest that the DPP had not adhered to its own guidelines. However, he submitted that cl 2.10(r) puts this case into a different category. Clause 2.10(r) states:

""... whether the alleged offender is willing to co-operate in the investigation or prosecution of others, or the extent to which the alleged offender has done so ...""

112Counsel for Mr Calleija submitted that the evidence of Detective Superintendent Moerman, the history of the matter and the more important prosecutions of Mr Agius and the other accountants was such that it could not be said from a public point of view that the guideline had been truly followed. Counsel directed attention to cl 2.12, which refers to the existence of an enforcement mechanism as an alternative to prosecution. Mr Calleija's counsel submitted that the Commissioner of Taxation could have brought enforcement proceedings against Mr Calleija for the recovery of the tax evaded. However, that had been unnecessary, as Mr Calleija has paid his tax in full, together with all interest and penalties in a total amount of $2.4M and had sold his house in order to do so. 

113Counsel pointed out that Mr Calleija had taken this action notwithstanding that at the time he did so, he had not been charged with any offence, nor had any enforcement proceedings been taken against him by the Commissioner of Taxation. Mr Calleija's counsel submitted that in proceedings to prosecute him, the Crown was distancing itself from the fact that Mr Calleija had voluntarily offered assistance to the police. This submission concluded with the rhetorical question: ""With great respect, if that is not an 'affront to the public conscience', what is?"".

114I have already dealt with the notion of ""affront to the public conscience"" and do not need to say anything further on it. It must be borne in mind, that there are other factors which are relevant to the discretionary decision of the DPP to charge or not charge for alleged offences. Those other considerations include the seriousness of the alleged offence: cl 2.10(a); the effect on community harmony and public confidence in the administration of justice: cl 2.10(g); the need for deterrence; cl 2.10(k); whether the alleged offence is of considerable public concern: cl 2.10(m); the necessity of public confidence in the rule of law and the administration of justice through the institutions of democratic governance, including the Courts: cl 2.10(u); and the need to give effect to regulatory or punitive imperatives: cl 2.10(v). Clause 2.10 concludes with the statement: 

""The applicability of and weight to be given to these and other factors will depend on the particular circumstances of each case."" 

115Clause 2.11 is also of particular importance. It provides:

'As a matter of practical reality the proper decision in many cases will be to proceed with a prosecution if there is sufficient evidence available to justify a prosecution. Although there may be mitigating factors present in a particular case, often the proper decision will be to proceed with a prosecution and for those factors to be put to the Court at sentence in mitigation.""

Clause 2.11 also states that where an alleged offence is ""not so serious as plainly to require prosecution"", the prosecutor should consider whether the public interest requires prosecution to be pursued. 

116It could not be said that the offences with which Mr Calleija is charged and the systematic nature of the alleged fraud over a period of four and a half years and the substantial tax thereby avoided were ""not so serious"" such as not to call for prosecution. As cl 2.11 expressly states, there may be mitigating factors in a particular case, although falling within one of the sub-clauses in cl 2.10, where prosecution is still warranted, albeit that those same matters will be relevant on sentence. 

117In my opinion, there has been nothing advanced on behalf of Mr Calleija which shows that the decision to prosecute, having regard to the policy, was not clearly available to the DPP and not otherwise an abuse of process. In my opinion, ground 6 as discussed above should be rejected.

118Mr Calleija, as an additional submission under ground 6, contended that the Crown's ""procedural approach"" to the case had been one of ""non-adherence"". This term appears to make reference to timetabling and evidentiary considerations that Mr Calleija asserted the Crown had not complied with. Mr Calleija referred amongst other things to: the Crown's service of the indictment two weeks after the date identified by Blanch J's order; the withdrawal of the first overview and summary of evidence after stay papers had been served; service of 11 new statements; continual production of volumes of material from the trial of Mr Agius, which is currently being conducted in the Supreme Court; and service of the ""Initial briefing paper to Australian Federal Police re Vanuatu based scheme promoter dated 11 November 2005"" five days after Frearson DCJ's decision on 11 August 2011. 

119Mr Calleija submitted that the instances listed above have caused him unfairness and disadvantage in the form of additional expense and stress. The submission concluded with the statement that the Crown's conduct of the case constituted ""an abuse of the rights of any accused"" and brought ""the administration of justice into disrepute"". As previously stated, the authorities emphasise a balancing process when determining whether a permanent stay should be granted. Delay and unfairness to the accused person are not the only relevant factors when making this decision: see Walton v Gardiner; Petroulias v R. The instances identified by Mr Calleija are in a similar vein to his earlier submissions and do not raise anything new. In my opinion, Mr Calleija has failed to demonstrate, on the basis of this argument, that this was an exceptional case where a permanent stay ought to be granted. This aspect of ground 6 should also be rejected.

Ground 7: application to rely upon new material

120Mr Calleija seeks leave to introduce new material being a document from the Australian taxation office entitled ""Initial Briefing Paper to Australian Federal Police re Vanuatu Based Scheme Promoter"". The document was prepared by an accountant, James Walton, and is dated 11 November 2005. The document was served upon Mr Calleija's solicitors under cover of letter dated 16 August 2011.

121Mr Calleija's counsel submitted that the service of this document was typical of the modus operandi of the prosecution in this case, namely, the late service of material and, in this case, its service after the determination of the application for a permanent stay. It was submitted the importance of the material in this document was that it revealed that after the ATO had audited Mr Calleija's records, it had identified as early as November 2005, aspects of the Vanuatu scheme and the involvement of Mr Agius and the accountants in the office of Owen T Daniel.

122Counsel drew attention to the statement at page 13 of the document which stated: 

""Whilst [Owen T Daniel] is the Australian link between each of the participants, the evidence in regard to his involvement is limited.""

123Counsel submitted that it was apparent from the audit that Mr Calleija ""did not know too much about what was going on"". However, with the professional assistance of a new accountant and the tax barrister Mr Inglis, Mr Calleija made the first and then the subsequent induced statement. Counsel repeated the submissions as to the practical value of the information Mr Calleija provided. 

124Counsel said that what was ""extremely interesting about this document"" was that:

""... the paper trail does not speak for itself in that the missing links had to come from direct evidence which came from the induced statements ...""

125No particular part of the document is referred to in support of this submission. In any event, it overlooks the fact that this was an ongoing investigation that continued well after Mr Calleija provided his first induced statement.

126Counsel made the further submission that:

""What amounts to abuse of process on this aspect is that what has been derived from Mr Calleija's own induced statement has been used indirectly against him now.""

This issue has already been dealt with. 

127Counsel next submitted that ""[a]nother important aspect of this 'new paper' is that it shows the relatively inordinate delay in ultimately charging [Mr Calleija]"". It was submitted that the ""oppressive delay"" was ""even more obvious"". I have already dealt with the question of delay. Reference was also made to the intended use of Mr Calleija as a witness and to the application that he be granted an immunity from prosecution. Those issues have already been dealt with.

128The final submission made in respect of the application to rely upon this material was as follows: 

""124Surely after reading all the induced statements, not only of [Mr Calleija], but also of the other eleven persons, if they are believed, there is no doubt who the real culprits and masterminds of the tax evasion schemes were, the rogue accountants. 

125Yet, for reasons which seem to mystify even the Federal police investigators, the DPP would rather try to convict [Mr] Calleija, than use him to help convict the real criminals in this whole scenario.

126If such an approach does not bring the system of justice into disrepute, it is hard to imagine what would."" 

129This is a repetition of Mr Calleija's essential grievance in the case. For the reasons I have already given, this is not sufficient to establish that the case is of an exceptional nature such as to require the grant of a permanent stay. There was no error in the trial judge refusing the application.

130I would refuse leave to adduce this ""new material"". It does not demonstrate anything not already known in the course of making the application. It follows that ground 7 should also be refused.

131The orders I propose are:

1.Leave to appeal is granted;

2.The appeal is dismissed.

132R A HULME J: I agree with Beazley JA.

133GARLING J: I agree with Beazley JA.

		06 August 2013",2012-03-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758878,Police v Cameron Trevail [2012] NSWLC 1,"JUDGMENT
 
Remarks on Sentence
 
1The offender appears before the Court today to be sentenced in relation to an offence of stalking and intimidation with the intention of causing psychical or mental harm. The charge in relation to the offence is brought pursuant to section 13(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. The maximum penalty for an offence under these provisions is 5 years imprisonment or a fine of $5,500 or both. The offence falls within Table 2 under the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Section 268(2)(f) of that Act limits maximum penalty that may be imposed in the Local Court to 2 years imprisonment or a fine of $5,500 or both. Despite the jurisdictional limitation it is well settled law since R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115 that a Court, in assessing the objective seriousness of an offence, is to have regard to the maximum legislative penalty not the jurisdictional limit.

The Facts

2A detailed statement of facts is attached to the Court papers. For the purpose of these remarks I have summarised the salient features. I have omitted the name of the victim in order to preserve her privacy. Where necessary she is described as V.

3The offender and the victim [V] had been in a relationship that was on foot in December 2008 and diminished in intensity until finally ending in November 2010. The relationship included consensual participation in sexual intercourse.

4On one occasion during the relationship the offender orchestrated the making of a video of he and V engaging in sexual intercourse. He did this without forewarning V. During the sexual activity V noticed the offender's mobile phone had been placed on the bedside table with the video lens activated such that it could record the event. 

5V spoke to the offender about his conduct however it appears that intercourse continued until completion with the entirety of conduct being recorded. The facts describe the video as extremely graphic with both the face of V and the offender clearly visible along with the entirety of their respective bodies.

6At a later time, after the relationship had ceased the offender showed the victim the video. He reassured V that the video was only for him, as he wanted ""a nice memory of the two of them"". Whether this assertion was true at the time or not is problematic. Subsequently the offender continued to contact V both verbally and by text message. This was despite requests from the victim to cease.

7On 10 May 2011 the offender contacted V on her mobile phone. He told her that if she did not have sexual intercourse with him he would make a copy of the video he had taken and post it on the Internet. He proposed that he would come to the V's residence that very evening to claim the product of his intimidation. He further stated, ""If you don't see me I'll blackmail you and put that shit on the net. You understand me"". This conversation was recorded by V. 

8Upon receipt of the offender's call the V activated the loudspeaker function on her mobile phone. This enabled the offender's intimidatory remarks to be overheard by two other witnesses who were with her at the time. 

9V contacted Police. On 13 May 2011 Police executed a search warrant on the offender's residence. They seized his mobile phone, a USB device and other computer recording paraphernalia. The offender was arrested. He took part in an electronically recorded record of interview. He agreed he had made the video. He declined to answer questions about his constant requests for sex and threat to upload the video if the victim refused to give in to his demands.

10The offender was subsequently charged with a series of offences. Two of the initial charges were subsequently withdrawn following which a plea of guilty was entered to the charge now before the Court.

The Plea

11The offender was charged with this offence on 13 May 2011. Initially he entered a plea of not guilty to the charge and to the other charges preferred by Police. A brief of evidence was ordered. When the matter came before Waverley Local Court on 21 July 2011 it was given a hearing date of 10 October 2011 at the Downing Centre Local Court. 

12On the day fixed for a one day defended hearing of all three charges the prosecution withdrew two other serious charges. The offender then entered a plea of guilty to this charge. The objective seriousness of the charge and the conduct was such that the proceedings were adjourned to 25 November 2011 for sentence to enable the preparation of a Pre Sentence Report.

13Section 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the 'Sentencing Act') requires a court in passing sentence to take into account the fact that an offender has pleaded guilty. The court is further required to take into account when such plea was given or indicated and the circumstances in which the plea was indicated.

14The guideline judgment in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and the more recent decision of R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 articulate the approach to be taken by courts in determining the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty. Where there is a utilitarian value in the plea the Court is required to mitigate the otherwise appropriate penalty. The extent of the discount applied will depend on the circumstances. 

15In R v Borkowski the Court set out what are described as ""principles of general application"" in determining the utilitarian value of a plea. On this issue the Court notes it was open to the offender to enter a plea or indicate an intention to do so from the first time the matter came before the Court. It seems clear from the course the proceedings took that such plea was withheld until such time as the prosecution took the step of withdrawing the other two charges. The utilitarian value of a plea entered in such circumstances is dealt with at paragraphs 8 and 9 in Borkowski. The discount is correspondingly affected. I allow a discount in this matter for the utilitarian value of the plea of 17.5%. 

Subjective Factors

16The offender comes before the Court as a 25 year old man employed within the hospitality industry. He resides at Blacktown with his de facto partner and 4-month-old daughter. The Pre Sentence Report provided to the Court reveals his current partner is unaware of the charge before the Court. It further states, somewhat ironically given the nature of his conduct towards the victim, that the offender ""claimed he did not want to cause her unnecessary emotional distress."" 

17The report discloses a history of abuse of drugs and, prior to meeting his current partner, excessive use of alcohol. He disclosed to Probation and Parole a history of poly substance abuse since the age of 14 and revealed that whilst his alcohol consumption has been significantly reduced, he continues to use prohibited drugs from time to time. To his credit he does not claim that either alcohol or drugs contributed in any way to the commission of this offence.

18The attitude of the offender set out in the probation report acknowledges his conduct represents an abuse of power. He is equivocal on the issue of consent by V to the making of the video but concedes making threats to place the video on the Internet was wrong. 

19The Case Manager who prepared the report identified concerns about the offender's propensity to use his power over other individuals for his personal benefit although she hypothesised this incident may have at long last provided the offender with some insight as to the impact his actions have on others. 

Antecedents

20The historical allusion by the Case Worker relates to the offender's criminal record. He has 3 separate convictions recorded against him 2007. Two of the offences relate to contraventions of an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order. The offender was placed on a Section 9 Bond in relation to each offence. Each of these offences is separated in time in terms of the date of the offending. Additionally the defendant has a conviction for Damage to Property. A further penalty recorded on the offender's record is referable to a breach of one of the Section 9 Bonds imposed for the first of the contravention of an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order offences. 

21As a consequence of his criminal history the offender does not come before the Court as a person of prior good character. The effect of his background is not that it aggravates his conduct in the matter before, rather the impact is to significantly negate the mitigating factors available for first offenders as identified in section 21A(3)(e),(f),(g) and (h) of the Sentencing Act.

Aggravating factors

22It is clear from the statement of facts and from the Pre Sentence Report that the offender constructed the means of intimidating the victim to submit to his sexual advances because she was otherwise resistant to his ongoing demands. The corollary of this environment is in my view to persuade the Court to the view that the offence is aggravated by the planned nature of the criminal activity. Section 21A(2)(n) operates to aggravate the offending behaviour.

Mitigating Factors

23Apart from the plea of guilty it is difficult within the provisions of section 21A(3) to find any other mitigating factors other than a qualified sense of remorse as referred to in section 21A(3)(i) of the Sentencing Act. When I say qualified, I do so in the context that there is little in the offender's approach in this matter that finds favour other than the belated acknowledgment in the pre sentence report that ""he could now understand the victim's vulnerability and her concern at the time."" I am prepared to take this into account in further mitigating the penalty but not to a substantial degree.

The Sentence

24Counsel for the offender submitted that the offender's conduct is at the bottom of the range of objective seriousness for this type of offence. In the discourse between the bench and the bar table counsel seemed surprised that the Court took a very different view. In such circumstances it is necessary to expand on the reasons why the Court takes the view that this offence is towards the upper end of a middle range category of offence.

25Every member of the community, irrespective of his or her prior relationships with other members of society, is entitled to their privacy. Whatever may have been the belated silent acquiescence on the part of the victim to the offender's unilateral and furtive undertaking in videotaping their sexual activities there was no consent to publication of this article to a wider audience. The action taken by V in contacting police establishes this reality.

26It is one thing for the offender to say he had no real intention of publishing the videotape on the Internet. Who would know whether, had it not been for the actions of the victim in summoning the assistance of Police, it might not have occurred? The offender's criminal history suggests he is not always careful to conform to the reasonable expectations of society. It is clear from his conduct he is not a person committed to respecting women or their privacy. 

27To use this type of intimidation to constrain the victim into giving in to his demands for sex is the type of conduct all reasonable members of the community would regard as outrageous. The offender should not lose sight of the fact that had the victim been intimidated into giving in to his demand only to complain to police later then it would be open for him to have been charged with sexual intercourse without consent. At the completion of these proceedings the offender at the very least should be given some advice regarding the applicability of section 61HA of the Crimes Act 1900 to a potential prosecution under section 61 l of that Act. Whilst this speculative exercise is not relevant to the determination of the ultimate sentence it is the proper function of a Court to educate those before it as to the potential consequences of their behaviour so that they may re-think their attitude in the future. 

28The protective nature of the criminal jurisdiction should not always be confined to the instant of the sentencing exercise.

29It is beyond dispute that whether or not the defendant intended to publish he effectively brought about that reality albeit within a limited range. In seeking the assistance of the police the victim would be well aware that as part of the investigative role of the police it was highly likely that one or more strangers would need to view the video to determine the nature and extent of the offending behaviour. This in itself is a form of humiliation forced on the victim at the instigation of the defendant's intimidating conduct.

30In addition it does not need a great deal of imagination or life experience to understand the potential humiliation and emotional distress the victim would undergo in the period between the threat fixed in time to accommodate his demand for sex by 11pm that night and the seizure of the videotape and other material by police some 2 days later. There is no evidence before me to establish that the emotional harm to the victim was substantial however it cannot be said that it was non-existent. So concerned was she for her privacy and self respect that she sought the intervention of police. To argue in this context that the conduct of the offender places the offending behaviour at the lower end of the range is to misconstrue the reality of his conduct. I reject the submission by counsel on this point.

31The type of conduct undertaken by the offender warrants emphasis on general and particular deterrence - general deterrence by reason of an increasing incidence in the use of the Internet to embarrass or humiliate and the potential audience that such conduct may reach. It is not to the point that the offender did not upload the material.

32It is to the point that he was aware of the potential and used that mechanism as a means of intimidation with a view to securing a level of sexual self indulgence from someone he knew would not willingly provide it without the threat of publication. That he should believe this type of behaviour is neither here nor there is extraordinary. This type of conduct whether it is by the offender or by others within the community with like-minded tendencies should be discouraged and discouraged with firmness.

33Having come to the view regarding the subjective seriousness of the offender's conduct and taking into account the aggravating and mitigating factors the next step in the sentencing exercise is to determine whether the threshold in section 5 of the Sentencing Act has been crossed. Section 5 cautions Courts against imposing sentences of imprisonment unless there is no other appropriate sentence that adequately addresses the purposes of sentencing and the objective seriousness of the offending. In my view in this matter there is no other appropriate alternative.

34The offender has shown scant regard for orders of courts in the past. He has failed to live up to expectations under two Section 9 Bonds imposed because he could not comply with the terms of an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order. This Court can have only a small degree of confidence that he will not re-offend. The time has come for the offender to realise that his ongoing disrespect for the law and the escalating nature of his offending needs to be brought to an end. It is my view this should be done by withdrawing the offender's privilege of remaining free within society in the form of a sentence of imprisonment.

35Having determined the appropriate sentence is one of imprisonment it remains for the Court to decide the manner in which such sentence should be served. Because of the need to strongly emphasise general and particular deterrence I do not accept that any sentence imposed on the offender should be suspended pursuant to section 12 of the Sentencing Act. 

36The authority of R v Taylor [2000] NSWCCA 442 at [49] to the effect that ""suspended sentences provide very little if anything by way of general deterrence"" underscores this approach. Additionally the failure on the part of the offender in the past to keep the terms of a previous bond does not inspire confidence. This conclusion does not necessarily mean other forms of custody are not available.

37Because, and only because the offender failed to carry out his threat to publish the Court is prepared to consider an alternative to full time custody at this time. Considering such an option does not mean it will become the ultimate outcome. The Court retains the discretion to impose a sentence of full time custody. The nature of the offence is such the offender is excluded from consideration for Home Detention.

38The alternate response, one consistent with denunciation, general deterrence and engaging the offender in rehabilitation in relation to his attitude problem and continuing drug-taking activities is to consider an Intensive Corrections Order. If the offender is assessed as unsuitable then the alternative may well be full time custody. As someone who has yet to experience that environment I come to the view it is appropriate the offender be considered for such an alternative.

39These proceedings will be adjourned to enable an assessment to be undertaken. The offender is to provide his personal details and his telephone numbers to the registry before leaving the Court building. The proceedings are adjourned until 3 February 2012 at 9.30am part heard before me. Bail is to continue in its current terms.

Further Remarks on Sentence - 23 March 2012

40Sentencing of the offender is before the Court today following an earlier order that the offender be assessed as to his suitability to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment to be served by way of an Intensive Corrections Order. Having already determined the nature of the offending warranted condign punishment, the Court, as indicated in earlier remarks, formed the view there were issues within the offender's previous history of offending and personal circumstances that warrant an outcome consistent with emphasising rehabilitation in addition to general deterrence. It is the view of the Court that the offender's previous history of abuse of alcohol and prohibited drugs is a significant contributor to his anti social mindset and unwillingness to learn from previous sentences with inbuilt leniency and expectation for reform built into them.

41During the period of remand the offender has been assessed as suitable for an Intensive Corrections Order. Mindful of the views expressed by the Court in R v Boughen, R v Cameron [2012] NSWCCA 17 at [108]-[111] the Court is prepared to exercise its discretion to impose the pre-determined necessity for a prison sentence in this fashion. 

42Having regard to my remarks on the previous occasion the appropriate sentence for this offence is a sentence of 9 months imprisonment. Allowing for a discount of 17.5% for the utilitarian value of the late plea the offender is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for 7 months and 12 days. Such sentence is to be served by way of an Intensive Corrections Order. Within the period of Intensive Correction the offender is to be subject to involvement in Drug and Alcohol rehabilitation programmes. 

43The sentence is to commence within 21 days.

2758884,R v BEAUMONT [2012] NSWDC 24,"Judgment

1On Monday 19 March 2012 I granted an application by the accused Kevin Nigel Beaumont that he be tried by judge alone. I then commenced to hear the trial. Mr Beaumont pleaded not guilty to a charge that on 23 December 2010 he assaulted LB and at the time of the assault committed an act of indecency upon her, she then being under the age of 16 namely 10 years of age. 

2There was, as is usually the case, no issue that if the accused had done what he is alleged to have done then he would be guilty of the offence. So the question is ultimately whether the Crown has satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that he did what LB said that he did. 

3The complainant's evidence in chief was primarily given by a video taped interview she had with police being played to the Court. Her cross examination then took place with the complainant appearing on closed circuit television. Adducing evidence from a child through those means is standard procedure. I did not draw any adverse conclusion against the accused because the evidence was given in that way, nor did I give the evidence any greater or lesser weight because it was not given in the way evidence of an adult would usually be given. 

4I have decided this case only on the evidence put before me. In particular I have put to one side such things as emotion. Acting as a judge requires that I approach this matter from a coldly analytical point of view. 

5In this case the two most important people in resolving the matter have both given evidence. I was able to assess the complainant's demeanour as she gave evidence and also the accused's demeanour as well, he also giving evidence despite there being no obligation upon him to do so. 

6Although I had the benefit of seeing the witnesses give their evidence I fully appreciate that in many cases it is extraordinarily difficult to assess whether a witness is telling the truth or not from the way the person behaves in the witness box. In this case the complainant impressed me as a child who responded to questions put to her, particularly in cross examination, confidently and accurately. At a very broad level, the accused did not impress me in the same way. At least part of that impression results from some confusion in the way I framed a particular question, but at a more fundamental level a poor impression in the witness box often says very little about whether the witness is doing his or her best to tell the truth or not.

7I have of course borne in mind at all times that the onus of proving the guilt of the accused is upon the Crown, and further that a high standard of proof is required in a criminal trial - namely proof beyond reasonable doubt. The accused does not have to prove that he is innocent. The accused does not have to prove that he is not guilty. The accused is presumed to be innocent until the Crown satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty, if the Crown is capable of doing that. 

8One matter which flows from the high standard of proof which is placed upon the Crown concerns the circumstance that the Crown case relies almost exclusively on the evidence of a single witness namely the complainant. Accordingly I have scrutinised her evidence with great care. Before I could convict the accused I must exercise caution because the Crown case depends on me accepting the reliability of the evidence of a single witness namely the complainant. 

9Of course that does not mean that I am not entitled to convict the accused based on the evidence of the complainant alone. What it does mean is that I should exercise caution and scrutinise the evidence of the complainant carefully in deciding whether it satisfies me of the truth and accuracy of what she said. 

10It is notorious that offences such as this one are usually committed in private and so it is commonly the case that the Crown is forced to rely on the evidence of a single witness. But the standard of proof, proof beyond reasonable doubt, is not watered down because offences such as these usually occur in circumstances where no one is present to corroborate the complainant's version. 

11The accused is now 63 years of age. He raised his character as an issue in the trial. He has no prior convictions for any criminal matter at all. This makes it less likely that he would have committed this offence and more likely that he was telling the truth when he denied committing the offence in the course of his evidence.

12The complainant's mother Ms AB met the accused through an internet dating site. They formed a relationship which involved them occasionally staying overnight at the other's home. The complainant lived in a town house with her mother. Her father did not live in Australia. She had regular telephone contact with him as well as video calls using skype. Her father, LE and his brother came to visit Australia in December 2010. They stayed in the town house. On the 23rd of December 2010 the accused also came to the town house to do some work for the complainant's mother. The accused is a builder and he was doing some plumbing work. 

13There is a swimming pool attached to the complex in which the town house is situated and the complainant spent some part of that day swimming in the pool with a friend of hers. 

14At one stage during the course of the afternoon the complainant's father and uncle went to the Macquarie Shopping Centre, about 15 minutes walk away. That left the complainant, her mother, and the accused behind in the town house. The complainant's mother had a job as a carer for elderly people and she needed to be at work at 6.00 pm. She was hoping that the complainant's father and his brother would return from the shopping centre in time to look after the complainant while she was at work. However, as the time approached where she had to leave to go to work, and after she was unable to arrange alternative care for her daughter at short notice, it was agreed between the accused and the complainant's mother that he would look after the complainant until her father and uncle returned from the shops. The complainant's mother then left. 

15What I have described so far is common ground. However what happened next has been the subject of significant dispute in the trial. As I mentioned earlier the two most important people, namely the two who remained in the town house, both gave evidence. 

16The complainant gave evidence that the accused began pestering her to allow him to give her a massage. She said that although she declined at first she eventually gave in. She therefore lay down on the lounge room floor, still wearing her swimming costume. The accused began massaging her until at one stage he put his hand under her swimming costume and rubbed her external genitalia for a few seconds. Her evidence was that he told her not to say anything to anyone about this and that he did not believe that what he was doing was wrong. She said that he stopped what he was doing because her father was coming home from the shops.

17The accused agreed that he did massage the complainant but insists that he only touched her on her shoulders and upper back. He agrees that when he first asked her if he she wanted a massage she said ""no"" but some time later when he repeated his offer, his evidence was that she agreed. He denied specifically ever placing his hand under her swimming costume. 

18The complainant's father gave evidence that he returned from the shops at about 7.30 pm. He did not suggest that there was anything unusual about his daughter when he saw her. The accused and Mr LE agreed that the accused left soon after putting his tools in his car. The complainant did not say anything to her father about the accused touching her genitals. It was not until some time after the complainant's mother came home from work that evening that the complainant alleged to her that the accused had touched her under her swimming costume rubbing his hand over her external genitals. 

19The accused suggests that the failure of the complainant to tell her father what she later told her mother is evidence which I should take into account in assessing the reliability of the complainant's evidence. The argument is that if in truth the complainant had just been molested by her mother's friend then she would not have failed to immediately tell her father about this when he arrived home. On the other hand there may be good reasons why a young girl in the position of the complainant, whose father lived overseas and who clearly had a closer relationship with her mother, might prefer to wait the short time until her mother returned home before making a complaint. The complainant was asked about this in evidence. She explained that she was ""too nervous"" to tell her father. 

20This is not a case where the distance between Australia and Canada, where the complainant's father usually lived, meant that the two of them had little to do with each other. Both the complainant's parents seemed to have made highly commendable efforts to ensure that the complainant had a good relationship with her father. There was regular contact between them, including, video calls through skype, and they had been together physically on other occasions when Mr LE came to Australia and they went to Canada. Despite this closeness I can well understand why the complainant might pause before speaking to her father about what she said had happened to her in circumstances where she is clearly closer to her mother than her father, where she is speaking about highly personal sexual matters, and where she knows that her mother will soon be home giving her the opportunity to complain at that time. 

21After being told by her daughter about what she said had occurred, the complainant's mother spoke to Mr LE and then made a number of phone calls. She contacted a help line, Eastwood police, and the accused himself. Part of the difficulty in knowing what conclusions to draw from things said by the accused during that conversation arise from the circumstance that the call was not recorded, no notes were taken, and, at least to some extent, Ms AB spoke euphemistically. According to her she said that her daughter had complained that the accused had touched her between her legs. In circumstances where the accused had undoubtedly touched the complainant during the course of the massage the use of this euphemism could have led to confusion. Ms AB no doubt knew what she meant by the expression but there is no guarantee that a person hearing the expression used would automatically assume that what Ms AB meant was that her daughter had been touched on her genitals. 

22As it turns out the use of the euphemism did not appear to cause any significant confusion. The accused undoubtedly knew that what was being suggested was that he had done something highly improper. This is obvious from the way he said he reacted to the allegation. And in any case he gave evidence that he did not massage the complainant's legs at all saying that he merely stroked her shoulders and upper back. 

23There is a conflict in the evidence as to whether the accused told Ms AB that he had massaged her daughter. Ms AB said he did but the accused said he didn't. Whether he did or not say that to Ms AB is probably not all that important. And any difference of recollection may be due to the circumstances that I referred to earlier.

24I turn now to something which was said to provide a possible motivation for the complainant to make a false allegation against Mr Beaumont. The complainant agreed in cross examination that she did not like Mr Beaumont. Nor did she like his 13 year old son. Not surprisingly, she would have preferred both her parents to live together with her in the town house. She had complained to her mother about Mr Beaumont and told her mother that she didn't like him. She was asked ""but you would be very happy if you could get him out of your house, is that right?"" and she answered ""I would just prefer it"".

25Counsel for the accused pointed out that this allegation arose at a time when the father was in fact in Australia and so the complainant may have seen this as an opportunity for her parents to recommence co-habitation. Of course this does provide a motivation for the complainant to make a false allegation. That of course is not to say that her allegation is false, or that she was in fact motivated in the way the accused suggests, but it is to recognise that this is not a case where the accused cannot suggest any reason that the complainant might make a false allegation against him. 

26Of course there are two sides to every story. The Crown relies on the circumstance that the complainant freely admitted her dislike of the accused and a preference that her parents live together in cross examination. The Crown suggests this demonstrates the complainant's honesty.

27Even if I were to reject the motive raised by the accused that does not mean that there is no motive for the complainant to tell a lie. As I have explained repeatedly the onus of proving the guilt of the accused is placed firmly on the Crown. Absence of evidence of a motive to lie is not evidence that there is no motive to lie. After all the accused can't be expected to see into the mind of the complainant and discover whatever motive there may be for her to tell a false story. 

28While, as I said earlier, I appreciate the difficulty in assessing truthfulness from demeanour, there was nothing in the way the complainant gave her evidence, either during the interview with the police, or cross examination, which suggested she was being other than truthful. In particular she did not appear to be embellishing matters. For example she is clearly a very intelligent young girl and had she wanted to she could have easily made more serious allegations than she did. She did not say for example that the accused removed her clothing or any of his clothing. She complained of only a very brief period of touching on her genitals and denied penetration. Had she wanted to, she could have made things much worse for the accused. 

29She was appropriately embarrassed about naming her private parts and in describing intimate matters and did not appear to be a person who was enjoying the experience of being interviewed by police. In other words she did not appear to be deliberately trying to get the accused into trouble. 

30There were certain aspects of what she said too which had the ring of truth about them. Her evidence that he had said to her that she should not tell anybody might perhaps be the product of a clever young girl's desire to make her account more believable, but her evidence that the accused said to her that he thought what he had done was not the wrong thing to do shows a level of sophistication of thought suggesting the truth of the complainant's version of events. 

31There were some differences in the evidence given by the complainant and her mother but, interestingly, where there was a disagreement the complainant's evidence matched that of the accused rather than of her mother. For example whilst the complainant and the accused agreed that the accused had stayed overnight with the complainant present in the house, the complainant's mother said that when the accused stayed overnight the complainant invariably stayed at her grandmother's. The accused even said that on three occasions the complainant came in to the main bedroom whilst he was in bed with the complainant's mother. (It would have been perhaps helpful if that suggestion had been made to the complainant's mother in cross examination, but what she would have said in response to such a suggestion is simply unknown.) Not much really turns on the differences in evidence given by the complainant and her mother. The complainant's mother's credibility was not really in question and, whether or not the complainant was present when the accused stayed the night, she seems to have been well aware that the accused represented more to the complainant's mother than simply being the home handyman. 

32It was part of the Crown case that it was possible to see out from the lounge room where the offence allegedly took place because the vertical blinds were open. This, said the Crown, meant that the accused was able to keep watch for the return of the complainant's father in order that he would not be caught red handed. The town house fronts onto XXX at Marsfield and it is possible to see parts of the street from inside the lounge room. However the fact that someone can see out also means of course that someone can see in. Whilst the presence of low shrubs would perhaps prevent a casual passer by from seeing activity on the lounge room floor, Dr Glennon points out that as far as the accused would be aware there might be someone other than a casual passer by coming to the home, perhaps a neighbour, and perhaps even the young child with whom the complainant had been swimming earlier that day. The competing arguments are balanced and I do not find the view into and out of the lounge room to be of much help in resolving this case.

33I do accept that the accused did not know when the complainant's father would be returning from the shops and so there was a risk, perhaps a small one, of being caught in the act. But there was a larger risk that the complainant's father and uncle would return home immediately after he had indecently assaulted the complainant and they would walk in on a distressed child making an allegation of improper conduct. On the Crown case the accused minimised the chance of that happening by telling the complainant not to tell anyone but there is no way the accused could have been confident that the complainant would obey that instruction. And in any case there is little he could do to prevent the child from appearing distressed. The complainant's father saw no signs of distress when he arrived a few minutes after the complainant said she had been indecently assaulted.

34Not only did the accused know that the complainant's father and uncle were due home at any time he also knew that the complainant had not been backwards about coming forward to complain to her mother about other things involving him and his son. The evidence was that the complainant had told her mother about things she did not like about the accused and his son and so the accused could not at all have been confident that simply saying to the complainant that she should not tell anyone would lead to her remaining silent. 

35So if the accused did what he is alleged to have done, he did it in a way which created significant risks of detection. Dr Glennon uses this as part of a submission that the accused did not do what he is alleged to have done because to have done so would have been foolish. I recognise immediately that it is only the foolish or unlucky criminals that actually get caught, but it is significant that on the Crown case the accused would have chosen to molest the complainant when the risks of detection were increased but there is no suggestion that he acted improperly towards the complainant at any time when he was minding the complainant alone, something which although denied by the complainant's mother, the complainant and the accused both agree had previously occurred. 

36I mentioned before that there are inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainant's mother and the complainant. There is another inconsistency of perhaps more significance. It is clear that the complainant told her mother, and police, and gave evidence in court, that the accused's hand went under her swimming costume such that his hand directly touched the complainant's external genitals. However the evidence of the complainant's father LE is that the complainant told him something different. His evidence was that on the evening of the 23rd of December the complainant told him that the accused touched her ""private"" and when he asked her to show what he did she put her hand on the top of her vagina. Mr LE then asked the complainant ""did he put his hand in your pants"" to which the complainant replied ""no"". If we discount the possibility that the complainant responded that way because she took the question literally and her evidence was that the accused put his hand under her swimming costume not her pants, then either the complainant's father has misremembered what he was told by his daughter about a serious matter or the complainant has given an inconsistent version of events. 

37Of course I cannot say with certainty why it is that the complainant's father's evidence was that the complainant told him that the accused's hand did not go under her pants, but it is clearly a factor which tends against the acceptance of the Crown case. 

38One of the matters put strongly by the Crown concerns the circumstance that the accused wanted to massage a ten year old girl when he was home alone with her and would ask again after having been initially rebuffed. Why would a grown man be so keen to massage a ten year old girl that he would ask again (his version) or again and again (the complainant's version) especially in circumstances where the evidence would suggest that he was not terribly close to her and did not think much of her behaviour? 

39No doubt it was at least unwise for the accused to massage her, and that he would ask her again after having been rebuffed on the first occasion does tend to suggest a desire for physical contact between him and the complainant. On the other hand what to the eyes of a criminal lawyer is highly suspicious behaviour can be in truth simply someone being affectionate to another. And the evidence of the accused was that whilst there had been some difficult occasions with the complainant, there were other times when her behaviour was quite different. He described it this way 

""it was almost dichotomous in a way because some days she would absolutely love you to death and the next day she would just totally ignore you and be quite hateful"". 

40In circumstances where the accused appears not to have been aware of any cooling in the relationship between him and the complainant's mother, it is not at all surprising that he would try to be affectionate towards the complainant, and that such affection might on occasion take the form of innocent physical contact such at massaging her shoulders and upper back. 

41I mentioned the accused's good character before, but it is worth expanding on that. The accused is not some 18 year old with no priors. In such a situation a fact finder could be forgiven for simply thinking the absence of criminal history says little about the underlying character of that person. The accused is 63 years of age and not once in that time has been convicted of any criminal offence let alone an offence involving an allegation of sexual assault of a child. That does say something about the chances that he would have done what the Crown alleges that he did in this case. Of course people without previous criminal convictions are not incapable of committing an offence for the first time, nor are people without criminal convictions incapable of lying in court, but in the circumstances of this case, particularly as regards the accused's age, his good character works very much in his favour.

42In this case there was nothing to suggest that the complainant was not telling the truth. As I have mentioned she, as far as I could determine, gave answers in what appeared to be a straightforward and honest manner. Indeed the evidence on which the accused sought to establish her motive for lying came from the complainant herself. She did not appear to exaggerate, embellish, or make things up. The one area where she said something inconsistent in evidence (using the word hands rather than hand) was likely a mere slip of the tongue. I do not find it at all surprising that she would not complain to her father but prefer to wait until her mother got home before making the allegation against the accused. 

43On the other hand similar things could be said about the evidence of the accused. An inconsistency in his evidence relied on by the Crown was probably also a mere slip of the tongue and evidence on which the Crown relied, in particular concerning the circumstance that he asked the complainant whether she wanted a massage on more than one occasion, was confirmed by the accused despite it being capable of being used against him.

44I have, as I am required to do, examined the evidence of the complainant with great care and there is nothing in that evidence to lead me to think that she is lying. On the other hand that is not the right test for me to apply. I have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty, and to put that matter another way, if there is a reasonable possibility that the accused's evidence is true then it is my duty to find him not guilty. 

45I repeat something I said earlier. The burden of proof in child sexual assault cases is not watered down simply because these offences occur in private and the Crown thus has difficulty proving them. The fact that the Crown in this case can rely only on the evidence of a single witness is a significant impediment to the Crown proving its case to the required standard. 

46The complainant did have a motive to make this allegation. It was her desire to get the accused out of her mother's life and for her mother and father to live together. Again it is significant that this allegation arose when the complainant's father was actually staying in the town house. 

47I cannot exclude the reasonable possibility that the accused's evidence is true, whether or not the complainant was motivated by a desire to see her parents back together. The accused is not guilty.

		26 March 2012",2012-03-22 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758891,Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales v Christopher Ronald Fitzsimons [2012] NSWSC 260,"Judgment
Introduction
1Mr Fitzsimons was an articled clerk from 1964 to 1969 and admitted to practice on 5 December 1969 when he was 24 years of age.  He was an employed solicitor until 30 June 1971, when he commenced practice in his own account in Chatswood and remained there as a sole practitioner until early 2002 when he merged his practice with another practice in Chatswood, forming a partnership.  That lasted six months and he resumed practice on his own account.   On 21 December 2005 his practising certificate was suspended and cancelled on 13 December 2007.  
2The Prothonotary of the Supreme Court applied in the Court of Appeal by summons for declarations that Mr Fitzsimons is guilty of professional misconduct, is not a person of good fame and character and is not a fit and proper person to remain on the local roll of lawyers of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.  The following particulars were provided - 
(a)Between 25 June 2001 and 27 February 2006 the Respondent engaged in conduct of a dishonest nature for which he was convicted on 17 December 2009 at the Sydney District Court of eight (8) counts of fraudulent misappropriation of money contrary to s178A of the Crimes Act 1900, and three (3) counts of use false instrument with intent contrary to s300(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.
(b)The Respondent misled the Legal Services Commissioner in a letter to him dated 25 January 2006 when, in response to a complaint, he stated that he had paid all moneys to Mrs Roberts.
Consequently, an order is sought that Mr Fitzsimons' name be removed from the local roll of lawyers of the Court.  The first particular is not disputed, but issue is taken with the second.
3Jurisdiction to exercise of the disciplinary powers of the Court with respect to legal practitioners is assigned by Rule 65A of the Supreme Court Rules to the Court of Appeal.  Section 51 (4) of the Supreme Court Act 1970 provides that any proceedings pending before the Court of Appeal may ""be remitted to a Division for the determination by trial or otherwise of the proceedings or any question arising in the proceedings"".  
4When the matter came on before the Court of Appeal, Mr Fitzsimons' solicitor indicated that the application was opposed, essentially on the ground that the solicitor is now a fit and proper person because the matters giving rise to the application resulted from a psychiatric condition which is now controlled.  The Court of Appeal stood the matter over to a directions hearing before Young JA.  His Honour ordered that, in view of the necessity to call evidence and determine the extent, if any, to which the defendant's health problems contributed to the matters complained of, the summons should be referred to a single judge of the Common Law Division for decision.  The matter was then listed before me.  Young JA confirmed that it was intended that the judge determine all matters arising under the summons.  This would have the advantage that each party would be able to appeal if it was felt appropriate to do so.
5At the commencement of the hearing, I brought this matter to the attention of counsel.  After some discussion, I decided, with the consent of the parties, that I should proceed on the basis of the direction of Young JA, as clarified by his Honour.   
Legislative provisions
6For the purposes of the Legal Profession Act 2004 (""the Act""), the expression s 496 provides ""unsatisfactory professional conduct"" - 
Includes conduct of an Australian legal practitioner occurring in connection with the practice of law that falls short of the standard of competence and diligence that a member of the public is entitled to expect of a reasonably competent legal practitioner. 
7Section 497 defines the expression ""professional misconduct"" as follows - (1)  For the purposes of this Act ""professional misconduct"" includes: (a) unsatisfactory professional conduct of an Australian legal practitioner where the conduct involves a substantial or consistent failure to reach or maintain a reasonable standard of competence and diligence, and 
(b) conduct of an Australian legal practitioner whether occurring in connection with the practice of law or occurring otherwise than in connection with the practice of law, if established, justify a finding that the practitioner is not a fit and proper person to engage in legal practice. 
(2)  For a finding that an Australian legal practitioner is not a fit and proper person to engage in legal practice as mentioned in subsection (1), regard may be had to the matters that would be considered under section 25 [suitability for admission] or 42 [suitability to hold local practising certificate] if the practitioner were an applicant for admission to the legal profession under this Act or for the grant or renewal of a local practising certificate and any other relevant matters.
8The ""suitability matters"" referred to in subsection (2) are outlined in section 9(1) of the Act.  Relevant to this application are the following:
(a)whether the person is currently of good fame and character,
...
(c)whether the person has been convicted of an offence in Australia or a foreign country, and if so:
(i)    the nature of the offence, and
(ii)   how long ago the offence was committed, and 
(iii)  the person's age when the offence was committed.
Fitness and character 
9There was no controversy about the meaning of the expressions ""fit and proper person"" and ""good fame and character"".  Neither is defined in the Act, which is scarcely surprising since they encompass notions of fact and degree which cannot be precisely described.  Plainly enough, both refer to the moral character of the lawyer and not physical or mental capacity.  It is, of course, true that reputation or fame is not the same as character or fitness but, as it seems to me, the question of reputation must be that which is fairly ascribed by reasonable persons having knowledge of the facts.  It is also clear enough that the offences to which s 9(1)(c) refer must be those reflecting on the character of the legal practitioner either because of the facts giving rise to the offence or, it may be, simply the deliberate breach of the law.  The significance of the offence or offences must be determined by reference to the particular circumstances of each case.  
10In McBride v Walton [1994] NSWCA 199 Powell JA stated the following (at 61-62) in a passage that, though directed to doctors, has been repeatedly cited in connexion with lawyers - 
""To determine whether a finding of proven misconduct should be followed by a consequential finding that the practitioner is not of good character in the context of fitness to practise medicine, one must consider - 
(a) whether the misconduct can be satisfactorily explained as an error of judgment rather than a defect of character;
(b) the intrinsic seriousness of the misconduct qua fitness to practise medicine;
(c) whether the misconduct should be viewed as an isolated episode and hence atypical or uncharacteristic of the practitioner's normal qualities of character;
(d) the motivation which may have given rise to the proven episode of misconduct;
(e) the underlying qualities of character shown by previous and other conduct; and
(f) whether the practitioner's conduct post the proven episode of misconduct demonstrates that public and professional confidence may be reposed in him to uphold and observe the high standards of moral rectitude required of a medical practitioner.""
With respect, this is a helpful guide to the appropriate approach for considering whether a legal practitioner has been guilty of professional misconduct within the meaning of the Act.  
The offences
11On 17 December 2009 Mr Fitzsimons was sentenced in respect of the conduct set out in the particulars.  For the purpose of the sentencing proceedings in the District Court an agreed statement of facts was tendered.  It was in the following terms - 
On 21 December 2005 the Supreme Court of New South Wales appointed a Receiver, Jean Sayer, to the law practice known as C.R. Fitzsimons, the principal of which was the accused Christopher Ronald Fitzsimons.  On the same day his practising certificate was suspended.  An audit conducted of the limited files and records available to the Receiver and further investigation revealed:
Offence No.11
Sarah Gee Keg nee O'Neill died on 1 October 2000 at the age of 36, intestate.  Her husband Rodney instructed his father's solicitor, the accused, to apply for Probate.  Being distraught he was unaware of the exact assets of the Estate.  
On 10 April 2001 $50,756.86, being State Super benefits, was received into the trust account of Fitzsimons on behalf of Rodney Keg from the Estate.  After expenses the remainder of the funds were forwarded to Mr Keg on 30 April 2001 with a letter indicating that the administration of the Estate was virtually finished and enclosing a statement of account.  Another payment of $2,228.91, from First State Super, was received by the accused and forwarded to Mr Keg on 6 June 2001.  Mr Keg believed the Estate had been finalised and did not have any further dealings with the accused. 
On 25 June 2001 $50,625.00 was deposited into the Trust account of the accused, being death benefits from First State Super for Sarah Keg.  Mr Keg was not informed this money had been received.  On 18 February 2002 a cheque was drawn on the Trust account and a bank cheque issued which was deposited into a Cash Management Trust account of Fitzsimons.  The Trust Ledger was finalised ""Payment to clients A/C"".  
On 4 March 2002 the balance of this account was withdrawn and the account closed.  $51,412.67 was then used as the opening deposit for an account at Martin Place in name of Christopher and his wife Maria Fitzsimons. $50,000.00 was then transferred to a Commonwealth Marginal Lending Account on 21 March 2002.  Mr Keg was informed by Jean Sayer of the existence of the money and received the sum from the Fidelity Fund of the Law Society in 2006.
Offence No. 7
On 19 December 2001 Myra Irene Nettlebeck died and Fitzsimons acted for the Executrix Jean Joss in obtaining a Grant of Probate and in the realisation and distribution of the assets of the Estate.  Three beneficiaries of small amounts were named in the will and the residual was to be paid to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Royal NSW Institute for Deaf and Blind Children and the Salvation Army.  A property at Oxford St, Woollahra was part of the Estate and Fitzsimons advised Joss she could purchase the property for $380,000.00.
The accused had previously acted for Ms Joss and held $171,781.99 on her behalf being part of the Estate of her Father, V. Eddy.  This sum was deposited into the ""Direct Investment Account"" of Christopher and Maria Fitzsimons on 10 May 2002.  After further payments on 13 May 2002 Mrs Joss contributed a cheque of $111,351.00 to finalise the Estate.  This cheque was also deposited to the Direct Investment Account of the Accused, without the knowledge of Joss. The money received was then expended from the account mainly by Netbank (internet) transfers to other accounts kept by the accused.
The bequests were to be paid and the balance of the Estate was then to be paid to the Charities in the amount of $92,377.67 each, closing the Estate. No letter or financial statement of account was received by Joss.
When questioned by Joss, Fitzsimons sent a 'Professional Costs and Tax Invoice' on 5 April 2005.  The covering letter indicated the charities and other beneficiary had been paid as expected and the administration of the Estate completed during May 2002.  Having concerns Joss made enquiries with the charities which revealed no payments had been received.
Offences No. 8 to 10
On request on 4 May 2005 Fitzsimons then sent Joss photocopies of Trust cheques 2023 to 2026, from his Solicitors Trust Account 062 140 10072183. The cheques, dated 3/6/02, were allegedly used to fund Bank cheques.
Cheque 2023 listed the bank cheque payee as the Royal NSW Institute for Deaf and Blind Children for $92377.67, cheque 2024 listed payee the Salvation Army of NSW for $92377.67, cheque 2025 the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for $92377.67 and cheque 2026 for another beneficiary M Meekings for $3,000.00.
Enquiries revealed on 3 June 2002 the balance of the Accused trust account 062 140 10072183 was $16,484.95, which was insufficient to cover funding of the cheques. These cheques were never presented for payment to the Commonwealth Bank. Notes in the cash book of the Practice record ""cheques 2021 to 2026 destroyed for security to prevent accidental writing of cheques."" The cheques butts recorded ""cancelled closed.""
The accused also supplied signed receipts purporting to be from each of the Charities.
The receipt acknowledging the payment of the legacy for the Royal NSW Institute for Deaf and Blind Children for $92377.67, dated 6 June 2002, was signed with an indecipherable signature. Enquiries revealed it was not the signature of the Chief Executive or Legal Officer of the Institute, the only people authorised to sign a receipt. No money was received by the Institute at that time.
The receipt acknowledging the payment of the legacy for the Salvation Army of NSW for $92377.67, dated 11 June 2002, was signed ""C. White."". Enquiries revealed it was not the signature of the Legal Secretary of the Institute, the only person authorised to sign a receipt. No money was received by the Institute at that time.
The receipt acknowledging the payment of the legacy for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, for $92377.67, dated 7 June 2002, was signed Richard Walsh. Enquiries revealed there was no employee of the Institute by that name or authorised to sign a receipt. No money was received by the Institute at that time.
Richard Walsh, a client of Marie Fitzsimons who was also a Solicitor, was spoken to and he stated that his signature appears on the receipt. However he denied signing the receipt, explaining Maria Fitzsimons had a stamp of his signature to be used when he was out of the country.
The beneficiary Mary Meekings was spoken in June 2005 by Joss. She stated she had not received a cheque from the Accused in payment of the legacy. On 21 June 2005 Meekings received a cheque from the accused for $3,000.00 and a letter stating he had previously sent a cheque in 2002.
On 29 November 2005 a cheque for $277,131.00 was deposited into the joint account of the accused and his wife. This cheque was drawn on the account of K & D Grubisa. Dominique Grubisa is the daughter of Christopher and Maria Fitzsimons. Three cheques for $92,377.67 were then drawn by Maria Fitzsimons on that date and Bank cheques forwarded to the Charities.
Offences No. 6 & 5
The accused acted on behalf of Malle Poole in respect of the Estate of her parents Linda and Tiit Kroll. On 31 March 2004 $114,985.33 was received into the trust account of Fitzsimons from the Estate. Without her knowledge or consent $50,000.00 was transferred from the trust account on 19 April 2004 to the joint account of Christopher and Maria Fitzsimons. The money was disbursed to Credit cards payments, another joint account of the Fitzsimons and the TAB. A note on the trust ledger of the practice lists the debit as ""K. Poole CBA a/c interim distribution.""
On 22 April 2004, again without the knowledge and consent of Mrs Poole, $25,000.00 was transferred from the Trust account to a joint account in Cairns held by the Fitzsimons and their daughter Louisa. This sum was disbursed in the same manner. The ledger records ""K. Poole CBA a/c transfer interim.""
Mrs Poole received a ""Professional Costs and Tax Invoice"" from the accused dated 6 May 2004. This shows her total payment of a cheque for $108,921.33, with a handwritten note stating ""cheque banked into your account."" An almost identical ""Professional Costs and Tax Invoice"" located in the file of the accused's practice shows, ""$108,921.33. Less paid - $75,000.00, balance and cheque $33,921.33"", apparently to conform to the trust ledger record.
A cheque from the joint account of the accused and his wife for $75,000.00 was deposited into Mrs Poole's account on 10 May 2004, being part of the full payment of $108,921.33 paid on that date. The funds for this cheque were provided by another client Peron P/L.
Offence No.4
Fitzsimons also acted for Mrs Poole and her husband Kenneth in relation to the purchase of a property at 14/344 West Botany Street, Rockdale. About 9 September 2005 Mr Poole gave Fitzsimons a cheque for $30,594.00 payable to the NSW Office ofState Revenue for stamp duty on the property. This cheque was deposited into the Cairns joint account of the accused, his wife and daughter Louisa, on 13 September 2005. Settlement took place on 13 September 2005.
In 2006 the Poole's spoke to Jean Sayer the Receiver of the practice. Mrs Poole realised she did not have the Certificate of Title for their house. An enquiry revealed their property was still registered to the previous owners. Mr Poole contacted the accused. Stamp duty on the property was paid on 14 March 2006 and the Transfer registered on that date. On 16 March 2006 the accused left the Certificate of Title to the property in the house in an envelope.
Offence No.3 
On 8 November 2004 $61,750.75 was deposited into the joint account of Christopher and Maria Fitzsimons on behalf of Robert Harkess from the Estate of his Father Robert Harkess. The Solicitors Trust account was not used for this transaction. The credit balance of the account was $2,748.42. Debits totalling $59,200.00 were made, mainly credit card payments. On 16 December 2004 cheques were drawn to pay the beneficiaries of the Estate, being $27,709.38 to D. Harkess and $29,029.37 to R Harkess. These cheques were funded by the proceeds of an advance made to the Fitzsimons by Robin Wilson.
Offence No.2
The accused acted for Roger Huntington concerning the administration of the Estate of his Mother, Doris Huntington with probate granted on 30 November 2005. On 16 December 2005 a cheque for $173,585.78 was forwarded to the accused, representing the accommodation bond paid to the Uniting Church for care. Mr Huntington instructed the accused to use these funds to discharge a mortgage on the family home at 72 Tambourine Bay Road, Lane Cove and transfer the title to him as provided in his mothers will.
On 16 September 2005 the accused had opened an account at the CBA Chatswood, styled C.R. Fitzsimons Trust account, number 10566431. The cheque was deposited into this account on 21 December 2005, and without the knowledge or consent of Mr Huntington. This account was closed by the drawing of a cheque made payable to K & D Grubisa for that amount. This cheque was deposited into the St George account of KM & DE Grubisa.
Offence No. 1
On 27 February 2006, the accused, although his practising certificate was suspended, opened a Solicitors Trust account with the Commonwealth Bank, Kings Cross 10315225. Part of the opening deposit was two cheques received from the Uniting Church, $33,164.42 and $3,258.92 payable to the Estate of the late Doris Huntington. Without the knowledge or consent of Mr Huntington the majority of these funds were then transferred to the joint Cairns and Chatswood accounts. Mr Huntington did not receive this money.
Mr Huntington received no money or accounting documents from the accused. Jean Sayer alerted Mr Huntington to the situation, and the funds were not recovered from the accused. The mortgage on the property of Mr Huntington was discharged on 15 December 2006. The Commonwealth Bank were required to pay money to the Receiver in repayment for these transactions. 

12On these facts and his pleas of guilty, the solicitor was convicted of the following offences -

13Overall, Mr Fitzsimons was sentenced to a head sentence of 21 months with a non-parole period of nine months, expiring on 11 September 2010. 
Misleading the Legal Services Commissioner
14On 15 December 2005 Ms Kathleen Dooley complained to the Legal Services Commissioner about Mr Fitzsimons' conduct whilst acting on behalf of the administratrix of the estate of the late Francis John Haylen.  The complaint concerned two matters: firstly, despite requests for an account of the administration of the estate, none had been provided; secondly, there was also alleged a shortfall of about $40,000 in the total distribution to the beneficiaries.  
15The complaint was, it seems, forwarded to Mr Fitzsimons, who responded on 25 January 2006.  After confirming that he acted for Mrs Roberts, the administratrix, the solicitor briefly described the assets and enumerated the beneficiaries.  The letter said, ""Mrs Roberts gave me specific instructions to pay all moneys to her and that was done"".  In fact, it appears that, although the bulk of the funds were paid to Mrs Roberts, other substantial amounts were paid to other beneficiaries.  It does not appear to be alleged that any of these payments were inappropriate or unjustified.  Although the accounts from which they were paid, as listed by the Crown Solicitor, appear to be unconventional and, perhaps, impermissible, this is not made the subject of any allegation of misconduct.  
16Two allegations are particularised.  Firstly, as I understand it, that Mr Fitzsimons did not, when responding to the Commissioner's enquiry, disclose the payments to the other beneficiaries.  Since it does not seem to be suggested these payments were improper, the failure to disclose them does not strike me as of particular significance.  The Crown Solicitor, in the letter responding to a request for particulars, also alleges that the payments made to those beneficiaries ""were taken from funds in the Phillipson Estate"" and that Mr Fitzsimons misled the Commissioner by not disclosing this fact.  This particular is somewhat obscure.  It was not alleged in any part of the statement of facts in the District Court that Mr Fitzsimons had misappropriated funds from either the Phillipson or the Haylen Estates.  Nor was any evidence put before me justifying this allegation.  In the result, the allegation in respect of this matter amounts to a complaint that Mr Fitzsimons did not inform the Commissioner that he had not only paid estate funds to Mrs Roberts but also to the other beneficiaries.  
17On the other hand, in his affidavit of 27 January 2011 the solicitor says at paragraph 83 - 
""In respect of the further and better particulars supplied by the Crown Solicitor referring to the Estates of Haylen and Phillipson my recollection is that these were two deceased estates where there was discord between the family members as beneficiaries.  I wrote to the Legal Services Commissioner on 25th January 2006, a week after being discharged from the Northside Clinic on 18th of January 2006.  I have no recollection of whether I had access to the Haylen file in preparing my letter but most likely I wrote it from memory without reference to the file.  As the allegation is now one of fact that I paid the Haylen beneficiaries with the proceeds of the Phillipson estate and that gives rise to the allegation of deliberately misleading the Legal Services Commissioner, I say that I had absolutely no intention of deceiving the Commissioner, that I wrote the letter with the intention of being frank and helpful and that I had no idea at all of the link between the Haylen Estate and the misappropriation in the Phillipson Estate.""
I note that Mr Fitzsimons was not required for cross-examination on his affidavit.
18This appears to me to amount to an admission by Mr Fitzsimons of a misappropriation in connection with the Phillipson Estate.  But, if so, it is certainly not an allegation that is referred to in the District Court proceedings or substantively (as distinct from alleging a failure to report it) the subject of complaint in this Court.  Perhaps it was simply a mispayment or some confusion on his part.  However this may be, I do not see how it can presently be taken into account.  
19I take the complaint to be, therefore, in substance, that the statement as to the payment to Mrs Roberts was inaccurate and that the solicitor was thus in breach of his obligation to be correct in his communications with the Commissioner.  Accepting that the circumstances in which the response came to be made are truthfully stated in the affidavit, this does not seem to me to be a significant matter.
The views of the sentencing judge
20It is conceded by the applicant that I should take into account the views expressed by the learned sentencing judge when dealing with Mr Fitzsimons. Her Honour thought that the mode of commission of the offences was relatively simple.  Mr Fitzsimons deposited funds received from clients in his trust account.  The money was then transferred to another account and thence to two accounts to which he had sole access.  The transactions were fully documented and not concealed in any sophisticated way.  Some years after the particular offences to which they related, the solicitor prepared false receipts to trick the persons entitled to the funds into believing that the accounts were in order.  Unsurprisingly, this was ineffective and eventually led to the discovery of the frauds.  
21A very significant part of the case in the District Court was the uncontradicted reports from consultant psychiatrists Dr Paul Trott and Dr Jonathan Carne.  Her Honour accepted that Mr Fitzsimons' frauds were instigated for the purpose of paying gambling debts.  She referred to, and accepted, the following diagnosis by Dr Carne - 
""It is more likely that Mr Fitzsimons was experiencing abnormalities in mood, both depression and elevated moods in the period of these offences.  The exact relationship between the offence and Mr Fitzsimons' mood state was not able to be established, as Mr Fitzsimons was unable to recall exactly his mood during the specific periods in the offences took place.
...[T]he statement from Mr Fitzsimons' daughter...reinforces the strength of the conclusion that Mr Fitzsimons suffered from long standing bipolar affective disorder as well an alcohol abuse problem.
... Mr Fitzsimons probably suffers from longstanding bipolar affective disorder and alcohol abuse and dependence... his behaviour at the time of the offences was probably affected to a significant degree by abnormalities of mood.
...[It] is perfectly clear to me [that] the behaviour which brought about the gambling problem is a behaviour which, on balance, can be found to be as a result of a manic phase that he was in at the time.""
22Summarising the psychiatric case, her Honour stated - 
The excessive gambling and subsequent misuse of funds seems to me to be a defined feature of the manic phase of the bipolar disorder as described by Dr Carne and Dr Trott. [Their] reports speak of the effects of the mania and the oppressive episodes on the offender's related disorders of alcohol misuse and gambling. 
Also supporting this finding is the fact that, as noted by his daughter and Dr Trott, when the offender is medicated he is calm, thoughtful, responsive and responsible.  When not medicated he is anything but that.  This speaks in itself of a mental illness controlling the actions of the offender rather than the offender choosing to gamble and using his diagnosis as an excuse.""
23Her Honour accepted that Mr Fitzsimons had demonstrated genuine remorse and had made good (with the support of his family) his defalcations by, in effect, selling all their property, leaving nothing of any substance.  Her Honour accepted that he had not sought to hide his assets.  She concluded that he ""will be a very good candidate for rehabilitation and a very good candidate for a finding that there is very little prospect of re-offending"".  
24These findings were plainly the basis for (and, with respect, completely justified) the very lenient sentence imposed on Mr Fitzsimons.
Medical history
25The solicitor's background and history concerning his mental condition are sufficiently set out in the detailed medical reports which have been tendered.  In addition, Dr Jonathan Carne and Dr Bruce Westmore gave evidence before me.  In substance, as it seems to me, there is no substantial disagreement about the nature of Mr Fitzsimons' mental problems and it does not seem necessary to set out in detail the history upon which it is based.  A summary however is, I think, useful.  
26Mr Fitzsimons recalls that, from the time of his early secondary schooling, he developed periods of depression alternating with periods of emotional elation.  These sensations have been with him all his life.  In December 2005 he says that he plunged into a most severe period of depression and he had thoughts of murder and suicide.  Realising that he had a serious mental problem he went to a longstanding friend who was a psychiatrist, Dr Rowe who saw him at his home and referred him for psychiatric treatment.  After a week or so, as I understand it, he was admitted to Northside Clinic as an inpatient on 3 January 2006 and was discharged on 18 January.  He was diagnosed with a severe episode of major depression with melancholia and psychotic features.  It was thought, though not confirmed, that he might be suffering from bipolar disorder.  Dr Lyndon, under whose care he had been admitted, noted that the solicitor ""was preoccupied with a sense of shame and guilt relating to what he described as 'misappropriation of funds' approximately four years previously.  Mr Fitzsimons also reported a longstanding history of excessive alcohol use consistent with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence.  His risk of suicide was assessed on his admission as being very high.  A brain scan showed changes consistent with his history of alcohol abuse, consistent with a possibility of early dementia and, more remotely, ""possibly consistent with a diagnosis of longstanding bipolar disorder"".  Dr Lyndon thought that although this latter diagnosis was presumptive only, there was a reasonable possibility that it was the true diagnosis but the presence of co-morbid alcohol dependence meant that it was difficult to interpret the history of mood swings and diagnosed bipolar disorder with certainty.  Mr Fitzsimons' early response to lithium augmentation suggested that his treatment prognosis would be reasonably good.  
27In February 2006, following his discharge from the Northside Clinic, Mr Fitzsimons came under the care of Dr Hugh Morgan.  That doctor reported on 3 March 2006.  The history given to that doctor by Mr Fitzsimons was that in 2002 his law practice was ""on the skids"" and, after an unsuccessful short term partnership, he left to practice alone.  He told Dr Morgan that he was retained in connexion with a deceased estate with $300,000 to be donated towards charity and that he took the money.  He said that he knew ""for one millionth of a second"" that it was wrong but said he was driven by a compulsion, ""the thrill of doing it, taking the money and not being caught, the daredevil factor"".  Dr Morgan suspected that Mr Fitzsimons was hypomanic at the time.  He was very regretful for his actions, the doctor noted, and also felt bad about the impact his behaviour had on his wife's legal practice and his family generally.  He said that by July 2005 he was fed up with his practice, the doctor suspecting at this time that he was severely depressed, and felt he needed help and was insecure with a sense of failure.  In September 2005, he surrendered his practising certificate to the Law Society but six weeks later changed his mind and arranged for it to be reissued to him.  In the last week of November 2005 he sought to surrender his practising certificate again but the Law Society noted that there had been a complaint made against him and he was unable to do so whilst it remained outstanding. (Although this is unclear, it may well be that Mr Fitzsimons was referring to the misappropriations concerning the Nettlebeck Estate, which involved the sum of about $280,000).  Shortly after he was advised of the complaint, an investigation ensued by the Law Society.  However, Mr Fitzsimons went to the family holiday house in Queensland, leaving his wife at home to deal with the matter.  Whilst he was in Queensland alone for three to four weeks he became paranoid, intensely worried, and dyed his hair to change his appearance, also attempting to obtain contact lenses.  On 22 December 2005 Mr Fitzsimons returned home.  On the previous day his practising certificate was suspended and a receiver was appointed in respect of his practice.  As is usual, his personal assets were frozen subject to the ability to withdraw a weekly sum for expenses.  On 30 December 2005 he saw Dr Rowe and, as I have related, ultimately was admitted to the Northside Clinic.  
28Dr Morgan concluded that Mr Fitzsimons had been suffering from Bipolar I illness, characterised by clear manic episodes and major depressive episodes.  Dr Morgan relied on Mr Fitzsimons' self-reported history and also information provided by his wife whom, he thought, described ""a very typical account of what somebody is like when they are manic"".  Dr Morgan suspected that Mr Fitzsimons had probably been suffering from a bipolar illness since his late teens or early twenties and believed that his very erratic behaviour towards the end of 2005 and the incident of misappropriation of funds in 2002 were all substantially related to his being mentally ill at the time and substantially interfered with his compliance with the legal requirements governing his conduct as a solicitor including having a substantial impact on his appreciation of legal and moral standards of conduct.  Mr Fitzsimons had responded well to antidepressant and lithium medication, which Dr Morgan thought would need to be continued.  He thought that he was and would remain well providing he continued treatment.  (I note that Mr Fitzsimons had significantly understated both the occasions and the extent of his misappropriations.  He also had not mentioned his gambling.)
29Dr Morgan reported that Mr Fitzsimons' mental state examination, which occurred on 3 February 2006, ""revealed a pleasant man who developed a good rapport who was honest, reflective and remorseful for his actions"".
30Despite this optimistic picture, Mr Fitzsimons, a little over three weeks later, committed the offence in the first count on the indictment, involving the opening of a Solicitor's Trust account with the Commonwealth Bank for the purpose of depositing two cheques of $33,164.42 and $3,258.92 payable to the Estate of the late Doris Huntington.  Most of this money was transferred to Mr Fitzsimons' personal accounts.  He was already under treatment and his affidavit does not suggest any relapse until he stopped taking his medication (as referred to above) in mid-2006.  At this time, his practising certificate was suspended and, on 21 December 2005 a Receiver had been appointed to his practice.  Of course, the inevitable ensuing investigation would have disclosed his defalcations, including this last one.  This appears to suggest both that this offence was seriously irrational in the sense that its discovery was certain and that his behaviour was then inadequately controlled by the drugs.  However, it might also suggest that the misappropriations were far less a result of his mental illness than he and the medical evidence suggests.  I note that this chronology was not referred to in any of the medical reports, although Dr Trott, Dr Carne (who specifically mentioned, but without comment, the 2006 offences) and Dr Westmore - all of whose opinions are discussed below - nor was it mentioned by counsel in submissions as a matter that should lead me to doubt the significance to be attributed to medical opinions.  
31Mr Fitzsimons has not adverted to the 2006 offences in his affidavit and attributes all his defalcations to his mental condition.  However, he does not make a statement one way or another about his condition at the time, except by implication that he felt much improved.  Of course, he might well not have been a good judge of this if he were manic, or somewhat manic.  As I have mentioned, he was not cross-examined on his affidavit.  Nor was this matter the subject of cross-examination of either Dr Carne or Dr Westmore.  Of course, I have no medical expertise and thus am unable to assess whether, at the time, his medication in fact stabilised his condition without intermittent relapse.  Absent the considerations that arise from the omissions to cross-examine to which I have referred and the patent irrationality of the misappropriation when discovery was not only inevitable but imminent, the evidence on the whole could lead to the conclusion that, more probably than not Mr Fitzsimons was not significantly affected by his bipolar disorder at the time.  I bear in mind also that the plaintiff bears the onus of proof.  In the result, although I have real doubts about this matter, I am not prepared to draw an inference adverse to Mr Fitzsimons.  
32Mr Fitzsimons saw Dr Clive Allock on 1 and 15 February and March 2007 specifically to deal with his gambling issues.  He told Dr Allcock that he had started gambling in his mid-teens until the age of 19, then resuming betting at about 24 years of age for a short time before restarting in the late 1980s with small bets through a telephone account.  In the early 1990s he started to gamble on the horses using a computer program with which he had some successes.  He then started to lose, at first hundreds of dollars a week and then larger sums as his betting increased as an attempt to make money.  He did not feel it was as yet a major problem.  He opened a TAB telephone account involving, it seems, sums of up to $5,000 and then $10,000 a week, concealing the extent of his gambling and especially the losses from his family and friends.  He disclosed that he gambled as a way of escaping from problems.  He lied to family members and others to conceal the extent of his involvement, committing illegal acts including fraud and embezzlement but yet denying that he had a pre-occupation with gambling or needing to gamble with increasing amounts of money to achieve the desired excitement.  Mr Fitzsimons told Dr Allock that he had not gambled since June 2006 and felt no pressure or urge to gamble at this time.  
33Dr Allcock concluded that there was no doubt that a diagnosis of pathological gambling could easily be sustained ""in recent years"" and had significantly contributed to the decisions that Mr Fitzsimons made in terms of taking money.  He thought that it was very likely, in light of his indication that he had now no urge to or interest in gambling, that it was very likely that he would have ""a good prognosis on the gambling front"".  Dr Allcock noted, in this respect, that were other psychological issues and, if they increased in intensity then he would return to Dr Lyndon or the Northside Clinic for further assistance.  
34On 30 November 2009 Dr Paul Trott, who was then Mr Fitzsimons' treating psychiatrist, provided a report for the purpose of the sentencing proceedings.  This report was based on his - 
 ...having regular and recent reviews of [Mr Fitzsimons'] mood, mental state and level of functioning....[which enabled him] to gain an extensive and longitudinal psychiatric history concerning Mr Fitzsimons mental functioning, as well as providing continuing care.
Dr Trott's report briefly outlines the evolution of Mr Fitzsimons' major depressive episode which led him to consult Dr Rowe and then Dr Lyndon and admission to the Northside Clinic.  It appears that after Mr Fitzsimons' consultation with Dr Allcock, he (wrongly) concluded that his gambling addiction was his main problem rather than that of bipolar affective disorder or other affective illness so that, feeling ""well"", Mr Fitzsimons discontinued his psychotropic medications and suffered an illness relapse which necessitated his readmission to the Northside Clinic.  He was then again stabilised on lithium carbonate (a mood stabiliser) and Fluoxetine (an SSRI antidepressant).  However, Mr Fitzsimons again discontinued his medication during 2008 because he felt ""mentally well"" and suffered a subsequent decline in mood, becoming quite dysphoric and negative in his outlook with emergent pessimism and hopelessness as well as entertaining notions of suicide and homicide.  He said that this relapse stemmed from continuing stresses involving an inability to meet financial commitments, which had resulted in the forced sale of properties.  He was admitted to the Cairns Base Hospital psychiatric unit where he was stabilized again on lithium carbonate.  Dr Trott observed that Mr Fitzsimons' ""gambling problem"" may be separate to or part of his bipolar illness (hypomania).  
35Dealing with the misappropriations, Dr Trott referred to Mr Fitzsimons' acknowledgment of the wrongfulness of his actions but described ""a sense of excitement"" and ""thrill"" with his ""feeling somewhat driven and compelled"".  Dr Trott also referred to Mr Fitzsimons' grossly excessive alcohol consumption.  He described a history of recurrent cyclical hypomanic and major depressive states since especially the mid-1990s.  
36Dr Trott's diagnosis was that Mr Fitzsimons had a chronic moderate to severe Bipolar Affective Disorder Type II, as defined in DSMIV, which had been partially treated, manifesting recurrent major depressive episodes and in-between hypomanic states, the clinical picture being complicated by a co-morbid chronic moderate alcohol abuse as well as a gambling addiction, though these, according to the history given by Mr Fitzsimons, were now in remission.  
37Dr Trott described the course of Mr Fitzsimons' condition since February 2009 and the medical treatment provided to him which, with adjustment, had led gradually to improvement of his mood and mental well-being, including a resolution of various depressive symptoms and a loss of the suicidal and homicidal ideation together with a normalisation of his neuro-vegetative function.  
38Dr Trott also noted Mr Fitzsimons' expression of deep regret and remorse concerning his actions, especially in betraying the trust of clients and the subsequent harm that he had caused.  Although not well expressed, it seems to me that Dr Trott accepted that Mr Fitzsimons Bipolar Affective Disorder (with alternating Hypomania and Major Depression) as well as former alcohol Abuse and gambling addiction resulted in a chronic pattern of impulsivity and recklessness (of spending and gambling) and his failure to fully consider the consequences of his subsequent miscreant actions, especially upon his clients, his legal practice, the legal profession and his family.  
39As mentioned, Dr Jonathan Carne reported on Mr Fitzsimons' condition on 4 December 2009 for the purposes of the sentencing proceedings.  Dr Carne had available to him considerably more information about Mr Fitzsimons' criminal misappropriations.  He obtained the following history - 
""Review of Mr Fitzsimons Level of Functioning During the Period of his offences
The offences took place during 2002, 2004, December 2005 and February 2006.
Mr Fitzsimons told me that he lost interest in his legal practice in 2002 and went into partnership with a colleague nearby in Chatswood, however this did not work out and he terminated the partnership and returned to his own practice in which his wife who qualified as a solicitor in 1990 also worked. 
2002 offenceDuring this period Mr Fitzsimons told me he was depressed about his unsuccessful new legal partnership which he felt was not working. 
In 2003, the year in which no offences were committed, Mr Fitzsimons told me he left the partnership.  He felt the pressure of working in a bad partnership had been relieved.  He continued gambling.   2004 offencesMr Fitzsimons told me he committed these offences to pay gambling debts. 
2005 offencesOffences committed to pay gambling debts.
2006 offencesThese offences were also committed to pay gambling debts.""
40Dr Carne gave a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder (manic depression) with periods of depression and mood elevation, probably longstanding but with an unclear date of onset together with alcohol abuse/ dependence.  He concluded - 
""Mr Fitzsimons probably suffers from longstanding Bipolar Affective Disorder and alcohol abuse/ dependence.  His behaviour at the time of the offences was probably affected to a significant degree by abnormalities of mood although, because of Mr Fitzsimons' poor recall of his mood states during the various periods of offending it was not possible to draw a direct causal relationship between mood and behaviour.""
Dr Carne concluded in addition that - 
""If Mr Fitzsimons continued his psychiatric treatment and abstinence from alcohol he thought it unlikely that any re-offending would occur. ""
41On 9 May 2011 Dr Carne provided a new report based upon a number of consultations he had with Mr Fitzsimons between 23 November 2009 and 4 May 2011.  As I have mentioned, the first consultation was for the purpose of preparing a report for the sentence proceedings.  Subsequent consultations were for treatment of Mr Fitzsimons' condition.  
42Dr Carne confirmed his initial diagnosis of longstanding Bipolar Affective Disorder and alcohol abuse/ dependence.  He was still of the view that Mr Fitzsimons' behaviour at the time of the offences was probably affected to a significant degree by abnormalities of mood although, as he had earlier stated his poor recall of his mood states during the offending periods meant it was not possible to draw a direct causal relationship between mood and behaviour.  Dr Carne pointed out that Bipolar Affective Disorder is not reversible although it responds to treatment which, when effective, abolishes symptoms such as mania, depression and the cyclical disturbance of mood which are typical of the illness.  However, even full adherence to all treatment may not prevent relapses although they are less likely.  He thought that, absent gambling and alcohol misuse, there is good prognosis for long term stability providing he continues to comply with psychiatric treatment and has domestic stability and social support.  As to whether on clinical grounds he is employable in a legal practice, Dr Carne thought that if Mr Fitzsimons remained stable and he stays within the area of his professional ability his answer is ""yes"".  So far as re-offending is concerned, providing he remains psychiatrically stable he thought that, in light of his remorse and acceptance of responsibility and his wish to rehabilitate himself, there is little likelihood of re-offending.  Dr Carne felt that he could say that Mr Fitzsimons shows ""clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation"".  
43Dr Carne gave evidence before me and was cross-examined by counsel for the Prothonotary.  He confirmed the opinions given in his reports and that he was continuing to treat Mr Fitzsimons.  He said that during the period of treatment Mr Fitzsimons has been clinically stable and it appeared that, at present at least, his medication is effective and appropriate.  He is seeing Mr Fitzsimons between monthly and bi-monthly and would expect this to be so for about two years.  If his stability continued the frequency of assessments could be reduced providing he regularly sees a general practitioner.  Dr Carne made the point in cross-examination that he did not actually diagnose bipolar disorder in Mr Fitzsimons.  He said that he had been presented with a man diagnosed with bipolar disorder by two or three different psychiatrists and who was stable at the time he saw him.  He accepted the diagnosis based upon those made by previous treating psychiatrists, whose analysis seemed on the face of it to be correct.  Moreover, it was confirmed by the information provided in the statements of his daughters.  Dr Carne said, in cross-examination, that he did not feel he could go far as to say that, but for Mr Fitzsimons' mood disorder, he would not have committed the offences but nevertheless it had a role to play, that is, there was a causal connection.  However, it was necessary to be cautious in this respect because there were gaps in the history and the additional complication of Mr Fitzsimons' alcohol abuse during the relevant period.  As the doctor commented, quite fairly, it is scarcely possible to disentangle the causative factors.  
44Dr Carne was taken to Dr Westmore's opinion that it was Mr Fitzsimons' gambling disorder primarily which caused his professional conduct, although the mood disorder and alcohol abuse may have played some role.  Dr Carne thought that the gambling behaviour resulted from the bipolar disorder.  He explained that gambling alone is not necessarily the result of a mental illness but the severity and irresponsibility of the gambling and of the consequences were the result, in his view, of the abnormal mood states caused by Mr Fitzsimons' bipolar disorder.  Asked whether, as a result of his disorder, Mr Fitzsimons was able to distinguish between right and wrong, Dr Carne replied that he could not say what Mr Fitzsimons' mental state was when he was committing the offences.  He tried to obtain a history covering that period but Mr Fitzsimons was not able to recall exactly how he felt at that time.  He was asked whether he would expect Mr Fitzsimons to be able to recall that he had in 2001 and mid-2002 misappropriated the sums of about $50,000 and $280,000.  Dr Carne said that he was treating Mr Fitzsimons over a period of 10 months when he was well but it would be unusual for a person suffering from a manic episode not to be able to remember a significant event such as a course of action involving misappropriation of funds.  However, this involved speculation since every individual is different and the effects of an illness vary from person to person.  In addition, Mr Fitzsimons had a severe alcohol problem as well as his bipolar disorder and it is quite clear that excessive consumption of alcohol leads to many deficits and failure to record or recall memories.  
45The Prothonotary called Dr Bruce Westmore, who examined Mr Fitzsimons at the behest of the Crown Solicitor.  This examination occurred on 9 June 2011.  I do not need to repeat the history taken by Dr Westmore and set out in his report.  Although in some respects it is more detailed than other histories and, perhaps more focused, no doubt a reflection of the advantage that Dr Westmore had from reading the other reports, I do not think it differs significantly from those previously given.  So far as psychiatric diagnostic issues are concerned, Dr Westmore's conclusion is at one with the other doctors, namely that Mr Fitzsimons has Bipolar Affective Disorder, which is currently in remission as is his gambling disorder and alcohol abuse.  He thought that it is unlikely that Mr Fitzsimons suffers from Antisocial Personality Disorder, despite the nature of the offending behaviour.  He thought his general level of functioning is likely to have fluctuated significantly depending on his mood state, his gambling addiction and his abuse of alcohol.  
46Dr Westmore agreed with Dr Carne that it was not possible to establish a positive relationship between the Bipolar Affective Disorder and the offending behaviour.  Otherwise, Dr Westmore agreed with Dr Carne's opinions about Mr Fitzsimons' present condition and the possibilities of relapse.  Dr Westmore added the following - 
""The nature, extent and chronicity of his previous gambling behaviour which was associated with serious ethical breaches in his practice of law obviously represent a serious concern.  At this time, he reports that he is not gambling.  I would not accept that there may be some relationship between his previous mood disorder, alcohol abuse and gambling although the gambling disorder is a unique illness in and of itself.  I would recommend that he attend Gamblers Anonymous or a similar group on a long term basis.  I accept that this can be difficult for some patients but it does provide them with additional support and reality testing in relation to their previous problems."" 
47Dr Westmore expressed the view that it was Mr Fitzsimons'  ""gambling disorder primarily which caused his professional misconduct... [though] mood disorder and alcohol abuse may also have played some role in his serious error of judgment and professional misconduct"".  As to Mr Fitzsimons' level of insight into the gravity of his misconduct, Dr Westmore pointed out that he had only seen Mr Fitzsimons on one occasion.  To the extent that he could comment on this aspect, Dr Westmore thought that he has at least moderate and probably greater insight into the gravity of his misconduct.  Dr Westmore summarised his report in this way - 
It would seem that this man was in the past an energetic and committed lawyer but that his various medical problems affected his capacity to practise both mentally and in a practical sense.  It is likely he his highly experienced and he appears to be highly motivated to return to make some contribution to the law.  I think he does have that potential and capacity but that he will require support and supervision if that occurs.
48In the course of his evidence, Dr Westmore described Mr Fitzsimons' gambling problem, as severe and extreme, indeed ""very"" extreme.  He said that the preoccupation with gambling suggested that it was a primary and unique problem but that he nevertheless agreed it was related to depression in the sense that people who are depressed, it is known, have a propensity to gamble.  
49In his affidavit of 11 May 2011 Mr Fitzsimons stated - 
""I now recognise that my bipolarity caused me serious errors of judgment which triggered my professional misconduct giving rise to my criminal convictions and imprisonments.  I recognise too that I have been addicted to alcohol and gambling which two vices caused me to depart from responsible behaviour and into a horrid world of lies, deception and ultimately criminality.  I accept full responsibility for my misconduct and criminality."" 
It appears from this passage that Mr Fitzsimons accepts responsibility for his wrongdoing but believes that it arose from ""serious errors of judgment"" caused by his bipolarity.  His acceptance of ""full responsibility"" for his wrongdoing is, to this extent, qualified.  I make this observation in passing since Mr Fitzsimons was not required for cross-examination and it was not suggested to me that I should act on the basis that he did not fully acknowledge the moral shortcomings which, at least in part, contributed to his conduct.  He has not suggested - nor could it be suggested - that, at the time he committed the misappropriations and the attempts at cover up, he was not fully aware that what he was doing was both seriously immoral as well as illegal.  I do not think it can be seriously doubted that his judgment was warped by his mental condition and his gambling and alcohol addictions.
The failure to report  
50I raised in the course of Dr Westmore's evidence the point that, during the entire period of his misconduct there were times when he would have appreciated that he had done some very wrong things and asked - 
""Q.  Therefore his decision to do nothing about it when he had a positive duty as a legal practitioner... there must have been times when he must have been - of course it is all relative - but relatively in his right mind and known what he had done and yet decided for whatever reason not to correct it.  Fear of consequences is a perfectly rational response, so it is not irrationality that would lead one not to do anything about it?
A.  No. I agree.""
51It seems to me that the evidence suggests, as I put to Dr Westmore, that there were times when the applicant was in his right mind, if not entirely so, and knew that he had committed serious offences.  Yet, he not only did  not attempt to make good his thefts, he did not inform the Law Society (as was his independent duty) of what he had done.  Since, ex hypothesi, this silence was not the result of his illness, it indicates to my mind a significant failing of moral character that reflects upon the question whether he is a fit and proper person to remain on the role.  
52However, this issue was not a part of the particulars relied on by the Prothonotary nor a matter raised by Mr Griffin with Dr Carne or, for that matter, Dr Westmore.  During submissions I raised the problem specifically with Mr Griffin in the following way - 
""HIS HONOUR:  I don't think it could be doubted he was guilty of professional misconduct.  It seems to me the real issue is the significance of the psychiatric evidence and quite what is meant by present unsuitability or present suitability.
GRIFFIN:  Indeed and to put it in context, the primary submission by the applicant is that the conduct contended for by the respondent makes him permanently unfit to remain on the roll.
HIS HONOUR:  There are two aspects of the conduct.  The first one is the conduct itself.  Accepting that, for the sake of discussion, it would not have occurred but for his mental condition.  I think the evidence is clear that there were substantial periods of time when he was quite, how shall I put it, not in command of himself.
I think I would infer that there were times he knew that he had committed crimes and knew that he had a duty to disclose them and yet he did not do so.  So that even accepting the causal relationship between the offences themselves and his psychiatric condition, there appears to be, I haven't of course decided anything but there appears to be in the psychiatric evidence a high likelihood, perhaps a certainty, that he was aware of the crimes and aware of his duty to disclose them and did not do so and that is a very significant professional and indeed moral failure.  It is not for me to judge that.  I can understand why you would be afraid of doing so and worried about doing so and the destruction to your family.  
All those motives, of course, are powerful ones and would affect that person but he was a person who had a duty and his duty required peremptorily and unconditionally that those personal considerations not affect his performance of it.
Since that failure occurred at a time of a degree of normality in which his ability to understand what was happening and was the position was not significantly affected, that provides a secondary serious question about his suitability which, itself, is an independent ground of misconduct and I am not sure as I sit here whether you have particularised it but if you have not if nevertheless strikes me, subject to your submission on the matter, as a matter necessity to be taken into account when considering what appropriate orders should be made and whether he has suitability and certainly it militates against such a finding.
GRIFFIN:  And indeed, your Honour, there is a third aspect which is the allegation of misleading the Legal Services Commissioner.""
53During submissions made by Mr Lyons on Mr Fitzsimons' behalf the following exchange occurred - 
""HIS HONOUR:  What do you say however about his undoubted duty to inform the Law Society of his defulcation.
LYONS:  I go back to my introduction your Honour and the quote from Dr Westmore basically when he said what I think was probably impaired was his capacity to care.  He knew for a moment he was wrong and it just went ta ta.  We have admitted all those things your Honour.  We have said look we have done these very dishonest things, we are embarrassed.  We have been to gaol.
HIS HONOUR:  You see the problem is, as I see it, that there is a complete explanation, you see, accepting for a moment and I am not sure it goes that far, but accepting for a moment that it is the combination of his bipolar condition and his addiction which explains why he gambled and why he took the money.  He was not, his mind was not disordered for the entire time.  He was in practise after all, at a time when his mind was not disordered, he must have known of his thefts and his duty to disclose them.
As to the duty to disclose them, the least charitable view is that he decided not to disclose them, not because he didn't know they were wrong, not because he didn't care, but on the contrary, because he did care and he did not wish to suffer the consequences of what he had done.  An entirely rational but fundamental breach of duty.  Now what is the answer to that analysis of the material? 
LYONS:  I don't have the answer to that other than a quotation from Dr Westmore.
HIS HONOUR:  I must say, I will read his evidence again.  I don't think Dr Westmore answers that problem.  He accepted that there were times when his mind was not disordered and that is plainly true, or significantly disordered.  He was able to get on with the ordinary things of life.  That is plain.  He was able to conduct a law practise with apparent competence. That is plain also.  But there was, I don't wish to be harsh about it, a moral lacuna which surrounded these thefts and I must say, that is a difficulty that I have in accepting that he is a fit person to be a solicitor.  That is because the thefts can be, on one view of the evidence, explained.  But I do not see how that explanation explains the breach of duty to disclose them.  
Now, I understand it is not neat, the condition doesn't start then and stop neatly.  But we are dealing with a long period of time during which it is plain he must have been in his right mind.
LYONS:  May I ask your Honour a question, when you say a duty to declare, you mean ring up the Law Society and say ""I have just stole $400,000 from the trust account"".
HIS HONOUR:  Yes.  Inescapable, is it not?  
LYONS:  I just can't imagine anyone doing it your Honour.
HIS HONOUR:  I can, and I happen to know it has been done.
LYONS:  Not at the time it was taken.
HIS HONOUR:  Well no, but the person comes to realise the seriousness of what they have done and comes forward and confesses.  Now that has happened.  But whether it has or not, there is an undoubted duty to do so, is there not?  
LYONS:  There is a duty, yes.
HIS HONOUR:  This is not a subject capable of debate, and it is a duty to disclose theft made by other solicitors of which you are aware and your own.  It is an important duty because it is often difficult, of course, to discover and so on.
LYONS:  Yes. 
HIS HONOUR:  It is a part of the requirements of integrity.  And I have difficulty in seeing how the medical evidence explains that aspect of the case.  I understand, of course, all the human reasons that would lead someone to hesitate before taking such a step of disclosure.  But as those reasons become powerful, so must the insistence on the duty itself be unqualified.  You see the reasons. 
LYONS:  Yes.
HIS HONOUR:  That is, as I see it as I sit here now, of course I will read all the material.
LYONS:  The integrity your Honour, if I may, once all this came to a smashing end they immediately set about selling all their assets to repay these monies.  So there is integrity your Honour.  It isn't void.
HIS HONOUR:  I am not suggesting your client is utterly void of integrity Mr Lyons, I wouldn't say that for a moment.  That is not the question. 
LYONS:  Thank you, your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR:  There is something that concerns me, it is said in P and has been repeated but I am not sure what it actually means.  That is you have to be satisfied that the person or the solicitor is permanently unfit.  How can you ever be satisfied of that?  
GRIFFIN:  You can't in one sense because it would involve a degree of speculation.
HIS HONOUR:  What is meant by--  
GRIFFIN:  I take it to mean that the behaviour is such that one cannot at the moment foresee the person going from unfitness to fitness.  But it shouldn't be read literally in the sense that given enough time and enough behaviour.
HIS HONOUR:  It is a gloss on the Act.
GRIFFIN:  It is.
HIS HONOUR:  I am not sure it is the Act, it is the rule, the rule is whether someone is fit or unfit.  I suppose if someone were momentarily unfit I could understand why you wouldn't say they were relevantly unfit.
GRIFFIN:  I suspect it is a condemnation phrase grown out of seeking to express a level of--  
HIS HONOUR:  I could understand behaviour so egregious, take this case, if there were absolutely no evidence whatever of any mental condition at all, it was simply naked greed and dishonesty, well, one simply could not imagine a solicitor who had done that ever been being able to get back on the roll.
GRIFFIN:  Except to say the legislation doesn't prohibit application for restoration.  It may be it is hopeless but nonetheless there is nowhere, a legal or medical field where a professional who's struck off and indeed medical field it is common to nominate a period of time in which they cannot make an application.
HIS HONOUR:  I wouldn't, that is not appropriate here, is it?  
GRIFFIN:  No. 
HIS HONOUR:  Would you mind just taking me to the revisions of the Act which govern my own discretion or jurisdiction, do you have it there?  
GRIFFIN:  I don't have the Legal Profession Act with me.Can I say one thing picked up by Mr Lyons, where he said Mr Fitzsimons ""just didn't care"", can your Honour look at page 10 which repeats the statement of facts before the District Court.  If you look down the middle of the pages there is a heading against number one on page ten [a reference to the offence committed in February 2006, after the appointment of the receiver].
HIS HONOUR:  Yes.""
Mr Lyons did not suggest that the issue of failure to report was unfair or unfairly raised at a late stage.  Nor did he seek an adjournment to enable further evidence to be obtained, either by his client or the doctors.  
54Although it is somewhat unsatisfactory to deal with this issue rather late in the piece, it was raised in sufficient time for Mr Fitzsimons' solicitor to have made some application if he felt it was in his client's interest to do so.  Moreover, he made submissions as to the matter.  I have come to the view that it is necessary to take it into account on the issue of Mr Fitzsimons' fitness for practice.
Gambling Addiction
55In his affidavit of 27 January 2011 Mr Fitzsimons deposed that, in 2006 or 2007, he entered a gambling addiction treatment program at St Vincent's Hospital, attending once a week for 13 weeks.  He attended the first six appointments with a psychologist who then terminated his enrolment and referred him to Dr Allcock at the St John of God Hospital, to whose report I have referred.  Mr Fitzsimons says, in accordance with his advice, he stopped gambling.  He did not enter any TAB outlets, buy lottery tickets or similar gambling products and voluntarily agreed with his wife that he should not be allowed access to or carry any money at all.   By following Dr Allcock's advice of carrying no money, having no credit cards and doing shopping with a fixed sum of money given to him by his wife, returning home with the merchandise, the change and the receipt for payment to prove what had been spent, he mustered the will power to stop gambling.  
Alcohol
56Mr Fitzsimons says that since 2006, following diagnosis of and treatment for his mental condition, he has significantly reduced his alcohol intake.  He says that he does not now feel obliged to drink and estimates that he now has two glasses of wine with his evening meal maybe twice a week.  As I have mentioned, there was no cross-examination of Mr Fitzsimons and, considering the other evidence in the case, it seems to me that I should accept this testimony.  
Present position
57Since 2006 Mr Fitzsimons was placed on welfare benefits and given a New Start Allowance without the requirement to report his activities or seek employment.  In February 2008 he applied for and was granted a disability support pension on the ground of mental illness and he is still in receipt of that pension.  As I understand it, he is not presently employed.  Of course, Mr Fitzsimons was in prison between 12 December 2009 and 11 September 2010 and on parole for a further period of one year, requiring him to accept supervision from the Probation and Parole Service.  There is no suggestion that he had ever been in breach of parole.  Mr Fitzsimons says that he wishes to return to Cairns and take employment there with the Queensland Employees Practising Certificate or alternatively to hold a Queensland Volunteer's Practising Certificate and assist the communities on Cape York Peninsula in community legal centres.  He says that, if he is permitted to remain on the roll, he undertakes never to apply for an unrestricted practising certificate and never to have any involvement with trust moneys.  
58Amongst other things, Mr Fitzsimons' elder daughter with whom and her husband and three children Mr Fitzsimons has lived whilst on parole deposes that he is taking his lithium medication daily and there has been a noticeable change in his conduct and behaviour patterns.  She says that he is well mannered, caring, loving and a pleasure to be with, which characteristics ""are completely opposed to his lifelong erratic behaviour"".  She says he is not the same man that she knew very well before he undertook psychiatric treatment and medication but is ""a different man now and a much better person"".  So far as his drinking is concerned, she says that Mr Fitzsimons no longer drinks heavily or daily although he has a glass or two of table wine with the evening meal twice a week and sometimes will not drink for a week or more at a time.  She says ""certainly the alcohol dependent father I knew has been transformed into a sensible, reliable, sober and trustworthy person"".  She confirms that Mr Fitzsimons does not now gamble, she has not seen him with any gambling sites open on his computer and from time to time she subtly checks with him about the urge to gamble.  This deponent was not required for cross-examination on her affidavit.   
59Lastly, I should mention that as a result (as I understand it) of Mr Fitzsimons' conduct he and his wife separated.  She was subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer which required a number of operations.  On 17 May 2011 she underwent her fifth and final operation, which was successful.  Mr Fitzsimons says that he has been caring for his wife every day since her discharge from hospital and hopes for a reconciliation.  He has acknowledged that his actions had a catastrophic effect on his wife's life including her loss of her ability to practise.  
The attitude of the Law Society
60When this matter was called on before the Court of Appeal, McColl JA brought to the attention of Mr Griffin the views of Young JA expressed in Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales v P [2003] NSWCA 320 at [27] suggesting that in the case such as this the Law Society should present its considered views to the Court as to whether the practitioner is a fit and proper person to remain on the roll.  Mr Griffin informed the Court of Appeal that ""in broad terms"" the Law Society was ""supporting this application to strike off and... were adjourning their proceedings [in the Administrative Decisions Tribunal] pending the decision of this Court.""  I am not aware of the material that was available to the Law Society although I assume that it did not include Dr Westmore's report.  In the result, I think it right to act on the basis that the Society has indicated its support for the action taken by the Prothonotary, although that it has not seen fit to make a substantive submission as to the material considerations rather limits the utility of this expression of opinion.  Furthermore, its attitude may well have been affected by the allegation as to misinforming the Commissioner, which, as stated above, is not, in my view, of any significance.  
Discussion
61Firstly, for the reasons given, I think that complaint about the communication with the Commissioner should be dismissed.
62A careful consideration of the medical evidence leads me to conclude - and I think this is consistent with the view expressed by the sentencing judge - that, were it not for the combination of his addictions with his mood disorder and excessive drinking, it is likely that Mr Fitzsimons would not have committed the misconduct that gave rise to the offences and thus his convictions.  However, the misappropriations were repeated over some years in very substantial amounts by methods that, if not complicated, nevertheless required a not insubstantial degree of planning.  Moreover, there were also methodical attempts to cover up at least one of them. Despite Mr Fitzsimons' tragic mental illness that was, I would accept, playing a significant role in his behaviour, these crimes necessarily involved a significant degree of moral turpitude.  
63There can be no doubt that the conduct involved in each of the offences for which he was convicted constituted serious professional misconduct.  To adopt the language of Clarke JA in Nash v Law Society of New South Wales [1988] NSWCA 100 at 7, ""the illness stands in mitigation, and in partial explanation, of those breaches.""  To these matters I feel impelled to add the failure to report, when he was in a fit state to do so, his actions to the Law Society.  Accordingly, the declaration as to professional misconduct should be made.  
64It does not follow that the declaration as to fitness and the order for removal should be made. This depends on Mr Fitzsimons' present fitness to remain on the roll.  I am not in any sense called upon to punish Mr Fitzsimons.  The jurisdiction being exercised by the Court is protective.  Of course, the past misconduct may demonstrate that he ""lacks the qualities of character and trustworthiness which are the necessary attributes of a person entrusted with the responsibilities of a legal practitioner"": Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales v Farran [2003] NSWCA 372 per Giles JA at [14] citing In Re a Practitioner (1984) 36 SASR 590 at 591; Council of the Law Society of New South Wales v A Solicitor [2002] NSWCA 62 at [89], [113], [125].  His Honour went on to say - 
""But if, for example, the past conduct is sufficiently explained as the product of psychiatric illness now controlled by medication, it may be that the protective function of the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction is met by less than unalloyed unfitness and removal..."" 
Giles JA noted that although the reports were not uniform, there was agreement that the practitioner's bipolar disorder in that case contributed to his misconduct, with different emphases on the extent of contribution.  In the result, however, Giles JA concluded that ""absent more full assurance that the opponent's misconduct was attributable to psychiatric illness and will not recur"" and in light of the fact that the practitioner had not appeared and contended for a regime by which he could remain on the roll subject to supervision and medical monitoring, the declaration as to unfitness and the order for removal should be made.  It appears that the practitioner's condition was ""on the milder end of the spectrum"" as he recovered without treatment with mood stabilising medication at any stage.  
Conclusion
65I accept that the present state of Mr Fitzsimons' mental condition means that it is unlikely to have an adverse effect on his conduct.  He is to be commended also for successfully dealing with his gambling addiction and alcohol abuse for something over six years, despite short term relapses when he has gone off his medication.  However, in light of the lack of satisfactory explanation of and justification for his omission to report to the Law Society as mentioned above, I am not satisfied that Mr Fitzsimons' mental condition was such as to excuse, in a professional sense, his misconduct.  
66Taking up the issues referred to in McBride, the misconduct can be satisfactorily explained only to some, though a significant, extent as an error of judgment warped by his mental illness, rather than a defect of character; the intrinsic seriousness of the misconduct directly impinges on his fitness to practise law, since it arose in the context of doing so; the misconduct was not an isolated episode but it was to some extent atypical or uncharacteristic of the practitioner's normal qualities of character, given the his mental illness;  the motivation which gave rise to the misconduct, except for the non-reporting, was the addictive need to gamble, to a significant degree exacerbated by his mental illness; the underlying qualities of character shown by previous and other conduct were basically sound, except for the moral turpitude demonstrated over a number of years not only by the defalcations themselves but also by his failure to report them;  in respect of the practitioner's conduct post the misconduct, he has succeeded in dealing with his gambling and alcohol addictions, has shown genuine remorse and contrition, and has repaid with substantial difficulty the persons from whom he stole. 
67The overall effect of the evidence, both favourable and adverse, has persuaded me that Mr Fitzsimons now is very different from the person he was when he committed his criminal offences, both in terms of his mental health and, more significantly, in his moral character.  Weighing up all these considerations, I have concluded (adapting the language of Giles JA in Farran, cited above) that, although not all ""of his past conduct is sufficiently explained as the product of psychiatric illness now controlled by medication, it may be that the protective function of the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction is met by less than unalloyed unfitness and removal"".
68I make the following declarations - 
(1)The respondent is guilty of professional misconduct.
(2)At the time of the commission of the misconduct particularised in paragraph 1 (a) of the summons the respondent was not a person of good fame and character.
(3)I decline to make the declaration that the respondent is not a fit and proper person to remain on the local roll of lawyers of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
    (4)    The respondent must pay the applicant's costs.

69I am minded to make an additional declaration to the following effect -
Mr Fitzsimons is not fit to practise as a sole practitioner or in partnership or as a solicitor having access to a trust account and that any practising certificate be subject to the conditions that he continue to remain under the care of a general practitioner and any specialist whom that practitioner may refer him and comply with any regime of treatment or medication prescribed for him, including undertaking of any tests as directed.  He is to give written authority to his medical practitioners to provide progress reports to the Law Society when requested to do so.
Before doing so, I invite the parties to provide written submissions within seven days as to whether such a declaration can be and, if so, in what form it should be made.

2758919,R v White & ors (No 7) [2012] NSWSC 471,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  This is an application by the accused Birkensleigh that evidence of certain post-offence conduct be excluded.  The application is made, first, on the basis that the evidence is irrelevant, and secondly, in the alternative, on the basis that, if relevant, the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by unfair prejudice: s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995.
2The Crown case, very broadly, is that the accused White murdered the deceased in the course of carrying out what might colloquially be known as a drug rip-off.  It is contended that the deceased was robbed of a substantial quantity of the drug known as speed.
3The Crown case, insofar as the accused Birkensleigh is concerned is that she was an accessory before the fact to robbery and that she was an accessory after the fact to murder.  In relation to the robbery, the Crown contends that she was on notice of the proposal to rob the deceased and rendered assistance to the accused White, in particular by purchasing cable ties and probably duct tape that were used by the accused White in binding and gagging the deceased at the time of the robbery.  The deceased was left in the location where that occurred and, if not dead at the time, subsequently passed away.
4The Crown case is that the accused White and the accused Birkensleigh were in a relationship.  It was their plan to move to Victoria to establish a new life and the robbery of the deceased was for the purpose of obtaining funds to finance this plan.
5The evidence in question on this application concerns expenditure by the accused White and the accused Birkensleigh in Victoria.  Almost immediately after the robbery and murder of the deceased, the accused Birkensleigh flew to Victoria and not long afterwards the accused White made his way there.
6The evidence of expenditure by these two accused in Victoria is to be found in a bundle of statements which was identified by the Crown Prosecutor during the course of his submissions.  Copies were provided which I have read.  There is a useful summary of the effect of that evidence in the statement of Detective Acting Sergeant Timothy Peck of 1 April 2010.  At pages 6 and 7 he summarises the transactions made by the two accused which indicates some 15 transactions that occurred between January 2009 - I interpolate, not long after the robbery/murder - and 3 August 2009.  Together with a sum of cash found at the time of the arrest of the accused, they total $157,653.70.  They relate to the purchases of a speed boat, a caravan, various motor vehicles, accommodation, the deposit on a block of land and other items.  
7Banking records were also provided in affidavits identified by the Crown Prosecutor in support of the proposition that the funding for the expenditure has no apparent legitimate source and supports the inference that it was from the proceeds of the robbery.
8The deceased was robbed of drugs and not money.  There is evidence in the trial from the witness Peter Elefsen that he saw the accused White in possession of drugs on the evening of the day following the alleged offences.  It was his evidence (T345) that there were three cryovac packages each containing ""a pound of speed"".  His evidence was that Mr White said that he was going to get another powder to cut the speed so as to convert each one pound block into five pounds.  He said the accused White said that each block of speed was pure and that what he saw of the drug in the cryovac bags was red in colour.
9There is evidence proposed to be led in the trial from a Detective Sergeant Stephen Yapp who is said to be an expert in drug matters.  The effect of his evidence will be that a quantity of 70 grams of drug found upon the arrest of the accused, which was found by an analyst to be 14 percent pure, if converted back in a reverse manner to that allegedly described by the accused White to the witness Elefsen, it could have been from a primary source of 70 percent purity.  That is, broadly speaking, about as pure as methylamphetamine gets.
10Detective Yapp speaks of there being five pounds of the drug in single pound blocks, whereas the witness Elefsen speaks of three one-pound blocks, but on any view of the matter the potential value of the drug stolen from the deceased, if the valuations and calculations of Detective Yapp are accepted by the jury, is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
11The Crown will seek to link the drug found upon the arrest of the accused with the drugs stolen from the deceased through the evidence of Detective Yapp, particularly as to the purities, and also by the description of the drug.  The analyst's certificate in respect of the drug found on the arrest of the accused indicates that the drug was ""red powder"".  Mr Elefsen agreed in his evidence (T345) that the drug he saw in the possession of the accused White was red in colour.  A witness, Simone Chaloub, will give evidence of seeing drugs in the possession of the accused White and the accused Birkensleigh in Melbourne in April 2009 which she described as ""red ice"".  So from that evidence the Crown contends that the drug found upon the arrest of the accused was residue from the drugs stolen from the deceased.  The Crown will contend that the majority of the drug stolen from the deceased had been cut and sold, and was the source of the money used in relation to the expenditure summarised in the statement of Detective Peck.
12The vast majority of the purchases in question were made by the accused White and the accused Birkensleigh with the use of false names.  The objection extends to both the evidence of the making of the purchases and the evidence that they were made with the use of false names.  However, Mr Johnston indicated that the two are bound together; in other words, it is all or nothing.
13Mr Johnston's objection was first as to relevance as I have indicated.  It was his submission that there was an insufficient connection, or no connection, between the money used in the various transactions and the robbery of the deceased.  It was also submitted that there was no evidence that the accused Birkensleigh herself was in possession of large sums of cash.  The evidence showed that the accused White had the ability to have large sums of cash available to him through his activities as a drug dealer, and also through his activities in the purchase and sale of motor vehicles.
14As I understand it, it was suggested that even if I came to the view that the evidence was relevant, its probative value was outweighed by unfair prejudice because the link between the expenditure and the robbery of the deceased, even if potentially in existence, was so tenuous and it would be outweighed by the danger of the jury misusing the evidence by giving it a weight it did not deserve or that was not warranted on the evidence.  
15It was submitted that there were a number of alternative explanations for the source of the money and for the use of false names.  As to the latter, Mr Johnston had difficulty suggesting an alternative explanation without further evidence that may be forthcoming in the trial.  
16I have come to the view that the evidence is relevant.  There is a sufficient link between the drugs found upon the arrest of the accused with the drugs alleged to have been stolen from the deceased.  It is a matter for the jury whether they find that link is established, but in my view it is open to the jury to draw that link.
17If the jury does conclude that some of the drugs stolen from the deceased were still in the hands of the accused in September 2009, it could also conclude that there had been a sale of the majority of the drugs stolen from the deceased over the course of the nine months between the two events.  If the jury accept the evidence as to the quantities and value of the drug, it would be open to the jury to find that the expenditure was funded by those drug sales.
18Accordingly, the evidence is relevant to the involvement of both of the accused White and Birkensleigh in the robbery.  I doubt that the evidence says much, if anything, about the culpability of the accused Birkensleigh for the accessory after the fact to murder charge, but that is not determinative.  If it has relevance to one of the alleged offences, that is sufficient.  
19I am not persuaded that there is any danger of unfair prejudice.  It is not the case that there is said to be some embarrassment for the accused Birkensleigh in providing an explanation for the drugs found upon her arrest or for the money used to fund the various purchases. Indeed, there was no suggestion of there being some realistic competing inference that could be drawn for the presence of a red coloured quantity of methylamphetamine at the time of arrest (that is, it was acquired other than from the deceased).  Further, there was no suggestion of there being some realistic competing inference that could be drawn for the accused having the ability to fund purchases in the order of over $150,000 in a nine month period.  The submission that the jury might give more weight to the evidence than is warranted is not accepted.  The jury will either accept the probative value of the evidence in the manner for which the Crown contends or it will not.  The only prejudice that there seems to be is that the evidence is probative of the accused's guilt.  That is not ""unfair prejudice"".
20If there does appear to be any danger of the jury misusing the evidence by the time all the evidence is in, I will hear counsel further as to any directions that I should give to the jury to guard against any impermissible process of reasoning that is potentially available.
21To conclude, I am satisfied that the evidence is relevant in the sense that that term is defined in the Evidence Act.  I am satisfied there is no danger of the probative value being outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice.  
22The evidence is admissible.

		09 May 2012",2012-03-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758920,R v White & ors (No 4) [2012] NSWSC 468,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  An issue in this trial is a contention by the Crown that the accused White was in possession of a substantial quantity of drugs after the robbery and murder of the deceased.  It is the Crown case that the deceased was killed in the course of a drug ""rip off"".
2This morning, Mr Bodor QC on behalf of the accused White made an application for the discharge of the jury.  He indicated that this related to him having been informed yesterday that the Crown was to call to give evidence one Wayne Hedley.  Mr Bodor indicated that he enquired of the Crown Prosecutor why that witness was being called, he being of the view that there was nothing significant in his evidence, whereupon he was informed that, in the Crown's view, the evidence was of significance.
3The Crown Prosecutor opened on the evidence of Mr Hedley but Mr Bodor said that it did not dawn on him what the evidence was or what significance it had.
4Yesterday Mr Bodor was provided with a copy of the transcript of an interview by police with Mr Hedley on 1 March 2010 and this morning he was provided with a recording of that interview.  The actual recording is said to be significant because it appears that Mr Hedley demonstrated physically to the police in that interview the size of packages of drugs that he said that he saw Mr White in possession of.
5Mr Hedley had also made a statement to the police on a previous occasion, that is on 12 March 2009, which was largely a non-event; it was not a complete and truthful account.  Mr Bodor was in possession of that statement, prior to the trial as I understand it, but I accept that, looking at that statement, there was little need for defence representatives to be concerned about the evidence within it.
6It was submitted that Mr Hedley's evidence as disclosed in the subsequent interview of 1 March 2010 was somewhat consistent and somewhat inconsistent with the evidence of Mr Peter Elefsen, which is already before the jury, as to drugs which he claimed were in the accused White's possession, both in terms of quantity and packaging. 
7It was submitted by Mr Bodor that he would have given different advice, and the instructions he received in response may have been different, if he had been aware of the evidence disclosed in the 1 March 2010 interview of Mr Hedley.  As a consequence, this may have resulted in Mr Bodor taking an entirely different approach in the cross-examination of Mr Elefsen.
8Mr Bodor is in a difficult position in that his instructing solicitor is not present here in Lismore.  Mr Bodor has the assistance of a clerk from his solicitor's firm.  Mr Goold, who is the solicitor, is arranging to attend and it is proposed that he and counsel will attend upon Mr White at Grafton gaol on the weekend to provide advice and obtain instructions in relation to Mr Hedley's evidence.
9Mr Elefsen is required for further cross-examination by Mr Bodor in relation to other matters.  As I understand the position, there would be some embarrassment if it were also necessary to further cross-examine Mr Elefsen in relation to drugs that he claimed were in Mr White's possession in a manner that was different to the cross-examination that had already been conducted. The cross-examination to date has generally been to the effect of suggesting that Mr Elefsen was wrong in his claims as to the quantity and the packaging of drugs that were in the accused White's possession.  It was suggested, speaking generally, that the quantity was dramatically less than Mr Elefsen had asserted.  
10The submission was made that there is now prejudice in making, on behalf of the accused White, a coherent attack on the prosecution evidence as to Mr White's possession of drugs.  
11Finally, it was submitted that, whilst this is day 13 of the trial, not every day has been fully utilised and the actual sitting time is more in the order of six days and if the trial were to restart, having had the experience of the evidence to date, the cross-examination might be more efficient and even less time would be required.  In effect, as I understand the submission, it was being put that there was no great loss of time and utilisation of resources if the application was to be granted and the trial was to restart.
12For the Crown, it was said that there was no dispute as to the significance of Mr Hedley's evidence in the way that Mr Bodor had described it.  The Crown Prosecutor submitted that Mr Hedley's evidence ties in with that of Mr Elefsen and also, to a lesser degree of significance, with evidence given by Mr Alan Waters.  The Crown submitted that it is important evidence in going to the motive for the robbery and killing of the deceased.  It was also said to be significant that apparently Mr Hedley, Mr Elefsen and Mr Waters did not know each other and they each give evidence about drugs in the possession of Mr White.
13The Crown Prosecutor indicated that it was solely because of oversight that the transcript of Mr Hedley's interview on 1 March 2010 was not served until yesterday, but he pointed to the fact that the prosecution brief is in excess of three and a half thousand pages contained in about 17 folders, and that to some degree explains how such an oversight could occur.
14The Crown served an index to the prosecution brief on the defence solicitors on 24 February 2012, including a reference to Mr Hedley's interview, apparently as a precaution to ensure that the defence representatives would check that they were in possession of everything within the prosecution brief.  So it was suggested that whilst there was error in not serving the transcript of Mr Hedley's interview, the blame was not entirely with the prosecution.  I interpolate at this point that I am not concerned with any matter of blame.  The primary issue is, as I indicated during the course of submissions, the significance of the proposed evidence of Mr Hedley. 
15As to Mr White's instructions, it was the Crown Prosecutor's submission that it was Mr White's choice as to what instructions he gave.  In effect, it was suggested that the instructions he gave should not be dependent upon what he thinks the evidence for the Crown would be.  I interpolate the observation at this point that the instructions that are provided by an accused to his legal representatives are often given in the light of advice given by counsel and that counsel can only give advice based upon his or her understanding of the case for the Crown, and that is, as I understand it, the position suggested by Mr Bodor.
16The Crown indicated that Mr Hedley would not be called before next Monday, which would allow time for Mr White to consult with his legal representatives and to provide instructions. 
17Mr Elefsen is available for recall and Mr Waters will be made available for recall if required.
18Mr Walmsley SC for the co-accused Serone opposed the application.  He made some observations about the impact upon his client having to restart the trial, which I note.  He also suggested that Mr Bodor has five days to deal with the problems that he has ventilated.  Mr Walmsley made the observation that at this point they are only put in terms of being potential problems.
19The statement and the interview of Mr Hedley are exhibits 1 and 2 on the application.  I have taken the time this morning to read them.  In the statement of 12 March 2009 there is no mention at all of Mr Hedley seeing the accused White in possession of any drugs and there is no mention of a number of other events which are later disclosed in the 1 March 2010 interview.  Mr Hedley explained in the interview that he did not disclose everything in the statement out of fear of retribution.  He claimed to be providing a full and accurate account of evidence he was able to give in the interview.  
20The interview includes an account of seeing Mr White in possession of, and using, drugs at Mr Elefsen's home; on that occasion the drugs were sourced from what he described as a little plastic bag.  But on a subsequent day, I think it was suggested to be 20 December 2008, Mr Hedley said that he drove the accused White to Tamworth and dropped him off at a friend's place and there at that friend's place he saw Mr White in possession of drugs.  He described seeing a ""big, flat, brick-type compressed thing"", (question 115).  He described, ""Kilo packages"" (question 222).  He said there were ""two of them"", (questions 223 and 227).  He said, ""They were wrapped in clear plastic,"" (question 224), and he later reiterated that there were ""two one kilo packages"", (question 348).  That evidence is not entirely consistent, but is broadly so, with the evidence of Mr Elefsen.
21The index that the Crown sent to the defence representatives prior to the trial included reference, not only to Mr Hedley's statement but to his interview as well.  The page numbering that was included in that index would have made it apparent to a careful reader of the document that the transcript of the interview was lengthy.  It is, in fact, 56 pages. 
22The Crown Prosecutor opened on the evidence of Mr Hedley in these terms, and I quote from page 43 of the transcript.  After referring to Mr Hedley giving the accused White a lift to a friend's place in Tamworth, he said:
""While at those premises having a cup of tea, Mr Hedley saw the accused was in possession of two packages.  He described those packages as being similar to bricks.  Hedley in fact says they looked like the normal drug packages that you see on TV.  The accused White offered Hedley something from one of the packages, that is something Hedley described as a crystal sort of stuff in the bottom of a plastic sandwich bag.  Mr Hedley refused the offer of the crystalline substance and after about half an hour Mr Hedley left.""
23That, clearly, is material sourced not from the initial statement made by Mr Hedley but from the 1 March 2010 interview.  It is, with respect, difficult to see how that could not be regarded as evidence of some significance.  It is evidence similar to that which was anticipated to be given by Mr Elefsen.  
24This is not a case of completely new material being disclosed by the Crown midway through the trial.  It is disclosure of evidence that is, in practical terms, the same as that which has already been led before the jury.  It is simply that the same type of evidence is coming from an additional source.  
25The existence of the evidence was implicitly disclosed by a service of the index to the brief.  It was explicitly disclosed in the Crown's opening address.  Whether it will, in reality, have any prejudicial impact upon the presentation of the case for the accused White is, in my view, at the moment speculative.  
26I am not persuaded that sufficient prejudice has been established to warrant discharging the jury. 27The application is refused.

		09 May 2012",2012-03-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758945,R v Mauger [2012] NSWCCA 51,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Harrison J.
2HARRISON J: The Crown appeals pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a sentence imposed upon the respondent by her Honour English DCJ in the Sydney District Court on 23 November 2011. The respondent pleaded guilty to supplying 5.13g, or 20 tablets, of 3,4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine or ecstasy contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. A charge of possessing 3.1g of cannabis was taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The amount of ecstasy was four times the indictable quantity but less than the commercial quantity. The offence could therefore not be dealt with summarily. The maximum penalty is 15 years imprisonment.
3Her Honour dismissed the charge without recording a conviction pursuant to s 10 of the Sentencing Procedure Act and ordered the respondent to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of two years. The Crown relies upon the following grounds of appeal:
Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in finding that:
(a) the respondent's mental condition was such that his judgment was impaired; and
(b) the respondent would suffer adverse consequences to his employment and his ability to travel overseas if a conviction was recorded.
Ground 2: The sentence is manifestly inadequate.
4For the reasons that follow, I consider that the appeal should be dismissed.
Background
5On Saturday 19 February 2011 the respondent, who was then 32 years old, attended the Playground Weekender music festival at Wisemans Ferry. He was in possession of 20 ecstasy tablets and a small amount of cannabis. These were detected by a police dog. The respondent was arrested. He admitted possession of these drugs and that he intended to take two tablets himself and give the balance to friends over the course of the weekend. The cannabis was said to be primarily for his own use. The respondent had paid $800 for the ecstasy. He told police that he had not discussed the subject of whether of not he would be paid for the tablets supplied to his friends.
Proceedings on sentence
6The respondent gave evidence. He said that he was employed by Perpetual Limited as a senior analyst. He regularly travelled to the United States of America for work. He had not told his employer about the charges because he was concerned about the ramifications. The respondent said that he was not a regular drug user and expressed shame and remorse for his offending.
7The respondent was uncontroversially accepted to be a person with a low risk of re-offending.
8The respondent's contract of employment was tendered and provided relevantly that his employer could terminate his employment if he was ""charged with a criminal offence which in [the employer's] reasonable opinion may negatively impact upon [his] ability to perform [his] duties or may negatively impact upon [his employer's] reputation"". Evidence also indicated that entry into Canada may be prohibited to a person who had committed or who had been convicted of a criminal offence.
9The respondent relied upon an assessment of his psychological condition from Mr Borenstein who noted that prior to the commission of the offences the respondent had been in a ""regressive psychological state"" caused by the recent break-up of a long-term relationship and the commencement of a new one with another woman. Mr Borenstein noted that the respondent had sought escape and considered using drugs with new friends would provide it. Mr Borenstein opined that the respondent's prospect of reoffending was ""as close to nil as it is possible to predict"".
Subjective features
10The respondent has no criminal antecedents. He is from a stable upbringing in a loving family. He has a B Comm from the University of Auckland and has almost completed a Masters Degree in Applied Finance at Macquarie University. He is employed in a senior role on a salary of approximately $300,000 per annum. He is not a regular drug user. He has been a committed supporter of various charities for many years and was very active in assisting Samoan villagers affected by the 2010 tsunami. Character references suggested that the offences were very much out of character.
Remarks on sentence
11Her Honour recited the respondent's very positive subjective case. Her Honour found that at the time of the offences the respondent was acting from a ""regressed psychological state which impaired his thinking and cloud[ed] his judgment"". Her Honour accepted that the respondent was truly remorseful and that he had excellent prospects for rehabilitation. He was found to be highly unlikely to re-offend. Her Honour acknowledged that his actions carried with them the possible consequence that his career could be destroyed and that his ability to travel overseas could be severely restricted.
12Her Honour afforded the respondent a 25 percent discount for his early guilty plea and noted that the objective seriousness of the offence was at the ""very lowest end of the scale"". He was not an addict and had not intended to profit from what he did. Her Honour observed that considerations of general deterrence ordinarily attracted custodial sentences for offences of this nature. Statistically there were at least 19 comparable offenders who had no conviction recorded pursuant to s 10.
13In relation to the decision to dismiss the charges and not record a conviction her Honour noted the respondent's relatively young age and his mental state, which her Honour described as ""not extenuating"" but ""certainly not usual"". Her Honour emphasised that the consequences of the recording of a conviction for the offence ""far outweighed the seriousness of the offence committed"" and her Honour took into account the nature of the offence and the respondent's ""otherwise outstanding qualities"".
Legislation
14Section 10 of the Sentencing Procedure Act provides relevantly as follows:
""10 Dismissal of charges and conditional discharge of offender 
(1) Without proceeding to conviction, a court that finds a person guilty of an offence may make any one of the following orders: 
(a) an order directing that the relevant charge be dismissed, 
(b) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding 2 years, 
(c) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into an agreement to participate in an intervention program and to comply with any intervention plan arising out of the program. 
(2) An order referred to in subsection (1) (b) may be made if the court is satisfied: 
(a) that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment (other than nominal punishment) on the person, or 
(b) that it is expedient to release the person on a good behaviour bond. ...
(3) In deciding whether to make an order referred to in subsection (1), the court is to have regard to the following factors: 
(a) the person's character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition, 
(b) the trivial nature of the offence, 
(c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed, 
(d) any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider.""
15Section 12 of the Criminal Records Act 1991 provides as follows:
""12 What are the consequences of a conviction becoming spent? 
If a conviction of a person is spent: 
(a) the person is not required to disclose to any other person for any purpose information concerning the spent conviction, and 
(b) a question concerning the person's criminal history is taken to refer only to any convictions of the person which are not spent, and 
(c) in the application to the person of a provision of an Act or statutory instrument: 
(i) a reference in the provision to a conviction is taken to be a reference only to any convictions of the person which are not spent, and 
(ii) a reference in the provision to the person's character or fitness is not to be interpreted as permitting or requiring account to be taken of spent convictions.""
Applicable principles
Crown Appeals
16The Crown acknowledged that the primary purpose of a Crown appeal against sentence was to lay down general principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons and that the Court had a residual discretion in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence was erroneously lenient: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 283 ALR 1 at [1].
17In order to succeed on ground 1 of this appeal, the Crown had to establish that the sentencing judge's fact findings were not open on the evidence or that error is shown in the sense referred to in House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-5; SBF v R [2009] NSWCCA 231; (2009) 198 A Crim R 219 at [75]. In order to succeed on ground 2 of this appeal the Crown had to demonstrate error in sentencing in the sense discussed in House v R and Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [3], [58]. By asserting manifest inadequacy, the Crown contends that the sentencing judge's orders were unreasonable or plainly unjust. In such circumstances intervention is warranted only if this Court considers that in all of the circumstances there was some misapplication of principle even though it may not be specifically identifiable in the statement of reasons: see Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [59]; Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [58]; Dinsdale v The Queen at [58].
Section 10 bonds
18Section 10 and its predecessors reflect the willingness of the legislature and the community to provide offenders with an opportunity in certain circumstances to maintain a reputation of good character and to avoid the otherwise rigid application of inexorable laws: Cobiac v Liddy (1969) 119 CLR 257 at 269; R v Nguyen [2002] NSWCCA 183 at [50].
19Where the offence that is committed is an objectively serious one and where general deterrence and denunciation are important factors in sentencing for that offence, the scope of the operation of the section decreases. The section must operate in the context of the general principle that the penalty imposed for any offence should reflect the objective seriousness of that offence: Application by the Attorney General under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a Guideline Judgment Concerning the Offence of High Range Prescribed Concentration of Alcohol Under Section 9(4) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (No. 3 of 2002) [2004] NSWCCA 303; 61 NSWLR 305. However, the focus must be on the particular conduct of the offender and the circumstances of the offending rather than the nature of the offence: Walden v Hensler [1987] HCA 54; (1987) 163 CLR 561 at 577.
20In Re Attorney-General's Application under s 37 at [132], Howie J said this:""[132]... The section must operate in the context of the general principle that the penalty imposed for any offence should reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed. To recognise this fact is not to impose an undue restriction upon the section or to change the criteria for its operation on an offence by offence basis. Such an approach would clearly be erroneous. It is simply to apply normal sentencing principles to the offence under consideration. However, just as the discretion inherent in the section cannot be limited by the application of some overreaching general principle, neither can it be broadened simply because a court does not agree with Parliament's view of the seriousness of a particular offence or believes that in general the penalties imposed under the scheme of the legislation are unduly harsh or unpalatable.""
21Considerations of extra curial punishment may be relevant to the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 10: see R v KNL [2005] NSWCCA 260; (2005) 154 A Crim R 268 at [49] - [50]; R v TMTW [2008] NSWCCA 50 at [52]. However, it is not proper to dismiss a charge without conviction merely to avoid the operation of some other legislative provision that is otherwise applicable: R v Fing (unreported NSWCCA 25 July 1994); R v Stephenson [2010] NSWSC 779 at [66].
Consideration
22Her Honour found that the respondent's regressive psychological state ""impaired [his] thinking and clouded his judgment"". Her Honour held that his mental state was such that ""his otherwise good judgment was clouded to such a degree that he allowed himself to engage in this criminal conduct"".
23Mr Borenstein's reference to the respondent's regressive psychological state contained no comment about whether his ability to think had been impaired or his judgment had been clouded. On the contrary, Mr Borenstein set out in some detail the respondent's thoughts leading up to the offence, including that he had had a tough year at work, had recently broken up with his girlfriend and ""wanted to make the last days of summer feel like freedom"".
24The respondent gave evidence that he dabbled in illicit drugs and that he knew he was purchasing illegal drugs for the group. He said that he felt he had missed out on the festival experience because he had been working so hard and that he ""needed a blow out"". The weekend was to be a ""release valve"". He also agreed that he was trying to ingratiate himself with new friends by supplying the tablets.
25There is no other material to suggest that the respondent's thinking was impaired. The Crown submitted that the offences demonstrated ""a fairly high degree of planning"", to the extent that he worked out how much he needed to supply the whole group and purchased the tablets in advance. Far from suggesting that he was impaired in his judgment, the respondent's evidence suggests a single minded clarity of thought. It is difficult to discern the precise evidentiary basis for her Honour's findings about the respondent's mental state and in my opinion her Honour must have misconstrued the facts to reach her conclusion. In doing so she fell into error.
26Her Honour's decision not to record a conviction would also appear to have been influenced by what she described as ""the consequences of the recording of a conviction"". That was a reference to the possibility that the respondent might lose his job and be prevented from travelling overseas. Her Honour appears to have assumed that by granting the respondent a 27s 10 bond and not recording a conviction, the respondent would not suffer negative consequences in either respect. The Crown contended that no such assumption was correct.
27So far as his employment was concerned, the Crown emphasised that it was the fact of being charged with a criminal offence that attracted the prospect of the termination of his employment. The recording of a conviction was said in those circumstances to have no bearing on any difficulty that was or that may have been created by the singular fact of being charged.
28I do not agree. The obligation to reveal the existence of a conviction arises in common experience from time to time. It is not to the point that the respondent's employer in this case reserved to itself a discretion to take certain steps concerning the respondent if he had been ""charged"" with an offence. That reservation logically suggests that the employer treated the fact of being charged as a serious matter, so that in all likelihood it would consider a conviction for an offence to be more serious. It is not the case that being charged ""leads"" automatically to dismissal. The respondent's employer may terminate his employment if charged with a criminal offence that the employer reasonably opined may negatively impact upon his ability to perform his duties or upon the employer's reputation. It is not difficult to imagine a circumstance where the fact of a charge unaccompanied by a conviction would not trouble a reasonable employer but where in contrast the fact of a conviction may do so. In my opinion the prospect that a conviction for this offence could have possibly detrimental consequences for the respondent's employment was definitively something that her Honour was entitled to take into account and that was proper for the Court to consider pursuant to s 10(3)(d) of the Act when deciding whether or not to make an order pursuant to s 10(1) of the Act.
29So far as his travel was concerned, the respondent gave evidence that during the previous five years he had travelled to the USA on work-related trips five or six times and was required to travel regularly. The respondent led no evidence about what, if any, restrictions applied for anyone wanting to travel to the USA who had been charged with or convicted of a criminal offence.
30The Crown pointed out that there was authority for the proposition that the existence and terms of entry restrictions imposed by foreign countries on international visitors was not an appropriate matter for judicial notice: United States Surgical Corporation v Hospital Products International [1982] 2 NSWLR 766 at 801. Despite this, and the sparse state of the evidence on the topic, her Honour found that the ""consequences of his actions have the capacity to destroy his career and to prevent him from travelling overseas"". The Crown contended that the nature or extent of any restrictions upon the respondent's ability to travel to the USA were not supported by the evidence and his ability to travel to other counties was irrelevant and should have been given no, or very little, weight.
31I agree. It does not seem to me that generalised prognostications about the respondent's ability to travel overseas unsupported by clear evidence could properly be matters that fell within what is contemplated by the words ""any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider"". It may be different if the sentencing judge were confronted with evidence to suggest that a particular offender faced the loss of his livelihood as the result of travel restrictions upon convicted persons, or that he faced the prosect of the loss of the ability to visit, or return to, family overseas, in which circumstances some definite and enduring hardship or disruption could be demonstrated or confidently predicted. This is not the case here. In my view her Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried to the extent that she proceeded to a conclusion that no conviction should be recorded in a way that was based on such matters.
32I am not, however, of the view that her Honour's decision to record no conviction and to place the respondent on a s 10 bond was a manifestly inadequate result to this sentencing exercise.
33The Crown contended that her Honour's sentence does not properly reflect the multiple objectives of sentencing described in s 3A of the Sentencing Procedure Act. That section provides as follows:
""3A Purposes of sentencing 
The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows: 
(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
(c) to protect the community from the offender, 
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community. ""
34The respondent is undeniably a person of good character with no criminal antecedents. I accept that his age is for all present purposes irrelevant. His health and medical condition are also of little if any present relevance. Nor are there any extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed. Although minds may differ on the question, it is also not correct to characterise the offence as trivial. So much is apparent from the maximum penalty that applies to it.
35It is instructive to observe that the appropriate penalty for which the Crown contends in this case is the imposition of a s 9 bond. Section 9 of the Sentencing Procedure Act is relevantly as follows:
""9 Good behaviour bonds 
(1) Instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment on an offender, a court may make an order directing the offender to enter into a good behaviour bond for a specified term. 
(2) The term of a good behaviour bond must not exceed 5 years. 
(3)...""
36In this case her Honour ordered that the respondent enter into a bond for a period of two years to be of good behaviour and to come before the Court if called upon to do so. I take it to be the Crown's position that the terms of the bond that should be imposed pursuant to s 9 would be exactly the same. Upon that assumption, the only difference between the Crown and the view taken by her Honour is the fact of the recording of a conviction. It is implicit in the position taken by the Crown that the recording of a conviction is a matter of special significance or importance in this case.
37Whilst that contention is understandable as a general proposition, it is important that it not be permitted in this case to dilute or to downgrade the significance of the imposition of a bond. If the seriousness of the present offence and the need for denunciation and general deterrence are important considerations, they are to my mind more than adequately contemplated in this case by both the terms and the duration of the bond that has been imposed. The respondent has been made subject to a judicially sanctioned requirement that he be of good behaviour for a period of two years. There are onerous consequences that apply if he fails to observe that requirement. That fact alone would in my view impress the seriousness with which the Court was treating the respondent's conduct upon an objective and reasonable member of the community. It should not pass without comment that the significance of a bond, and the consequences of disregarding its conditions, is regularly considered by this Court to be important when deciding whether or not to grant bail to applicants who have allegedly disregarded the conditions and restrictions that a bond imposes. Much more than mere lip service is regularly paid in this context to the important and significant consequences for bail applications created by offences allegedly committed in breach of such conditions. It is wrong in my view to assume that the decision to not record a conviction is automatically or necessarily coextensive with the imposition of an inadequate, or even a particularly lenient, sentence.
38There seems to be little doubt that there is no strong need in this case for special deterrence. The respondent is uncontroversially regarded as a person with a very low risk of re-offending. Furthermore, this is also not one of those cases where general deterrence might be regarded as particularly important because of the notoriety of the respondent. This is to be contrasted with the recent well-publicised case of R v Wilhelm [2010] NSWSC 378 in which Howie J said this at [30]:
""[30] Deterrence is an important part of sentencing, particularly when the sentence of the offender will probably receive a degree of media interest. Therefore, he is a suitable case for general deterrence because so very frequently the Court imposes deterrent sentences upon people where that deterrence is of a theoretical nature rather than of a real effect."" [Emphasis added]
39Section 10(1) of the Act authorises the court to do one of three things. On one view of s 10(1), a court utilising this section has no ability to employ more than one of the paragraphs of the subsection, although that course is regularly taken. Indeed, her Honour in this case in terms dismissed the charge apparently pursuant to s 10(1)(a) and proceeded to discharge the respondent upon condition that he entered into a good behaviour bond apparently pursuant to s 10(1)(b). The Crown's contention in this case is based upon the assumption that the imposition of a good behaviour bond subject to conditions is not an adequate penalty, or is not adequate in the absence of the recording of a conviction. It seems to me on the contrary, in the particular circumstances of this case, to be completely adequate. In terms of the relative criminological and social consequences for the respondent on the one hand and society on the other hand, the recording of a conviction for the offence in this particular case is of little or no practical or theoretical consequence to the good order of the community but is by way of contrast potentially of great importance to the respondent. As Spigelman CJ said in R v Ingrassia (1997) 41 NSWLR 447 at 449, in a comment directed to a consideration of the impact of a conviction upon an individual offender, ""[t]he legal and social consequences of being convicted of an offence often extend beyond any penalty imposed by a Court"". 
40It goes without saying that by endorsing the use of s 9 as an alternative sentencing option in this case, the Crown tacitly recognises the importance of the imposition of a bond as an effective alternative to a sentence of imprisonment. In my view it is clear that the imposition of a bond pursuant to s 10 operates in fact, and will be perceived by the community as operating, in the same way as a bond imposed pursuant to s 9. The particular legal and social consequences for the respondent of recording a conviction against him in this case far outweigh the requirements of punishment, denunciation, or special or general deterrence. The purposes of sentencing described in s 3A of the Act are in my opinion properly and adequately achieved by the imposition of a conditional bond. It was not beyond the permissible scope of her Honour's discretion to sentence the respondent in the way that she did. This seems to be clear when one has regard to authoritative statements concerning the application of s 10 such as made by Basten JA in Hoffenberg v The District Court of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 142 at [10] as follows:
""[10] Further, to say that a court ""is to have regard to"" certain factors (see sub-s (3)), suggests that these are mandatory considerations. However, they are really conclusions reached by the court in the course of its considerations. As is clear from s 4 of the South Australian Act, a critical question for the court may be whether the nature of the offence can properly be described as ""trivial"" and whether the circumstances in which it was committed were in fact ""extenuating circumstances"". Properly understood, the court is not to ""have regard to"" those factors, but to determine whether those factors exist. Finally, it seems that these are not in truth mandatory considerations, because par (d) includes ""any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider"". It is not meaningful to make that a mandatory consideration. Again the purpose is to ensure the court considers the full range of factors it considers relevant.""
41Her Honour's sentence in this case was not manifestly inadequate.
Conclusions and orders
42In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.
43McCALLUM J: I agree with Harrison J.

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Garling J.

2R S HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Garling J and, subject to the following remarks, with his Honour's reasons.

3Although it is appropriate to recognise that the effective reduction in Mr Boyd's sentence by making the groups of sentences imposed on him concurrent is due to the combined effect of the two groups, and cannot be solely attributed to the group in respect of which the Applicant and Mr Boyd were co-offenders, I have some reservations about apportioning that concurrency as his Honour has done, and this whether the apportionment is effected on a 50/50 or some other basis.

4In Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295, the decision which established that one co-offender is entitled to argue that, on grounds of parity, he should derive benefit from considerations of totality to which another co-offender, but not the first-mentioned, is entitled (notwithstanding that other differences in circumstances are expected to be reflected in their respective sentences), Kirby J, one of the judges in the majority, said that the parity principle between co-offenders continues to apply notwithstanding the application of the totality principle to one co-offender. His Honour then based his decision on the extra imprisonment effected by the sentences being imposed for the offence common to the co-offenders - at p 343. However, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, the other members of the majority, were not so restrictive. They said, at pp 302-4, that in determining the sentences to be imposed on co-offenders, consideration should be given to all components and one should take into account the head sentences and non-parole period being imposed, the total effect of the sentences (including the earlier ones) imposed and not merely the extra imprisonment effected by those sentences. 

5Dawson and Gaudron JJ reaffirmed that for the parity principle to justify intervention, there must be a ""marked"" disparity giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance - at p 301 - and Kirby J's acceptance, at p 338, of Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 involved a similar view. 

6As Garling J has pointed out, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for four years and eight months, including a non-parole period of three years and six months while his co-offender, Mr Boyd was subjected to two sentences or groups of sentences. The first group involved imprisonment for two years and three months including non-parole periods totalling 15 months and the second group, in which Mr Boyd and the Applicant were co-offenders, involved sentences of the same length as those imposed on the Applicant. The commencing date for the second group was specified as one that was approximately five months after the commencing date of the first group, thus making the two groups of sentences overlap by 10 months. Presumably the reason for this concurrency was totality - a reason that had no relevance to the sentencing of the Applicant. 

7Considering for the moment only the non-parole periods, while the effect of making the sentences for the common offences concurrent was to increased Mr Boyd's imprisonment by two years and eight months compared with the three years and six months imposed on the Applicant, the overall result of the sentences on Mr Boyd is that he would serve three years and 11 months. If one looks at the total sentences, Mr Boyd's is five years and one month and the Applicant's four years and eight months. 

8Looking at the overall picture, I am not persuaded that there is a marked disparity.

9GARLING J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court of New South Wales by his Honour Judge King SC on 17 December 2010. 

10The applicant, Mr Jayden Rees, pleaded guilty before King DCJ to two offences. The first was an offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The second was an offence contrary to s 195(1A)(a) of the Crimes Act. 

11Both of the offences relate to an incident which occurred on 7 November 2009 when the applicant, together with Mr Reilly and Mr Boyd, broke into Club M at The Entrance on the Central Coast of New South Wales, and whilst armed, and on the premises, threatened the manager and staff, and destroyed property.

12The maximum penalty for the first offence of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act was 20 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of five years applied. 

13The maximum penalty for the offence of intentionally or recklessly destroying property in company was 6 years. No standard non-parole period applies. 

14The sentencing judge imposed a total sentence on the first count of 4 years and 8 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months, commencing on 10 November 2009, which was the date upon which the applicant was arrested and bail was refused. 

15On the second count, the judge imposed a fixed term sentence of 14 months which was entirely concurrent with the sentence on Count 1. This sentence has now expired.

16A total effective sentence imposed on the applicant was, therefore, 4 years 8 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months.

Facts

17A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered to the sentencing judge. A brief summary of these facts is set out below:

18Club M is a nightclub on The Entrance Road at The Entrance. On the night of 6 November 2009, whilst the club was still trading, the applicant and one of his two co-offenders approached the entrance of the club and attempted to gain entry. Security guards prevented them from so doing. Nothing of this incident forms part of the conduct which gave rise to the offences. 

19Shortly after 4am on Saturday 7 November 2009, Club M had finished trading when staff noticed a motor vehicle carrying the applicant and his co-offenders, who were armed, parking across the road from the club. Club staff shut the front doors of the premises which consisted of two steel-framed doors with steel panelling. They locked the padlocks located at the top and bottom of the doors. They also secured a metal door across a fire exit at the rear of the premises.

20The applicant and his two co-offenders, Mr Reilly and Mr Boyd, approached the front doors of the club. The applicant was armed with a hammer. The three co-offenders tried, initially at the front door, to break into the club unsuccessfully. They went to the rear of the premises and tried unsuccessfully to obtain entrance via the fire exit. 

21They returned to the front doors where all three began to hit and kick the doors. Eventually the three co-offenders grabbed the lower section of the door and pulled on it until the securing padlocks and lugs broke. They climbed the stairs, entering the main bar service area. The applicant was in front of his co-offenders. He swung a hammer in the direction of one of the security guards, and then swung the hammer a number of times onto the granite bench area of the bar, breaking a large corner piece of the granite at one end of the bar and causing it to crack through the width of the bar counter in another place.

22The applicant threatened the manager, who was attempting to calm the situation. The applicant obtained the use of a pole which Mr Boyd had been carrying, and struck the club manager with it. Later, the applicant armed himself with a clear glass bottle of the liqueur Galliano, and threatened the club manager with the bottle.

23Whilst this last interaction was occurring, police arrived and arrested the applicant and ultimately, both his co-offenders.

24The Crown conceded at the proceedings on sentence, that each of the offenders was well affected by alcohol at the time of the offending conduct.

25When he was first arrested on 7 November 2009, the applicant was charged with affray. He was released on bail. On 9 November 2009, police determined to upgrade the charges once they had received and reviewed the security film footage from the club. At their request, the applicant attended the police station by appointment and was charged with the new offences. It was at that point that he was arrested. He has been in custody since that time.

Applicant's submissions on sentence

26The applicant, as I have said earlier, agreed with the facts set out above. He gave evidence on sentence and tendered further material including a psychological report of Anita McGregor of Duffy Robilliard Psychologists.

Remarks on Sentence

27The sentencing judge in his careful and detailed remarks on sentence described the principal offence, against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act in the following terms, which the applicant accepts as a proper description:

""As participants in a joint criminal enterprise, each is liable for the acts of the other within the scope of the enterprise. The offending behaviour included violence and damage to property to gain entry to commercial premises specifically closed to prevent their entry. They terrorised staff and patrons after entering, although only the manager was physically assaulted. They caused damage to further property after entering, as part of the intimidation of the occupants. The offensive weapons used included a hammer, a Galliano bottle and a piece of timber or pole. 

In short, they carried out a violent invasion of commercial premises closed specifically to deny them entry, by force and damaging property in the invasion. They used offensive weapons to damage property, to effect entry, and to intimidate occupants of the premises. There was a physical assault of the manager and further damage to property after gaining entry. The offending behaviour was outrageous, and evidences a significant degree of violent criminality against property and citizens entitled to go about their lives and business free of such conduct. Offending conduct such as this significantly undermines the confidence and security of the public, whether it be in the street or in private premises, albeit a commercial operation.""

28These remarks were appropriate and are entirely justified by the agreed facts. I agree with them. 

29The trial judge found, consistently with the agreement of the Crown and counsel for the applicant, that the circumstances of the offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of the kind. 

30In respect of the offence of intentionally or recklessly destroying property in company, the sentencing judge noted that a standard non-parole period did not apply, nevertheless found that it was a serious offence, and although separate from the first count, was intrinsically bound up with the aggravated break and enter offence.

31As the applicant, and his co-offenders, had each pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, the sentencing judge allowed a discount of 25 per cent on the sentence. The Crown did not oppose this.

Grounds of Appeal

32Only one ground of appeal is relied upon by the applicant. It is this:

""The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance at the effective sentence to be served by co-offender Darren Boyd.""

Applicant's Submissions

33The applicant in his submissions to this Court conceded that:

(1)the sentencing judge correctly characterised the facts in the way described above as amounting to a violent invasion of commercial premises closed specifically to deny the applicant and his co-offenders entry;

(2)the sentencing judge correctly found that the other relevant circumstances of aggravation were that the applicant was in company with his co-offenders, he used physical violence on the manager when he struck him with a pole and that the applicant knew that there were other people in the place where the offence was committed;

(3)the sentencing judge correctly found that an aggravating feature was that the offences were committed by the applicant whilst subject to conditional liberty on three s 12 bonds;

(4)the applicant's previous criminal record was significant including the fact that he had served several periods of imprisonment for violence and had a number of convictions for break and enter offences. The applicant also concedes that he has an unsatisfactory history of behaviour whilst on supervision.

34In addition, the applicant concedes that the sentencing judge was correct to make a finding that there was no relevant difference in terms of the criminality of each of the three co-offenders and in terms of the objective seriousness of the principal offence with which they were charged. 

35In short, the applicant concedes that the sentence imposed was an appropriate one when considered in isolation, but argues that a lesser term of imprisonment is now warranted because of the effective sentence imposed on his cooffender, Mr Boyd.

36The applicant notes that a lesser sentence was imposed on the cooffender Mr Reilly because of his different, and significantly lesser, previous criminal history, but does not submit that this sentence ought be taken into account. 

37The gravamen of the applicant's submissions is that the effective term of imprisonment imposed upon the co-offender Mr Boyd was markedly less than that imposed upon the applicant and consequently that this Court should, by application of the parity principle, intervene.

Sentence Imposed on the Co-Offender

38It is necessary to examine the circumstances with respect to the sentencing of Mr Boyd. 

39Mr Boyd was not detained in custody at the same time as the applicant. He was on bail. Whilst on bail, Mr Boyd committed the further offences of affray and intimidation of a police officer on 24 July 2010. He was sentenced for those offences in the Wyong Local Court on 15 December 2010. In respect of the offence of intimidate a police officer, he received a sentence of 3 months full-time imprisonment, and in respect of the offence of affray, a total sentence of 2 years imprisonment with a 12 month non-parole period. The learned Magistrate ordered the two sentences to be entirely cumulative.

40The sentence for the Local Court offences commenced on 22 October 2010. Had there been no other offences, Mr Boyd would have been released from custody on 21 January 2012. 

41Mr Boyd lodged an appeal from the sentence for the Local Court offences alleging that they were too severe. On 18 March 2011, the learned sentencing judge heard these appeals by Mr Boyd against the severity of the Magistrate's sentence and dismissed those appeals. It was necessary for his Honour to adjust, by a couple of days, those sentences. This adjustment is irrelevant to the issues on this appeal. The learned sentencing judge then sentenced Mr Boyd in respect of the offences with which the applicant was also charged. 

42As I have earlier noted, with respect to those offences, his Honour assessed the criminality of both the applicant and Mr Boyd as being the same and he determined that precisely the same sentence should be imposed on Mr Boyd as was imposed upon the applicant. 

43King DCJ then pronounced sentence upon Mr Boyd of a total sentence of 4 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. His Honour determined that the commencement date for that sentence would be the day upon which it was imposed, namely 18 March 2011. 

44In determining that date as the date upon which the sentence would commence, his Honour took into account the sentence resulting from the Local Court offences, the appeals from which had been disposed of that day. Having regard to the principle of totality, he determined that there would be a degree of concurrency of both sentences.

45King DCJ was, when sentencing Mr Boyd, considering the totality of Mr Boyd's criminality for all of the offences, including those for which the applicant was sentenced, and so he was obliged to have regard to the totality principle of sentencing. As McHugh J said in Postiglione at 307:

""The totality principle of sentencing requires a judge who is sentencing an offender for a number of offences to ensure that the aggregation of the sentences appropriate for each offence is a just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved ...

...

The application of the totality principle therefore requires an evaluation of the overall criminality involved in all the offences with which the prisoner is charged. Where necessary, the Court must adjust the prima facie length of the sentences downward in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences."" (references omitted)

See also: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59.

46It will be observed that the extent of the accumulation is from 22 October 2010, being the date upon which the sentence for the Local Court offences commenced, to 18 March 2011, being the date upon which the sentence for the joint offence with the applicant commenced, effectively a period of 5 months. Consequently, the non-parole components of the sentences were concurrent for a period of 10 months.

47It is the consequence of this period of concurrence that leads the applicant to submit that in effect Mr Boyd will serve only approximately 2 years and 8 months for the same offence for which the applicant will serve 3 years and 6 months, that is, a difference of 10 months. 

48The applicant submits that having regard to the findings which are not challenged, of the identity of the criminality of the co-offenders, their roles in the joint criminal enterprise and their subjective circumstances, he has a justified sense of grievance because the actual period to be served in custody in consequence of the offences committed by the co-offender does not bear a due proportion to the actual period to be served in custody in consequence of the offences committed by the applicant.

49The applicant submitted that this Court should intervene, quash the applicant's sentence and reduce the applicant's sentence so that it bears a proper proportion to the sentence imposed on Mr Boyd.

The Parity Principle

50So far as I understand it, the authorities on the application of the parity principle in circumstances such as those with which this Court is presented in this case, provide the following principles:

(1)The parity principle is an aspect of equal justice, which requires that there be consistency in punishment. Unequal treatment under the law is likely to lead to an erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice: Lowe at 610-611 per Mason J; Postiglione at 301 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ, at 335 per Kirby J; Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49 at 28 and 30 per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ;

(2)Because the function of imposing a sentence on an individual has a discretionary character, an appellate court will ordinarily be reluctant to intervene. There is no such thing as perfect consistency in sentencing. A search for perfect consistency is to look for the unattainable and will frequently be an exercise of academic abstraction: Postiglione at 336-7 per Kirby J, R v M (CA) (1996) 105 CCC (3d) 327 at [92] per Lamer CJ; 

(3)Hence, the discrepancy required to be identified between sentences is one which is not merely an arguable one, but one which is ""marked"", or ""clearly unjustifiable"", or ""manifest ... such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance"" or else it ""[appears] that justice has not been done"": Lowe at 610 per Gibbs CJ (Wilson J agreeing), at 613 per Mason J, at 623-624 per Dawson J; Postiglione at 301 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ, at 323 per Gummow J, at 338 per Kirby J; R v Taudevin [1996] 2 VR 402 at 403 per Hampel AJA, at 404 per Callaway JA; DGM v R [2006] NSWCCA 296 at [46] per Latham J (McColl JA agreeing); Green at [31] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, at [105] per Bell J;

(4)The elimination of an ""unjustified"" discrepancy is a matter of importance not just to the individual concerned, but to the administration of justice in the community more generally. This Court is therefore concerned not with whether an appellant actually feels a sense of grievance, that is, a subjective test, but rather whether, examined objectively, the sense of grievance is a justifiable one, namely that a reasonable mind looking over all of what happened would see that a grievance was justified. In other words, the matter is considered objectively: Lowe at 613 per Mason J; R v Kelly [2005] NSWCCA 280; 155 A Crim R 499 at [11] per Johnson J (Simpson J agreeing); Postligione at 338 per Kirby J; Green at [31] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.

(5)In determining whether there has been a discrepancy of a kind sufficient to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, a court:

(i)must consider not just the head sentence, but all components of the sentence including the non-parole period and the total effective period that both offenders will serve: Postiglione at 303 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ, at 338 per Kirby J;

(ii)must also consider all of the facts and circumstances applicable to both individuals involved, including the objective seriousness of the offence, in order to identify whether a differential sentence was justified; Green at [30] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ;

(iii)ought not intervene to reduce a sentence below a level, which would mean that the sentence would be wholly inadequate having regard to the offence involved and the criminality of the offender, and consequently the result would be an affront to the proper administration of justice: R v Chen [2002] NSWCCA 174; 130 A Crim R 300 at [289] per Heydon JA, Sully and Levine JJ; DGM at [58] per Latham J (McColl JA agreeing); Kelly at [12] per Johnson J (Simpson J agreeing); Green at [33] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.

Discernment

51The commencing step in the analysis of the applicant's submissions is to note, as the applicant accepts, that having found the criminality between the co-offenders to be identical, the learned sentencing judge imposed identical sentences. No complaint is made in this respect. 

52However, the cases, by the time the sentencing judge came to consider each of them, were not identical. That is because Mr Boyd was serving a sentence of imprisonment which had been imposed in the Local Court (and corrected, albeit to a minor extent on appeal, by the learned sentencing judge).

53As a consequence, in the case of Mr Boyd, the learned sentencing judge was obliged to take into account the totality principle of sentencing in considering all of the offences. There was no equivalent requirement when sentencing the applicant. 

54The simple effect of the applicant's submissions is that because the sentencing judge did not make the sentence which he imposed for the same offences as that imposed upon the applicant entirely cumulative upon the previous offences, the applicant by reason of the parity principle, is entitled to a reduction on his sentence. 

55It will be observed that the sentence imposed upon the applicant carried a 75 per cent ratio between the total term of the sentence and the nonparole period. This accords with the statutory requirement: s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. King DCJ made no finding of special circumstances, either for the applicant or Mr Boyd. 

56An examination of the effective sentences ultimately imposed by King DCJ on Mr Boyd, was that he would serve a total term of 5 years and 1 month with a non-parole period of 3 years and 11 months. The ratio of the non-parole period for the total term is 77 per cent. 

57If one was to apply, arithmetically, that ratio to the total term imposed on the applicant, then he would have been sentenced to a non-parole period which was slightly longer than that which he received. 

58But, the applicant does not rely upon this arithmetic approach. He submits that when looking at the 10 month period of concurrence for the non-parole component of the sentence, Mr Boyd will serve a considerably shorter period in prison than will the applicant. That period, he submits, is at least 5 months on the basis that one divides the concurrence period equally between the sentence for the Local Court offences, and the offences committed by Mr Boyd jointly with the applicant, or perhaps more, and closer to 10 months if the concurrence period is apportioned in some other way.

59However, as the authorities demonstrate, the mere existence of a discrepancy is insufficient to warrant intervention by an appellate Court. 

60An evaluation needs to be made as to whether the discrepancy which in my view is properly calculated at 5 months, is a marked discrepancy such as would lead to a justifiable sense of grievance.

61It would be apparent to an objective observer that although the sentences imposed were identical with respect to the same offence, the circumstances in which Mr Boyd came to be sentenced were quite different and the judge was engaged in an exercise at that stage, of determining, in light of the particular circumstances, and the additional offence, an overall term of imprisonment which was appropriate having regard to the totality of Mr Boyd's criminal conduct.

62It was well within the trial judge's discretion to consider whether or not, and to what extent, the sentences should be aggregated or made concurrent. He chose a period of concurrence of about 10 months for the non-parole period. This was a figure well within a proper discretionary range and in my opinion no error has been demonstrated with this sentence: see House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499.

63Thus it would be immediately apparent that there was a real reason why there was a difference. And it would be immediately apparent to an objective observer that the actual sentence imposed from the date of sentence upon Mr Boyd was identical to that imposed on the applicant for the same offence. 

64Notwithstanding this obvious explanation for the discrepancy, the question remains whether such a difference would give rise, objectively viewed, to a justifiable sense of grievance.

65In my judgment, the discrepancy could not be so described. It is to be remembered that sentencing is not a question of mathematical precision and the application of the parity principle does not involve an exercise of precision.

66In my opinion, there was a good and adequate reason for the existence of a discrepancy between the effective sentences. The extent of that discrepancy was not marked or otherwise sufficiently significant to engender objectively speaking, a justified sense of grievance and there is no basis upon which this Court should intervene.

67The sentence which King DCJ did in fact impose on the applicant was, in my opinion, at the low end of the appropriate sentencing range. A reduction in the non-parole component of that sentence by a period of five months or so, would if I were otherwise persuaded that it should be made, result in a sentence for the crime which would be so low as to be entirely inadequate. This is an additional reason why I would not favour any reduction of the sentence. 

68Nor have I been persuaded for any other reason that any lesser sentence ought be imposed upon the applicant for his offences which were very serious. 

69In all the circumstances, I would reject this ground of appeal.

		30 March 2012",2012-03-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758948,ARBILI v R [2012] NSWCCA 48,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  The circumstances of this application are set out by Schmidt J and need not be repeated here.  Subject to what follows, I agree with her  reasons.  However, in my view the Court should intervene to reduce by four months the balance of term from two years, six months, to 26 months.
2The majority view is that there was error in failing to accord a 25% discount for the plea of guilty in the circumstances of the case, but that the sentence was nevertheless one warranted by law because it was seen to be lenient.  As I understand the reasons, the element of leniency derives from the fact that the sentence was made entirely concurrent with a 10 month sentence imposed in the Local Court for a separate offence.  In other respects the sentence was not properly described as lenient.  The commencement date was in accordance with the Director's submission to the sentencing judge (judgment, p 11).  It is difficult for the respondent now to rely upon the adoption of his submission in resisting correction of error.  In fact, he relied upon that aspect of leniency only as a basis for resisting a finding that the sentence was manifestly excessive, a ground on which the applicant fails in any event.
3The difficulty caused by the sentence imposed in the Local Court was that it did not commence until almost a year after the applicant was arrested, and during which period he had been in continuous custody, as it appears.  As explained by Schmidt J, his Honour said, somewhat by way of afterthought, having been invited by counsel to indicate whether he had given a discount for the plea:
""Yes I meant to say and I think now I didn't say so, that what I had allowed when I was going through all the features that the plea of guilty would merit a discount of 20%.  As I say, I didn't do some arithmetical feature with that, but came to a global decision.""
4Despite his denial of an ""arithmetical"" exercise, the majority in this Court state that to accord such a discount must have resulted from acceptance of the appropriate sentence, prior to the discount, as six years, three months.  A better understanding may be that, as in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346, the appropriate range of four to five years for similar offending included taking into account a plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong prosecution case: at [162](vii) and [163]-[164] (Spigelman CJ).  Thus, the error lay not in the starting point well in excess of the Henry guideline, but in failing to allow a greater discount than would have been incorporated into the Henry guideline.
5Two other concerns arise from the circumstances of the case.  The first relates to the difficulty in understanding the factors which drove the applicant to commit the particular offence.  Whether or not, as in Wilmot v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 278 at [27] it would be correct to describe the conduct as ""bizarre"", it certainly bore the hallmark of irrational and disturbed behaviour.  It was followed by conditions later identified by Dr Kasinathan as demonstrating paranoid schizophrenia and psychogenic amnesia.  The applicant asserted no memory of any kind, relevant to his conduct.  The possible explanations might have involved a neurological disability caused, for example, by a blow to the head; a psychiatric illness, or a disturbed state induced by drugs.  A neuro-psychologist, Dr Susan Pulman, opined that there was ""no history of organic brain injury or neurological disorder which could account for Mr Arbili's global amnesia."" Nor did she think the condition was consistent with the sequelae of traumatic brain injury.  Dr Kasinathan's psychiatric diagnosis did not extend back to the time of the offence.  Although there was evidence that the applicant took drugs, the sentencing judge was not satisfied on the evidence that this accounted for his offending conduct: judgment, p 7.7.
6Accepting that a diagnosis of mental illness at the time of offending does not necessarily lead to a diminution in moral responsibility or the reduced relevance of general and personal deterrence as a basis for sentencing, these factors are commonly engaged.  As in Wilmot, there must be a concern that the applicant's mental illness, diagnosed shortly after the offence in question, was present at the time of the offending and had a bearing on his conduct: Wilmot, at [31]-[32] (Hidden J).  While it is true that an applicant bears the onus of establishing such mitigating factors on the balance of probabilities, the uncertainty resulting from the evidence in the present case raises a doubt as to whether the Court had been as fully informed as it might have been about the circumstances of the offending.  Nevertheless, the deficit is not one which can be remedied by this Court and for that reason the grounds relating to the possible effects of mental illness at the time of the offending must be rejected.
7I would grant leave to appeal and reduce the balance of term by four months.
8RS HULME J:  I agree with the orders proposed by Schmidt J and with her Honour's reasons.
9SCHMIDT J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a sentence imposed upon him by Moore ADCJ on 11 November 2010.  On 9 June 2010, the applicant entered a plea to a charge brought under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, assault with intent to rob while armed with an offensive weapon.   The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 years to date from 29 October 2009, expiring on 28 October 2014, with a non-parole period of 2 years, 6 months, expiring on 28 April 2012. 
10The maximum penalty for the offence was 20 years.
The grounds of Appeal
11Four grounds of appeal were initially advanced:
""1. His Honour erred in the manner in which he took into account the applicant's mental illness;
2. His Honour erred in concluding that there was ""a notable degree of planning"";
3. His Honour erred in his application of Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, 106 A Crim R 149;
4. The sentence is manifestly excessive.

12The applicant sought leave to advance a fifth ground:
5. His Honour erred in failing to apply a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea.""

13While that leave was opposed by the Crown, it was granted in circumstances where it was explained for the applicant that the reason for the delay in advancing this ground was error on the part of his legal representation and where it was accepted for the Crown that no prejudice would flow from the grant of the leave.
The sentencing judgment
14His Honour noted that the offence had been committed while the applicant was on bail in respect of another charge before the Local Court, of demanding property in company with menaces and with intention to steal.  His Honour noted the relatively early plea entered in circumstances where the applicant said he had no memory of anything in the past, including the commission of the offence.  The plea was entered as the result of legal advice which his Honour observed, in his view, was very properly given in the circumstances.  His Honour took the view, however, that in those circumstances, the question of remorse had to be considered in the context of a strong Crown case.
15His Honour noted the applicant's subjective circumstances.  He was 31 years of age, with a criminal record comprising 2 convictions for common assault in 2003, in respect of which he received bonds; another common assault in 2005, in respect of which a $500 fine was imposed; a fine in 2008 for entering into enclosed lands, as well as bonds for another common assault and a charge of stalking or intimidating, with conditions that he accept drug and alcohol rehabilitation; and 18 months imprisonment in 2009, for an offence of demanding property in company.
16His Honour referred to the agreed facts as to the circumstances of the offence:
""The victim, Jihan Thejil, works at his father's tobacconist shop at Liverpool.  His father, Hamid Saddy, on 28 October 2009 told Jihan Thejil that an incident at the store where a male tried to exchange a tobacco grinder purchased several weeks earlier and had threatened Mr Saddy before he left the store.
On 29 October 2009, Mr Thejil was working at the tobacconist at about 6.30pm.  The offender entered the store and started to swear at Mr Thejil in Arabic.  Mr Thejil realised that this was the same man who had entered the store yesterday and spoken to his father.
That man produced a tobacco grinder, defined that it didn't work, and demanded a refund of $30.  Mr Thejil told him that the item needed to be sent back to the manufacturer.  There was another customer in the store.  When the customer left, the offender looked out into Bigge Street, came back to the store, pulled out a brown-handled-knife, and unfolded the blade of it which was approximately 10 centimetres in length.
He pointed the knife at Mr Thejil several times, and said 'give me the $30, give me anything, give me a phone, I will fuck your mother, you don't know me, I will break your shop, I will cut you.'   All of this was said in Arabic.  Mr Thejil said 'please don't hurt me, I just work here, I'll call my father.'
The offender got angry and slammed his hand down on the counter, cracking the counter glass.  Mr Thejil picked up the telephone and managed to call his father while the offender was saying 'don't call the fucking police, the police are scared of me, just give me the money.'
The offender tried to get into the cash register to get money.  Mr Thejil leant forward and closed the cash register drawer with his left hand.  The offender swiped at him with the knife, giving him a cut on the left tricep.  Mr Thejil managed to close the drawer.  At this point a customer came into the store, the offender closed the knife and put it away and walked out of the shop.
Mr Thejil's brother came into the store and Mr Thejil told him what had happened.  Mr Thejil's father then came into the store and saw the offender outside.  Mr Thejil's father asked the offender to come back in to the store and he will give him his money.  The offender refused and shouted 'fuck off, I'm going to break your shop, just wait a minute and my friends will be here.""

17His Honour also referred to events which occurred subsequently, which he did not take into account by way of aggravation of the offence, but 'in assessment of the question of the offender's mental illness which has been made a feature of this case'.  They were:
""The offender walked a short distance up the road and again started threatening Mr Saddy, Mr Thejil's father, constantly saying that he was going to break his shop.  Mr Saddy and Mr Thejil walked up to him to try and calm him down and keep him at the scene until the police arrived.  The offender started swearing and saying 'fuck you' to Mr Saddy, pushing Mr Saddy to the ground.
Mr Thejil said 'what are you doing.'  The offender said ' I will show you what I am doing, ' pulled the knife from his pocket, unfolded it and started to walk towards Mr Saddy who had regained his feet. The offender was holding the knife over his head.  Mr Saddy was speaking to him, trying to calm him, Mr Saddy tripped over and fell again to the road.  Mr Thejil ran towards Mr Saddy and a passer-by joined in to help him.
They grabbed the offender with the knife and tried to get it out of his hand.  Mr Thejil's brother was also there.  At that stage the police arrived.
It was the offender then who fell down, saying that he needed an ambulance.  Mr Thejil and his brother took the knife, and the offender's wallet and tobacco grinder, and went back into their store.
On 30 October 2009, the offender took part in an interview with the assistance of an Arabic interpreter.  When the allegations were put to him he said he was bashed by four different males for no reason and that they had a knife, not he. He was kept under arrest and has remained in custody ever since.""

18His Honour referred to records of the applicant's triage at the police cell complex that day, as well as to a report from Dr John Kasinathan, a psychiatrist who saw the applicant on 6 May 2010.  His Honour noted that Dr Kasinathan came to the conclusion that the applicant had a mental illness, 'paranoid schizophrenia and  psychogenic amnesia'.
19His Honour noted that there was a history of the applicant having been assaulted in October 2009, but without any loss of consciousness.  He also noted the report of Dr Susan Pulman, to whom the applicant was referred after he fell out of a bed in his cell in December 2009.  His Honour noted her opinion that:
""Although a period of retrograde amnesia is often observed following a traumatic brain injury, the inability to recall any details from his past is inconsistent with the details of his injuries.  Individuals with extremely severe trauma head injuries are able to recall some details of their past, details of an individual's childhood and formative years are typically well reserved in such injuries.
Based on Mr Arbili's presentation and the information available from medical records, there is no history of organic brain injury or neurological disorder which could account for Mr Arbili's global amnesia.""

20Reference was made by his Honour to a pre-sentence report, which reflected that the applicant had answered most questions asked of him with 'I don't remember' and which had been prepared by reference to an earlier report prepared for the applicant's appearance in the Local Court in March 2008.  His Honour noted the opinion expressed there that the applicant's mental health 'may have been a factor in the offence.'
21His Honour also noted the submission advanced for the applicant, that the commission of the offence may have been influenced by drugs or alcohol, but his Honour was unable to make any finding on the evidence in that respect.  His Honour rejected the argument that the offence was not premeditated, on the agreed facts.
22His Honour noted that there was an issue as to whether the mental illness from which the applicant was later diagnosed to have been suffering, existed prior to the commission of the offence.  His Honour considered evidence as to the applicant's prior offending, including the circumstances of the assault of another shopkeeper in March 2009.  His Honour concluded:
""Given the equivocal nature of the medical evidence, I do not feel as a lay person, without the doctors having been given that material to consider, and without it having been considered in any way in conjunction with today's sentence, that I should take it into account in assessing whether there was an earlier mental health issue with the offender which may be demonstrated by the earlier crime.  So I put the details of the crime to one side, whilst still taking the result into account by way of criminal record in the requisite fashion.
I believe that as much as can be said from the material before the court is that the mental illness - from which I accept the offender presently suffers - cannot be said to have arisen before the commission of the present crime.  It may, however, well persist.  Dr Kasinathan does not deal with prognosis other than to say that treatment is required.
I feel that I should find that there is a likelihood presently indicated of persistence of the mental illness after his release.  The Parole Board will be in a better position to assess that at the time of the considering parole, but I must deal with the issue presently in determining the sentence.  The courts are familiar with crimes being committed by persons with paranoid schizophrenia but it does not follow that a person with paranoid schizophrenia may, for that reason, commit crime.
On assessment of all the evidence I am left, on balance, but only on balance, with a distinct unease that the offender may now have a tendency to commit further crime if, on release, he is not given sustained treatment.
This is a matter pertinent to consider, see Helmsley 2004 New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal 228 para 36 citing Israil 2002 New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal 255.""

23His Honour did not consider that the applicant's mental illness reduced his moral culpability for the offence, nor rendered the matter an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence.  His Honour noted that mental illness might be relevant to the issue of specific deterrence, but did not indicate that he had adopted that approach.  He did come to the view that special circumstances existed, requiring a lengthy period of parole with medical supervision of treatment and to the view that a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily on the applicant than on the normal run of prisoners.  An allowance was made in this respect in the applicant's favour.  
24His Honour had regard to sentencing statistics put before him and referred to the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, which he observed did not strictly apply to this offence, but which required consideration in the particular circumstances.  His Honour observed:""However, I do note that the features of the characteristics are all present in one degree or another in the present matter, with the exception that here the criminal history is worse and the degree of planning could not be described as limited.  The violence involved was also more than limited.  The plea of guilty could not be described as early although it was relatively ... (not transcribable)... ""
25He concluded that the plea warranted a discount of 20%, which had been reflected in the sentence imposed.
The evidence 
26In evidence was the agreed statement of facts; a Probation and Parole Pre-sentence report; Dr Kasinathan's report; NSW Justice Health records as well notes from St George and Liverpool Hospitals; and Dr Pulman's report.  Mr Arbili gave no evidence.
27Dr Pulman's opinion was:
""Based on Mr Arbili's presentation and the information available from medical records there is no history of organic brain injury or neurological disorder which could account for Mr Arbili's global amnesia.  It is noted from Justice Health medical records that Mr Arbili has been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder.  Issues relating to his fitness to stand trial are therefore a matter for psychiatric opinion rather than neuropsychological expertise.
In summary, on the basis of information available to the writer, there is no evidence of any neuropsychological deficits which are consistent with the cognitive sequelae of a traumatic brain injury.""

The applicant's case below
28It was argued that the offence was not premeditated and that it was low range, because of a lack of planning.  It was accepted that aggravating factors were the prior convictions, the offence being committed while the applicant was on conditional liberty; and the vulnerable victim, a young shopkeeper.  The mitigating matters were that the offence was not planned; and that the applicant was not fully aware of the consequences of his acts, because of his mental state and the plea.  It was argued that special circumstances would be found, because this would be the applicant's first gaol term and because of his mental state, for which he was receiving treatment.  
29As to the Henry guideline judgment, it was submitted that the applicant's  mental illness affected the objective seriousness of the offence, which was not planned, was of short duration and committed in the context of frustration and drug and alcohol abuse issues, with the result that it was a lower range offence.  It was argued that given his time in custody of almost one year, the applicant ought to be released after preparation of a case plan for parole.
Ground 1 - His Honour erred in the manner in which he took into account the applicant's mental illness
30The applicant submitted in written submissions that contrary to his Honour's finding, the evidence established that he was mentally ill at the time of the commission of the offence in October 2009; and that as a result, his moral culpability for his offence was limited, because his illness contributed to the commission of the offence in a material way.  In the result his Honour had erred in failing to conclude that the applicant was an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence; and in failing to reduce the head sentence, by virtue of that mental illness.  In oral submissions it was urged that the mental illness should have ameliorated general deterrence as a factor in the sentence.
31In my assessment these submissions should not be accepted.
32The evidence was that on 1 October 2009 the applicant was admitted to St George Hospital, seemingly after he was assaulted.  He was released the next day, with no evidence found as to any head injury, he having been found to be alert and oriented.  There was then no suggestion of mental illness.  The offence occurred on 29 October 2009.  At that time the applicant was on bail in respect of the offence he had committed in May, of which he was later convicted.  
33The applicant's conduct that day was clearly irrational, but whether that was the result of a mental illness, or the effects of drugs, is not apparent.  In the submissions advanced below, it was conceded that the applicant had drug and alcohol issues, there having been evidence of drinking scotch, smoking $20 pot per day, taking one table of morphine a day, as well as panadeine forte for headaches.  That was another possible explanation for the applicant's conduct, but that this was the cause was not established on the evidence.
34The records also show that the applicant was agitated after his arrest on 29 October, then only admitting to marihuana use.  On 31 October, florid speech and mood swings were noted, with the question of mental health then raised.  On 2 November, the applicant was noted as being tearful, agitated, demanding, irrational and emotionally unstable, distressed and fearful.  It is on 6 November that the notes are suggestive of mental illness, recording complaints, for example, of the TV giving the applicant messages, albeit it is also noted that the applicant then suggested that this was a symptom of withdrawal.
35The plea was entered on 9 June 2010, after the applicant was assessed to have been fit to plead on 6 May 2010 by Dr Kasinathan.  His report noted that he had spoken to Dr Nguy, consultant psychiatrist who advised that:
""... upon arrival to jail, Mr Arbili had presented as anxious and fearful and was able to speak English.  Within weeks his mental state deteriorated, he would only speak Arabic, admitted to hearing voices and feeling paranoid.  Dr Nguy diagnosed Mr Arbili with a psychotic disorder and commenced appropriate treatment.""  
36There was no report from Dr Nguy in evidence, but Dr Kasinathan noted that the applicant was able to speak English on arrest, when he was anxious and fearful and soon began to suffer symptoms consistent with drug withdrawal.  Dr Kasinathan was of the view in 2011 that the applicant was suffering from a mental illness, but neither he nor any other expert expressed the view that the applicant was suffering from such an illness at the time of the offence.  
37The onus fell on the applicant to establish that the mental illness existed at that time.  His Honour concluded that this onus had not been met.  That conclusion was open.  The evidence relied on to suggest the existence of mental illness was also consistent with the applicant suffering from the effects of his habitual drug use on arrest and later from withdrawal.  
38Even if either mental illness or drug and alcohol abuse was a factor in the commission of the offence, that would not necessarily result in the conclusion that a lesser sentence should have been imposed.  As discussed in Henry at [173] - [177]:
""173  As a joint judgment of the Court put it in Valentini (1989) 46 ACrimR 23 at 25:
""This Court has said on countless occasions that addiction to heroin is not to be considered as a factor for the reduction of what would otherwise be an appropriate sentence for the nature of the offences which have been committed. It serves, however, to provide an explanation for the commission of the offences."" 
This has been reiterated in a number of later cases (eg Stanford NSWCCA 23 November 1993; Atkins NSWCCA 27 May 1998).
174  Drug addiction is one of the circumstances of a particular offence that is relevant to the sentencing exercise. It may, for example, be pertinent to the issue of impulsiveness/planning or to the weight to be given to rehabilitation in a particular case.
175 In Engert (1995) 84 ACrimR 67, Gleeson CJ emphasised the complexity of the sentencing task and the multiplicity of the, sometimes conflicting, objectives it must serve. His Honour concluded:
""It is therefore erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances. In every case, what is called for is the making of a discretionary decision in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, and in the light of the purposes to be served by the sentencing exercise."" (68)
176  His Honour went on to say that the existence of a causal relationship between a mental disorder and the commission of an offence does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence (at 71). Nor, in my opinion, should the existence of a causal relationship between drug addiction and the commission of an offence.
177  The circumstances in which motive may be a mitigating factor should, in my opinion, be confined to cases in which motive impinges upon the moral culpability of the offender. This can include mental, emotional or medical problems or impulsive conduct. In any event the degree to which motive may be pertinent must depend on the whole of the circumstances. (White NSWCA 23 June 1998 at 24).""

39In Wilmot v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 278, the trial judge did not accept the opinion of an expert that the applicant was suffering a mental illness at the relevant time.  Hidden J observed at [26] - [32]:
""26  It is unnecessary to revisit the familiar line of authority dealing with the bearing of mental illness upon sentence: see, for example, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. Undoubtedly, a finding that the applicant's mental illness contributed to his criminal behaviour would have been relevant to an assessment of the objective gravity of his offences. However, that is a matter in mitigation as to which the applicant bore the burden of proof, and there needed to be evidence sufficient to establish it. 
27  Certainly, there is a bizarre quality to both offences. This can be seen in the somewhat elaborate planning of the malicious wounding of Mr Mostafa and the ferocity of the attack upon him, as well as in the applicant's expression to police of a preference to be shot rather than be imprisoned. As to the planning of the first offence, it may be that that is not inconsistent with its being the product of mental illness. Moreover, one might question the effectiveness of the applicant's disguise when committing that offence in the presence of members of his family. As I have said, it did not prevent his daughter recognising him. 
28  Nevertheless, a finding that the applicant's mental illness contributed to the offences would need to have been supported by expert evidence disclosing the basis upon which that finding was available. In his second report Dr Westmore did not elaborate at all upon his assertion of a link between the illness and the applicant's behaviour. His ability to proffer a basis for that opinion must have been hampered by the fact that the applicant declined to provide him with an account of the offences. Nor did the applicant give evidence in the sentence proceedings, and Ms Davenport was unable to take us to any part of his recorded police interview which might have provided a foundation for the doctor's opinion. 
29  Ms Davenport referred to a passage in the Justice Health material from which it appears that the applicant told a health professional that he believed that Mr Mostafa was planning to sexually abuse his daughter. This appears in notes made on 12 July 2004, five days after his arrest. Nothing of the kind was suggested elsewhere in the evidence. In particular, he said nothing about it in his recorded police interview and there was no reference to it in Dr Westmore's reports or in his father's evidence. Nor is it referred to in his Honour's remarks and, indeed, it does not appear to have been raised at the sentence proceedings. 
30  It is difficult to place any weight on this assertion, or to afford any significance to it. There appears to have been no material before his Honour by which it might be decided whether there was some factual basis for it, whether it was a fabrication or whether it was a delusional belief. Certainly, there was no evidence, expert or otherwise, to establish that it was engendered by mental illness. 
31  Ms Davenport emphasised the fact that almost immediately after the applicant's arrest he was found to be suffering from a psychiatric condition, previously undiagnosed and apparently of long standing. She argued that this alone warranted a conclusion that his condition influenced the commission of the offences. 
32  I must say that this aspect of the matter has troubled me. However, as I have said, the question of a link between the applicant's mental illness and his offences was a matter for expert evidence. Whilst acknowledging the undoubted expertise of Dr Westmore, his second report was wholly inadequate to establish that link. The bare assertion of a link, without elaboration, was insufficient: cf Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705. It was open to his Honour to find that the connection had not been established.""

40This approach has been followed in a number of later cases (see for example Mercael v R [2010] NSWCCA 36 and Lewis v R [2011] NSWCCA 206).  
41In this case there was no expert evidence that the applicant was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the offence, or as to any causal connection between the offence and the mental illness the applicant was later diagnosed to be suffering from.  His Honour carefully considered the evidence, but concluded that it did not establish that mental illness was suffered at the time of the offence.  That conclusion was plainly open.  The evidence was not all one way, as was submitted for the applicant.  
42If his Honour had come to the conclusion that a mental illness was suffered at the relevant time, he would also have had to consider the causal connection between the illness and the offence and whether the result should be the imposition of a lesser sentence, because the applicant's circumstances were such that the need for deterrence to feature in the sentence needed to be modified.
43While such a connection was not established, the mental illness which the applicant was suffering from at the time of sentence, was still a factor to be taken into account in determining sentence.  That illness was taken into account by his Honour, who determined as a result that special circumstances existed, warranting a longer than usual non-parole period.  In adopting that approach his Honour did not err.  
44 Accordingly, this ground of appeal must fail.
Ground 2 - His Honour erred in concluding that there was a notable degree of planning
45The applicant's case below was that there was no premeditation or planning involved in the offence.  His Honour rejected that submission, finding that there was a 'notable degree of planning'.  That conclusion was open on the agreed facts, which included that on the day before the offence, the applicant went to the shop and sought to exchange a pepper grinder.  He threatened the victim's father, when he did not agree to the exchange.  It was the following day that the applicant returned to the shop armed with a knife.  He entered the shop and swore at the victim, speaking to him about the grinder, only after the other customer in the shop had left.  The applicant then looked out into the street, returned to the empty shop and pulled out a knife with a 10cm blade, which he pointed at the victim, while demanding money and threatening to cut him.  It was in the ensuing altercation over the till, that the victim was injured.
46The Crown's case was that there had been a limited degree of planning, but his Honour found  that the facts revealed a degree of planning involved in the offence which 'could not be described as limited'.  That conclusion was clearly open on the evidence.  Accordingly, this ground of appeal must also fail.
Ground 5 - His Honour erred in failing to apply a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea 
47It is convenient next to deal with Ground 5.
48The applicant was arrested on 29 October 2009.  Justice Health triage notes of 31 October 2009 record ""mental health issues & mood swings"".  A Notification Form of that organisation dated 2 November records, inter alia, ""Tearful agitated man"", ""became demanding and irrational"", and ""Behaviour escalation angry emotionally unstable and demanding"".  Although the records available to the Court are by no means complete, there seem thereafter to have been a number of health issues until, on 6 May 2010 Dr  Kasinathan reported that although the applicant had a mental illness he was fit to plead.  On 9 June 2010 the applicant pleaded guilty and shortly afterwards he was committed for sentence.  His Honour took the view that the plea as ""relatively early although by no means at the outset"".
49Otherwise, his Honour made no reference in his original remarks on sentence to a discount for the applicant's plea.  After he had concluded those remarks, Counsel asked him if he had applied such a discount.  His Honour responded: - 
""Yes, I meant to say and I think now I didn't say so, that what I had allowed when I was going through all the features that the plea of guilty would merit a discount of 20%.  As I say, I didn't do some arithmetical feature with that, but came to a global decision.  Thank you for reminding me ...""

50The amount of the discount was a matter for his Honour's discretion.  As discussed in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, a 25% discount is not automatic.  The applicant relied on the conclusions reached in Hawkins v R [2011] NSWCCA 153, to submit that the discretion had miscarried.  There a delay in the entry of a plea and a hearing, as the result of an investigation into the applicant's health, a fitness hearing and plea negotiations, was considered to have been fairly attributed to the applicant's mental illness, with the result that the relvant discretion to grant a discount of only 20% had miscarried.
51His Honour took the view that the plea of guilty could not be described as early, although it was a useful and a responsible acceptance of guilt in circumstances where the applicant had no recollection of the crucial events.  
52It seems to me, as in Hawkins, in the applicant's circumstances the exercise of the discretion miscarried.  In the circumstances the plea was an early one, properly attracting the grant of a 25% discount.  While the evidence did not establish the existence of any mental illness at the time of the commission of the offence in October 2009, that the applicant succumbed to such an illness not long afterwards is apparent.  He received treatment for that illness and his fitness to plead was investigated.  Having been found to be fit in May, he was given prompt advice and soon entered a plea despite ongoing problems with his memory.  The plea was entered before committal proceedings in the Local Court.  In those circumstances a 25% discount was plainly warranted.
53This ground of appeal must be upheld.
Ground 3 - His Honour erred in his application of Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R 149Ground 4 - The sentence was manifestly excessive
54The applicant directed the same case in respect of these two grounds.  In respect of ground 4, he must establish that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust.  
55Both parties addressed Henry in their submissions.  It was a guideline judgment given in relation to the offence of armed robbery under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act.  At [165], Spigelman J observed that in his view, offences in which the following factors are shown to be present, ought to result in four and five years for the full term:
""162  It appears from the cases that come to this Court, including the present proceedings, that there is a category of case which is sufficiently common for purposes of determining a guideline:
(i) young offender with no or little criminal history;
(ii) weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury;
(iii) limited degree of planning;
(iv) limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof;
(v) victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver;
(vi) small amount taken;
(vii) plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.""

56His Honour also observed at [169] - [170]:
""169  Aggravating and mitigating factors will justify a sentence below or above the range as this Court's prior decisions indicate. The narrow range is a starting point.
170  In addition to factors which may arise in any case, for example, youth, offender's criminal record, co-operation with authorities, guilty plea in the absence of a strong case, rehabilitation efforts, offence committed whilst on bail etc, a number of circumstances are particular to the offence of armed robbery. These include:
(i) nature of the weapon;
(ii) vulnerability of the victim;
(iii) position on a scale of impulsiveness/planning;
(iv) intensity of threat, or actual use, of force;
(v) number of offenders;
(vi) amount taken;
(vii) effect on victim(s).""

57The judgment was clearly a relevant consideration in his Honour's determination of the sentence (see Legge v R (2007) NSWCCA 244 at [37]), as was the maximum penalty for the offence.  The applicant's case was that the sentence imposed, 5 years after a discount of 20%, at the upper end of the range established in Henry was manifestly excessive; that being the result of his Honour's failure to have regard to the distinguishing features in this case, particularly the early plea and the applicant's mental illness.
58These submissions should not be accepted.  
59Mental illness and discount for the early plea are the subject of separate grounds of appeal.  Otherwise, the facts in this case were outside the factors discussed in Henry, in a number of relevant ways.  The applicant was 31 years of age when he committed the offence, while on bail for another offence of violence.  He had  a relevant criminal history and by the time of sentencing, the applicant had been convicted of the offence he had committed in March 2009, for which he had been sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 10 months.  It was found there was more than limited planning involved in this offence.  The applicant not only went to the shop armed with a knife, he threatened and actually wounded the victim, a shopkeeper, while wrestling with him over the cash register.  While he was unsuccessful in taking any money, he then also made further threats with the knife, against others who were immediately outside the shop.
60While mental illness was not established to have existed at the time of the offence, that the applicant was mentally ill was taken into account in the sentence imposed.  The non-parole period imposed for this offence was only 50% of the term of the sentence.  The non-parole period for the earlier offence is to expire on 8 July 2011.  The sentence for this offence was backdated to 29 October 2009, with the result that the non-parole period of 2 years, 6 months imposed, totally subsumes the 10 months non-parole period imposed for the earlier offence. 
61This result reflected considerable leniency in the circumstances.  In reaching his conclusion his Honour observed that he had accepted the approach urged by both parties, which he had accepted with some reluctance.  His Honour did not explain why.  
62In the circumstances the totality principle required that his Honour give consideration to questions of cumulation and concurrency of the sentence imposed (see Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59; Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610; Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616 and R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; (2006) 164 A Crim R 481.) The two offences in respect of which the applicant received concurrent sentences, each offences of violence, were not the result of one course of conduct, or criminal enterprise.  Sentences for two such offences should not be made concurrent, simply because of the similarity of the conduct involved in each offence (see R v Jarrold [2010] NSWCCA 69 at [56]).  
63When concurrent sentences are imposed, it is settled that there needs to be an identification and evaluation of relevant factors pertaining to the offences, including their respective nature and seriousness, which leads to the concurrency which is imposed (see Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]).  Complete concurrency is usually not warranted where there are separate offences and separate victims.  As Simpson J discussed in R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [38]:
 '...In this context the Crown appropriately reminded the Court of the purposes of sentencing set out in s3A of the Sentencing Procedure Act. The first purpose so specified is ensuring adequate punishment for crime; others here relevant include crime prevention by deterrence, denunciation, making an offender accountable, and recognition of the harm done to the victim and the community. To fail to accumulate, at least partially, may well be seen as a failure to acknowledge the harm done to those individual victims.

64It follows that these grounds of appeal were not made out.  This was not a manifestly excessive  sentence in the circumstances. 
A lesser sentence is not warranted in law
65Despite the conclusion that his Honour erred in relation to the discount given, having in mind the sentence which his Honour imposed, which was made entirely concurrent with the sentence imposed for the March 2009 offence, it is necessary to consider whether any lesser sentence is warranted in law (see s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79]).  That requires consideration of whether the sentence imposed is outside of the appropriate range for the offence (see R v Baxter [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 at [16] - [18]).
66Arithmetical calculations based upon the five years total sentence and the 20% discount referred to by his Honour would indicate a starting point of six years and three months.  Accepting his Honour's statement that he had not indulged in that degree of precision, it may be inferred that his starting point was of the order of six to six and a half years.  The division of the five year term into a non-parole period of two and a half years and an additional term of two and a half years meant that the non-parole period was an unusually low percentage of the total term albeit his Honour saw good reasons for this.  As has been said, that non-parole period was made entirely concurrent with the 10 month non-parole imposed upon the applicant for his earlier offence.""
67The sentence imposed was, in my view, not only within the appropriate range, but a lenient sentence, having in mind the gravity of this offence; the aggravating and mitigating factors which had to be taken into account; the mental illness from which the applicant now suffers, as reflected in the finding of special circumstances; the 25% discount which ought to have resulted from the early plea; and the proper application of the totality principle.
68In my view of the circumstances, a lesser sentence than that imposed was not warranted in law, with the result that the appeal should not succeed.
Orders
69I propose the following orders:
1.   Leave to appeal is granted.
2.  The appeal is dismissed.

	HIS HONOUR: The Court is dealing with an objection by the Crown to the tender of a document by the accused. The accused seeks to tender documents, that he says are exculpatory. Amounts, the Crown says, are undeclared income of the accused are treated as loans in these documents. I allow the tender.
	
	
	I do so on the basis that the document is a business record.
	
	
	While the veracity of the contents of the documents may ultimately be the subject of contest because they were compiled by persons seeking to exculpate the accused, nevertheless they are matters that can properly and fairly be dealt with in submissions to the jury.
	
	
	It seems to me that the document, notwithstanding that it dates from a time after the offences in question, could rationally affect directly or indirectly the probability of the existence of a fact in issue, being the relationship between the accused, the companies, and the purchase of the property. I will admit the document.
	
	
	Lastly, the Crown relies on s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995. While the weight or acceptability of the material is ultimately a matter for the jury, in a sense, I consider the probative value is not outweighed by any unfairness that cannot be dealt with appropriately by the Crown.

2758975,AX by tutor ZX v Ashfield Municipal Council [2012] NSWDC 32,"Judgment

1The plaintiff by statement of claim filed on 11 March 2011 claims damages for negligence against the defendant, the owner/occupier of the Ashfield Swimming Pool. The plaintiff, who is currently 16 years of age and in Year 11 at high school, lacerated his left big toe on a broken tile on the floor of the pool on 27 October 2007. 

2The plaintiff being a minor, these proceedings have been commenced on the plaintiff's behalf by his tutor (his mother). The statement of claim asserts that the negligence of the defendant caused the plaintiff to suffer injuries not limited to the laceration to his left big toe (which required three stitches at the local hospital), but a consequential psychiatric injury, triggered by the impact of the injury on his school boy football career from 2007 to date. 

The pleadings in these proceedings and the issues to be determined

3The statement of claim brings an alternate claim in contract which was not pursued at the hearing, or the subject of submissions. 

4Breach of duty of care in relation to the circumstances of the accident, insofar as it resulted in injury to the plaintiff's left big toe, is admitted. The defence filed on 23 August 2011 raises issues pursuant to s 5N Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) (recreational activity) and a claim of contributory negligence pursuant to s 5R Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), as well as a defence under ss 50C, 50D and 50F Limitation Act 1969 (NSW). No submissions were made as to contributory negligence; the basis upon which liability was contested by the defendant at trial was pursuant to s 32 Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW).

5In unrelated incidents, the plaintiff and his elder brother were victims of a sexual assault. I have been informed that criminal proceedings in which the plaintiff's elder brother may give evidence are likely. For that reason I have anonymised all reference to the plaintiff's name and to identifying features such as his home and current school.

6The issues which I have been asked by the parties to determine were helpfully summarised by Mr Gambi in his oral submissions as follows:

(a)Whether the plaintiff in fact suffers any ongoing disabilities as a result of the injury he suffered on 27 October 2007; 

(b)If so, was there a duty of care in relation to mental harm and was any such injury reasonably foreseeable, having regard to the provisions of s 32 Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW); and

(c)Quantum issues.


The circumstances of the plaintiff's accident

7The plaintiff went to Ashfield Swimming Pool with family members on 27 October 2007. While he was in the shallow end of the pool, he suddenly noticed a great deal of blood in the water and felt his left toe throbbing. He screamed for help and the lifeguard came to help him out of the water. The plaintiff later told his psychologist, Ms Rose Cantali, according to her report of 10 August 2009, that he had ""a huge hole in his toe"". He was taken to Concord Hospital, where the discharge notes suggest that the cut was caused by an object like glass being on the swimming pool mat.

8The plaintiff's laceration was reviewed by the Registrar, Dr Fogg, who put three stitches into the wound under local anaesthetic. Steristrips were applied, as well as a bandage. He was given a seven-day course of medication to prevent infection and advised to keep the area dry for 48 hours. He was also advised to keep pressure off his toe for a few days (Concord Hospital Emergency Department notes, Exhibit B). He was discharged later that same day.

9The plaintiff was upset by the circumstances of the accident, and said that he had difficulty walking on his left foot. He missed time from school. According to the closing submissions made on behalf of the plaintiff, he was absent from school for a month. According to his school records, he was absent for 19 days from January to June 2007, which should be subtracted from the total of 40 days for the period January to November 2007 (Exhibit A); as he had other days away prior to the October accident, the actual period for which he was absent as a result of this injury was probably less than a month.

10The plaintiff described the impact of his physical injury as follows:

""Q. You see the case is isn't it that this was a very minor incident that occurred in the pool wasn't it?
A. Yes.

Q. You went to hospital, you had three stitches in it, is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. You basically got over it didn't you?
A. The physical yes.

Q. And you really could have played sport if you wanted to couldn't you?
A. No."" (T 32)

11Counsel for the plaintiff referred in his closing address to the plaintiff having used crutches. He had certainly used crutches in relation to an earlier accident on 17 March 2007 (T 15, 74), when he had injured his right big toe, and he was given a certificate for absence from school for the period 13 to 16 March 2007 for this accident (see the plaintiff's amended chronology, page 2). However, neither he nor his mother said in their evidence that crutches were required after the accident the subject of these proceedings.

12The plaintiff went to see his local doctor on 30 October 2007, and on 6 November went back to have the sutures removed. He did not consult his doctor again about this toe until 7 March 2008, when Dr Marinucci records the plaintiff complaining that the scar was ""sore when plays sport"". On 26 July 2008, he complained of having a painful right big toe. Since he injured both his left and right big toes during 2007, it is unclear whether this is a typographical error, or a reference to his March 2007 injury to his right big toe. I shall assume for the purposes of these proceedings however, given the report of Dr Hollinshead, that this is a typographical or comprehension error by Dr Marinucci, and that the plaintiff was in fact complaining about his left big toe.

13Dr Marinucci wrote a referral letter on 19 March 2008. It is unclear why nothing was done about this until the second visit to Dr Marinucci on 2 July. In any event, Dr Hollinshead provided a report on 13 August 2008 as follows:

""Many thanks for asking me to see [the plaintiff] who is a young chap who cut the plantar surface at the base of his great toe in the skin crease while running around the pool at Ashfield. It appears he cut it on a piece of sharp tile at the pool. He required 3 stitches and they were placed here at Concord Hospital in the emergency department. The wound has healed up extremely well and on examining it I had a lot of trouble actually seeing where the cut was. There was no induration, there was no focal tenderness and there was no obvious abnormality that I could see within the wound. However [the plaintiff] does have a sensitive wound and I suspect this is the result of minor neuromas in the cuts surface which can give him a rather sensitive, uncomfortable wound. These particularly occur in the hands and feet around the digits. As I understand from the hand surgeons there are ways of desensitising these to some extent, but I am not familiar with what is involved. It may be worth getting a further opinion from someone like Dr David Dilley who is a hand surgeon or maybe one of the neurologist who might be able to advise how to manage these sensitive wounds and try and get them to settle down a bit more for him. I would not recommend that the wound be re excised or explored. I have made no specific arrangements for a referral for [the plaintiff], but I have asked mum to come back and discuss it with you as to whether you have any suggestions as to who may be best to see him in terms of ongoing management.""

14On 4 November 2008, the plaintiff again attended Concord Repatriation Hospital in relation to foot injuries. The circumstances were described in the hospital notes as follows:

""Jumped off a first storey building and landed on foot yesterday. Has walked on it since. Complaining of pain to lateral malleolus. On examination patient was walking with crutches. Tender 1 cm above lateral malleolus on left foot. Left hip and knee normal. No obvious foot swelling. No plantar or calcaneal tenderness. X-ray of left ankle showed no fracture.""

15The plaintiff went to see Dr Marinucci the next day. The doctor recorded the injury to the plaintiff's left foot but made no comment about pain in either of his toes. 

16On 19 November 2008, Dr Ronald Clark, an orthopaedic surgeon, saw the plaintiff in relation to the foot sprain who said as follows: 

""I reviewed [the plaintiff] today with the aid of his mother. He was complaining of pain around his left lateral malleolus. There was no swelling or deformity today and the joint was stable. The areas of tenderness were rather vague on occasions. I sent him for CT of the ankle which was normal with no evidence of a fracture line. I have advised his mother about appropriate elevation with exercises at home and he is soon for review. I do not feel that more active intervention is required at this stage. There possibly has been a tiny fracture or a ligament problem but this should fully heal. It would be possible to perform a bone scan or MRI but hopefully this can be avoided."" (p 58 of the defendant's bundle, Exhibit 2)

17On 3 December, Dr Clark noted the CT of the plaintiff's left ankle did not reveal any fracture but that he was still complaining of pain and an MRI has been arranged. Neither of these reports referred to any problems with the plaintiff's left big toe.

18On Monday 1 December 2008, Dr Lyons of the Sydney West Plastic & Cosmetic Surgery Centre provided a report to Dr Marinucci who stated as follows:

""Thank you for referring [the plaintiff] to see me following a laceration on his foot in October of 2007. I understand he was sutured at Concord Hospital with three sutures. Since then he has noticed some ongoing discomfort associated with his great toe. This becomes particularly evident on walking.

On examination this patient demonstrates evidence of a well healed scar at the base of his great toe. He notes some slight decreased sensation bilaterally of the distal toe, possibly consistent with underlying partial injury to the underlying digital nerves. He does, however, have good protective sensation and normal pseudomotor function evident. Range of movement of his toes seems to be within normal limits.

I have discussed with [the plaintiff] and his mother today that I feel this laceration is well healed. The discomfort may well possibly be associated with some underlying scar. I do not feel that any intervention is warranted. The slight sensory abnormality he has noticed may well be associated with some minor injury to the underlying digital nerves but he has good protective sensation and this is not amenable to surgical management.

I have discharged him from further follow-up. Thanks very much again for your referral.""

19The plaintiff had no further treatment. He was subsequently seen by a neurologist retained by the defendant, Dr Ross Mellick, on 31 August 2011 who noted the following history:

""I understand that he is not restricted with regards to his walking and that he wears normal shoes. He assists his mother with the shopping, carrying the parcels.

The past medical history includes an injury to his right hand resulting from punching a wall on 13/01/10. There was a past history of a fracture of the distal radius in August 2009. I note that he had X-rays of his left ankle and foot, the examination being requested with the history that he ""jumped off a single storey building yesterday and landed on feet... today finding it painful to walk... using crutches... tender 1cm above lateral malleolus of the left foot.""

Additional history was noted in the General Practitioner's notes of 17/03/07, 17/07/07, 15/09/07, 27/10/07, 30/10/07 and 06/11/07, which make reference to the injury. These indicate the absence of evidence of infection and the removal of the sutures. A tender scar was described to be present below the left big toe. The General Practitioner made reference to the toe being ""sore"" when playing sport.

A comment dated 26/07/08 made reference to the left big toe still being painful and comment was made by the General Practitioner on 05/11/08 regarding pain in the left foot and left lateral malleolus after he jumped off the first storey building.

I have a report from a Surgeon dated 13/08/08 which makes reference to the laceration of the toe. The doctor comments that the wound had healed well and that he had ..."" a lot of trouble actually seeing where the cut was."" He reported no induration and no focal tenderness or obvious abnormality (report prepared by Dr John Hollinshead dated 13/08/08).

I note a report from a Plastic Surgeon dated 01/12/08 that makes reference to a scar at the base of his great toe. The doctor records an examination and comments that the laceration is well-healed. Referring to the physical examination he does not specify which toe was in fact injured.

I have a report from a Psychologist which makes reference to his inability to play sport. She draws attention to the importance of his previous achievements in sport, which would seem he had abandoned, these achievements helping him with regard to his self-esteem and self-respect.""

20Dr Mellick noted the following on examination:

""There was no abnormality of the lower extremities and, in particular, I was not able to identify a scar on the toe. [The plaintiff] indicated to me the site of the laceration, however pressure there did not evoke pain indicative of the presence of neuroma.

There was normal superficial and deep sensation bilaterally and unimpaired two point discrimination of the plantar aspect of the great toe.

There was no abnormality with regard to the range of hip, knee or ankle movement. Toe movements were also full and unimpaired.

There was no abnormality of contour, posture, tone, power production, coordination or sensation. The deep tendon reflexes were all present and symmetrical. There was no abnormality in his ability to run on the spot.""

21Dr Mellick concluded:

""I do not identify any significant impairment of toe, foot or lower extremity function. I also identify no basis to regard the prognosis to be guarded or unfavourable. It may be that [the plaintiff] is cautious with regard to performing sports such as football. However, appropriate management is for him to be encouraged to do so as there is no identifiable physical impediment preventing him.""

22That is the totality of the treatment that the plaintiff had for this physical injuries. In March 2009 he was, however, referred to a psychologist, Ms Rose Cantali, and has continued to be treated by her since that time. The reason for this referral, according to Ms Cantali, is that the plaintiff was, he said, unable to play football at school from October 2007 onwards, and the impact that this had upon him and upon his feeling of self-confidence was severe. The plaintiff's oral evidence in this court was that as a result of his ongoing inability to play football, he became the subject of bullying. Football had been a central part of his life, as he had been an elite player in his school, so this had a significant impact on his self-confidence.

23The plaintiff had played football in his school team in 2005 and 2006. All of the evidence points to him being a good football player. He changed teams in 2006 and this appears to have caused some resentment amongst his former team mates, resulting in an incident after a football match where one of them threw a brick at him. However, in 2007, the year in which he suffered the injury, he did not play football at all. It was his mother's evidence that this was substantially due to the plaintiff having fallen behind in his school work and needing to make up time in his studies. It was the evidence of the psychologist (and I note some concessions by the plaintiff's mother as well) that the real reason was that the plaintiff's mother, a single parent with another child who also played sport, was unable to drive the plaintiff to the sports field to play sport and that this was why he did not play football in 2007. Whatever the reason, prior to the accident, for the whole of 2007, the plaintiff had not played any football as part of a school team, for reasons unconnected with the accident.

24The plaintiff's evidence was that he had been looking forward to returning to playing football for his school in 2008. It was not explained why, if his mother had been unable to drive him to sporting activities in 2007, she could do so in 2008, but this clearly was the plaintiff's expectation. However, he said, due to his left big toe injury, he was not able to play at all. The pain arising from his left big toe (as opposed to his right big toe or his left ankle, injured in a separate accident) was such that he was unable to play football. He considered he was unable to play football for at least two years as a result of his toe pain. Since he was a shy boy and most, if not all, of his social interaction was on the football field, the loss of the ability to play football for his school was, for him, according to Ms Cantali and to his mother, a very serious loss.

25The plaintiff's evidence in chief concerning consultation of Ms Cantali was as follows:

""Q. You've been seeing a Ms Rose Cantali who is a psychologist. Is that correct?
A. Yes.

Q. I think you commenced seeing her in June 2009?
A. Yes.

Q. How often do you see Ms Cantali?
A. Once a fortnight.

Q. Do you find that that helps you at all?
A. Yeah. 

Q. When you see Ms Cantali you just speak about how you are feeling?
A. Yes.

Q. You didn't see her for about a year and a half after the accident. Is that correct?
A. Yeah.

Q. You were referred to her by Dr Marinucci, your treating general practitioner?
A. Yep."" (T 10)

26The plaintiff said his older brother had seen Ms Cantali in 2009 ""but he stopped"" (T 20). The plaintiff's mother explained in more detail:

""Q. Did he report to you any problems that he was having at school?
A. Yes, he did.

Q. What did he tell you?
A. Because he left his friends from St Joan of Arc they were bullying him because he couldn't play football any more.

Q. How long did he report that bullying going on through 2008?
A. Well it's been going on. Because he can't play any more and all his friends are like - have been bullying him like saying that he's no good any more at playing and that was his passion to play football.

Q. Now in early 2009 you took him out of De La Salle Ashfield, is that correct?
A. Yes.

Q. And then you put him in Concord, is that correct?
A. Yes.

Q. Did he report to you - did he tell you how he was going at Concord during the time that he was there?
A. Yeah, it was just - he was getting still bullied and--.

Q. What was he getting bullied about?
A. Well about football and all this other - like, yeah, he was just getting bullied.

Q. Ultimately you applied for and he was accepted into [the X School], is that correct?
A. Yes.

Q. During the period of time - this is in 2008 into 2009 - what did you notice about [the plaintiff] in terms of - what did you notice about him in relation to bullying that he was experiencing and the problems he was having?
A. Well it's made him mentally - he's just a different child.

Q. When did you first notice he was a different child?
A. Since two thousand - well since this has happened to him, since 2007.

Q. Did you at some stage decide to take him to someone because of the problems that he was having?
A. Yes.

Q. Was that Ms Rose Cantali?
A. Yes.

Q. She's a psychologist?
A. Yes.

Q. Were you referred there by Dr Marinucci?
A. Yes.

Q. Just before you were referred by Dr Marinucci what was it about [the plaintiff] that made you think that he might need help?
A. Because he was basically coming home just didn't want to do anything, used to go into his bedroom, stay in his bedroom, because he couldn't go out and play anymore, because he wanted to play football and he couldn't do it.

Q. Well - go on?
A. Yeah, and also because of the way, yeah, he was getting teased."" (T 50 - 51)

27The plaintiff's mother said that since this incident, her son had been a different child, and that whereas before he used to go to school and play football, he had now ""changed"" (T 53), which was why she had taken him, on referral from their family doctor, to see Ms Cantali. 

The plaintiff's treatment by a psychologist

28Ms Rose Cantali has provided six reports (10 August 2009, an undated report apparently received1 February 2010, an undated report received on or about 17 January 2011, 15 March 2011, 29 November 2011 and 16 February 2012).

29Although Ms Cantali's evidence was described by counsel for the plaintiff as that of a treating specialist, her first report of 10 August 2009 is addressed to the plaintiff's solicitor. She told the court during her evidence that she commenced seeing the plaintiff on 10 August, and it would appear she received a letter or phone call from the plaintiff's solicitors seeking a report before her consultation on that day (T 98). She had, however, seen the plaintiff on a prior occasion (3 June 2009), but there were no notes available for this meeting (T 99).

30 In her first report, Ms Cantali describes the plaintiff as having been referred to her by his general practitioner, Dr Marinucci, by reason of the plaintiff's concerning symptoms; he ""was exhibiting symptoms of sadness and was often angry"". She considered the problem was that the plaintiff had internalised issues that stemmed from an accident at Ashfield pool on [sic] October 2007"" when he injured his toe. He told Ms Cantali ""there was a huge hole in his toe"" and ""the accident left [the plaintiff] with a damaged nerve to the toe which has affected his ability to play sport"".

31Ms Cantali states that at the time of the accident, the plaintiff had ""enjoyed Rugby and played sport"" but that since the accident he had not wanted to play sport ""for fear of the pain in his [sic] and it appears that he has developed many problems at school related to his anger"". She went on to say that he had developed a number of fears, such as swimming and playing sport, and that ""it appears these fears may result from an accident incurred [sic] at Ashfield pool October 2007."" She recommended 12 sessions at the APS scheduled fee.

32The next report (a one-page letter) is, like the letter of 10 August 2009 to the plaintiff's solicitors, prepared without the benefit of any reference to the Code of Conduct. Ms Cantali repeats that the incident at Ashfield Pool ""damaged his toe and as a result he has never been able to participate in football - a sport that he previously enjoyed and excelled in."" Treatment was no longer possible because of his family's ""inability to pay"". In her professional opinion, this injury to his toe ""had a major affect [sic] on his quality of life as well as his psychological state"" and she recommended a further 12 sessions at $2,472, as he ""urgently"" required help.

33In a four-page report which is undated but which was received on about 17 January 2011, Ms Cantali repeats that pain from the plaintiff's toe was ""the biggest factor in restricting him from his normal activities which included playing sports at school and being in the top teams"". She describes him as a very skilful player who was in the first grade team and as someone who believed his career to be in sport. All this ""fell apart"" after the Ashfield pool accident, as from then on, he was unable to participate in sport due to his injury, and ""began to realise that his toe would not heal"" (page 1). He had been excited about attending school in 2007 because he was confident he would be given the chance to play for the school but this opportunity ""never occurred"" as the plaintiff's toe ""never healed"". He felt disillusioned, reports from school indicated learning difficulties were evident, and he began to have difficulties with bullying because he did not fit in with the boys who played sport. After his school was changed, there was a slight improvement and then a relapse. 

34At this point, according to Ms Cantali, mainstream high school was no longer appropriate for him, because he was unable to participate in sport at a satisfactory level due to his toe, the classes were too large, he could not understand the teacher and catch up, and he was drawn to peers who exhibited challenging behaviours.

35Ms Cantali assessed the plaintiff through clinical interviews and the Achenbach System of Empirical Behaviour Assessment (ASEBA) checklists. She described the test results as showing that he was in the clinical range for anxious/depressed, withdrawn/depressed and social problems. He was in the borderline range for attention, aggressive behaviour and rule breaking behaviour. This was due to the impact of the injury to his toe, which meant he ""was unable to reach a degree of satisfaction in himself through sport and subsequently could not cope at school"" (page 3). His referral to X School showed the severity of his problems, and these were all ""due to the injury incurred at Ashfield pool"" (page 4). He now needed to be supported and counselled ""throughout high school"" and his mother needed professional assistance to support him throughout his school years.

36This is the principal report, and the only report which refers to the Code of Conduct. The next three reports from Ms Cantali are short (1 - 2 pages) and do not refer to the Code of Conduct at all.

37The first of these, a letter to the plaintiff's solicitors dated 15 March 2011, consists of a statement of her fees. The second is an updating report (16 April 2011) restating that the ""injuries"" the plaintiff suffered at Ashfield pool (page 1) were the cause of his problems. 

38Ms Cantali has also provided a reply to reports from Dr Akkerman, the psychiatrist whose medico-legal reports are relied upon by the defendants. Ms Cantali explains that any other person ""whether professional or not"" would have difficulty diagnosing the plaintiff because of the plaintiff's difficulty ""communicating his emotions effectively"", which would prevent a ""valid diagnosis on his emotional state"" (page 1). His emotional state had not yet stabilised. He had been self-harming, and there were deep scars on his wrists. He also reported intrusive thoughts, obsessions and compulsions. A current review of his condition found him to be diagnosed with depression, generalised anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder as per the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM IV, 2000) of mental disorders (revised 4th edition). Due to the increase and nature of his symptoms, he had been referred to see a psychiatrist and a social worker.

39I shall briefly note the other expert reports tendered on behalf of the plaintiff.

Mr Machlin's reports and Professor Hazell's report

40Mr Machlin, a child psychologist, has provided a medico-legal report dated 12 May 2011, as well as a copy of the Achenbach questionnaire the plaintiff completed for him. According to Dr Akkerman, Mr Machlin's report was prepared at the office of Ms Rose Cantali. 

41Mr Machlin states that while the plaintiff had problems before the Ashfield pool incident, his overall functioning was adequate and he derived social acceptance from sport. He considered Ms Cantali had outlined a clear justification for ongoing psychological therapy, and that the plaintiff's favourable and willing response to therapy as boding well for future progress (at page 6). He concluded that while the injury continued to feature prominently in the plaintiff's appraisal of day-to-day problems, ""a speedy resolution to his compensation case would assist him in his ability to put his memories and regrets behind him and to develop productive coping strategies"". 

42Professor Hazell's letter of 10 September 2010, a brief note to the X School counsellor stating that the plaintiff is receiving outpatient services at X School and attending the Paterson School Program, was also tendered. Professor Hazell is the supervising psychiatrist of the X School facility (T 92). He states that the plaintiff's clinical diagnoses are oppositional defiant disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and agoraphobia. 

43No report prepared by Professor Hazell was tendered on behalf of the plaintiff, but the defendant has tendered notes relating to the plaintiff's diagnosis at X School, a specialist school where psychiatrists and counsellors play an active role in the supervision of the children enrolled. These handwritten notes, dated 3 February 2010 and apparently prepared by Dr Pistilli (Exhibit 2, pp 51-57), the medical registrar, make no reference to the swimming pool incident as playing any role in the plaintiff's problems. I note Professor Hazell's name (Exhibit 2, p 51) appearing on the assessment prepared on 3 February 2010 by Dr Pistilli. 

44The defendant tendered reports by a psychiatrist, Dr Akkerman. That report has been replied to by Ms Cantali. Neither Mr Machlin nor Professor Hazell provided reports in reply dealing with the matters raised by Dr Akkerman, the psychiatrist whose evidence is relied upon by the defendant. In addition, in her evidence, Ms Cantali made it clear she disagreed with some of the contents of the 3 February 2010 notes of Dr Pistilli. The evidence therefore falls into three different groups: the plaintiff has normal adolescent turmoil; the plaintiff suffers from the psychiatric problems diagnosed by Professor Hazell, but for the reasons to be found in the notes of Dr Pistilli, which do not refer to the swimming pool incident; the plaintiff suffers from the psychiatric problems referred to by Ms Cantali and Mr Machlin, and Ms Cantali's rejection of Dr Pistilli's findings is to be preferred. These conflicting opinions require careful analysis.

The parties' experts' competing views of the plaintiff's disabilities

45In his first report of 20 September 2011, Dr Akkerman was critical of Ms Cantali for failing to carry out a Mental State Examination prior to commencing treatment and providing reports. He notes (page 3) that she did not make a diagnosis, but simply stated the plaintiff had been affected by his accident at the pool and recommended further treatment (page 3). Professor Akkerman made similar complaints about the report of Mr Machlin, including that he had not made a diagnosis (page 3). 

46Ms Cantali's subsequent Medical State Examination and diagnosis of the plaintiff, apparently in response to this criticism, is the subject of Dr Akkerman's second report of 18 January 2012. He did not agree with the diagnosis of Depression, Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and in particular noted that he had seen no evidence of the plaintiff having cuts on his arms during the September consultation. He stated, without elaboration, that he considered Ms Cantali was seeking to justify treatment, and this meant she needed to make a finding that the plaintiff suffered from a psychiatric condition (page 5).

47Dr Akkerman is dismissive, in a general fashion, of the abilities of psychologists to diagnose and treat psychiatric conditions. In his report of 18 January 2011 he refers to the lower level of training of psychologists, the lack of examination or other entry criteria, the limitation in training (namely to psychology only and not to medical issues), the ability of psychiatrists to use medication, and the larger number of patients seen by psychiatrists such as Dr Akkerman.

48I am reluctant, without further explanation, to place any weight upon these criticisms. However, Dr Akkerman raises other issues of significance: whether Ms Cantali has the appropriate expertise; Ms Cantali's failure to perform a mental state examination and supply a diagnosis, the reliance on a psychiatric diagnosis which is essentially that of Professor Hazell and failure to expose reasoning for identifying the cause of this condition with the circumstances of the plaintiff's accident, particularly in light of the fact that he had not been playing football for almost a year (i.e. between the end of 2006 and the date of the accident on 27 October 2007) before the injury. 

49In addition to any question of whether a psychologist has the appropriate expertise, there is a failure to expose reasoning in accordance with the tests set out in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 (""Makita""). There are also causation issues, in that according to the X School mental health assessment dated 3 February 2010 there had been no previous psychiatric assessments (Exhibit 2, p 54) and the list of features referred to at p 55 of this tender bundle (and indeed elsewhere in the X School mental health assessment documents) do not refer to the trauma of his injury at the swimming pool as playing any role in the diagnosed psychiatric condition.

50Ms Cantali considered the failure of the plaintiff to mention his toe to Professor Hazell or Dr Pistilli to be ""irrelevant"" (T 135). In cross-examination, she disagreed with many of the issues that Dr Pistill had listed in his notes as being fundamental to the plaintiff's problems. Mr Gambi cross-examined her about the contents of these notes as follows:

""Q. ""He has a genetic disposition to antisocial"" - I think that should be behaviour - ""through his biological father and his development is suggestive of disrupted attachment."" 

Just pausing there. Do you agree or disagree with that?
A. Disagree with that, I disagree with that.

Q. This is people at X School who--
A. Doesn't matter, disagree with it.

Q. That's fine. 

""Recent precipitation is his change of school with limited ability to cope with demands together with recent allegations of sexual abuse by a neighbour."" 

You didn't know about the sexual abuse issue, so you can't agree or disagree with that I assume?
A. No, but the change of schools, he was ready to change schools, I don't agree with that because he was transitioned into that, I know that.

Q. ""Perpetuating factors include his idolisation and interaction with his older brother who has a diagnosis of conduct disorder."" You'd agree with that?
A. No.

Q. Wouldn't agree with that?
A. No I don't, I don't agree that he idolises his brother. I agree that he has been taught to respect his brother and love his brother but I do not agree that he idolises his brother.

Q. Did he ever tell you he was teased about his height?
A. Yes.

Q. Did he tell you he was teased about the fact that he can't do anything by himself?
A. I can't remember that but that doesn't surprise me. Kids tease for a lot of reasons."" (T 135).

51 This meant that Ms Cantali disagreed with most of the factors considered relevant by Dr Pistilli. She explained the absence of any reference by the plaintiff to the swimming pool incident during Dr Pistilli's interview as being because the plaintiff was not ""hovering"" on this problem. However, Dr Pistilli had the benefit of other sources of information. This included Ms Cantali's letter of 23 December 2009 (Exhibit 2, p. 36), which also makes no mention of the plaintiff's swimming pool injury, although it refers in detail to the problems of the plaintiff's elder brother, in a section Ms Cantali has blacked out.

52Having outlined the areas of dispute in relation to the expert evidence, I shall now set out how expert evidence of this kind should be analysed.

The correct approach to expert psychological and psychiatric evidence

53In addition to the criteria for expert evidence set out in Makita, as explained and elaborated upon in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar (2011) 243 CLR 588, courts have given detailed attention to the correct approach to psychological and psychiatric reports. This is in part because the descriptions of disabilities such as a broken leg are of a more straightforward nature than the complex workings of the human mind, and in part because of the possibility for error in diagnosis where the doctor is less reliant upon objective criteria such as X-rays and more reliant upon the presentation of the patient at interview, as Ms Cantali acknowledged in her cross-examination.

54I shall outline the nature and extent of the expertise of the psychiatrist and psychologist, and the degree to which each is competent to make a diagnosis of injury.

The nature and extent of the expertise

55The first question is whether the opinions expressed fall within the field of expertise; the second is whether the opinions expressed are in fact expert opinions.

56Additional problems may occur where the person the subject of the report is a child. Cases where psychological or psychiatric sequelae to injury have been suffered by an infant need to be considered with care, as the NSW Court of Appeal noted in De Groot (an infant, by his tutor Van Oosten v Nominal Defendant [2005] NSWCA 61 at [16] - [18] and [21] - [22], dismissing an appeal from Gibb DCJ's long and careful analysis of a series of claims of injuries. 

57The care which must be taken when considering whether the expert evidence is both within the field of expertise and an opinion of an expert nature is helpfully explained by Refschauge J noted in R v WR (No 3) [2010] ACTSC 89 at [47]. His Honour notes the question may be whether some of the opinions expressed, without any indication that they were otherwise grounded in such specialised knowledge, training, study or experience were, to use the words of Gleeson CJ in H G v R (1999) 197 CLR 414 (at 427 [40]) (at [41]):

""A combination of speculation, inference, personal and second-hand views as to the credibility of the complainant, and a process of reasoning which went well beyond the field of expertise of a psychologist.""

58The first challenge to the diagnoses of Ms Cantali and Mr Machlin is whether a psychologist is able both to diagnose these conditions and to link them to the incident the subject of the claim. The second challenge is to whether the evidence (Exhibits B and D) in fact supports these diagnoses.

59As noted above, Dr Akkerman, the psychiatrist retained by the defendant, challenges both the expertise of psychologists in relation to diagnosis of psychiatric injury and also challenges not simply the causation chain but the diagnosis itself.

60Ms Cantali was also cross-examined about whether the results of the Achenbach questionnaire in fact supported the diagnoses of the plaintiff, as the results appeared to fall short of the number required for the diagnosis made. Ms Cantali had stated in her undated report (Exhibit B), prepared at the same time as she administered this test to the plaintiff, that this test's checklists ""ask for the respondents to rate the child's behaviour on numerous items"" and ""allows for a comparison to a behavioural sample of children of the same age"". However, she explained to the court:

""A. No, what I'm trying to say is the Achenbach doesn't really fit into those areas because of adolescence and the DSM IV is really designed for adults. So what we use, we use the DSM IV as a guide for in terms of diagnosis but we really can't fit it into adolescence and what we're trying to do here is fit - categorise it into teenagers into adult type of diagnosis. I mean when we say the DSM IV with young people, it's not really reliable per se, you know as clinicians we use it as a means of treatment so that's - as I said the DSM IV is mostly for adults so that's why you're not getting the correlation between those two types."" (T 125)

61Ms Cantali explained (at T 126 - 7) that the plaintiff did not satisfy the criteria for DSM 4 because he was an adolescent. She agreed that this applied to the findings of Mr Machlin as well.

62Ms Cantali also explained the limits of the test generally, due to its self-reporting nature:

""You know if you were to use these - Achenbachs are great because they give you a screening, but when it comes to taking all - everything on them I wouldn't - they're not really reliable because first of all a lot of kids don't want to confront their problems anyway, so you're just reading all these symptoms that [the plaintiff] doesn't have or reported not having, but in actual fact if you look at the situation now, he's had these problems for a long time but he has not reported them."" (T 118). 

63I do not have the benefit of any comments about the suitability of this test for adolescents. Given Ms Cantali's reservations, it seems to be a test I should view with caution. 

64Ms Cantali did, however, affirm the importance of observation. She stated, both in her evidence and in her reports, that she primarily relied upon her observations in interview, and that because the plaintiff had communication problems and did not open up to others, ""any person unfamiliar to him, whether professional or not, would find difficulty in obtaining a valid diagnosis on his emotional state without having time to develop rapport"" (report, 29 November 2011).

65Dr Akkerman challenged this in his report of 18 January 2011:

""In my opinion, it is not difficult to properly diagnose the plaintiff as Ms Cantali suggests. The personality characteristic that Ms Cantali describes might make it harder to get a history from him. But this would not affect his Mental State Examination. There were no abnormalities on Mental State Examination."" (page 5).

66Dr Akkerman is considering the plaintiff in light of the injury, his being a medico-legal report. Nevertheless, he has concluded that the plaintiff does suffer from what he calls ""psychological factors"" which predated and coexist with the laceration and may have led to special apprehension regarding the consequences of the injury (report 5 September 2011). However, these are ""minor issues as a consequence of him not being able to pursue sport"" (report 20 September 2011) in circumstances where there are ""many other severe stresses in his life such as not having a father, problems with his mother and brother and having pre-existing reading difficulties"". Dr Akkerman describes his symptoms as ""minimal"", noting the absence of a mental state examination by Ms Cantali. He repeats in his report of 18 January 2012 that the plaintiff has at best ""minor issues regarding adolescence turmoil"" (page 4).

67Another problem with Ms Cantali's reports is that she has accepted uncritically, for the purpose of her written report, the factual basis upon which the plaintiff's claim is brought, but in her evidence she conceded that a number of the factual statements in her report were inaccurate. In particular, she agreed that the plaintiff had not been playing sport for the period December 2006 to October 2007 and had, in particular, not been playing football with his team during this period.

The importance of factually accurate background information and history

68In Makita, the importance of factually accurate material was strongly emphasised. This is of particular relevance to claims for psychiatric injuries, where the nature and extent of injury is not something as readily visible or understandable as a physical condition which is demonstrable by objective investigations such as x-rays.

69In Woods v DPP (WA) [2008] WASCA 188, the court carefully analysed the correct approach to take to expert psychiatric evidence, and particularly noted the importance of accurate factual material, citing the following passage from R v Kneipp [1975] Qd R 1:

""In general, the facts on which an expert's opinion is based not only may be proved, but must be proved by admissible evidence: see Cross on Evidence (Australian Edition) at p 461, and the cases there cited. In the case of a medical witness, the facts on which he relies may include, among others, his own observations, the results of tests or experiments, and what the patient has told him of the patient's history and symptoms. Of course, if what the patient has told him is not confirmed by evidence from the plaintiff or other sources, this may weaken or destroy the effect of his evidence: Ramsay v Watson (1961) 108 CLR 642. It seems to me that the same principles are applicable to the evidence of a psychiatrist as to the evidence of any other medical witness, subject to the observation that what the patient of a psychiatrist says or has said, whether to him or in his presence or not, may be relevant to him, and admissible in evidence, quite irrespective of proof of any facts stated in the statement.""

70The factual problems may be summarised as follows:

(a)Ms Cantali's inconsistent account as to the nature and severity of the plaintiff's physical injury and his reasons for not playing football in 2007;

(b)The presence of other stresses in the plaintiff's life, such as the behavioural problems of his older brother (including his expulsion from school), the circumstances in which both the plaintiff and his older brother had been victims of a sexual assault, the role of the family history of depression, the impact of other physical injuries (including his two other foot injuries in 2007) and a twice broken wrist in 2009 and potential other diagnoses such as ADHD (Exhibit 2, p 51).

(a) The nature and extent of the plaintiff's injury

71Although in her reports Ms Cantali described the plaintiff as having suffered an injury which was physically serious, she agreed that the injury was, medically speaking ""insignificant"".

72Ms Cantali said:

""No matter how good or how bad he was he felt important in that field and he was able to interact with other kids in a positive way, so once that was over he had nothing else and even though you said that he wasn't playing in 2007, his mother was very busy and wasn't able to cope, to take him, but you know what he was hanging out for that, and once - you know he was hanging out for that so when that happened and he wasn't able to go, no matter how insignificant that problem was with his foot, that was for him was a - he felt it really badly."" (T 102)

73Ms Cantali was certain the reason the plaintiff did not play football in 2007 was because his mother did not have the time to take him, and not because of schoolwork problems (T 104). 

74Whatever the reason, this was a significant departure from her statements in the reports, set out above, referring to the plaintiff having a serious physical problem which prevented him from playing sport. 

75Further, Ms Cantali never elaborated upon why it was that the toe incident, as opposed to the plaintiff's two other foot injuries in 2007, both of which required treatment at the emergency unit and for the plaintiff to go back to school on crutches, did not play any role in any anxieties he had about playing football.

76In addition, the plaintiff suffered other stresses, ranging from family problems to being the victim to a sexual assault.

(b) Other causes of stress

77As set out above, Ms Cantali was cross-examined about other potential triggers for any psychological or psychiatric problems, namely:

(a)the plaintiff's older brother's behavioural problems, which included expulsion from school, and the circumstances in which this boy had been the victim of a sexual assault by a neighbour and was shortly to give evidence in criminal proceedings;

(b)The circumstances in which the plaintiff had complained of a sexual assault by a neighbour;

(c)A family history of depression problems suffered by the plaintiff's mother, aunt and grandmother;

(d)A history prior to the accident of school bullying of the plaintiff, including one incident when he had been sent home from school and another where a brick had been thrown at him, where the plaintiff was a victim because he was younger and smaller than many other boys in the class.

78I shall first note the evidence concerning the plaintiff's older brother. According to X School Mental Health Unit notes prepared by Dr Pistilli (apparently under the oversight of Professor Hazell), the plaintiff idolised his older brother, whose truanting from school led to his expulsion and who was described as displaying delinquency at a level higher than the plaintiff. 

79As noted above, Ms Cantali did not agree with this finding (T 131), and did not agree that the plaintiff's brother had in fact been expelled from school, or that the family environment contributed. She considered the family to be a stable one.

80The material considered by X School (see Exhibit 2, pp 37-57), with its emphasis on family problems, the impact of sex assault on the plaintiff and his brother, and family history, is a careful and objective analysis of problems of a significant kind. There is no reference to the pool injury; the major injury or illness referred to in these notes is a broken wrist in 2009 (p 39). The only reference in these doctors' notes to football is a note that the plaintiff enjoys playing football in his front yard (Exhibit 2, p 57). By contrast, Ms Cantali did not appear to have kept notes of any substance to record what was said during her meetings with the plaintiff. 

Conclusions concerning disability and causation issues

81At T 107 Ms Cantali gave the following opinions:

""Q. Would it be fair to say if we can just pause, bearing in mind a number of questions that I've asked you. Would it be fair to say that the pool incident may have been one of a number of potential triggering factors that set off what you believe to be [the plaintiff]'s current mental health problems?
A. Yes I do yes.

Q. Is it like the straw that broke the camel's back?
A. Yes it is.

Q. And sometimes that straw only has to be pretty small in order to do that because of a whole lot of other unrelated issues - unrelated to the straw incident I mean?
A. And you know I think what it is it's the time it happened and it was that time in his life and that transition, and with adolescence transition points, there are points in kid's lives that are very very, when they're more susceptible to situations and other times.""

82In summary, the defendant has demonstrated, through cross-examination of Ms Cantali and the tender of X School records, that the plaintiff has been subjected to significant stresses in both his home and school life, and that even on the plaintiff's case at its highest, the swimming pool incident was, given Ms Cantali's concessions, only one of these. 

83Football was an outlet for the plaintiff which he lost when his mother could no longer take him to play in the regular weekend matches for the whole of 2007. During 2007 and 2008 he suffered three foot injuries which required him to go to the emergency section of the hospital and to have time off school. The role played by the second of these injuries, namely the injury the subject of these proceedings would be, on the evidence of Dr Akkerman and the X School doctors' notes, trifling. It was the second and least serious of the physical injuries to his feet in 2007 - 8. He made no further complaint to his general practitioner until 7 March 2008, six months after the incident, and his complaint, as noted by Dr Marinucci, was that it was ""sore when plays sport"", not that it prevented him from playing any sport. He made a further complaint on 26 July, at which time he was referred to Dr Hollinshead, who found no problems. 

84On 4 November 2008, a month later, he jumped off a first storey building, and was referred to an orthopaedic surgeon for unrelated injuries. He did not mention his right foot injury again until 6 September 2010, when he told Dr Marinucci he had problems because of the sexual assault, the injury to his foot, and depression. By this time, he was already in X School and was about to see Dr Akkerman for a medico-legal assessment. 

85Taking all of the above into account, I am satisfied that the ""pool incident"" (T 107) was one of a series of injuries the plaintiff suffered at a time when issues such as family problems (particularly relating to his older brother) and a sexual assault were of far greater significance than any of these accidents, either individually or collectively. 

86The first issue is whether the plaintiff has a psychiatric condition at all. The plaintiff has not, on the evidence of Ms Cantali, made out that he suffers from a psychiatric condition. The report from Professor Hazell amounts to a statement that the plaintiff suffers from a condition, without explaining why, and I am reluctant to endeavour to analyse Dr Pistilli's notes to determine whether that diagnosis should be accepted. 

87On the evidence before me, I prefer Dr Akkerman's carefully reasoned opinion that the plaintiff is suffering from adolescent turmoil which falls short of amounting to a diagnosable condition, and that his adolescent turmoil is in fact within normal limits. I also accept his conclusion that there is no pre-existing condition rendering the plaintiff vulnerable (Exhibit 1, report 20 September 2011, p 5).

88However, if I have erred in so finding, and Professor Hazell's diagnosis should be accepted, then the plaintiff has still failed to establish any causal link between has resulted from the circumstances of his injury at Ashfield Swimming Pool. In the event that the plaintiff does suffer from the conditions diagnosed by Professor Hazell and Dr Pistilli, he suffers from them for the reasons outlined by those doctors in their careful and extensive notes, which do not include a reference to the swimming pool incident. While it may be that the plaintiff's loss of confidence due to failure to participate in school sport played a part in his problems, the reason he did not participate in school sport for the whole of 2007 was because he was not playing football at all during that year. By the time he injured his foot in October, the school year was almost over. 

89The plaintiff has failed to establish causation. In addition, however, the defendant relies upon s 32 Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) to establish that it does not owe the plaintiff a duty not to cause mental harm, and I now set out my findings on this issue.

Section 32 Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW)

90The defendant submits that it does not owe a duty to the plaintiff not to cause mental harm, relying upon the provisions of s 32 Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW).

91Section 32 Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) provides:

""32 Mental harm-duty of care 

(1) A person (""the defendant"") does not owe a duty of care to another person (""the plaintiff"") to take care not to cause the plaintiff mental harm unless the defendant ought to have foreseen that a person of normal fortitude might, in the circumstances of the case, suffer a recognised psychiatric illness if reasonable care were not taken. 

(2) For the purposes of the application of this section in respect of pure mental harm, the circumstances of the case include the following: 

(a) whether or not the mental harm was suffered as the result of a sudden shock, 

(b) whether the plaintiff witnessed, at the scene, a person being killed, injured or put in peril, 

(c) the nature of the relationship between the plaintiff and any person killed, injured or put in peril, 

(d) whether or not there was a pre-existing relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. 

(3) For the purposes of the application of this section in respect of consequential mental harm, the circumstances of the case include the personal injury suffered by the plaintiff. 

(4) This section does not require the court to disregard what the defendant knew or ought to have known about the fortitude of the plaintiff.""

92I also note the definition of ""consequential harm"" in s 27 as follows:

""""consequential mental harm"" means mental harm that is a consequence of a personal injury of any other kind.""

93""Mental harm"" and ""pure mental harm"" are also defined in s 27.

94The defendant submits that the plaintiff is not a person of ""normal fortitude"" and his psychological injury has arisen by reason of pre-existing vulnerabilities which affected not only his perception of the circumstances surrounding his accident but were in fact the cause of any mental harm that he had suffered.

95The precursor to s 32, in relation to ""normal fortitude"", was the High Court's decision in Tame v New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd (2002) 211 CLR 317 where Gleeson CJ described ""normal fortitude"" at [16] as follows:

""[16] Furthermore, there may be something about the vulnerability or susceptibility of a particular plaintiff that makes it unreasonable to require a person to have in contemplation the kind, or perhaps the degree, of injury suffered. In the context of remoteness of damage, it is established that a tortfeasor must take a victim as the victim is found; but we are presently concerned with whether there is a duty of care, and whether a tort has been committed. Putting to one side cases where a defendant knows, or ought to know, of the peculiar susceptibility of a plaintiff, the law has established what Brennan J described in Jaensch v Coffey as ""an objective criterion of duty"". The variety of degrees of susceptibility to emotional disturbance and psychiatric illness has led courts to refer to ""a normal standard of susceptibility"" as one of a number of ""general guidelines"" in judging reasonable foreseeability. This does not mean that judges suffer from the delusion that there is a ""normal"" person with whose emotional and psychological qualities those of any other person may readily be compared. It is a way of expressing the idea that there are some people with such a degree of susceptibility to psychiatric injury that it is ordinarily unreasonable to require strangers to have in contemplation the possibility of harm to them, or to expect strangers to take care to avoid such harm. Such people might include those who, unknown to a defendant, are already psychologically disturbed. That idea is valid and remains relevant, even though ""normal fortitude"" cannot be regarded as a separate and definitive test of liability.""

96This in turn has its origins in the reference to a ""reasonably normal condition"" in Bourhill v Young [1942] 2 All ER 393 at 406 per Wright LJ. In Mount Isa Mines Ltd v Pusey (1970) 125 CLR 383 Windeyer J noted at 405: 

""I venture to question its validity for reasons I shall state. But first it is enough to say that, assuming it be correct to the full extent stated, it does not affect the present case. The plaintiff here was not before the accident obviously prone to nervous shock or to any psychological derangement. He had worked satisfactorily for the appellant for fifteen years. The trial judge, directing his attention to this aspect, found as a fact that there was ""nothing in his personal or family or medical or occupational history"" before the accident which would disqualify him as a plaintiff. I must add that I am not to be taken as assenting to the proposition that nervous shock caused to a man who is prone to such shock is not compensable when a similar occurrence harming a ""normal"" man would be. That, I think, should remain for us an open question. It does not arise in this case. I therefore say only a few words to indicate my misgivings.

To begin with, the line of distinction postulated is not in any particular case easily drawn. The idea of a man of normal emotional fibre, as distinct from a man sensitive, susceptible and more easily disturbed emotionally and mentally, is I think imprecise and scientifically inexact. Waller J referred to this in Chadwick v British Railways Board (1967) 1 WLR 912, at p 922 (The case is also reported (sub nom. Chadwick v British Transport Commission) in All England Reports (1967) 2 All ER 945, at p 952; but the relevant sentence is there not the same: one word seems to be mistaken.) His Lordship said: ""The community is not formed of normal citizens, with all those who are less susceptible or more susceptible to stress to be regarded as extraordinary. There is an infinite variety of creatures, all with varying susceptibilities.""

Next, the supposed rule does not, at first sight, stand well with the so-called ""egg-shell skull"" rule in relation to physical harm. That, Lord Parker CJ has emphatically said, is still lively doctrine: Smith v Leech Brain & Co Ltd (1962) 2 QB 405, at p 414. I have no doubt that we should agree and that it is still for us the law that a tortfeasor takes his victim as he finds him. The proposition that a man susceptible to nervous shock is not entitled to damages is said to be reconcilable with that, because it is said that there is no duty of care for unknown abnormal persons who suffer harm because of their abnormality: only if a defendant knew or ought to have known of the existence of the plaintiff's infirmity had he a duty to avoid harm to him which a normal man would not suffer; only then would he be a tortfeasor and the man with an egg-shell mentality the victim of a tort. I appreciate that. Nevertheless I do not find the proposition easy. A mother who suffers a shock because she sees her child run over by a negligently-driven motor car is entitled to damages, apparently because mothers are likely to be near their children and prone to suffer shock if they see them hurt: yet a stranger who suffers shock because he sees the same happening is not entitled to damages unless he was a person not prone to shock, or it is suggested, with what logic is not apparent, if he was present as a rescuer. However, I need say no more about the position of persons prone to suffer shock, for the present plaintiff was not such a person. I wish only to guard myself for the future by saying that, as at present advised, I am not convinced that a defendant in cases of this sort can escape liability simply by shewing that, unknown to him, a person who suffered harm was easily harmed.""

97The Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) does not define the concept of ""normal fortitude"" but I note the helpful discussion of this concept by Hume J in Hollier v Sutcliffe [2010] NSWSC 279 at [226]-[231] as follows:

""[226] In Tame, all of the judges agreed, although variously expressed, that the plaintiff's reaction to an allegation that she had consumed alcohol prior to a motor vehicle collision was not that expected of a person of normal fortitude. It was a reaction, which Gummow and Kirby JJ described (at [233]) as ""extreme or idiosyncratic"".

[227] By contrast, in Annetts, the reaction of parents, who had entrusted the care of their son to the defendants, to the news of his death was that expected of a person of normal fortitude.

[228] In Tomisevic v Menzies Wagga Southern Pty Ltd, [2005] NSWCA 178, Beazley JA (Mason P and Pearlman AJA agreeing) held that it was not reasonably foreseeable that a person of normal fortitude would suffer a recognisable psychiatric illness as a result of being splashed in the face by water contaminated by faeces.

[229] In Crump v Equine Nutrition Systems Pty Ltd t/as Horsepower, [2006] NSWSC 512, the plaintiffs claimed damages for psychiatric harm arising out of the death of their horse caused by purchasing contaminated feed from the defendant. Hoeben J determined against the plaintiffs on this issue (see [257]) by applying Tame and Annetts in so far as it was not reasonably foreseeable that a horse owner of normal fortitude would develop a psychiatric injury in the circumstances of this case.

[230] In CSR Ltd and Another v Thompson [2003] NSWCA 329 at [43] ; 59 NSWLR 77, Ipp JA (Handley and Sheller JJ agreeing) said that consequential mental symptoms such as emotional distress that do not amount to recognisable psychiatric harm are not compensable. In contrast, in the present case the defendant concedes the plaintiff suffers from a recognisable psychiatric illness.

[231] In Bourhill v Young, supra, the plaintiff, a pregnant women, suffered nervous shock and subsequently gave birth to a still born child, in consequence of hearing a collision involving a motorcyclist. In discussing the issue of normal fortitude, Lord Porter said at 117:

The driver of a car or vehicle, even though careless, is entitled to assume that the ordinary frequenter of the streets has sufficient fortitude to endure such incidents as may time to time be expected to occur in them, including the noise of a collision and the sight of injury to others.""

98More recently the High Court in Wicks v State Rail Authority of New South Wales; Sheehan v State Rail Authority of NSW (2010) 241 CLR 60 at [23]-[29] has explained:

""[23] The determination of whether the defendant ought to have foreseen mental injury to a person of normal fortitude must be made with regard to ""the circumstances of the case"". Section 32(2) identifies four kinds of circumstance to which regard should be had: whether the mental harm was caused by sudden shock, whether there was ""witness[ing], at the scene,"" of certain types of event, what was the relationship between plaintiff and victim, and whether there was a relationship between plaintiff and defendant. But s 32 does not prescribe any particular consequence as following from the presence or absence of any or all of those circumstances.

[24] Section 32, taking the form it does, must be understood against the background provided by the common law of negligence in relation to psychiatric injury as stated by this court in Tame v New South Wales. Judgment in Tame was delivered on 5 September 2002; the provisions of Pt 3 of the Civil Liability Act were inserted in December 2002 by the Civil Liability Amendment (Personal Responsibility) Act 2002 (NSW).

[25] Tame held that in deciding whether, for the purposes of the tort of negligence, a defendant owed a plaintiff a duty to take reasonable care to avoid recognisable psychiatric injury, the central question is whether, in all the circumstances, the risk of the plaintiff sustaining such an injury was reasonably foreseeable. A majority of the court in Tame rejected the propositions that concepts of ""reasonable or ordinary fortitude"", ""shocking event"" or ""directness of connection"" were additional pre-conditions to liability.

[26] In part, s 32 of the Civil Liability Act reflects the state of the common law identified in Tame. Consistent with what was decided in Tame, s 32 assumes that foreseeability is the central determinant of duty of care. Consistent with Tame, ""shocking event"", and the existence and nature of any connection between plaintiff and victim and between plaintiff and defendant, are considerations relevant to foreseeability, but none is to be treated as a condition necessary to finding a duty of care. But contrary to what was decided in Tame, s 32 provides that a duty of care is not to be found unless the defendant ought to have foreseen that a person of normal fortitude might, in the circumstances of the case, suffer a recognised psychiatric illness.

[27] For present purposes, there are three important features of s 32. First, ""sudden shock"" (the expression used in s 32(2)(a)) is no more than one of several circumstances that bear upon whether a defendant ""ought to have foreseen that a person of normal fortitude might, in the circumstances of the case, suffer a recognised psychiatric illness if reasonable care were not taken"". The occurrence of ""sudden shock"" is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a finding that a defendant owed a duty to take reasonable care not to cause a plaintiff pure mental harm.

[28] Secondly, witnessing, at the scene, a person being killed, injured or put in peril is also but one of the circumstances that bear upon the central question of foreseeability. Witnessing, of the kind described, is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for finding a duty of care.

[29] Thirdly, the focus of s 32 is ""mental harm"" and ""a recognised psychiatric illness"", not mental or nervous shock. Section 32 does not use the expression ""mental or nervous shock"". Yet, as noted earlier, the phrase ""mental or nervous shock"" appears in s 29 of the Civil Liability Act, and in s 30(1), the provision which determines whether s 30 is engaged. Section 30 applies to the liability of a person (the defendant) for pure mental harm to a person (the plaintiff) ""arising wholly or partly from mental or nervous shock"" in connection with another person (the victim) being killed, injured or put in peril by the act or omission of the defendant.""

99I have had the benefit of additional submissions from both the plaintiff (5 March 2012) and defendant (1 March 2012) concerning other recent decisions which have considered this issue, none of which add anything to the discussion set out in the extracts above. 

100The parties agreed that questions of what amounts to ""normal fortitude"" should be approached in the manner described by the High Court of Australia in Tame v New South Wales, supra; Hollier v Sutcliffe, supra, at 16.

101Essentially what the plaintiff submits is that the plaintiff's reaction was neither extreme nor idiosyncratic (written submissions, paragraph 6) in that he was a 11 year old boy whose inability to play sport and consequential psychological response was readily foreseeable by the defendant who admits that the standard of repair at its premises might give rise to a foreseeable risk of injury. An important factor should be the age of the plaintiff. In Hollier v Sutcliffe, no physical injury, in the sense of an accident causing physical injury, occurred in the ordinary sense of the word.

102The defendant submits that the plaintiff was not a person of normal fortitude but a person pre-disposed by the many factors referred to in the X School reports which formed part of Exhibit 2 (especially pp 51-57) and that the response of the plaintiff was similar to that of the plaintiff in Tame v New South Wales, namely ""extreme or idiosyncratic"" (at 233 per Gummow and Kirby JJ). It is submitted that it was not reasonably foreseeable that a person of normal fortitude might, in the circumstances of a physical injury of the kind suffered here, suffer a recognised psychiatric illness.

103In Hollier v Sutcliffe Hume J noted at [232] that whilst it would be expected that if reasonable care was not taken some physical harm might occur, the question of whether a recognised psychiatric illness might be suffered could not have been foreseen.

104Cases of this kind turn on their facts. It is a factor of very great weight that the plaintiff is a child, and he suffered his injury unexpectedly and in a place where the defendant must have expected young children would congregate. The potential dangers of swimming pools and the consequence of injury in circumstances where a child is in water are significant. However, children of normal fortitude suffer injuries of this kind in the course of recreational activities. There is no expert evidence before me to the effect that children are more vulnerable to psychiatric injury arising from accidents suffered during recreational pursuits.

105None of the elements in s 32 are able to be made out. As an injury in terms of the injuries potentially capable of being suffered, namely an injury caused by a cut toe on a broken tile in a swimming pool, is at the bottom of the range. The plaintiff's response was out of all proportion to what might reasonably have been anticipated (Tomisevic v Menzies Wagga Southern Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 178 at [13] and [39]). The plaintiff's response was not that of a person of normal fortitude.

106Accordingly, I am satisfied that the defendant does not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff by reason of the provisions of s 32 Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW).

107This brings me to a consideration of the question of damages. As the defendant has succeeded on issues relevant to causation and s 32 Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), I have assessed the damages as amounting solely to the $305.55 out-of-pockets in relation to the plaintiff's toe injury. I include some brief comments concerning the plaintiff's claim for damages as alternative findings in the event that these are of assistance if I have erred in my findings concerning causation and s 32 Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW).

The plaintiff's claim for damages

108The plaintiff claims damages as follows:





Head of Damage

Amount


Non-economic loss: 
(28%)

$73,000.00


Out of pocket expenses:
(i) Dr G Lyon $110.00
(ii) Medicare $2,407.35(iii) Ms R Cantali $8,156.25

$10,673.60


Future out of pocket expenses:
Sessions with Ms Cantali every fortnight x 2 years: $170.00 x 52 =

$8,840.00


Economic loss:
The condition suffered by the plaintiff has reduced the effectiveness of a good part of his recent schooling and may postpone gainful employment. The plaintiff seeks ""cushion"" in connection with this head of damage.

$15,000.00


Total:

$107,513.60

Non-economic loss

109I consider that the plaintiff cannot establish non-economic loss over the threshold. He is the first member of his family to proceed as far as year 11 in high school and according to his school reports (Exhibit 2) he is doing well. Beyond requiring psychological counselling for two years, he suffers from no other disabilities, on the plaintiff's case at its highest. Accordingly, I would not award any damages for non-economic loss.

Past and future out of pocket expenses

110Past out of pockets are agreed in the sum of $305.55 for the following:

113If the plaintiff has suffered a compensable injury as a result of his accident at the swimming pool, all these expenses should be awarded. The total sum awarded would be these disbursements only, which would be under the threshold for costs to be awarded without an order to that effect by the court.

Economic loss

114The cushion proposed for the plaintiff's economic loss is very modest. The plaintiff has successfully completed his school certificate and is in Year 11. He has his own resume and has completed work experience projects. He has become interested in a future career and TAFE studies. All the evidence points to the plaintiff making a successful transition into paid employment, under the wise supervision and assistance of X School. He should not be entitled to any claim for future economic loss.

Payment of the judgment sum

115The plaintiff is a minor, but given the sum to be awarded is for reimbursement of medical expenses incurred by the tutor, there is no need for orders for the investment of the judgment sum.

Costs

116The parties have asked me to reserve the issue of costs.

Orders

(1)Judgment for the plaintiff for $305.55.
(2)Costs reserved.
(3)Liberty to apply in relation to costs.
(4)Exhibits retained for 28 days.

		03 April 2012",2012-04-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758976,R v White & ors (No 6) [2012] NSWSC 470,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  At the close of the Crown case, Mr Johnston, counsel for the accused Jessica Tess Birkensleigh, made an application that I direct the jury to return verdicts of not guilty in respect of the two counts on the indictment referable to her.  
2I have a duty to direct an acquittal if, at the conclusion of the prosecution case, the evidence is incapable of proving an alleged offence.  I have no power to direct a verdict merely because I have formed a view that a guilty verdict would be unreasonable, or in the terminology formally used, unsafe and unsatisfactory:  R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 at 85.  A verdict of not guilty may be directed only if ""there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty"":  Doney v R [1990] HCA 51; (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 215; see also R v LK [2010] HCA 17; (2010) 241 CLR 177 at [29].  
3Ms Birkensleigh is charged that on 16 December 2008 at Chinderah in the State of New South Wales, she did rob Saaid Zaiter of prohibited drugs, the property of Saaid Zaiter.  She is further charged that between 16 December 2008 and 4 September 2009 in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, knowing afterwards that Rodney Boyd White did on 16 December 2008 at Chinderah in the State of New South Wales murder Saaid Zaiter she did receive, harbour, maintain and assist Rodney Boyd White.
4Briefly, the Crown case is that the accused White robbed a drug dealer, Saaid Zaiter, of a substantial quantity of drugs at a meeting with him at White's cabin in a caravan park at Chinderah on Tuesday 16 December 2008.  It is also the Crown case that the accused White beat Mr Zaiter severely enough to either kill him or to disable him to the point where he could be bound and gagged, and left for dead.
5The accused Birkensleigh was the accused White's girlfriend at the time.  She was with him in the days before and after the alleged robbery and murder.  Ultimately, the pair went to Victoria where they set up a new life for themselves.  The Crown alleges that they used the proceeds of the sales of the drugs stolen from the deceased to engage in substantial purchases that they made in cash and in false names.
Robbery
6The Crown contends that the accused Birkensleigh is liable for the count of robbery upon the basis that she was an accessory before the fact to the robbery committed by White.  The Crown case was described by the Crown Prosecutor in his opening address as follows:  
As far as Birkensleigh is concerned, it is the Crown case that she assisted White in the theft of drugs by doing acts beforehand designed to help and that she did them knowing of course what was on foot.  In particular, the Crown says they purchased the cable ties and very probably the duct tape used by White ultimately to bound and gag Zaiter when he was unconscious.
Now, the Crown doesn't say that Birkensleigh knew or was aware that White intended to bash Mr Zaiter to death.  What the Crown says is she was part of a plan to rob but that necessarily in the circumstances that robbery of the drugs must have at least involved disabling Zaiter to some extent so that drugs could be stolen from him.  That is, she must have always appreciated that in disabling him so that the drugs could be stolen, there would have to be, in these particular circumstances, some binding of him and that was the whole point of the purchase of the cable ties.
To be clear, the case against Birkensleigh is she was part of the plan to rob but did not know and did not believe that there was going to be an assault of such ferocity that Mr Zaiter would be killed.
What tends to support her advanced knowledge of the drug rip-off is events that happened after, in particular the text message that was sent to her by White to the effect that ""the job's done"".  There was her purchase of the mobile phones that afternoon at about 5 pm from Phone Scene knowing at that time that Mr White had bashed someone as she told Sarah Orams.  More importantly, you might think there's her continued association with Mr White, not only in the day immediately following but then of course in the months that follow up until her arrest, her continued association with him where in the Crown case she lives off the proceeds of the sale of drugs and she adopts and uses false names to assist in the purchase of property in Victoria which is a way of concealing, of course, money from the drugs so intimately involved in the plan to rob. (T47)
7Mr Johnston contends that the Crown case, taken at its highest, only establishes that there was a plan by the accused White to trick Mr Zaiter out of drugs that were expected to be in his possession.  For this he points to evidence that on the evening of the day following the robbery and murder of the deceased, White was in possession of a bundle of paper wrapped in $50 notes.  It was submitted, ""the clear and only real explanation of why White had the paper with $50 notes on each side is that White had intended to trick Zaiter out of the drugs, not rob him.""  The taking of Mr Zaiter's drugs that in fact occurred was opportunistic and occurred ""after the intended plan had come unstuck and the opportunity arose ... after Zaiter was beaten in the ensuing fight."" 
8Accordingly, it was submitted that if the accused Birkensleigh had prior knowledge of anything, it could only have been knowledge of a plan to steal, not a plan to rob.
9In proving that the accused Birkensleigh was an accessory before the fact to robbery, it is of course necessary for the Crown to provide evidence capable of establishing that she was aware that robbery was the crime intended.  If she only had knowledge of a plan to steal, the Crown case would necessarily fail and a verdict of not guilty would be appropriate. 
10Mr Zaiter was beaten and then bound with tape and cable ties.  There is evidence that Ms Birkensleigh purchased tape and cable ties at 1.35 pm on 15 December 2008, the day before the robbery and murder (Exhibit X). She had set an alarm on her mobile phone to remind her to make this purchase: ""Zip ties tape"".  The alarm was set to sound at 7.45 am on 15 December 2008 (Exhibit AF).  She had been taken into Casino by Mr Stephen Orams at the request of the accused White in order for her to purchase, according to what White allegedly said to Orams, ""some cigarettes, a roll of tape, sticky tape and a padlock I believe"" (T171). 
11The purchase of the cable ties and tape was made before the accused White attended the cabin in the caravan park at Chinderah on 15 December 2008 where he intended to meet with Mr Zaiter (T171-172).  It was submitted, ""There is no evidence of White ... taking zip ties on this trip to Chinderah.""  That submission ignores the fact that there is also no evidence that White did not take such items; in other words, the direct evidence is neutral on this point.
12The intended meeting between White and Zaiter on 15 December did not take place because Mr Zaiter failed to appear.  It was rescheduled for the following day.  
13Reference was correctly made to the evidence that White only carried a box containing a portable stereo when he walked to the cabin on 16 December 2008  (T157).  There was no suggestion that he was carrying any cable ties.  Assuming that evidence is accepted, it does not prevent the conclusion that White had taken the cable ties purchased by the accused Birkensleigh when he went to the cabin on the afternoon/evening of 15 December 2008.  
14Cable ties of the very same size and colour as had been purchased by Ms Birkensleigh were found in the cabin when the police searched it on 21 December 2008 (T58; T68; Exhibits D, E and X).  It would be open to the jury to conclude that these cable ties were part of what White took to the cabin on 15 December 2008 and were left over after he bound Mr Zaiter on 16 December 2008.
15Another matter relied upon by the Crown in proof of the accused Birkensleigh's knowledge of the plan by White is that after he had robbed and killed the deceased, he sent a text to her which said, ""Job's done okay on way back now.""  That White would make this representation to her is capable of showing that he had shared with Ms Birkensleigh his plan and was confirming to her that it had been carried out.  It is capable of confirming that the plan, of which she was aware, was one to, at least, rob Mr Zaiter. 
16Mr Johnston submitted that the Crown case is circumstantial.  That is correct.  He submitted, ""the Crown's theory is only one of a number of possible 'scenarios' available to explain the accused's behaviour.""  That may be true.  However, provided that one ""scenario"" is capable of establishing the accused's guilt, the existence of other scenarios is irrelevant to consideration of a no case submission.  The Crown case must be taken at its highest.
17There may be cogent arguments available to be put to the jury as to why the Crown case should not be accepted on the question of whether the accused Birkensleigh had knowledge of a plan by White to rob Zaiter at the time she rendered assistance by purchasing for him some cable ties and tape.  However, there is a basis upon which the jury could draw the inferences for which the Crown contends.
18I refuse the application that I direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty of the accused Birkensleigh on the charge of robbery. 
Accessory after the fact to murder
19The Crown put its case against the accused Birkensleigh on the charge that she was an accessory after the fact to murder in the opening address to the jury as follows:  
Birkensleigh is also charged with being an accessory after the fact to murder.  What the Crown points to here is her state of extreme upset as seen by Orams at the time when she comes back into his house after she has been speaking to White for some 5 to 10 minutes.  She comes back in, she is very upset, obviously crying, has to be consoled on the couch, remains in that mood, really, you will see, up until she left.
It is that state of her mind, her mood, her behaviour, in combination with her knowledge already that White has bashed someone which, in the Crown case, will lead you to be satisfied that at that point in time she knew that White had killed Mr Zaiter.
What has she done to assist?  The Crown says she came back up to Wagga in response to a phone call.  She came back with her family members, her father and brother.  She provided the means, the transport by which Mr White could leave Wagga, leave the jurisdiction of New South Wales and go down into Victoria pursuant the Crown says to the plan that both of them had all along to start off their new life being subsidised by drug money. (T47-48)
20The evidence the Crown Prosecutor was referring to is as follows.
21On the afternoon of Tuesday 16 December 2008, after she had heard from White, subsequent to the alleged robbery and murder, Ms Birkensleigh said to Ms Sarah Orams, ""Something's happened and I think Rob's bashed someone"" (T276).
22Mr Steve Orams gave evidence (T167, T173) that on the afternoon of Thursday 18 December 2008, the accused White and the accused Birkensleigh were at the Orams' home.  White and Birkensleigh went outside.  When they came inside, Ms Birkensleigh was more subdued than she had been in the preceding days.  She was upset and there were tears in her eyes.  She curled up on the lounge and the accused White comforted and cuddled her.
23There is also evidence from a woman who worked at the Casino Travel Shoppe that a person who entered the shop, who must have been, or is capable of being regarded as having been, the accused Birkensleigh, was ""really upset and nervous and was crying and had tears running on her face"".  That was on 19 December 2008.
24There is clearly evidence available for the jury to conclude that the accused Birkensleigh rendered assistance to the accused White after the alleged robbery and murder.  There is no dispute that, at least, she helped him to flee the State by collecting him in Wagga Wagga and taking him to Victoria.  But it is also necessary for the Crown to establish that at the time she did so she knew that White had killed Zaiter.  
25There is an issue between the parties about whether such knowledge needs to extend to whether the killing was murder or manslaughter.  I find the Crown submissions on that point persuasive but it is not a matter that is necessary for present purposes to decide.
26Mr Johnston submitted, ""the Crown has not proved the elements of murder committed by White beyond reasonable doubt.""  That is not the test; the test is whether the Crown has provided evidence capable of establishing the elements of murder beyond reasonable doubt.  Clearly, the Crown has.
27There is a considerable body of evidence, but it is unnecessary that I refer to it all.  It includes evidence that the deceased attended White's cabin on 16 December 2008.  Present were the accused White and a former co-accused Ricky Humphries (he has pleaded guilty to manslaughter and is awaiting sentence).  Mr Zaiter was not seen alive again.  White told Mr Stephen Orams a short time later, that is immediately after leaving the cabin, ""I've just bashed the cunt and I think he's dead"" (T159).  A dead body, bound and gagged, was found in the cabin when the accused Serone, Humphries, and a prosecution witness, Peter Elefsen, attended a few hours later; that body was removed and taken into remote bushland and dumped.
28A year later, with information provided by Elefsen, police recovered remains that were positively identified as those of the deceased.
29There is evidence that was adduced in cross-examination by Mr Bodor QC on behalf of the accused White (T378) that on the evening of 17 December 2008, Humphries told Mr Elefsen that Mr Zaiter had got into a scuffle in the cabin with White the day before.  Humphries himself became involved in the fight.  White jumped on to Mr Zaiter's chest, pinned him down and punched him until he stopped.
30This evidence that I just referred to is not all that the Crown relies upon but it, alone, is capable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the accused White murdered Mr Zaiter.
31The two pieces of evidence referred to in the Crown Prosecutor's opening, and in respect of which I have set out the details above, represent the only evidence relied upon by the Crown to establish that the accused Birkensleigh had knowledge that the accused White had killed Mr Zaiter.
32The evidence I have referred to earlier in relation to the robbery count is capable of establishing that Ms Birkensleigh had foreknowledge that Mr Zaiter was going to be robbed.  The evidence referred to in the Crown Prosecutor's opening is capable of establishing that she knew, after the event, that he had been bashed.  It is capable of establishing that she knew, after the event, that something had occurred which she found upsetting.  It is not capable of establishing that she knew that Mr Zaiter had been killed.  
33I propose to direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty on the count of accessory after the fact to murder.

		09 May 2012",2012-04-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758998,R v HT [2012] NSWSC 656,"remarks on sentence

1The offender, who was 17 years old at the time of the offences, was tried before me for murder, robbery in company with wounding and, in the alternative, robbery in company simpliciter. He was found guilty of manslaughter and the alternative charge of robbery in company. He stands for sentence for those offences. 

2The facts are particularly tragic. The victim was a 16 year old schoolboy who was fatally stabbed in the course of a robbery perpetrated upon him by the offender and another young man, Abraham Rodriguez. Rodriguez fled the country shortly after the incident, and is yet to be apprehended. The offences occurred in the early evening of 24 August 1995 while the victim was walking towards his home, having been at sports training after school. It was not until many years later that the finger of suspicion pointed to the offender and Rodriguez and, after investigation, the offender was arrested on 18 August 2009.

3The evidence against the offender was primarily admissions made by him to a friend shortly after the incident, and further admissions made over the ensuing years to another friend and to a woman with whom he was in a relationship. What emerges from the evidence is that neither he nor Rodriguez knew the victim. They were together in the area where the victim was walking and they decided to rob him. Rodriguez was armed with a knife, which the offender had given him. The victim resisted the robbery, removing an aerosol can of deodorant from his sports bag and spraying it towards the offender and Rodriguez. They then assaulted the victim: as the offender expressed it to one of the Crown witnesses, they ""jumped him."" 

4It was at that point that Rodriguez stabbed the boy, inflicting the wound which proved to be fatal. In all probability, the stabbing was impulsive and, as the Crown case on murder was based upon what is still conveniently referred to as felony murder, it was not necessary to establish that Rodriguez intended to kill the victim or to cause him really serious bodily injury. The unfortunate boy fell to the ground, and the offender kicked him to the head. He and Rodriguez then fled from the scene. The proceeds of the robbery were the boy's wallet and the small amount of money it contained.

5The Crown case against the offender, on murder and robbery in company with wounding, was that he participated in the robbery knowing that Rodriguez had a knife and contemplating the possibility that he might use that knife to stab the victim. The jury's verdict of guilty of manslaughter and robbery in company conveys that they were not satisfied that he contemplated that Rodriguez might stab the victim, but were satisfied that he contemplated that he might use the knife to scare him. Indeed, to one of his friends the offender admitted that he had given Rodriguez the knife but had said that it was to be used only to scare. 

6In evidence at the trial the offender gave a highly sanitised account of what occurred which, clearly, the jury rejected. He agreed that he had been with Rodriguez in the area where the offences occurred but said that he had not been a party to a plan to rob anyone. The effect of what he said is that whatever occurred between Rodriguez and the victim took place while he was making a call in a public phone box. He said that he heard a scream, which he thought was Rodriguez's voice. He emerged from the phone box, and saw the victim in a seated position in the street but could not see Rodriguez. He thought that there must have been some confrontation between the boy and Rodriguez which caused Rodriguez to scream. He claimed that he demanded the boy tell him why he had hurt his friend, and that he kicked the boy to his leg. 

7He said that he caught up with Rodriguez further up the street, and that Rodriguez showed him a knife which was bloodstained and which, he claimed, he had never seen before. Rodriguez said words to the effect that the victim had sprayed him in the face and that he thought he had stabbed him. He said that in another street, as they were walking away from the scene, Rodriguez showed him a wallet and, a little later, threw it into an industrial rubbish bin. 

8I received a victim impact statement by the boy's father. It was an eloquent expression of his grief and outrage at the senseless death of his son, and of the serious and enduring effects this tragedy has had upon him and the family. The hearts of the community must go out to them in their loss. At the time I read the statement I expressed my deepest sympathy to the family, and I do so again now. 

9The offender is now 34 years old. He had no criminal history prior to these offences, but he has been dealt with for a number of offences since, commencing in 2000. They include some offences of violence, but all of them were dealt with relatively leniently in the Local Court. However, while I appreciate the relevance to sentence of an offender's criminal history since the offence in question, I consider this offender's record to be of little or no significance for present purposes. 

10He was born in Vietnam, but came to this country with his family when he was very young. He was at high school in year 12 at the time of the offences. I received testimonials from his younger siblings, a sister and a brother, both of whom appear to have achieved stable and productive lifestyles. Both of them spoke highly of the offender, noting that he shouldered a considerable measure of responsibility for their care when they were younger because their parents worked long hours every day to provide for the family. Their testimonials also reveal that he progressed well at school until the final years, when he fell into bad company and began to use drugs. 

11In 1998, he and his former partner had a son. Both his sister and his brother noted that after the birth of the child he set about putting his life in order. Over a period he severed his connection with his undesirable associates and sought to deal with his drug use, which was primarily marijuana, together with a pattern of alcohol abuse.

12He was recently assessed in custody by Dr Richard Furst, psychiatrist, who has supplied a report. To that doctor he expressed remorse for the death of the victim, saying that what had happened was wrong and that he should have had the courage to help the boy, who was seriously wounded. He also expressed his sorrow for the boy's family. Dr Furst diagnosed him as suffering from a major depressive disorder. 

13I also received a statement by a prison chaplain, Mr Steve House, who wrote that the offender had become a practicing Christian and was receiving counselling from him. He also wrote that the offender appeared ""to be extremely remorseful for his actions, the pain and stress it has caused his family, friends, loved ones and the community."" He had also expressed remorse in similar terms to his sister, to one of his friends who gave evidence in the Crown case, and in his own evidence at the trial. 

14While in custody he has undertaken courses and employment, and appears to have been a well behaved and trusted inmate. He enjoys the support of his family, who visit him regularly. Significantly, he is able to maintain contact with his son who, with the consent of his former partner, visits him with the family. Dr Furst saw these matters as favourable to his prognosis, noting that psychological counselling would also be valuable and he was willing to undertake it.

15The offender has undertaken to give evidence against Rodriguez, should he ever be brought to trial. He has also undertaken to give evidence against Rodriguez's father, who is shortly to be tried as an accessory after the fact to the murder alleged to have been committed by his son. It is the Crown case that Mr Rodriguez senior secreted or disposed of the knife used in the offence, and assisted his son to flee the country.

16If Rodriguez were brought to trial for the murder, part of the Crown case would be admissions said to have been made by him. Nevertheless, evidence by the offender tending to implicate him would be of significant assistance to the Crown case. It would be even more significant in the trial of Mr Rodriguez senior, in which evidence of admissions made by his son and by the offender would, of course, be inadmissible. As part of the case against Mr Rodriguez as accessory after the fact, the Crown would have to prove that his son had fatally stabbed the victim in circumstances amounting to murder. In the absence of independent eye-witness evidence, evidence of the offender tending to implicate the son would be of importance to the prosecution.

17That said, the evidence which the offender would be prepared to give would not depart from his testimony at his trial. He would maintain that he was not a party to a robbery and only saw the aftermath of whatever happened between Rodriguez and the victim. Nevertheless, his evidence that Rodriguez had the bloodstained knife and the wallet clearly point to his having robbed the victim and stabbed him in the process. The offender's evidence of what Rodriguez said at that point about the stabbing might also be admissible in the trial of his father under s 65(2) of the Evidence Act, but lest that matter be the subject of argument at that trial, I express no concluded view about it. 

18Obviously, the proposed evidence of the offender is problematic and, no doubt, his credit would be open to attack. He would not be prepared to acknowledge his part in the incident as the jury found it, and would maintain the account he gave in evidence at his trial which, in my view, lacks credibility. However, a jury might reject his evidence insofar as he sought to exculpate himself but accept it to the extent that it implicated Rodriguez. 

19An important factor on sentence, of course, is the offender's youth at the time of the offences. They can fairly be seen as the product of his immaturity and the unsatisfactory environment with which he associated. I accept that he is now a very different person from the young man he was at that time. I do not doubt that he very much regrets the death of the unfortunate young victim and the pain it has caused his family. There is a measure of remorse which I take into account, but it is entitled to limited weight only because of his continued refusal to acknowledge his own involvement. 

20That said, I think it is unlikely that he would re-offend in such a way or, indeed, at all. Given the constructive use he has made of his time in custody and the enduring support of his family, his prospects of rehabilitation are good. They would be fostered by an extended period of conditional liberty, subject to supervision and the sanction of parole, and for that reason I find special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. 

21None of this is to deny the seriousness of the offences. The manslaughter falls into the more serious category of that offence, with particularly tragic results. The vulnerable victim was even younger than the offender. The offence was committed in company, a factor relevant to the gravity of the manslaughter although, of course, it was an element of the robbery offence. The incident involved the all too common use of a knife. Although I am satisfied that the offender is unlikely to re-offend in this way, general deterrence remains an important consideration. 

22It was common ground that the two offences should attract concurrent sentences. I shall impose a sentence with a non-parole period for the manslaughter and a fixed term of imprisonment, concurrent with that non-parole period, for the robbery in company. The incident occurred in 1995, but neither counsel suggested that there had been any significant change in the pattern of sentence for manslaughter since that time. This is consistent with the view arrived at by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Scott v R [2011] NSWCCA 221, per James J (with whom Bathurst CJ and Johnson J agreed) at [60] - [63]. 

23The offender had offered to plead guilty to manslaughter at the time of his arraignment and again before his trial. This is a matter which entitles him to a degree of leniency, which should be reflected in a quantified reduction of sentence. There should be a further quantified reduction to reflect his undertaking to give evidence against Rodriguez and his father. This also was common ground, although counsel did not agree about the extent of that reduction. Counsel for the offender, Mr Smith, submitted that a discount of 15% for each factor was appropriate. The Crown prosecutor argued that each discount should be no more than 10%. I think that the figures proposed by Mr Smith are reasonable. As to the offender's undertaking to give evidence, his credibility would be open to challenge for the reasons I have identified, but the fact remains that his evidence would be of significant assistance in the prosecution of two other alleged offenders. 

24Mr Smith referred me to three manslaughter sentence cases relating to offenders who were complicit in the fatal stabbing of a victim by a co-offender: the decision of Whealy J in R v VDN [2004] NSWSC 426, and my own decisions in R v Pham (unreported, 15 May 1998) and R v Siose [2007] NSWSC 1202. There is no need to examine them. I believe that they are consistent with a pattern of sentence which can be discerned in cases of this kind involving, as they usually do, young offenders. As the Crown prosecutor pointed out, in Pham and Siose the objective facts were significantly less serious than the present case, while in VDN the offender made out an exceptional subjective case. On the other hand, in none of those cases did the offender offer to give evidence against another offender.

25For the manslaughter in the present case, but for the offer to plead guilty to that offence and the undertaking to give evidence, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 9 years. A 30% reduction produces a term of roughly 6 years and 4 months, which I would round up to 6 ½ years. While I have found special circumstances, I would reduce the non-parole period from the statutory proportion only to a modest extent. Any greater reduction, in my view, would lead to a non-parole period inadequate to reflect the offender's criminality. That non-parole period will be 4 years and 3 months. For the offence of robbery in company I shall impose a concurrent fixed term of imprisonment for 3 ½ years. The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 18 August 2009, and the sentences will date from that day.

26Accordingly, for the offence of manslaughter the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months, commencing on 18 August 2009 and expiring on 17 November 2013, and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months, commencing on 18 November 2013 and expiring on 17 February 2016. For the offence of robbery in company, he is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 ½ years, commencing on 18 August 2009 and expiring on 17 February 2013. He will be eligible for release on parole on 17 November 2013.

2759002,R v Hawi [2012] NSWSC 332,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: On 2 November 2011, the offender, Mahmoud Hawi, was found guilty by a jury of the offences of affray and murder.

2The maximum penalty for affray is imprisonment for 10 years and for murder it is imprisonment for life. A standard non-parole period of 20 years is prescribed for the offence of murder. These are statutory guideposts that I am required to take into account, along with all of the other facts, matters and circumstances pertinent to the assessment of sentence. 

3The trial commenced with the empanelment of the jury on 24 May 2011 with seven accused. The jury retired on 29 September 2011 and returned its verdicts on 2 November 2011. 

4I heard and received evidence and submissions on sentence on 24 February 2012 before standing the matter over until today.

Facts

5The matter concerns events at the Qantas domestic terminal at Sydney airport on 22 March 2009 when there was conflict between members of rival outlaw motorcycle gangs, the Comancheros and the Hells Angels. The offender was the national president of the Comancheros and had been so since about 2002. The club had a hierarchical structure with strict and enforceable rules. These rules governed members' behaviour and reinforced a strong culture of loyalty of members to the club and to one another; cowardice was not tolerated. As the national president, the offender had ""absolute power"" in that he could overrule any decisions taken by members.

6The Comancheros had been in conflict with the Hells Angels for some time. A business being conducted by persons associated with the Hells Angels in Brighton-le-Sands had been firebombed. A Hells Angels controlled tattoo parlour in Petersham was the subject of a drive-by shooting. A Hells Angels clubhouse in Crystal Street, Petersham had been bombed. It was the belief of police that the Comancheros were responsible for each of these incidents. Graffiti sprayed at the front of the premises in Brighton-le-Sands of the initials ""ACCA"" supported that belief. The initials stand for ""Always Comanchero, Comanchero Always"" (T3985.45).

7Evidence of these incidents was not before the jury. However, it was an agreed fact that there was an ongoing hostility between the Comancheros and the Hells Angels and that each of the accused were aware of it. 

8A chance meeting with the Hells Angels president and the summoning of reinforcements to Sydney airport was the precursor to the affray and a subsequent riot which culminated in the murder of Mr Anthony Zervas.

9The offender went to Melbourne for the weekend of 21 - 22 March 2009 with four of his Comanchero colleagues, Christian Menzies, Ishmail Eken, Pomare Pirini and Maher Aouli. They returned on Qantas flight 430, departing Melbourne at about midday and arriving in Sydney at about 1.30 pm. The offender became aware almost immediately after he boarded the plane that the president of the Hells Angels, Mr Derek Wainohu, was on the same flight. He was travelling alone.

10The offender went out of his way to walk up and down the plane past Mr Wainohu and was observed by passengers to be glaring and exhibiting animosity towards him. He instructed Aouli and Eken to make contact by phone with fellow Comanchero members in Sydney for the purpose of having them attend the airport to meet the flight on arrival. The offender disputed this (T3817) but I accept the evidence of a passenger who said that he heard a man who was obviously Hawi say, ""Get the guys to meet us at the other end"" (T271). Mr Wainohu did likewise in respect of fellow Hells Angels members.

11Seven Comanchero and seven Hells Angels members (or nominee members or associates of members) rallied to attend the airport with haste. Although not all of these people were full members of the respective gangs, for brevity I will simply refer to people as being members of the gang they were associated with.

12The Comancheros who came to the airport were Fares Abounader, Usama Potrus, Zoran Kisacanin, Frank La Rosa, Tiago Costa, SP and AL (the latter two became prosecution witnesses and there is a non-publication order in respect of their identities). 

13The Hells Angels who came to the airport were Peter Zervas, his brother Anthony Zervas, Musa Ovalle, Elias Khoury, Tom Baker, Peter Martin and David Padovan.

14The seven Comancheros came in two cars. They were in such haste that they by-passed the public car park and parked the cars illegally immediately outside the lower, baggage claim level of the terminal. They all alighted and went into the terminal, travelling upstairs by escalator to the departure level and then to the security screening point at the western end of the terminal. Five passed through the walk-through metal detectors while two, Messrs Abounader and Potrus, waited immediately outside. Abounader was armed with a knife, which was the obvious reason he did not submit to security screening. The five who had passed security immediately proceeded to Gate 5 to meet the arriving flight.

15Two of the Hells Angels, Messrs Baker and Padovan, proceeded through to Gate 5 while the balance waited outside in the departure hall.

The affray at Gate 5

16There was a confrontation almost immediately after the passengers disembarked. The offender approached Mr Wainohu on the concourse immediately opposite Gate 5. They argued. The offender noticed the group of Comancheros who had come to the airport approaching at a fast pace. Mr Wainohu walked a short distance away and then returned. The offender threw a punch at him. Others became involved in the fighting and the offender ended up on the ground fighting with Tom Baker. A number of the Comancheros turned on Mr Padovan and pursued him along the concourse, kicking and punching him until he went to the ground where he was further kicked and punched. He lost his shirt at some stage of the assault. 

17The fighting then broke up. The Comancheros re-grouped and Mr Padovan returned to Messrs Wainohu and Baker. Before the Comancheros left the scene, the offender called out threats in the direction of the Hells Angels. Witnesses gave evidence of him saying, ""You're dead, you're fucking dead""; ""Next time we see you, you're going to have bullet holes through you. You are a dead man walking""; or ""You're a dead man, you're fucking dead. You've got bullet holes in you"". The offender did not dispute that he said these things but denied that he was angry (T3828-3829). I do not accept this denial. I am satisfied that the offender was very angry indeed.

18There were many members of the public at Gate 5 at the time of the affray, including children and elderly people. Many of them were shocked, horrified and scared by what they witnessed.

Into the departure hall

19The Comancheros walked as a group towards the exit into the departure hall. The offender was surrounded by his subordinates. When they emerged from the bi-fold security doors into the departure hall they were met by Messrs Abounader and Potrus who had been waiting in the vicinity. Abounader had made and received telephone calls from Aouli in the intervening period. It is possible that Abounader passed on some information of interest to those who were in the secure area of the terminal and it is a reasonable inference that Aouli called back to alert Abounader to what had just occurred at Gate 5.

20Stairs and escalators were immediately to the right of the Comancheros, which could have been used to conveniently and directly go down to the lower level where those who had luggage could collect it and where the cars were parked. However, instead of doing that, the group of 12 Comancheros walked towards the opposite end of the terminal. They could have walked in front of the check-in counters, which would have involved retracing the steps of the seven who had come to the airport. However, they walked behind the check-in counters. This meant that they were walking directly towards the group of five Hells Angels who were waiting about 70 metres away.

21It seems to be most likely that this route was deliberately chosen because it was known that the Hells Angels were there. Abounader and Potrus had been waiting in the departure hall for sufficient time for them to have noticed. To counter such a proposition, it was a defence argument at trial that the group were simply retracing the steps taken by those who had arrived at the airport and that they were on their way to the cars in order to leave. How 12 men were going to fit into 2 cars was not explained. This attempt to provide an innocent explanation for the route taken by the Comancheros was quite preposterous. However, the evidence is insufficient for me to make a definitive finding that it was the offender's intention to confront the five Hells Angels.

22If they were not already aware of the presence of the Hells Angels group, they soon became aware of them as they traversed the 70 odd metres from the bi-fold security doors. Zoran Kisacanin peeled off from the group and ran to the right, through to the front of the check-in counters and then turned left in what I am satisfied was a flanking manoeuvre. At about the same time, the balance of the Comanchero group quickened their pace.

The riot erupts

23As the two groups came close, a violent confrontation was inevitable. This is particularly so given the history of hostility between the two gangs; the affray that had just occurred at Gate 5; and the vitriolic anger the offender had displayed at the conclusion of the affray only a few seconds earlier. The offender's hostile attitude towards the Hells Angels was probably well known to the others already but it must have been particularly evident to them at this point.

24There was a short verbal exchange between the offender and Peter Zervas. Anthony Zervas was the first to make a move by attacking the offender. It was a pre-emptive strike in the face of an inevitable attack but it was foolish in the extreme. He was 161 cm tall and weighed only 58 kg while the offender was 178 cm tall with a heavy muscular build. A witness description of a man having ""arms as big as legs"" was apt for the offender. Anthony Zervas' decision was undoubtedly influenced by his intoxication. He was later found to have high levels of illicit drugs in his system. 

25The attack on the offender involved Anthony Zervas attempting to stab him with a pair of scissors. He managed to inflict some superficial injuries. From that point, however, all hell broke loose. Members of the two groups commenced to fight violently.

26The nature of the violence that erupted is best described by referring to some descriptions given by witnesses. One said, ""The group of them, they were all fighting one another. Then it started to move towards the check-in counters, towards the front glass doors. They were continually fighting. I heard things getting knocked over"" (T898). 

27Another witness said that she heard yelling and looked up and saw ""a rush of men coming through the little gaps between the counters""; seven or eight men; she then saw ""the group of men running through the barriers, the barriers were falling over, passengers scrambling to get out of the way, punching"" (T946).

28A witness who was using a self service check-in kiosk in front of the check-in counters said that she heard yelling and a lot of swearing, including ""I'm going to kill you, cunt"". She looked over her shoulder and saw ""someone like chasing someone and I saw them run through this part here [she indicated through the check-in counters] knocking over anything that was in their way. ... As they got slowed down by the people who dropped their bags off, it started breaking off into groups and then they started having their own little altercations, throwing punches, kicks, with barrier poles, signs, just about anything they could find"" (T1024 - 1025).

29The fighting moved from behind the check-in counters to the area at the front of the terminal. Witnesses described it as fighting between two groups with more men on one side than the other. There were references to it being an ""all in brawl"" with ""everybody"" punching. Bollards, normally clipped together with tape and used to guide queuing passengers, were unclipped and taken up and used as weapons in the fighting. These bollards have a heavy base and weigh 12 to 13 kilograms each.

30A further witness description appears to have captured the essence of the riot. An airline pilot who was standing at one of the self-service check-in machines said ""I saw approximately 12 to 16 males having - basically all fighting. They were fighting one on one, two on one, just a general brawl and melee is what I saw. I saw kicking, I saw punching and where these automatic kiosk check-in counters are there's a number of metal bollards holding ropes to organise the queues and I saw the metal bollards being thrown through the air and smashed on to people."" (T1052)

31The fighting, although short-lived, was shockingly vicious. One witness spoke of ""an explosion of fighting"" (T1281). This witness was sitting on a bench with her two very young children, one of whom was in a pram. She became ""frozen with fear"" and held her children close to protect them. Another witness said that she ""saw the large group of men fighting incredibly violently and aggressively"" (T2293). She said that the men were fighting in one group and then they split up into smaller groups.

32Another witness referred to the fighting as ""chaotic and quite wild and uncontrolled""; the men were ""raging, really angry"" (T1533-4). This witness and her companion fell over when he tried to pull her out of the way as the brawling continued into the area in front of the check-in counters. Her companion also gave evidence that there was a little girl in front of him who he grabbed and got out of the way. 

The fatal assault

33In the course of all of this, Anthony Zervas was pursued to the glass wall at the front of the terminal where he went to the ground. He was bludgeoned by at least one of the bollards and was stabbed in the chest and abdomen.

34There were three stab wounds, one inflicted by a pair of scissors and the others by either scissors or a knife. They caused injuries to the liver, stomach and right lung and caused significant internal bleeding. The head injuries were severe, including fracturing at the base of the skull, bleeding over the surface of the brain and bruising of the brain tissue. Mr Zervas received immediate emergency medical assistance but it was futile.

35The fatal assault upon Anthony Zervas was at the end of the riot. To the witnesses it no doubt seemed a lot longer but it was calculated from security camera footage to have taken less than a minute.

The Comancheros run away

36All of the Comancheros ran away. The offender fled to a taxi in which he, Menzies, La Rosa and AL got away and went to the offender's parents' home. Some of the others caught another taxi but were arrested a short time later in Brighton. The remainder took a circuitous route, running through the car park and back to the cars parked outside the lower level of the terminal from where they made good their escape.

37The offender was arrested by police and charged with affray on 6 April 2009. He was refused bail. A charge of riot was laid on 19 May 2009. He was released on bail the following day. The charge of murder was laid on 30 June 2009. He was refused bail and has remained in custody since.

Role of the offender

38It is necessary for me to determine the factual basis for which the offender is to be sentenced. 

39The Crown contended at trial that the offender was guilty of murder on any of three bases. First, because he was directly involved in the fatal assault upon the deceased in that he struck him with a bollard. Secondly, he was a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to inflict grievous bodily harm upon members of the Hells Angels. Thirdly, he was a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to assault members of the Hells Angels, with foresight of the possibility that one or more participants would intentionally inflict grievous bodily harm. 

40All six of the Comanchero accused were charged with murder but the offender was the only one found guilty. The jury acquitted Eken, Potrus and Kisacanin of both murder and manslaughter but found them guilty of riot. They acquitted Menzies and Abounader of murder but could not agree upon a verdict on manslaughter. Menzies subsequently pleaded guilty to manslaughter and has been sentenced. Abounader is to face a retrial in September.

41In the proceedings on sentence, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that I should find that the offender was directly involved in the fatal assault (CWS [7]). Mr Dunn QC submitted on behalf of the offender that I should not (DWS [52]), but no submission was made as to whether I should find that the offender's culpability was on the joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise basis.

The Comancheros were the aggressors

42Before dealing specifically with the offender, it should be noted that I am satisfied that the Comancheros were the aggressors in what occurred at both locations in the airport terminal. The general thrust of the defence case at trial was that the Hells Angels were more responsible. Some of the submissions made in support of this proposition were put again on sentence.

43A number of matters were said to support this. They included that the Zervas brothers travelled for about an hour from the Wollongong area in order to get to the airport. After the affray had occurred, Tom Baker at Gate 5 called Peter Martin who was in the departure hall, the inference being that he informed Mr Martin of the imminent emergence of the Comancheros into the departure hall. Anthony Zervas had armed himself with a pair of scissors. He brought a hooded jumper with him, on a warm day, which he put on, with the hood over his head, shortly before the confrontation in the departure hall occurred. During the crime scene examination, a knife and a set of knuckle-dusters were found on the terminal floor. It was submitted that these were more likely to have been brought by the Hells Angels who had not proceeded through any metal detecting screening point.

44The reference to such matters was very selective. The Comancheros went to considerable lengths to attend the airport as well. Seven of them dropped whatever it was they were doing and gathered in two cars. This activity started about an hour and a half before QF 430 landed. They did not go directly to the airport but attended a meeting at Brighton first. The meeting was with Daux Ngakuru and Rui Antao, senior members (the commander and nominee boss respectively) of the Milperra chapter of the Comancheros.

45It is correct that one Hells Angels member at Gate 5 called another Hells Angels member in the departure hall after the affray. But the same thing occurred in relation to the Comancheros between Aouli and Abounader. It may well be that Hells Angels members brought the knife and knuckle dusters that were dropped or discarded in the terminal but no-one saw them produced, let alone used. It was an undisputed fact that Fares Abounader brought a knife as well. It was a folding knife. He tried to use it, at least, but clumsily cut his own hand in the process. He dropped it into a drain outside the terminal when he fled.

46The Comancheros greatly outnumbered their rivals; by 10 to 3 in the vicinity of Gate 5 and by 12 to 7 in the departure hall. The 8th Hells Angel, Mr Wainohu, arrived at the conclusion of the riot. 

47All 12 of the Comancheros were charged with criminal offences and all but one of them have either pleaded guilty or have been found guilty variously of affray, riot, manslaughter and, in the case of the present offender, murder. By contrast, only 3 of the 8 Hells Angels were charged. The jury acquitted David Padovan of all charges. Musa Ovalle and Peter Zervas pleaded guilty and were sentenced in the Local Court for affray.

48I am satisfied from the facts I have recounted earlier that the Comancheros were the principal aggressors out of the two gangs. The Hells Angels probably came with the prospect of violence in mind, but it was a concern for violence that might be initiated by the Comancheros. Their president was outnumbered on the plane by 5 to 1.

The offender's involvement in the fatal assault

49Turning to the role played by the offender in relation to the death of the deceased, a starting point is that it is common ground that the offender was in the immediate vicinity of the fatal assault when it occurred. The video footage recorded by a tourist, known in the trial as the ""Deng footage"", was relied upon by counsel for the offender as showing that the offender was not involved in the fatal assault but was in fact ""running away towards the door"" (T4348.21. See also T4365.22; T4399.25). I have considered the submissions made in support of this contention and do not accept it. In my view, the footage simply showed the offender in the vicinity of the fatal assault, moving away from it. Indeed, in the course of his submissions on sentence, Mr Dunn conceded that ""moving"" rather than ""running"" was a more apt term (T25.36)

50The offender was moving away at a time when another man was raising his arms above his head and lowering them, accompanied by a loud banging noise. Witness descriptions were to the effect that a bollard was being held vertically and rammed downwards so that the base struck the deceased who was lying on his side on the ground. All that can be said about the appearance of that man in the footage is that he seemed to be quite tall and wore dark clothing on his upper body. Clearly, he was not the offender. I am satisfied that the man was one of the Comancheros, but, given the jury's verdicts, it would be inappropriate, and unnecessary in any event, to be more precise as to his identity.

51The evidence of two elderly witnesses (T2025 - 2052) was relied upon by the Crown as supporting the proposition that the offender was involved in the assault upon the deceased. Mr and Mrs Ireland were aged in their 80's. They were seated on a bench inside the front glass wall of the terminal. 

52Mr Ireland saw various aspects of the riot and the fatal assault, although of course, not everything. His observations included seeing a young man lying on the ground about two metres away from where he was seated and slightly to his left. The young man was lying on his side and seemed to be unconscious. He also saw a man in white trousers and a white T-shirt standing to the side of the young man, facing away from Mr Ireland. This man was ""tallish"" and ""well built"". I interpolate that Mr Hawi was the only one of the participants dressed all in white and the physical description was apt. 

53This man picked up a metal stand (a bollard) and it appeared to Mr Ireland that he was swinging it across his body from right to left in a slow motion. He said that he could have been hitting the young man on the ground but he could not be certain of this because his vision of the upper body of the young man was obscured. The man swung the bollard in this fashion two or three times. Mr Ireland said that he was not a golfer but it appeared to be like a putting motion. Mr Ireland was continually turning to check on his wife who was seated beside him, to his right, so he obviously did not see everything. At one point, he turned back and the man in white was gone. The young man was lying on the floor and there was blood in front of him and he appeared unconscious. 

54Like her husband, Mrs Ireland did not purport to see everything that occurred during the course of the riot and the fatal assault. After giving a general description of the noise and the fighting, she said that she saw a big man dressed all in white standing with his legs apart a few feet away. He had his back to her. She saw movement of an arm but nothing more. He was leaning over as if he was doing something but she could not see properly. After this man moved away, she saw a young man lying on the floor with blood near him. 

55The airport duty manager spoke with Mr and Mrs Ireland shortly after the riot had ended. She asked them if they had seen anything and Mr Ireland replied that he remembered a person dressed all in white who had ""arms as big as legs"" (T2054). In her closing address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor invited consideration of that evidence in conjunction with a photograph of the offender taken by police when he was arrested on 6 April 2009 (Exhibit GD). The description provided by Mr Ireland was a perfect match for the offender.

56The Crown relied upon other evidence to support the proposition that the offender was involved in the fatal assault. It is unnecessary to refer to more. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was in the immediate presence of the deceased when the assault occurred. I am not satisfied that he was the person who inflicted the blow, or blows, which caused the fractured skull. The person who did that was the person to whom I referred earlier who was tall and had dark clothing on his upper body. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender inflicted any blows at all. I am satisfied that the person referred to in the evidence of Mr and Mrs Ireland was the offender but they did not actually see any blows make contact with the deceased.

57I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what occurred was this. One of the Comancheros rammed a bollard into the head of the deceased one or more times by raising and lowering it and striking him with the base of it. This caused the fractured skull. The offender contributed to the actions of this man by either joining in the assault by attempting, at least, to strike the deceased, or by simply being there when it was occurring. His presence would undoubtedly have had the effect of authorising and approving the actions of the other man who bludgeoned Anthony Zervas to death. Having seen the deceased being dealt with in that fashion, he turned and walked towards the exit, exchanged some threats with Peter Zervas, and then hurriedly left.

Seriousness of the offences

58The affray at Gate 5 was relatively short-lived and none of those involved suffered serious injury. There was a large crowd of innocent bystanders of all ages ranging from children to the elderly. There were also a large number of combatants involved. I have observed in sentencing others that the evidence given by many of the witnesses left me with the clear impression that they were shocked and frightened that such violence could occur in such a place. These are prominent features of the offence and render it more serious than if it had been carried out elsewhere and otherwise. 

59I am satisfied that what started the affray was the offender punching Mr Wainohu. He was aware that his fellow Comanchero members would be likely to follow his lead, given his position of being the gang leader. For these reasons, his moral culpability for this offence is greater than for any of the others.

60There is a wide range of circumstances in which murders are committed. This offence was, as the Crown Prosecutor submitted, a very serious case of murder. It was not contended that it fell within the worst-case category, or near it. The Crown submission was that it was ""above mid-range"" (T28.49) whereas Mr Dunn submitted it was of ""midway seriousness"" (T25.1).

61I accept that the killing was not something that was planned. It was, however, the product of actions of the offender that created the high possibility of a very violent confrontation between members of two outlaw motorcycle gangs in a very public place.

62There were a large number of eyewitnesses; members of the travelling public and airline and airport staff. They had the misfortune to witness what must have been a most terrifying incident in a place where they were entitled to expect safety and security.

63The witness who was trying to protect her two small children said that she went into shock and felt like she could not breathe (T1288). Her husband described her as being ""really distressed, yelling, crying"" (T1314). Another witness said that the mother was ""clearly ... very distressed and looked quite shocked and she burst into tears"". This witness added,"" I suppose I became distressed myself"" (T2513). An elderly woman said that she had to turn away because she ""got too distressed because [she had] never experienced anything like this"" (T1353). Mr and Mrs Ireland, seated so close to the fatal assault, were observed to have been in distress (T1676). One of the first police officers on the scene said that a number of the members of the public who were present ""appeared distressed and upset"" (T2518). It was necessary for Qantas to arrange for counsellors to be brought in (T1746).

64The offender, and his Comanchero colleagues, displayed a flagrant disregard, not only for the law, but also for the many witnesses in whose memories of the incident will live long, notwithstanding that it took less than a minute.

65The jury obviously rejected the offender's claim to self-defence, which was relied upon even though he denied involvement in the fatal assault. It was submitted on sentence that I should find that the offender was provoked, or acted under duress, because the deceased had attacked him. I reject that submission. In my view, the deceased was killed in an act of retribution because he had the temerity to attack the president of the Comancheros. Nobody was going to get away with doing that, least of all someone of the deceased's stature.

66The Crown's position that the offence is not in, or near, the worst category of cases, is a realistic and responsible one. However, I have concluded that the offence is of considerable seriousness, above the middle of the range.

Victim impact

67The deceased's mother, Ms Frederica Bromwich, prepared a victim impact statement. It was read to the Court on her behalf. The grief that Ms Bromwich has suffered over the loss of her son, ""her angel"" as she described him, is almost beyond comprehension. I reiterate that my sincere condolences go to Ms Bromwich and her family.

Subjective features

68The evidence before me as to the offender's personal circumstances comprises criminal and custodial history printouts, a Corrective Services inmate profile, an affidavit of Ms Carolina Gonzales, a report by forensic psychologist Mr Tim Watson-Munro, medical reports concerning the offender's wife and mother and a number of testimonials.

69The offender was born in Beirut, Lebanon in June 1980. He is now 31 years old and was 28 at the time of the offences.

70He has a close relationship with his parents, brother and three sisters. The family moved to Australia in 1985 and the offender had an uneventful, if meagre childhood as the family settled in Sydney's southern suburbs.

71After obtaining his School Certificate at the age of about 16, he left high school to attend TAFE and take an apprenticeship in his father's spray painting business where he worked for 3 to 4 years. He then bought a car detailing business with the family before establishing a refrigerated transport company in 2007 that he was running up until he went into custody. By all accounts, this was a successful business that also employed the offender's father. However, business has all but ceased operation since he was remanded in custody.

72The offender does not have a history of drug or alcohol abuse. He appears to have led a settled life, characterised by self-employment and involvement with his family. He began his relationship with his wife, Carolina Gonzales, in 1995 while they were both still at school. In 2002 they were married and have two sons together aged 8 and 2½ years old. Their second son was born shortly after the offender was arrested for murder and remanded in custody. Prior to the offender's incarceration they were living together at their home at Bexley.

73Mr Watson-Munro stated that the offender appears to have reflected on the impact that the affray and the death of Mr Zervas must have had on the general public. He has exhibited some regret referrable to the deceased and accepted responsibility for the affray, although he has not demonstrated remorse or accepted responsibility for the death of the deceased. Mr Watson-Munro also stated that the offender is suffering Chronic Anxiety Disorder referable to his incarceration, compounded by depression in connection with separation from his family. 

74This is the offender's first period of full-time imprisonment. His criminal history includes a finding of guilt for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 1996 in the Children's Court when he was 16 years old. For that offence, he received a fine and a community service order. He has also been convicted for a number of driving offences, and received penalties which included a 3 month suspended sentence of imprisonment for driving while disqualified. He has also been fined for using offensive language and, most recently in 2005, was fined for possession of a prescribed restricted substance. Having regard to the nature of these offences and when they were committed, this is not a significant record of prior convictions. 

75The testimonials confirm that the offender enjoys the continued support of his wife, family and friends. He has earned the reputation of a man committed to his family and supportive of his friends. The authors speak of various other positive personal qualities as well. An additional feature that Mr Dunn emphasised in his submissions was that the offender has not been involved in any disciplinary incidents since he has been incarcerated.

76The offender joined the Comancheros when he was 18 years old; his interest in motorcycles was the impetus for joining. By the age of 22 he was the national president; a position he held until his incarceration. He told Mr Watson-Munro that since going into custody he no longer holds office but remains a member.

Family hardship

77It was submitted by Mr Dunn that the family has suffered considerable financial and health difficulties since the offender has been remanded in custody. In her affidavit, Ms Gonzales states that the incarceration and trial of her husband has impacted on the health of herself and her sons. Medical reports indicate that she is suffering ill health that is likely related to the stress caused by these events. This was supported by a number of the testimonials. I was also provided with evidence indicating that the offender's mother suffers a number of medical conditions.

78In written submissions it was put that family hardship was a matter that I should take into account. However, Mr Dunn accepted in oral submissions that such hardship was not of an exceptional kind, as required by the authorities, which could be taken into account as a discrete consideration. It is a sad fact that it is often the case that an offender's family will endure the burden and distress of separation from a partner, parent, or breadwinner. Similarly, the submission that these matters would make being in custody more onerous for the offender cannot be accepted; they are the common experience of many offenders.

Character

79It put in written submissions that I should take into account that the offender was of prior good character but that was abandoned in oral submissions by Mr Dunn (T32.7). That was a realistic concession. Having been the national president of an outlaw motorcycle gang, the offender is a person I would want to know a lot more about than is disclosed in the evidence before such a finding could be made in his favour.

Rehabilitation prospects and likelihood of re-offending

80It was submitted that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. While it is difficult to predict future behaviour, the support that the offender receives from his family, his strong record of employment, no history of drug or alcohol abuse, and absence of significant previous convictions all support the submission. His lack of genuine remorse and continued membership of the Comancheros are to the contrary. The most I can conclude is that the prospects of rehabilitation and not re-offending are reasonable.

Pre-sentence custody

81It is agreed that the offender's sentence should be backdated to 16 May 2009 in order to take into account the period in which he has been in custody already.

82It was submitted that I should take into account that the offender has been ""in segregation"" for a part of that time. Written submissions asserted that he was ""in segregation"" for 6 weeks and 2 days until he was released on bail and then for a further 6 months and 3 weeks after he was returned to custody; a total of about 8 to 9 months. The offender told Mr Watson-Munro that he had spent ""9½ months in solitary confinement"". He said that this involved ""24 hours a day locked down in his cell"".

83Detective Walpole gave evidence about this and a document from Corrective Services NSW was tendered. The document indicates that the offender was classified as ""Prisoner Restricted Non-Association"" (PRNA) from 1 July until 5 November 2009 and then as ""Prisoner Restricted Limited Association"" (PRLA) from 6 November 2009 until 17 February 2010. Detective Walpole explained that PRNA status meant that the offender had no association with any other inmate. He was confined to a cell for 20 hours per day and had his own courtyard and cooking facilities. He also had access to library facilities and was able to receive visitors. PRLA did not mean ""segregation"" at all. It meant that the offender was able to associate with other prisoners who were not considered a threat to him; he had access to library, cooking and exercise facilities; and he was able to receive visitors. This evidence showed that what the offender told Mr Watson-Munro was untrue. I will take into account that he was subject to some restrictions in his custodial environment for the first 9 months but, in the scheme of things, it is of minimal significance.

84It was also submitted that I should take into account the onerous conditions of the offender's custody during the trial. I assume the submission was intended to include the committal hearing as well. Combined, the committal and trial ran for about 9 months. The offender was required to rise early and was not returned to his cell until late. During the 5 weeks of the jury's deliberations he was required to remain in the court cells, on many days without being brought up to court at all. I have indicated in sentencing others that I did not think this was a major consideration but was something I would take into account. I will do so in the offender's case as well.

Willingness to plead guilty

85I was informed that in April 2011, that is, just before the trial was due to commence, the offender offered to plead guilty to affray and manslaughter. The Crown rejected the offer. It seems reasonable to infer that the offer to plead to affray was contingent upon the Crown accepting the plea to manslaughter in lieu of murder. In the end, the offender pleaded not guilty to affray but was found guilty. I indicated at the sentence hearing that I would take this into account but it seems to be a matter of little significance. The offer to plead to manslaughter is of no significance.

Nature and relationship of the two sentences

86I propose to accumulate the sentence for the murder upon the sentence for the affray in order to recognise that they were two distinct offences. However, because they were committed in a similar context and within a fairly short period of time, the degree of accumulation will be relatively modest.

87I will impose a fixed term of imprisonment for the affray as there will be no utility in setting a non-parole period. I will be imposing a sentence that reflects the total term appropriate for that offence and not adopting what I regard as the anomalous approach of setting a term that reflects what would have been the non-parole period. That approach is anomalous because s 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act authorises a court to decline to set a non-parole period, not to reduce the sentence.

Special circumstances

88It was submitted that I should find that there are special circumstances warranting a reduction in the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period. The circumstances referred to were ""all of the mitigating factors referred to in [Mr Dunn's] written submissions"". Specific reference was made to the nature of the offender's prior criminal record; that he has a wife and 2 children; he has strong family ties; he has conducted himself in an exemplary fashion in the prison environment; and the lengthy period of time in which he has been in custody since his arrest. I have taken all of these matters into account in determining the total term of the sentence. It would be double counting to take them into account again in reducing the non-parole period. The parole period that will be part of the sentence will be more than adequate to assist the offender's adjustment and rehabilitation within the community following release. I do not propose to make any adjustment because of the partial accumulation of sentences in order to maintain the usual statutory proportions in the aggregate sentence. Such an adjustment would be trivial.

Sentence

On each: Convicted.

Affray: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years 6 months. The sentence is to date from 16 May 2009 and expire on 15 November 2012.

Murder: Sentence to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 21 years and a balance of the term of the sentence of 7 years. The sentence is to date from 16 November 2009. The offender will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 15 November 2030. The total term will expire on 15 November 2037.

2759004,Frederick Paval ENRIQUEZ v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 60,"Judgment

1MCCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Garling J.

2DAVIES J: I agree with Garling J. 

3GARLING J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court by her Honour Judge English, on 21 February 2011.

4The applicant Frederick Paval Enriquez pleaded guilty before English DCJ to one offence contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900. 

5The offence occurred on 22 October 2009, when Mr Enriquez had sexual intercourse with TF without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting and in circumstances of aggravation, namely that TF was person under the age of 16 years. 

6The maximum penalty for the offence is 20 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 10 years is applicable.

7As well as the offence to which he pleaded guilty, the applicant asked English DCJ to take into account one further charge of attempted aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, which was placed upon a List of Additional Charges (Form 1) pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

8The sentencing Judge imposed an overall sentence of 8 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 14 April 2010. 

Facts

9A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered to the sentencing Judge. A brief summary of these facts is set out below.

10In 1998, TF's mother became involved in a relationship with the applicant. They lived together with TF and her siblings at St Clair until September 2008 when the relationship between TF's mother and the applicant ended. 

11About a year later, in October 2009, TF who was then 15 years old, was at home looking after her two siblings whilst her mother was at work on nightshift. 

12TF, on the evening of Wednesday 21 October 2009, went to sleep in her mother's bedroom. At about 3am on Thursday 22 October 2009, TF woke to find the applicant standing next to the bed touching her leg. She got out of the bed and ran to the bedroom door, but the applicant closed the door and prevented her from escaping. 

13The applicant then removed his penis from his shorts and attempted to force TF to engage in fellatio. She pushed him away but did not call out because she did not want her brother to hear. This conduct formed the offence of attempted aggravated sexual assault which was placed on the List of Additional Charges (Form 1). 

14The offender left the room and TF believed he had left the residence. She returned to bed and fell asleep. 

15A short time later, TF awoke to find the applicant standing at the end of the bed without any clothes on. The applicant closed and locked the bedroom door. He then climbed into the bed where TF had been sleeping. She tried to move away from him, but he took hold of her physically and prevented her from getting off the bed. He then forcibly removed her underwear. TF resisted until her legs cramped and she could no longer prevent the applicant from removing her underwear. The applicant then lay on top of TF, pinning her to the bed with his arm and then engaged in a penetrative act of penile-vaginal intercourse. This conduct constituted the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty.

16TF ran away and locked herself in the toilet, and when she believed that the applicant had left, she returned to the bed and again fell asleep. 

17The applicant was discovered naked in bed next to TF the next morning when TF's mother returned from work.

18TF was taken to hospital for a medical assessment, police were notified and investigations were undertaken.

19On 28 October 2009, the applicant attended the police station of his own volition, where he was placed under arrest.

Applicant's Submissions on Sentence

20The applicant agreed with the facts to which I have just made reference. On sentence, he gave evidence himself and relied upon the contents of a report from a clinical psychologist, Mr Tim Watson-Munro. As well, submissions were made on his behalf by his counsel. 

21The applicant in his evidence accepted his responsibility for what occurred and proffered publicly an apology to TF. He denied any memory of what had happened that night, but accepted that by reason of the fact that his DNA was found in semen detected in swabs taken from TF, that he was the person who had undertaken the assault. 

22He gave evidence to the sentencing Judge that he had a drug problem, that for a period of about two years leading up to the offence he had been using ice. However, he made it clear that he was not using his drug taking as a reason for the reduction in his culpability for the offence. 

23It would appear from Mr Watson-Munro's report that the applicant had long-standing symptoms of depression, anxiety and low self-esteem and was a person who had, for many year prior to this offence, a long-standing gambling addiction.

24Mr Watson-Munro concluded his report in these terms:

""It is clear that he has been suffering from a broad band of symptoms reflective of an Adjustment Disorder according to DSM-IV TR criteria. In addition, he has previous suffered from severe Substance Abuse Disorder involving primarily 'Ice' which is now in partial remission as well as a Gambling Addiction in the past. ... His current situation and his remorse are aggravating his symptoms of depression, anxiety and self-esteem.""

25The following subjective matters were before the sentencing Judge. The applicant was born in the Philippines in March 1970. He has two sisters who live in the United States of America. He came to Australia at the beginning of Year 5 at the age of 11 and had difficulty making the necessary cultural adjustment, largely because he spoke no English and he was exposed to a divergent society. He continued his schooling until he completed his HSC at Westfield High School. He was not an academic student but gained employment after completing school and remained employed in a number of jobs over the years until about 6 months prior to his arrest. By that time, he found it impossible to remain at work because of his drug addiction. 

26During the sentencing hearing, his former partner, Ms Bell, with whom he had two sons, who were 16 and 15 at the time, gave evidence. Although their relationship had long since ceased, she remained supportive of the applicant and visited him regularly in jail, including taking his mother and his sons to visit him. 

27Ms Bell gave compelling evidence about the applicant's remorse, and his continuing attempts to be a father to his teenage children.

28In the course of submissions, the sentencing judge was informed that after his initial arrest, the applicant had been in custody from 28 October 2009 to 15 February 2010, when he was released on bail. He remained on bail until he was rearrested for a breach of conditions of bail on 2 August 2010. He remained in custody at all times after that re-arrest. 

29The effect of this broken pre-sentence custodial history was that the sentence was backdated to reflect his time spent in custody. It was for that reason that her Honour, without complaint in this Court or below, fixed the commencement date of the applicant's sentence as being 14 April 2010. 

Other Subjective Matters

30The applicant was born on 20 March 1970 and was aged 39 at the time of the offence. 

31He had a history of minor crimes. These minor crimes were dealt with by way of fines, an order for compensation, and a bond for a period of 9 months with respect to a motor traffic offence.

32The applicant told Mr Watson-Munro that he had been drug free after he was bailed on 15 February 2010, and claimed to Mr Watson-Munro that he had remained drug free during the time he had been returned to custody.

Remarks on Sentencing

33The sentencing Judge found that the applicant's criminal behaviour was reprehensible. In dealing with the seriousness of the criminality, her Honour noted that the offence had occurred in TF's home, and that, because of the relationship that existed with the applicant as her stepfather, TF was under his authority because he had been a person who had been the head of the household. The sentencing Judge found that ordinarily TF was required to do what she was told by the applicant in the normal course of the family situation. This was an abuse of trust.

34Her Honour found that the applicant knew that there was no adult in the house at the time he visited the house to engage in the conduct that he did. The sentencing Judge found that in all of the circumstances TF was a vulnerable person. 

35Her Honour concluded that the offence was carried out for the applicant's own sexual gratification and for no other reason. She concluded that the offence fell within the mid-range of offences. 

36Her Honour accepted that the applicant had long-standing symptoms of depression, anxiety and low self-esteem but concluded that these were not matters that would make the applicant a person for whom less weight should be given to the principle of general deterrence. 

37Her Honour noted that the applicant was not a person of previous good character by reason of his criminal history. However, she found that that record did not aggravate the offence, but rather tempered any leniency to which the applicant would otherwise be entitled. 

38In summary, she said of the applicant's offence:

""This appears to be an opportunistic offence to prey upon his step-daughter for his own sexual gratification in circumstances where aid was not readily available to her had she called out for help.""

39Her Honour noted that the applicant had entered a plea of guilty, but concluded, in line with the Crown's submissions, that it had not been entered at the first available opportunity but nevertheless still had significant utilitarian value. She allowed a 15 per cent discount to the applicant by reason of that plea. 

40She found that the applicant was remorseful and contrite and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation that would require attendance at drug and gambling counselling to ensure the risk of relapse was minimised.

41Her Honour concluded that there was a need to ensure that the penalty imposed reflected not just the offence to which the applicant had pleaded guilty but also to the offence that was placed on the Form 1.

42Finally, her Honour found special circumstances by reason of the applicant's age, the fact that he was being held in custody for the first time and that he would need a lengthier than normal period of supervised parole to assist with his rehabilitation.

Grounds of Appeal

43Four grounds were contained in the Notice of Grounds of Appeal filed by the applicant. They were:

(1)that her Honour erred in finding that the sentences were above mid-range in terms of seriousness;

(2)that her Honour made findings of fact which were not based on any evidence;

(3)that her Honour made a finding that the applicant was not a person of good character and was therefore not entitled to leniency on that basis;

(4)that both the head sentence and the non-parole period were excessive.

Ground 1 - Erroneous Finding on Objective Seriousness

44This Ground, which asserted that the learned sentencing Judge had found, erroneously, that the applicant's criminality was above the mid-range of seriousness, was abandoned at the hearing of the appeal.

45This was unsurprising since her Honour made no such finding. 

46The Ground requires no further consideration.

Ground 2 - Findings of Fact not based on any Evidence

47The applicant submits that included in her Honour's Remarks on Sentence, are the following remarks, which were not supported by any evidence before the sentencing Judge:

""This young girl will suffer for the rest of her life from the vile actions of this offender. ... The impact upon her in later life is likely to be an inability to trust men, to form satisfactory relationships and it may well impact upon her ability to bond with her own children. All through no fault of her own.""

48It was submitted that, in short, there was no evidence to support any of these future possibilities. It may be accepted that there was no specific evidence provided with respect to TF that would support these conclusions.

49However, having regard to the nature of this offence, and the well-known effects of an offence of this kind on the development of teenagers and young adults, I think that it was open to her Honour to draw on her general experience of the consequences of an offence of this kind to raise any of these matters as a prospect for TF in the future.

50Her Honour's approach accords with, and is supported by, the judgment of this Court in R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 28 at [19]. See also R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 565.

51I can detect no error in her Honour referring in such terms to the possible outcome of the criminal conduct upon TF's future psychological well being. 

52I would not uphold the appeal on this Ground.

Ground 3 - Past Character

53The applicant submitted that the conclusion that the applicant was ""not a person of otherwise good character"" was not fairly open to the sentencing Judge because such remarks were based on his prior criminal history, which was, it was submitted, a minor one. 

54The applicant submitted that the offences of which he had been convicted, in the past, were 

""... not of such a nature nor of such magnitude as to disentitle him from leniency."" 

The applicant submitted that this was an error in the sentencing process.

55It seems to me that what her Honour was doing in making these remarks, was drawing to attention to the fact that under s 21A(3)(f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, a matter to be taken into account in mitigation of penalty is the previous good character of any offender. What her Honour was remarking was that, because the applicant was not of previous good character because he had a criminal record, there was no basis upon which there could be any mitigation of penalty by reason of this feature. She specifically noted that his past criminal history did not aggravate the offence.

56I can detect no error in her Honour's dealing with this issue. 

57I would not uphold the appeal on this Ground.

Ground 4 - Manifest Excess

58It was submitted that both the non-parole period and the balance of term were manifestly excessive. This submission in large part relied upon statistics from the Judicial Commission of NSW. 

59Considerable circumspection is necessary in taking into account and relying upon, statistics of the kind that the applicant provides. In particular, with offences against s 61J of the Crimes Act, there is, commonly, a significant variation between the facts and objective criminality of each offence. 

60It is necessary for this Court when considering a particular sentence to have specific regard to the individual features which underpin the particular sentence. Obviously, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved and the culpability of the offender assume principal importance. 

61As the sentencing Judge correctly noted, this was a serious offence. There were a number of aggravating factors relating to TF's age, the fact that she was in her own home, the fact that the applicant knew that there would be no adult present and that accordingly, TF was vulnerable at the time. The previous familial relationship of stepfather and stepdaughter also placed TF in a vulnerable position when compared with the applicant. The conduct of the applicant amounted to a breach of trust.

62The offence that the sentencing Judge was asked to take into account on the Form 1 was similarly a very serious attempt at an aggravated sexual assault. If nothing else, TF's response to this attempt would have placed the applicant fairly on notice that what he was doing was wrong and that TF was having no part in any of it.

63But the applicant was not deterred, he returned and then perpetrated what is, on the agreed facts, a violent attack and sexual assault on TF. 

64Accepting that the applicant has good prospects of rehabilitation, I am unable to conclude that the sentence imposed by the learned sentencing Judge was so far outside the appropriate range as to justify the description ""manifestly excessive"" and that there must therefore have been a failure to correctly exercise the sentencing discretion.

65Nor am I persuaded that any lesser sentence is warranted as a matter of law: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

66I would not uphold the appeal on this Ground.

Orders

67I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted

(2)Appeal dismissed.

		11 April 2012",2012-04-10 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759005,Sleiman v R [2012] NSWCCA 58,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Garling J.

2DAVIES J: I agree with Garling J. 

3GARLING J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court by his Honour Justice Charteris on 14 April 2011.

4The applicant, Mr Omar Sleiman, pleaded guilty before Charteris DCJ to one offence contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 

5The offence related to the fact that on 23 June 2010 at Granville, Mr Sleiman knowingly took part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely, 21.8 grams of methylamphetamine. 

6The maximum penalty for the offence is 15 years imprisonment and/or a $220,000 fine. No standard non-parole period applies.

7As well as the offence to which he pleaded guilty, the applicant asked Charteris DCJ to take into account 11 further offences which were placed upon a List of Additional Charges (Form 1) pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

8The sentencing judge imposed an overall sentence of 4 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 23 June 2010, which was the date upon which the applicant was arrested and bail was refused. 

Facts

9The Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered to the sentencing judge. A brief summary of these facts is set out below.

10At about lunchtime on 23 June 2010, the police whilst patrolling at the Vauxhall Inn Hotel, came across the applicant in the gaming area. With due cause, the applicant was searched. Concealed about the applicant's clothing were 20 small resealable plastic bags containing methylamphetamine. 

11A shoulder bag that the applicant was carrying was found to contain 4.8 grams of cannabis in 5 resealable bags, 10 bags of methylamphetamine and $1,290 in a cash bundle.

12A search of the applicant's motor vehicle parked at the hotel revealed a sum of $5,000 in $50 notes. 

13The total of the methylamphetamine in all of the recovered bags was 21.8 grams. The total of the cash was $6,290.

14A search was undertaken pursuant to a warrant at the applicant's premises at Auburn. That search of his bedroom found 7 different sorts of illegal drugs. This led to a number of the charges on the Form 1. As well, the police found a box of ammunition for which the applicant did not have a permit and some goods, which the police reasonably believed were stolen. These goods included Myer Gift Cards, two laptop computers and a NSW driver's licence in the name of another person. These goods and the ammunition also formed the subject of charges put on the Form 1. As well, the police recovered a set of digital scales.

15The accused was arrested on 23 June 2010, and then charged later that day with knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug.

16He pleaded guilty to that offence on 28 October 2010 in the Local Court.

Applicant's Submissions on Sentence

17The applicant agreed with the facts to which I have made reference. On sentence he gave evidence himself and relied upon the contents of a report from a clinical psychologist, Ms De Santa Brigida. As well, submissions were made on his behalf by his counsel. 

18The applicant in his evidence accepted that he had come from a close family, that he had abused illicit drugs for a lengthy period and that although he had tried to reform his ways, he had not done so effectively. He admitted that he had continued to use drugs whilst in jail and that although he had intentions of changing his life to avoid the use of drugs, he accepted that he had not yet done so.

19The report from Ms De Santa Brigida noted a long history of illicit substance abuse and dependency starting at the age of 18. By the time he came to be sentenced, the applicant was 35 years old. His history of illicit substance abuse covered the use of cannabis, ecstasy, cocaine and crystal methamphetamine (ice). The applicant had no history of childhood disorders and no history of psychological or psychiatric problems. 

20He gave a history to the psychologist, which he repeated in evidence, that in 2002 his younger brother, Mahmoud had disappeared and was presumed to have been murdered. This event precipitated an increase in his drug use. It also apparently caused him to become depressed and he used this state of depression as a reason for increasing his drug use.

21It was apparent from the psychologist's report that the applicant came from a stable family background. He was one of four children, being the second youngest. He had been schooled to Year 10 and then completed a three year apprenticeship in panel beating. He terminated that apprenticeship due to asthma.

22Around 1995 the applicant took out a mobile telephone store franchise and operated his business first from Chatswood, and then after a period of five years, at Penrith. He closed his business following the disappearance of his younger brother. 

23Ms De Santa Brigida concluded:

""In summary, Mr Sleiman has an extensive history of substance abuse and dependence ... he meets the criteria for Cannabis, Cocaine, Hallucinogen, Amphetamine and Opioid Dependence. He also meets the criteria for Cocaine and Amphetamine Induced Psychotic Disorder. 

As stated, Mr Sleiman already had a history of substance abuse and dependence prior to his brother's disappearance in 2002. Despite this, he was able to operate a successful phone franchise up until his Brother's disappearance. However, the onset of Depression, bereavement and a trauma response following his brother's disappearance has seen him close the business. I note that in response to his Brother's disappearance, Mr Sleiman's use of illicit substances has escalated dramatically.

In my opinion, it is not possible to address Mr Sleiman's substance abuse and dependency without first addressing his trauma and unresolved bereavement problems.""

24During submissions on sentence, Mr Peluso, who appeared for the applicant, conceded that there were certain features of, and surrounding, the applicant's conduct which aggravated it. He accepted that these features ought to be taken into account by the sentencing Judge. 

25He conceded that the applicant's conduct was part of an organised criminal enterprise. He conceded that the applicant's conduct occurred at a time when he was on bail 

""...to an offence of custody of knife and a further offence of carrying an offensive weapon.""

26He also conceded that the offences listed on the Form 1 were matters which the sentencing Judge was entitled to take into account on aggravation of the penalty which he was to impose, having regard to the number of those offences and their nature.

27Mr Peluso also accepted that the criminal history of his client was a factor that the Court was entitled to take into account in forming a view as to his likely prospects of rehabilitation. 

28By way of mitigation, Mr Peluso submitted that the Court would find, and the Crown agreed, that the plea of guilty had been entered at the earliest available opportunity. 

29As well, the applicant had undertaken to give evidence in a trial against two accused who were charged with murder. The applicant had volunteered a statement and had volunteered to give evidence. The Crown agreed with the applicant's counsel that:

""... there is obviously a great benefit to the community, to police from people who provide assistance of this nature, especially in a matter such as the one that he did.""

Subjective Features

30The applicant was born on 4 December 1975 and was aged 34 years at the time of the offence.

31He has a long history of previous offences and convictions commencing in 1994 when he was 19 years old. His record included minor stealing and motor vehicle offences, a robbery in 1996 for which he received a sentence of imprisonment of 18 months to be served by way of periodic detention, an offence of supplying a prohibited drug for which he was sentenced in 2000 to a period of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 9 months and a 15 months balance of term. In August 2007, for a further offence of supplying a prohibited drug, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 months with an additional period of 9 months. 

32As well, there were some other offences for being in possession of a prohibited drug. 

33When giving evidence on sentence, the applicant said that he had resolved to reform because he had a 10 year old son for whose upbringing he was responsible and that he wished to rectify his past misdeeds. 

Remarks on Sentencing

34The sentencing Judge found that the applicant's criminal behaviour was very serious. With respect to the criminality of the offence, the trial judge was satisfied that the applicant was ""... clearly occupying the role of a drug dealer "". This seems to have been based upon the following facts to which the sentencing Judge referred:

""... he had illicit drugs on him, and in the car nearby; he had illicit drugs revealed in the search of his residence. He had all the paraphernalia one would associate with a drug dealer.""

35The sentencing Judge accepted that the purpose of the applicant's dealing in drugs was to satisfy his own need for the taking of illicit drugs. 

36When dealing with the applicant's past criminal history, the sentencing judge found that the applicant had three previous offences in relation to serious drug matters. He noted that he had been convicted of supplying a prohibited drug in 2000, 2006 and 2007. 

37He also noted that at the time of the offences for which the applicant was being sentenced, he was on bail as a consequence of having been arrested on 28 January 2010 on charges that he had custody of an offensive instrument in a public place and, as well, custody of a knife in a public place. 

38The sentencing Judge observed that the fact that the applicant was on conditional liberty ""... must aggravate the penalty that I impose"".

39As I have earlier noted, the sentencing Judge did not find the applicant's criminal history to be an aggravating matter, but simply that it did not entitle him to leniency. 

40The sentencing Judge noted, having taken account of the applicant's age, that the applicant had not responded to earlier attempts at rehabilitation and that he did not seem to have been deterred from undertaking drug supply by periods of imprisonment in the past. 

41His Honour allowed a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea of guilty. In addition to that discount, the sentencing judge allowed a further discount of 15 per cent to reflect the applicant's cooperation with the authorities.

42He found that special circumstances were established and accordingly, that the non-parole period should be less than 75 per cent of the total sentence. 

Grounds of Appeal

43Four grounds of appeal were relied upon by the applicant:

(1)His Honour erred in finding that the applicant had been sentenced to three previous serious (supply) drug matters.

(2)His Honour erred with respect to his factual findings with respect to the objective criminality of the offence.

(3)Manifest excess.

(4)His Honour erred when he held that the applicant was on bail when he committed the subject offence.

Ground 1 - Erroneous Criminal History

44This ground complains of an error in the sentencing Judge's finding that the applicant's past criminal history included three separate instances of serious (supply) drug matters. 

45It is clear that the sentencing Judge erroneously reached the conclusion that there had been three previous drug supply offences on the applicant's record.

46It is accepted by the Crown that this conclusion was erroneous because the offence of supply to which his Honour referred as having been the subject of a sentence on 18 December 2006, was in fact the same offence for which he was re-sentenced on 17 August 2007. These were not two separate occasions of supply, but were rather two sentences, the first by the Drug Court and the second when the applicant was removed from the Drug Court's program. 

47The sentencing Judge relied upon the finding of three previous serious (supply) drug matters in two ways. The first of those was when he concluded that the applicant's past criminal history did not entitle the applicant to leniency. I note that his Honour did not find that the past criminal history was an aggravating matter. 

48It seems to me that whether the applicant had been guilty of two past serious drug supply matters or three, is of no significant weight in the determination of the sentencing Judge when he found that the applicant's past record did not entitle him to leniency. That conclusion was the correct conclusion whether the applicant had either two or three previous serious drug supply matters.

49The second way in which the sentencing Judge used his conclusion that there were three previous convictions was in two comments to be found in the Remarks on Sentence. The first was when his Honour said:

""It is regrettable that his record shows that he has been before this Court on other occasions for supply of illicit drugs ... He does not seem to have been deterred by periods of imprisonment given for drug supply on the previous occasions.""

The sentencing Judge further said:

""I must punish the offender ... I must protect our community from him, I must personally deter him from behaving in this way in the future ... It is apparent that the offender has not 'got the message' so to speak, from earlier punishments imposed upon him. I am satisfied that I must give weight to the need for personal deterrence.""

50The use by the sentencing Judge of the applicant's past criminal history, in these circumstances, is to form the conclusion that weight must be given to the need for personal deterrence. 

51This obviously correct conclusion, having regard to the totality of the applicant's previous criminal history, and the admissions which he made as to his ongoing drug taking whilst in custody, would be the same whether the applicant had two or three instances separately, of convictions for the supplying of drugs.

52While I accept that the trial judge has made the error to which the appellant has drawn attention by this ground, I am not satisfied that the error has led to any erroneous conclusion. In other words, the conclusions which the sentencing Judge has reached were properly founded on all of the evidence which was correctly before the Court. Such error as the trial Judge has made, is entirely inconsequential.

53I would not be disposed to allow the appeal on this Ground.

Ground 2 - Objective Criminality of the Offence

54The trial Judge concluded that the criminality involved was serious and that the applicant was clearly occupying the role of a drug dealer. This was a conclusion which was properly open to him on the facts. Four matters of fact supported the conclusion:

(a)the quantity of drugs found in the applicant's possession;

(b)a large number of empty resealable bags found in his possession;

(c)a set of electronic scales capable of being used for the weighing of drugs found in his home; and

(d)the money found in his possession.

55It is submitted that in support of the conclusion that the applicant was occupying the role of a drug dealer, the trial Judge referred, erroneously, to the fact that the applicant had an ""array"" of drugs, and that illicit drugs were found in the applicant's motor vehicle and in the search of his residence.

56The applicant submits that these additional findings suggest that the sentencing Judge regarded the seriousness of the applicant's conduct as much more than that which he was entitled to do because the applicant's only charge of supply was one dealing with methylamphetamine. The applicant submitted that he was not charged with supply of multiple types of drugs, nor was he charged with supply of any of the drugs found in his home. I note that there were no drugs found in his motor vehicle. Thus, the applicant submits, the sentencing Judge's remarks were ill founded. 

57On the other hand, the evidence supported the trial Judge's conclusion that the applicant's possession of the methylamphetamine was spread amongst many separate bags, some of which were of different sizes and no doubt those bags would, in the ordinary use of the word ""array"" have been available to be arranged in a regular order, something which accords with the dictionary definition of ""array"".

58Whilst the applicant's submissions on this Ground point to some expressions in the Remarks on Sentence which may suggest some infelicity of language, I am not satisfied that the conclusions of the Judge were not open to him nor that they were incorrect.

59It seems clear that the conclusion reached by the trial Judge with respect to the seriousness of the offence, was expressed in a way which recognised that the applicant's involvement in the offence for which he was being sentenced, came about because of the need to feed his own chronic drug habit. 

60I would not be prepared to uphold the appeal on this Ground.

Ground 4 - Error in Finding that the Applicant was on Conditional Liberty when Offence was Committed.

61It is convenient to consider this ground next. 

62The applicant complains that the sentencing Judge erroneously concluded that he had committed the offence for which he was being sentenced whilst he was on bail for two earlier offences. This factual conclusion of the trial Judge arose because of what he was told by counsel for the Crown and the applicant who were then appearing before him. 

63The exchange between counsel and the Bench was:

""[Crown]: I should also at this stage note your Honour that the coversheet towards the bottom doesn't note that the offender was on bail at the time of the offence. He actually was on bail to an offence of custody of knife and a further offence of carrying offensive weapon. I think that's agreed by my friend. 

Peluso: That's so your Honour, agreed.""

64Counsel for the Crown and for the applicant then went on to inform his Honour that the applicant had been dealt with by the Court in respect of those original offences. 

65In this Court, both counsel for the applicant and counsel for the Crown agreed that what their predecessors told the sentencing Judge was erroneous, because although the applicant had been required to attend Court by means of a Court Attendance Notice, he was not on bail because bail was not required. 

66In dealing with the fact that the applicant was said to have committed the subject offence whilst on bail, the sentencing Judge said this:

""The offender was on bail in respect of those matters when he committed the subject offence. The fact that he was on conditional liberty must aggravate the penalty that I impose."" (emphasis added)


67Whilst accepting that the sentencing Judge was led into error, the Crown nevertheless submits that this Court would not be satisfied that any lesser sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

68Nevertheless, having regard to the nature of the error, and its apparent impact on the sentence imposed by the trial judge, it will be necessary to consider what sentence ought to have been imposed in order to form the opinion required by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 

Ground 3 - Manifest Excess

69The applicant submits that the sentence was, having regard to the relatively small quantity of drugs and cash involved, manifestly excessive. 

70In light of the fact that the error identified in Ground 4 requires a fresh consideration of the appropriate sentence, there is no useful purpose to be served in considering this Ground separately.

An Appropriate Sentence

71The offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty involving the supply of a prohibited drug, namely, 21.8 grams of methylamphetamine, was a serious offence. It was part of a planned activity involving the applicant deliberately concealing in various parts of his clothing and in his shoulder bag, bags containing the drugs. He had a significant sum of cash that I would infer was the proceeds of drug dealing. In his home, a set of scales were found which was capable of, and I would infer, was used for the purpose of his drug dealing activities.

72The charges on the Form 1 were of themselves not major, but their number and their nature require that proper consideration be given to them in the course of imposing any sentence on the applicant.

73The sentencing Judge allowed a 40 per cent discount for the applicant's early plea of guilty and the provision of assistance to authorities. On the hearing of this application for leave to appeal, both the Crown and the applicant accepted that this was an appropriate discount. I agree. This discount will be taken into account in imposing any sentence. 

74The applicant's subjective facts and circumstances are referred to earlier in the judgment. There is no doubt that he has had a lengthy period of drug addiction and abuse. Previous terms of imprisonment for two previous offences of supplying drugs have not succeeded in modifying the applicant's conduct. In other words, he has not been deterred by those periods of imprisonment from continuing to engage in the supply of drugs. 

75I would conclude that, as did the sentencing Judge, and as both parties submitted to this Court, the applicant was supplying drugs in order to support his own drug habit. 

76I have had regard to the opinions of Ms De Santa Brigida and the evidence that the applicant gave to the sentencing Judge.

77As well, the applicant relied upon the contents of an affidavit sworn 13 March 2012. In that affidavit the applicant affirms that he has abstained from alcohol and drugs for the past eight months and asserts that he has not had any positive urine test result since he was sentenced by Charteris DCJ.

78Since being in custody, the applicant has attempted to engage in the Smart Program which is a program targeting substance abuse, but has not as yet successfully engaged with that program because presently no vacancy is available. He has completed the Managing Emotions course, which targets emotional regulation, and he is on the waiting list for further programs. Since being in custody, either at Nowra or Wellington, he has had ongoing employment.

79He says that when released from custody he intends to remain abstinent from illicit drugs and is willing to engage in counselling and obtain help from other community programs to support that intention. 

80The sentence which I propose involves a ratio which differs from that fixed by statute: s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Accordingly, unless special circumstances are identified, such a sentence cannot be imposed.

81Here, as noted in [42], the sentencing judge found that special circumstances existed at the time that he passed sentence. No party in the Court submitted that this finding was in error.

82I am also satisfied for the same reasons as those articulated by the sentencing judge, that special circumstances have been established, which means that the statutory ratio will be varied to take account of those circumstances.

83The imposition of a sentence is necessarily an individual process which requires emphasis to be given to principles which do not always point in the same direction.

84Having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence, the applicant's past criminal history, his subjective features and such progress as he has made whilst in custody, in my view a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months non-parole with a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months would be appropriate.

Orders

85I propose the following orders:

(1)Grant leave to appeal.

(2)Quash the sentence imposed by Charteris DCJ on 14 April 2011.

(3)In lieu thereof, sentence the applicant to a term of imprisonment without parole of 2 years and 6 months to commence on 23 June 2010 and to conclude on 22 December 2012.

(4)Sentence the applicant to a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months to conclude on 22 March 2014.

I note that the first day upon which the applicant will be eligible for release from custody is 23 December 2012.

		11 April 2012",2012-04-10 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759009,R v Hussam Ayoub ABOLAIL [2012] NSWDC 181,"SENTENCE


1Tui Moaga and Mario Puljiz both went to work as usual on Monday 28 February 2011 but by the end of that day both men were in hospital with serious slash wounds to their faces. Photographs show the extent of the scars.

2Hussam Ayoub Abolail had turned up at work. He was irrational and probably still suffering the after effects of a drug and alcohol soaked weekend. He lashed out at both men with a box cutting knife which was one of his work tools. 

3I am about to sentence Mr Abolail for his behaviour. The word ""behaviour"" is a fairly neutral word to describe two very serious crimes. Mr Abolail has been charged with the same crime for each of the wounds he inflicted on Mr Moaga and Mr Puljiz. He has been charged with two counts of wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. That offence is regarded as so serious by the Parliament that it has fixed a maximum of 25 years imprisonment. Not only that, it has also fixed a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment. The crime is made into an offence by s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. 

4When judges sentence an offender, as I am about to sentence Mr Abolail, they have to give reasons. These were grave offences and sending somebody to gaol is a grave step to take, so the giving of reasons are important. They are important so that the offender knows why they are being sent to gaol. It is important for the victims of crimes to know why the judge has imposed the sentence which the judge regards as appropriate. It is important for the public to know why a particular person has been sent to gaol and what sort of punishment is thought appropriate for the crime. It is important for other courts to know the reasons for sentences which are imposed.

5When judges come to sentence offenders they have regard to the maximum penalty and if there is a standard non-parole period, as there is in this case, they have regard to that as well. They have been described as legislative guideposts which are born in mind when a judge considers the appropriate penalty. The judge must also have regard to what are called the objective circumstances of the offence; that is, standing back and looking at just what happened to make up the crime. Judges also need to take into account what are called the subjective features of the offender; that is, a judge takes into account circumstances and features of the offender which are personal to the offender and which may be relevant to why the person committed the crime.

6I need to say in a little more detail exactly what happened. Mr Puljuz and Mr Moaga were both working for Peri Australia as Mr Abolail was. There was a factory at Glendenning. Mr Puljuz was the yard supervisor and Mr Moaga was the warehouse manager. Mr Abolail was working as a yard hand. Mr Abolail turned up at work at 7am on 28 February 2011. He had at some stage in the past suffered a hand injury. Mr Moaga, as part of his duties, told Mr Abolail that he would be on light duties outside. 

7What happened then cannot be explained rationally. Mr Abolail walked into a storage area. He got a Stanley style box cutting knife. He came back to where Mr Moaga was and, as the agreed facts record, ""without warning lashed out with the knife in his hand, slashing Moaga across the right side of his neck."" The wound obviously bled profusely and it stretched from the right side of Mr Moaga's face from behind his right ear across his cheek and up towards the right side of his mouth. He was taken to hospital where the wound obviously had to be sutured. He was released a few days later.

8Mr Abolail then walked towards the car park. Mr Puljiz saw him. Mr Puljiz did not realise what had just happened. Mr Abolail went up to Mr Puljiz and said, ""Mario am I on light duties?"" Mr Puljiz replied, ""Yeah, you'll be on light duties."" Then what happened is again described in the agreed facts. Mr Abolail ""lashed out the knife within his right hand, slashing the victim to the left side of his face."" Mr Puljiz received a 20 centimetre laceration. It stretched from the left nostril across the cheek to his left ear. He was also taken to hospital where he underwent surgery and spent some days in hospital.

9The police were obviously called. They in fact contacted Mr Abolail on his mobile phone. Mr Abolail later in the morning presented himself to the Mount Druitt Police Station with his brother. He was arrested and put into custody. He has been in custody since that day and I will date his sentences from that day.

10As I have said, I have seen photographs of the wounds caused to both men. They appear to be photographs which were taken soon after the wounds were inflicted. They show serious and disfiguring scars. I do not know of course how long those scars will remain on the faces of the two men.

11What is also important for a judge to take into account are features which are personal to the offender whom the judge is sentencing. 

12Dr B Glennon of counsel, who appeared for Mr Abolail, called his client to give evidence. Mr Abolail was born in Jordan and came to Australia in 2006. He confirmed that everything he had told the probation officer and psychologist, both of whom provided reports, was true. 

13Mr Abolail could not explain why he attacked both of the men. He accepted that it was a very serious crime and was, of course, very wrong. He apologised openly in court for what he had done. He was obviously very remorseful for the offence. In fact Dr Glennon tendered as exhibit 2 a letter from Mr Abolail to the Court which confirmed the contrition and guilt which he felt about the crimes which he had committed.

14Although he could not explain what happened and although it will be difficult to make a finding, what is clear is that Mr Abolail had a serious mental health condition, which I will come to shortly, and in addition had spent the weekend taking illegal drugs and alcohol.

15He has spent the last year in custody and has used the opportunity to see a psychologist and a psychiatrist as well as the mental health nurse. Custody has had a very sobering effect upon him including witnessing a fellow inmate who had just committed suicide. He confirmed that what he had done was completely out of character. He asserted that in exhibit 2. Indeed the criminal record, which was part of exhibit A, shows that he has no previous criminal offences.

16He has a son who lives in Jordan. The boy is aged 15. He supports him financially. He indicated that he would be prepared to comply with any directions which a psychologist or psychiatrist suggested be parole conditions.

17Cross-examined by Ms L Graham, who appeared for the prosecution, he elaborated on some references (which were unexplained) to traumatic events in his childhood. He had himself been sexually assaulted when he was 12. When he was a teenager and picnicking with a girlfriend they were both assaulted and his girlfriend was raped by a group of men. He has not disclosed that information before.

18He had realised before committing these offences that his life was spiralling out of control because of alcohol and drug use. In fact he sought some treatment the month before and had an opportunity to get some counselling. That obviously had to be discontinued when he went into custody, but he has found the counselling and support which he is receiving in custody to be helpful.

19I have made reference to a pre-sentence report prepared by a Probation and Parole officer. That provides a helpful summary which says that Mr Abolail presents as a quiet and co-operative person. It acknowledges that he ""appears to have experienced difficult formative years"". It refers to his father's prolonged absences from his home, bullying at school and harsh treatment which he received at home. He spent some 11 years in the Jordanian Air force. It noted experiences of depression since childhood and episodes of self-mutilation and suicide attempts. It thought that the depression may have been a ""catalyst in his commencing to use alcohol and other drugs"". It noted that since being in custody, ""Mr Abolail has remained drug-free. During his interview, he made no attempt to excuse his offending behaviour, instead expressing his shame at what he did and his regret at both the physical and emotional pain he caused his victims."" He gets support from his brother who is also in Australia. The author thought that it was ""important he continues to address his mental health issues by maintaining compliance with treatment/medication and engaging in counselling.""

20There is a detailed psychological report which Dr Glennon tendered in evidence. It is by Professor Stephen Woods, a clinical psychologist. One observation that Professor Woods made is that from a ""clinical perspective, it must be assumed that his use of alcohol and drugs at least aggravated what appears to be a pre-existing psychiatric condition."" The psychiatric condition which Professor Woods expressed as a ""tentative diagnostic opinion"" included an alcohol dependence disorder and a poly-substance dependence disorder. Professor Woods also noted symptoms of paranoia and expressed the opinion that that symptom, along with his sustained use of illicit drugs and alcohol before committing the offences, ""would at the very least have greatly impaired his ability to fully appreciate the nature of his actions when committing the offences."" He recommended a treatment regime which Mr Abolail should undertake.

21Professor Woods thought that Mr Abolail had what he described as a ""complex clinical picture"". The symptoms he thought were consistent with a severe mood disorder which was likely a major depressive disorder with some psychotic features or a bi-polar disorder. 

22Dr Glennon emphasised that his client had early realised the enormity of what he had done. There was no real rational explanation for what he did. Indeed I described it as irrational and that appears to be consistent with the diagnosis offered by Professor Woods. Dr Glennon emphasised the finding by Professor Woods that his client's judgment was impaired. His client had pleaded guilty to the two offences with which he was originally charged at the earliest available opportunity. 

23Dr Glennon emphasised the impact of the weekend of indulgence on his client's behaviour. He emphasised the sobering effect of imprisonment. He emphasised his client's remorse and argued that there are special circumstances for adjusting the normal relationship between a non-parole period and the full sentence. He said some of these were that he needed extended treatment when he was released. All of these submissions I accept. 

24Dr Glennon did describe the two wounds as being at the lower end of the scale. I do not accept that submission nor did Ms Graham accept it. She argued that the injuries to both men were to their faces and that they were left with scars. I cannot say for how long those scars will remain but they both are ugly scars to the men's faces after serious slashing wounds had been inflicted. She argued that they should not be regarded as the lower end of wounds for this offence and I accept her submission. 

25Ms Graham said that there needs to be some accumulation of the sentences because of the two victims. She acknowledged that the offences were obviously unplanned and that Mr Abolail's mental health condition would have an impact on the significance of general deterrence. 

26I have taken into account these various submissions. As I say, I regard the wounds - as examples of wounds which can be inflicted - as being serious. On the other hand Mr Abolail has expressed obvious and sincere remorse. He was suffering from a condition aggravated by his drug and alcohol use which obviously produced this irrational behaviour, of the kind which he has never done before. Indeed he has never committed offences before in his life. 

27I regard both offences as warranting the same sentence. I regard an appropriate sentence for each of the offences as 8 ½ years imprisonment. 

28However, Mr Abolail has pleaded guilty. Pleading guilty means that instead of the resources of the courts being engaged for some days or weeks in hearing the trial, the matter has been able to occupy the court's time only for some hours. This is acknowledged by Parliament and the courts as being a factor which is important to take into account in reducing a sentence. 

29I propose to allow Mr Abolail the full reduction of 25 per cent for the plea of guilty which he has offered. Hence the 8 ½ years penalty for each offence would normally be reduced to just over 6 years. I propose to sentence him to 6 years imprisonment for each of the 2 offences. 

30I propose to accumulate the offences by 1 year so that in all he will serve some 7 years imprisonment. 

31The first sentence will commence on 28 February 2011 and the second sentence will commence on 28 February 2012. Normally a sentence of 7 years imprisonment would have a non-parole period of three-quarters of that time. I propose to reduce the non-parole period to 4 years which is under 60 per cent of that time. I have taken into account what Dr Glennon said about the obvious need for his client to have an extended period available to rehabilitate himself from his drug and alcohol addiction and also to deal with his mental health issues. I propose to fix a non-parole period of 4 years imprisonment. 

HIS HONOUR: I am going to sentence you now Mr Abolail if you stand up, thank you. I just need to work out how I do this. 

32All right for the offence of wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm committed on Mr Moaga I fix a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 28 February 2011 and to expire on 27 February 2014. The balance of the term will be 3 years to commence on 28 February 2014 and to expire on 27 February 2017.

33For the offence of wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Mario Puljiz I fix a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 28 February 2012 and to expire on 27 February 2015. The balance of the term will be 3 years to commence on 28 February 2015 and to expire on 27 February 2018. 

34The total effective sentence is 7 years imprisonment commencing 28 February 2011 and expiring on 27 February 2018. The total effective non-parole period is 4 years which commenced 28 February 2011 and will expire on 27 February 2015. The first date on which Mr Abolail you are eligible for release is 27 February 2015. Whether you are released or not on that date depends not on me but on the Parole Authority. 

HIS HONOUR: Have a seat Mr Abolail. Now Mr Cohen and Ms Summerfield if you wouldn't both mind first checking whether I have made any factual errors and second whether the mathematical side of the sentence is in order.

COHEN: No doubt when you were completing your remarks on sentence you made a mistake when you said that he'd walked out at - this was initially you said it was Mr Moaga that walked out, you were actually referring to Mr Abolail walked out when the first offence occurred, but that your Honour when you check it's quite obvious but you've mentioned that. 

HIS HONOUR: Thank you.

COHEN: The other one, did you make a finding of special circumstances?

HIS HONOUR: I did.

COHEN: Yes, I wasn't sure.

HIS HONOUR: The special circumstances that I found were his need for treatment for his mental health condition and his drug and alcohol rehabilitation.

COHEN: That was the only two issues.

HIS HONOUR: Thanks Mr Cohen and otherwise the mathematics, so to speak, are in order, Mr Cohen?

COHEN: I believe so-

HIS HONOUR: Just take your time, these things are important.

COHEN: Unless my friend has-

SUMMERFIELD: I believe so your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: All right just take your time Mr Cohen. 

COHEN: Thank you your Honour. No actually I already checked, yes, no I don't have anything.

HIS HONOUR: All right thank you. 

35Okay Mr Abolail as I say I have sentenced you effectively to 7 years imprisonment which is 2 lots of 6 years but one starts a year later because you committed 2 crimes against 2 men. Normally for a 7 year sentence, you have to serve at least 75 per cent of that which would be 5¼ years, 5 years and 3 months. I have reduced that to 4 years so instead of that your non-parole period that you have to stay in gaol is 4 years and I've reduced that because of what we call special circumstances, Mr Cohen referred to it. You will need when you get out over the following 3 years to continue to deal with your mental health issue and with your drug and alcohol problems so that I am allowing 3 years for that. And I repeat your sentence started last year when you went into custody 28 February 2011. The overall sentence finishes 7 years later 27 February 2018 and you are eligible for release, depending on the Parole Authority on 27 February 2015, that's 4 years after you've started it last year. Do you understand?

OFFENDER: Yes I do.

HIS HONOUR: Okay. Is there anything else Mr Cohen or Ms Summerfield? 

SUMMERFIELD: No your Honour.

COHEN: No your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: I don't think so. All right I'll give the papers to my Associate. Mr Cohen you're excused. Have a word to your client and then he can be taken down all right.
