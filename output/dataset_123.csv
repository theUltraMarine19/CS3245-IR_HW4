2765040,Cuzman v R; Bucataru v R [2014] NSWCCA 222,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  The applicants, Christian Cuzman and Georghe Bucataru, appeared for trial before Norrish DCJ and a jury of twelve on 27 September 2012 in relation to four counts.  They were named jointly in the indictment as having committed the following offences:
(i) Knowingly take part in the supply of a commercial quantity of heroin between 3 March and 22 March 2010 at Sydney and elsewhere in and outside New South Wales.
(ii) In the alternative to (i), knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug between 3 March and 22 March 2010 at Sydney and elsewhere in and outside New South Wales.
(iii) Knowingly take part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of heroin between 1 May and 1 June 2010 at Sydney and elsewhere in and outside New South Wales; and
(iv) Knowingly participating in a criminal group between 1 March and 1 June 2010 and Sydney and elsewhere in and outside New South Wales.
2On 23 October 2012 they were each convicted of counts (i) and (iv).  No verdict was taken on Count 2 and they were acquitted of Count 3.  Both applicants were on bail until convicted.
3On 29 November 2012 his Honour sentenced Christian Cuzman in relation to the offence in Count 1: - Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 12 August 2012 and expiring 11 August 2017 with a balance of term of 3 Â½ years expiring 11 February 2021.  In relation to Count 4, his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 3 years commencing 12 August 2012 which was fully concurrent with the sentence in respect of Count 1.
4On 29 November 2012 his Honour sentenced Georghe Bucataru in respect of Count 1: - Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months commencing 12 August 2012 and expiring 11 November 2017 with a balance of term of 3 years and 3 months expiring 11 February 2021.  In relation to Count 4 his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 3 years commencing 12 August 2012 which was fully concurrent with the sentence in respect of Count 1.
5Both applicants seek leave to appeal against their convictions on Count 1 on the sole ground that the verdicts were unreasonable and unable to be supported having regard to the evidence.  The applicants submit that the conviction in respect of Count 4 depended on guilt of either Count 1 or its alternative (Count 2) or Count 3, as well as potentially additional elements of the offence.  To the extent that the conviction for Count 4 included the prerequisite guilt in respect of Count 1, the applicants challenge this conviction as a necessary consequence if they are successful in overturning the conviction in respect of Count 1.  There is, however, no individual challenge to the conviction for Count 4.  The applicants have not sought leave to appeal against sentence.
The Crown case and evidence at trial
6The Crown case in relation to Count 1 was dependent on the evidence of Gabriella Suto, who was criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings.  She had pleaded guilty to a charge which related to it and received a discount on sentence.  The Crown case was otherwise based on intercepted telephone calls and messages (exhibit E), evidence regarding Ms Suto's location over relevant days and expert evidence concerning the value of heroin in 2010.
7The Crown also relied on general evidence relevant to all counts about a person named Csaba Magyari.  On the Crown case he was based in Sydney and was the person who provided heroin for Ms Suto to transport to Adelaide in her own white Ford Fairmont sedan.  The Crown case was that she did this for the purpose of delivering drugs to the two applicants who were involved in a joint criminal enterprise to receive the drugs for the purposes of supply.  The applicants were residents of Adelaide, living in separate premises with their respective families in suburbs close to one another.
8The evidence regarding Mr Magyari demonstrated that he was a large scale drug dealer.  In its opening, the Crown said ""He supplied drugs like heroin, cocaine and methylamphetamine"".  Mr Magyari had died by the time the trial commenced.
9The Crown case was that he lived in Cary Street, Drummoyne but rented anther property in North Bexley.  The North Bexley property was referred to by the Crown as a ""safe house"" at which he stored and processed drugs.  The Crown adduced evidence that he was responsible for the supply and sale of prohibited drugs, not only in Sydney but in Melbourne, Perth, the Gold Coast, Brisbane and Adelaide.
10It should be noted that much of the evidence adduced in the trial was relevant only to Count 3 and has no bearing on the applicants' ground of appeal.  The evidence requiring independent assessment for evaluating the reliability of the conviction is almost entirely that of Ms Suto and the relevant intercepted communications.
11Ms Suto was a Hungarian woman who came to Australia in 2008 on a student visa.  She had learned English as a child and at trial gave evidence without the assistance of an interpreter.  She worked as a personal trainer at Fitness First during the period covered by the events with which the trial was concerned.  She met Mr Magyari through her friend, Lilla Toemoeskoezy, with whom he was at one stage in a de facto relationship.  Lilla Toemoeskoezy and Mr Magyari were of Hungarian origin.
12Ms Suto was married in Australia to a  fellow personal trainer but the relationship disintegrated and police commenced proceedings against her for an apprehended violence order (AVO) for the protection of her husband.  For something like a year thereafter, Ms Suto lived with Lilla Toemoeskoezy in Barnstable Road, Russell Lea, having been required to leave the premises she had shared with her husband.  During that time, she came to know Mr Magyari who assisted her in getting to know Sydney, paying bills, getting to places, finding places and ""helping me out with lots of things"".
13In connection with the proceedings for an AVO, Mr Magyari arranged for a solicitor to assist Ms Suto.  A fee of $3000 came to be owed as an advance payment for a hearing on 17 March 2010.  A telephone intercept of 15 March (exhibit E2) suggested that Ms Suto had seen the solicitor that day but not paid him and that the solicitor required payment before the hearing.  Mr Magyari said that he would pay the solicitor the next day.  Ms Suto responded ""Good, okay"".  Her evidence during cross-examination suggested that there was in fact more than $3000 owed to the solicitor, being additional sums set out in correspondence sent to her for initial paperwork.
14Ms Suto's account was that she agreed to a driving job on 20 March to clear this debt.  Her evidence was that in order to pay it back ""I have to make him some favours"".  These favours were ""At about three times he asked me to put money into my account what he gave me and I had to go with him for driving.  And pretty much driving yeah.""
15When asked about the driving she had done for him, she said that the first trip was to Melbourne together with Mr Magyari where the driving was shared.  This was perhaps in July 2009.  The next trip was to Adelaide where the driving was again shared.  On that trip, she met two people.  The Crown case was that these were the two applicants.  They met in a motel car park and went to a restaurant for dinner.  She was with them for a couple of hours.  She said that she was not introduced to the men.  She said that when Mr Magyari spoke to her about the men he called them the ""fat gypsy"" (Christian Cuzman) and the ""thin gypsy"" (Georghe Bucataru).  There was no suggestion of criminal conduct at this meeting.
16Ms Suto went on a later driving trip by herself to Adelaide at Mr Magyari's request.  She met ""the thin one"" in a shopping centre car park.  Bank details suggest that one of the Adelaide trips was about 5-7 September 2009.  They met outside the car and she said that he asked for her car keys and parked her car nearby.  He was only in the car for a couple of minutes.  When he got back into his own car, she got back into her car and drove back to Sydney.  The thin gypsy had left a bag in her car.
17When Ms Suto was cross-examined by reference to the details contained in the statement of agreed facts tendered in her own sentence proceedings, she agreed that the first trip to Adelaide with Mr Magyari was 25-27 August 2009 and the second trip was 5-7 September.  Later cross-examination revealed that the Gold Coast trip was 7-8 March 2010 and that there was a trip from Sydney to Coffs Harbour and back on 31 May - 1 June just prior to her arrest on 2 June.
18Ms Suto said in cross-examination that usually what she did was to go empty handed but to bring something back which she thought to be money.
19By reference to the communication captured on exhibit E4, Ms Suto said she in fact attended Mr Magyari's premises at Drummoyne.  She told him she could not give him the money now.  He said ""That I have to do him a favour"".  The favour was ""He said that I have to go to Adelaide, meet one of his friends and because he has to go somewhere and so I think he was to Perth and he couldn't make it"".  She said that when she expressed reluctance because she would not be able to have so much time off work, he made her do it.
20Ms Suto said that she went to his apartment in Drummoyne on the afternoon of 20 March 2010.  He told her that he was going to prepare a birthday present for his friend and that she would have to take it to Adelaide.  He said ""Just wait in the kitchen and I'll prepare it in a sec"".  Shortly after this, he gave her a very simply wrapped package, wrapped up like a present with faint green paper.  It was about 20 cms long and 10 cms high, in a sort of brick shape, but not weighing as much as a brick.  It was then placed in a bag.
21She said that before this day, Mr Magyari had given her a GPS device for her vehicle.  On this occasion, he entered an address into it.  She set off for Adelaide not long after arriving at Mr Magyari's unit.  The drive took her about 15 hours.  She was in a hurry.  The bag was placed on the front passenger seat.  E-tag records showed that her car proceeded in a westerly direction through Moorebank and the M5 toll gates at 5.14pm.  She said that she drove through the night only stopping for the toilet or drinks.  She just left the package on the seat when she did so.  She arrived at about 9 or 10 in the morning.  
22While the GPS entry nominated a particular street and house number, she said that she stopped at a carwash/petrol station nearby ""just to revive"" and made a call to Mr Magyari.  She said that this was because she was not sure where she was going and that she was no longer following the GPS - she did not have any more information.  At another time she indicated she had driven down the street nominated by the GPS but did not see anyone.  There was CCTV footage of Ms Suto's attendance at the ""On The Run"" carwash recorded between 10.17 and 10.21 (Adelaide time) on 21 March.  She was shown to be on the telephone during this time, which would fit with the call from Mr Magyari tendered as exhibit E9 (commencing 10.13 Adelaide time indicated as 10.43 on the transcript).
23A tracking device had been installed in the car by Mr Magyari.  It is not clear whether Ms Suto was aware of this.  SMS messages back to Mr Magyari's telephone (which were captured by the intercept) specified her location from time to time - seemingly when he decided to check her whereabouts.  Intercepted calls and text messages in the Crown case used NSW time.  As a result, the time in Adelaide was half an hour earlier than that noted on the telephone transcripts.  Ms Suto and Mr Magyari communicated with one another in Hungarian.  
24At this time the applicant Mr Bucataru (the ""thin gyspy"") lived with his family in MacIntyre Street, Salisbury Downs.  The carwash was a couple of minutes from his residence.  From the carwash Ms Suto sent a number of SMS communications to Mr Magyari between 10.28-10.30.  He indicated at 10.31 that he would call the man but had to find a phone booth.
25At 10.57am Mr Bucataru telephoned Mr Magyari and said ""It's not in my street"".  He was told to wait and Ms Suto was called by Mr Magyari and apparently chastised when she advised that she was not ""there"" but at the carwash.  At about 11.02am she advised ""Now I am exactly there"" and Mr Magyari told her that he would call the man.  He called Mr Bucataru at 11.04 and said ""Check it out now"".  At 11.05 Mr Bucataru called Mr Magyari asking whether the car was a Ford and was told that it was a white Ford.  Immediately after this, Ms Suto said that she saw the ""thin gypsy"" come to her car.
26One of the things which Mr Magyari said during the 10.43am conversation with Ms Suto while she was at the carwash (E9) was ""Well just that I forgot to tell you how much the stuff.  The (gaming) chips.  Wait I'll just reckon I forgot.  I think it was 206 or something like it"".  She said ""Okay"" and he continued ""Okay? I'll just calculate it, I'll tell you that's what you tell him Okay?""  The Crown case was that this demonstrated that the price of what was being delivered was $206,000.  In a later call at 11.22am (E16) Mr Magyari said ""I looked at the pad, that birthday present I picked up yesterday was $206 ...  That was it, the whole caboodle"".  He told her ""Discuss it with him all right?""  She said that she understood this to refer to what she had to tell the man whom she met about the present, the ""thin gypsy"" who let her into the house.  
27Ms Suto was walked inside the house by the ""thin gypsy"".  She had her clothing and other such items and was carrying the birthday present.  They discussed her trip.  She was tired and was led to a bedroom.  She dropped her bag and went for a shower.  She said the 11.22 call must have been before her shower.  She had taken the bag with the package into the room as well.  She handed the package to the ""thin gypsy"" before she showered.  This was different to her statement to the police of 10/11 November 2011.  In the statement she said that the ""thin gypsy"" took the bag from her at her car and that she simply carried her personal possessions into the house.  
28In cross-examination Ms Suto agreed that when Mr Magyari said in the 11.22 phone call ""Tell them you go to sleep and when you wake up you meet"", she understood him to be saying to have a sleep and then she would afterwards meet with the appropriate people.  She agreed she was probably in the next part of the conversation asking Mr Magyari whether she should have this meeting at the place where she was or somewhere else.   Mr Magyari said ""Just don't take the stuff there"".  When she was asked whether this indicated to her that he did not want her to take the item to that particular house, she said she did not know what he meant.  The Crown Prosecutor addressed the jury to the effect that perhaps these instructions meant Mr Magyari was worried that the money was not going to be handed over, that there could be a ""rip-off"".
29After she showered, Ms Suto went into the kitchen and was given some food by a woman.  A bit later the ""fat gypsy"" (Cuzman) came in.  She gave evidence that ""I said what Csaba told me to say, the present was $206"".  When asked what he said her evidence was ""He said that he wasn't expecting me and he's not happy.  He needed to talk to Csaba next time he wants to see him"".  She said ""All right"" but was a bit scared because he seemed annoyed.  He said she had to wait, that he was coming back soon.  He left and the next thing that happened was that the ""thin gypsy"" gave her a bag.  It was the Crown case that the inference should be drawn that this bag contained $206,000.  Ms Suto described it as containing something like a shoe box, it was heavier than a box of chocolates but not as heavy as a brick.  She took it back to Sydney leaving it on the front passenger seat as she had with the package.
30Ms Suto was cross-examined to the effect that in her statement to police, she said that the conversation with someone in the kitchen was before she had a sleep for a few hours, whereas earlier in the cross-examination she went into the kitchen after she slept for a few hours.  In later cross-examination she agreed with a sequence of events by reference to her statement of being fed in the kitchen by the woman, spoken to by the ""fat gypsy"" and asked to wait a few hours, then sleeping for a few hours.  She had initially said that she slept before this conversation with the ""fat gypsy"".
31The Crown tendered an unrelated call between Mr Magyari and a Tibor Kovats at 11.07am (E15) in which Mr Magyari indicated that he was ""on four phones and I'm arranging now something fucking important and I am very nervous because everything happened at the same time"".
32By 4.43pm on 21 March Ms Suto had commenced the return journey to Sydney.  At 2.03pm on 22 March her vehicle was in the Ashfield/Croydon Park area of Sydney.  The evidence demonstrated that the trips down to Adelaide and back took at least a few hours more than the 15 hours estimated by Ms Suto.
33Ms Suto was living in Potts Point at that time but still had a key to Lilla's premises in Barnstable Road, Russell Lea.  In that house Mr Magyari had what was said to be an office and she put the shoebox there.  She said that she had stopped only for food and the toilet on her return journey.  During a phone call with Mr Magyari at 2.20pm on 22 March (E18), Ms Suto was inside those premises and discussing with him taking money from the table.  She said she saw the money left on the table and asked how much of it she could take.  He said ""Ah, you owed me 3, then take 2"".  She said ""Okay.  This is really exactly 206"".  He said ""Yes"" and she said ""Okay"".  They discussed whether or not they had agreed on ""5"" and he said to take the ""2 now"" and they would discuss it later.  She said the reference by her to ""206"" was ""that's what was in the bag.  That's what I confirmed with him if I said the right thing"".  She said she had looked in the bag and seen it was full of money, but not counted it except the amount she took herself.  She said there were many $50 bundles.  She said she counted (and took) $2000 because Mr Magyari said she could take $2000.
34Ms Suto sought to explain in her evidence what she meant in some of the important communications with Mr Magyari over these two days. Ms Suto said:
When she said in her SMS text ""Then look at me and make the arrangements"" in E7, she probably just thought she was lost and was waiting for directions.  He had said to her that if she got lost, he could direct her.  She just thought he would be able to help her out.  Ms Suto did not ever indicate knowledge of the tracking device.She did not know who ""the man"" meant when Mr Magyari said in E8 that he would call ""the man"".She did not know what 206 meant, other than that is what she was to convey that it cost.She did not know what ""the gaming chips"" meant or alternatively she thought that it actually meant gaming chips as used in a casino.She did not know what Mr Magyari meant by ""I looked at the pad"".She did not understand any of the directions recorded in the 11.22 call (E16) such as ""So not at his place"" and ""Wherever you want to.  I would think it's better if not there"" and ""Just don't take the stuff there"".She did not understand Mr Magyari's references to ""unfastened plates"" and ""weak chain links"" in E16.She did not understand what Mr Magyari meant when he said ""Congratulate the man for his birthday whichever way you want"".
35Ms Suto was arrested on 2 June 2010 and interviewed at Kings Cross Police Station.  The record of that interview was tendered as exhibit G.  The transcript of the interview was tendered as exhibit G1.  On the Crown case Ms Suto lied extensively throughout the interview.  Ms Suto gave evidence to that effect.  Her evidence in chief was that this was because ""I was scared of Csaba and I didn't actually know what I'm involved in until ...  like - a lot of things that, you know, I've been told that night, I just found out then and I didn't know how big trouble I am in.  So I just wanted to protect myself.""  She was played a number of the intercepted telephone calls during the course of the interview and otherwise alerted to a significant amount of the evidence police had which incriminated her.  In cross-examination she agreed that she told numerous lies, did so selectively and to deflect attention from herself.  She said that she did her best to make the lies seem believable.
36Ms Suto agreed that she was shocked when on 2 June 2010 the police started playing recordings of her conversations.  After being charged, she went to gaol until she was granted bail on 9 June.   She thereafter had conferences with her legal representatives about the brief of evidence which had been served, including transcripts of all the telephone calls she had been taken to.
37When her matter was listed for a preliminary hearing on 7 August 2011, an adjournment was sought for discussions to take place with the prosecution.  She was aware that she was facing a charge of supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug which reflected her alleged activities over a period of approximately 9 months.  She was aware that this carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years.  She agreed that through her lawyer she was seeking an alternative to best avoid gaol time.  
38Ms Suto gave evidence that she understood that negotiations between her lawyer and the DPP were to the effect that she could plead guilty to a lesser charge if she gave assistance to the police.  She agreed that what she wanted was to stay out of gaol.  She knew that the proposed reduced charge to which she ultimately pleaded guilty was knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug and that this carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and no standard non-parole period.  This deal required her to go to the police station and to provide assistance.  Nobody guaranteed that this would keep her out of gaol but she said ""I wanted to do the best that I could"".  She appreciated that it was in her interests to be and appear to be as co-operative as possible when she went to the police.  
39She acknowledged that by virtue of the deal, a version of facts favourable to her was able to be negotiated as agreed facts for tender on her sentence proceedings.  These indicated that she did not know the type of drug she was carrying nor the amount (although her evidence at the trial was that she did not even know she was carrying drugs).  Ms Suto agreed that she understood that her suspended sentence was dependent upon her coming to court and ""sticking to the script"" of her 11 November 2011 statement.
40Mr Bucataru was arrested on 31 May 2010 and Mr Cuzman on 9 June 2010 and the police photographed them.  These photographs were used in recorded identification proceedings with Ms Suto on 11 November 2011.  She selected the photographs of the applicants as persons she had seen previously during 2009 and 2010 in Adelaide.  The circumstances of this contact were said to be that they had a meeting with Csaba Magyari and afterwards they went to dinner and when she delivered the ""present"".
41By 11 November 2011 Ms Suto had agreed to assist police.  On 26 June 2012 she pleaded guilty to one charge of knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug (indictable quantity) with a Form 1 document which included acknowledgment of recklessly dealing in the proceeds of crime and participating in a criminal group.  She was sentenced by Tupman DCJ and received a sentence of 20 months imprisonment, which was suspended.
42Ms Suto was cross-examined about the extent of her socialisation with Mr Magyari.  She saw him almost every day during the year she lived at Russell Lea.  He had an office there, even after he had moved out.  She said that he never talked about what type of business he was conducting.  She was cross-examined about her asserted reason for doing ""favours"" for Mr Magyari because the payment of $3000 legal fees was for the 17th March 2010 hearing when the ""favours"" had started in 2009.  Ms Suto was questioned regarding the deposits into her bank account and withdrawals and expenditure from it.  She agreed ultimately that some of the deposits could have been payment for her trips.  
43Ms Suto was cross-examined about the $2000 taken from the table on her return to Russell Lea.  She suggested that the $2000 was going to be a ""loan"" for her to pay some fines.  It was put to her that she was lying about the receipt of money from Mr Magyari and that what she was clearly discussing in the 2.20pm call was payment of $5000 total for the job.  She said that she took $2000 out of the money that was on the table, then repeated the assertion made in her evidence in chief that she did not take it from the table but from the box she had brought back from Adelaide, then agreed again that she had taken it from the table.  She was cross-examined about not opening the box on the basis that there was no need as the money was on the table.  She maintained that she opened the box.
44Detective Senior Constable Hamilton gave expert evidence for the Crown.  He said that 350 grams (of heroin) was generally referred to as a ""block of heroin"" which was in solid form and was often what was imported into Australia.  Around $100,000 in 2010 would have been an approximate value for such an item.  He said that for a transaction of that size, there were a lot of variables (one of which was purity) but that was an indicative value.  A range of $70,000 to $120,000 might apply.  His estimate of a range in 2010 for a 700 gram block was $190,000 to $240,000.  In cross-examination he said that the information came from a number of sources.  He said that there were guidelines that were understood within the undercover program which he obtained from people still involved in it.  He also relied on his own experience when purchasing quantities of heroin ""and I guess multiplying upwards and projecting back to, in my experience, what prices were around 2010"".
45South Australian Police gave evidence regarding searches of the residence of Mr Cuzman on 31 May and 9 June 2010.  There was nothing found of relevance to Count 1.  The applicants were co-operative.  
Summary of defence case
46Neither applicant gave or called any evidence.  Much of the cross-examination has been referred to in summarising the Crown case.  So far as the applicants' case was concerned, no issue was taken with the Crown suggesting that Mr Magyari was a significant drug dealer. 
47It was squarely put to Ms Suto that the ""fat gypsy"" was never in the kitchen and that she was mistaken or lying about this.  She disagreed.
48Counsel for Mr Bucataru did not take issue with Ms Suto's attendance at his premises.  In his opening address, it was suggested that it really might have been a birthday present that she delivered.  There was evidence that Mr Bucataru's date of birth was 18 February.
49In addressing the jury, defence counsel relied upon aspects of Ms Suto's evidence which showed her account was unreliable.  It was submitted that Ms Suto was either lying or mistaken - but either way she was unreliable.  There was no issue taken with the evidence that Ms Suto had met Mr Cuzman once at a restaurant with Csaba Magyari and Mr Bucataru.
50The applicants submitted that there were other reasonable inferences or conclusions arising from the facts established by the Crown which were inconsistent with the guilt of the applicants.  The applicants submitted that this was particularly so in relation to whether the ""present"" contained a prohibited drug.  They submitted that the jury could not have been satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that they had actual knowledge that what was contained in the present was a prohibited drug, in particular, heroin.  In that regard, the applicants relied upon the fact that there was no direct evidence nor was there any objective or forensic evidence that the ""present"" contained a prohibited drug.
51The applicants submitted that there was nothing in the telephone intercepts which was capable of being a reference to a prohibited drug.
THE APPEALChristian Cuzman
52Mr Cuzman submitted that unlike Mr Bucataru whose contact with Ms Suto was confirmed by telephone intercepts and CCTV cameras, the only evidence placing him in Mr Bucataru's house on 21 March 2010 was that of Ms Suto.  He submitted that there was no independent evidence that he was in the house or had any contact with the ""present"".  He submitted that all the references by Ms Suto and Mr Magyari on the phone were to a man, singular, being met at the house and spoken to.  The only exception to this was in exhibit E16 when Ms Suto told Mr Magyari that she was hungry and he suggested to ""Eat at their place.  Tell them you are hungry and they will immediately seat you and feed you.  They are gypsies, Romanian gypsies ... you offend them if you don't eat there"".  Mr Cuzman submitted that this was not significant since it was a woman who fed Ms Suto, Mr Bucataru was a married man and it was not Mr Cuzman's home.  
53Mr Cuzman submitted that the Crown case against him was highly vulnerable in three areas - the honesty of Ms Suto, the reliability of her act of identification, even if honest, and the cogency of the Crown case theory that 700 grams of heroin was what was taken into the house and that Mr Cuzman knowingly took part in the reception of it for supply.
54In relation to the honesty of Ms Suto, Mr Cuzman submitted that she did not tell the whole truth about her involvement with Mr Magyari or the particular trip to Adelaide.  He submitted that Ms Suto had a clear motivation when providing assistance to minimise her own role in the offending.  By way of illustration, he submitted that it was unexplained why she did not advise Mr Bucataru as to the cost of the package when she handed it over to him.  He submitted that no good reason was given by her for why she waited and did not pass on that information as to cost until her alleged contact with him.  He submitted that a proper reading of her evidence made it clear that the involvement of two men in the receipt of the package in Adelaide was quite artificial and the more likely scenario was that there was only one person, i.e. the ""thin gypsy"", Mr Bucataru.
55Mr Cuzman submitted that Ms Suto's evidence about not understanding various instructions which were given to her by Mr Magyari and which were recorded in the telephone intercepts was false and should not be accepted.  He submitted that there were numerous interpretations which could be given to the words recorded by the telephone intercepts, none of which was consistent with Ms Suto having given a forthright description of what she was doing during her trip to Adelaide.
56Mr Cuzman submitted that Ms Suto's evidence was patently false regarding the money at Russell Lea.  He submitted that she had difficulty in simultaneously trying to maintain that she had seen the money inside the box and had counted some of it (so as to help the prosecution) but had not counted all of it (downplaying her own criminality).  He submitted that her assertion that there was also money on the table was an attempt to downplay her own criminality.  He submitted that if there were money on the table, this significantly undermined her evidence that there was money in the box and that this was known to her because she had a reason to count it.
57Mr Cuzman submitted that Ms Suto's evidence as to her relationship with Mr Magyari was not frank.  He submitted that the bank records (exhibit D) showed clear instances of receipt of large sums of money and expenditure on luxury items.  He submitted that her evidence that she was forced to undertake the trip to Adelaide, despite her protestations, was fanciful.  He submitted that the supposed indebtedness of Ms Suto to Mr Magyari for paying the solicitor should also not be accepted.  He submitted that the real situation was more correctly described by her evidence under cross-examination that Mr Magyari ""looked after"" her and had done so for some time.  He submitted that Ms Suto was clearly in a situation where she received significant financial support from Mr Magyari and willingly associated with him and his activities and actively participated in criminal activities for him to keep up her desired lifestyle.
58Mr Cuzman submitted that her continued attempts to maintain, despite the evidence and despite her guilty plea, that she did not know that she was conveying drugs to Adelaide was dishonest and would cause further serious disquiet regarding her reliability.  He submitted that the entire case against him depended upon the veracity of this one witness.  He submitted that the entire case against him comprised her evidence as to a short conversation in circumstances where that was an inclusion easily made by a witness who was shown to be demonstrably dishonest and who had a motivation to implicate even an innocent person to increase the extent of her offered assistance.
59In relation to his identification by Ms Suto, Mr Cuzman referred to the unreliability of her identifying someone she had met only once seven months earlier at a dinner at which she may have been fatigued and intoxicated.  This was particularly so when she was not even introduced to him.  He submitted that she was fatigued on 21 March 2010 in Mr Bucataru's house and that the alleged contact with him was for only a few minutes.  He submitted that she may have had an expectation that any male not Mr Bucataru approaching her in those circumstances would be him.
60Mr Cuzman submitted that the Crown case theory was highly speculative as to the precise interpretation required for guilt of Count 1 to be established and that there were considerations pointing in different directions.  He submitted that the introduction of the alleged price of 700 grams of heroin ($206,000) in such a casual manner by Mr Magyari was not consistent with the picture otherwise presented of that person as a highly suspicious professional drug dealer.  Mr Cuzman submitted that it was highly unlikely that he would have said nothing of price to Ms Suto or the recipient of the drug before she arrived in Adelaide.  Despite its implausibility, that was the only interpretation on the Crown case of the communication on 21 March (""Well just that I forgot to tell you, how much the stuff.  The [gaming] chips.  Wait, I'll just reckon I forgot.  I think it was 206 or something like it."" (E9))
61Mr Cuzman submitted that the carelessness with which the ""birthday package"" was conveyed in the car on Ms Suto's evidence was inconsistent with it being 700 grams of heroin.  He submitted that there was no evidence that it was heroin, other than that of the police officer which was dependent upon ""206"" representing $206,000.  In that regard, Mr Cuzman submitted that there were other illicit substances with which Mr Magyari was associated, such as cocaine and methylamphetamine, in relation to which no evidence was given as to price.
62Mr Cuzman submitted that even accepting the complete veracity of Ms Suto, and the safety of her identification, and the cogency of the Crown case generally, the evidence against him did not clearly demonstrate an act of knowingly take part in the supply of a commercial quantity of heroin.  He submitted that if he did convey the information from Ms Suto to Mr Bucataru as to price, it is far from clear that this was done in a way consistent with guilt of this particular charge (i.e., knowledge that a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug was received).
63In summary, Mr Cuzman submitted that the central question in his appeal was whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was in Mr Bucataru's house on 21 March 2010 and spoke with Ms Suto as she alleged and if so, whether the jury could be so satisfied as to the Crown's circumstantial case as to what this meant.  He submitted that Ms Suto was a deeply flawed witness and that the very small portion of her evidence inculpating him was capable of having easily been added by a witness as dishonest and motivated as she was.
Mr Bucataru
64Mr Bucataru made similar submissions as to the honesty and reliability of the evidence of Ms Suto.  In doing so, he accepted that unlike Mr Cuzman there was some independent evidence which linked Ms Suto directly to him, i.e., the telephone intercepts, the CCTV footage and the presence of her car in his street.  Nevertheless, he submitted that for him to be convicted the Crown case required that the only reasonable inference that could be drawn from a consideration of all of the established facts and evidence was that he was guilty of the offence contained in Count 1.  If there were any other reasonable inference open that was inconsistent with his guilt, then the Crown's circumstantial case could not succeed.
65He submitted that there were other reasonable inferences or conclusions arising from those facts and the evidence that were inconsistent with his guilt.  In particular, he submitted that it had not been established beyond reasonable doubt that the ""present"" did contain a prohibited drug.  
66Mr Bucataru referred to the same evidence as did Mr Cuzman to demonstrate the untruthfulness and unreliability of Ms Suto.  By way of illustration, he submitted that Ms Suto did not do favours for Mr Magyari because she owed him money but because she was being paid to do them.  In support of that submission, Mr Bucataru relied upon her bank statements between 22 August and 22 October 2009 which set out the following transactions:
25 AugustCash Deposit $300031 AugustCash Deposit $395029 SeptemberCash Deposit $90008 October Withdrawal $850012 OctoberCash Deposit $540014 OctoberInternet transfer $5000
67In summary, Mr Bucataru submitted that Ms Suto was an unreliable witness who on her admission had no difficulty in telling lies when those lies were perceived by her to be for her own benefit or advantage.  He submitted that she was a witness who was criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the offences in Counts (i) and (ii) on the indictment.  In that regard, he noted that Ms Suto was a witness who received considerable benefits from agreeing to co-operate with the prosecution and to give evidence.
68Mr Bucataru submitted that the jury could not have been satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that what Ms Suto transported from Sydney to Adelaide on 21 March 2010 was a prohibited drug.  He submitted that there was no direct evidence to that effect.  There was no evidence as to the weight of the ""present"".  He submitted that there was no conversation in the telephone intercepts which could have been considered to be referrable to a prohibited drug and no conversation that could have been considered to be referrable to the prohibited drug heroin.  He submitted that there was no conversation that could have been considered to be referrable to the weight of any prohibited drug and/or in relation to any money.
69In oral submissions in the appeal, counsel for Mr Bucataru refined that latter submission in a way somewhat different to the written submissions.
70He referred to the wording of Count 1 on the indictment which was in the following terms:
""Between 3 March 2010 and 22 March 2010 at Sydney and elsewhere in, and outside, the State of New South Wales, knowingly took part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely heroin, being an amount not less than the commercial quantity of that drug.""
By reference to that count, he submitted that there was no evidence before the jury which could establish that what was in the ""present"" was not less than a commercial quantity (250 grams) of heroin. 
71He submitted that it was an essential element in the Crown case that the prohibited drug being transported was heroin.  Not only that, for Count 1 to be made out, there had to be more than a commercial quantity of heroin.  He submitted that the only evidence as to there being more than a commercial quantity of heroin came from the police officer to the effect that $206,000 could be expected to purchase approximately 700 grams of heroin in 2010.  
72Mr Bucataru submitted that the evidence of the police officer was based on the assumption that what was being transported was heroin but that this assumption had never been established.  He submitted that if a drug other than heroin was being transported (such as cocaine or methylamphetamine) there was no evidence as to what a commercial quantity of that drug was and to what extent, if at all, the figure of $206,000 could establish than not less than a commercial quantity of such a drug was being transported.
73Mr Bucataru noted that the Crown's decision to rely upon heroin as the drug being transported in March 2010 appeared to have arisen from a transaction conducted between Mr Magyari and a Mr Bodo(?) some two months later in which heroin was the drug involved.  That transaction, however, formed part of the offence to which Count 3 related and in respect of which the applicants were acquitted.  It was made clear at the trial that the evidence led in respect of Count 3 could not be used to establish Count 1.
74Mr Bucataru put the same submission in a slightly different way.  There was no evidence as to the weight of the ""present"".  The only evidence as to weight was a reconstruction by the police officer that an amount of $206,000 could purchase approximately 700 grams of heroin in 2010.  That reference to weight, however, depended entirely upon the substance being transported being heroin, which was not otherwise established.  The police officer gave no evidence as to how much of any other drug an amount of $206,000 would purchase.
Consideration
75The point taken by the applicants in oral submissions as to the Crown failing to prove that the drug being transported was not less than a commercial quantity should be accepted.  The jury could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to that element of the offence because there was no evidence that the substance being transported was heroin and in the absence of that being established, there was no evidence of the weight of the substance being transported.  Consequently, there was no evidence that there was not less than a commercial quantity of heroin or other illegal drug being supplied.
76The elements of the offence are uncontroversial and were set out by the trial judge, both in writing (AB 203) and in the summing up (SU 23).  In the written direction provided by his Honour the following was set out:
""Prohibited Drug  
The prosecution must prove that the substance supplied, in effect the supply in which it is alleged the accused took part, was a prohibited drug.  Here the prosecution alleges that the prohibited drug was heroin.  Heroin is listed as a substance declared to be a prohibited drug under the relevant legislation for the purposes of this offence.  
What the prosecution must prove is that the relevant accused you are considering knew or believed at the time that he knowingly took part in the supply of a substance that it was a prohibited drug.  The prosecution does not have to prove that the accused knew that the drug was a particular one specified in the charge.  The identification of heroin is what lawyers call a particular.  The prosecution does not have to prove that the accused knew or believed that it was heroin, but the prosecution does have to prove that the accused knew or believed that the substance that he took part in supplying was a prohibited drug.
The commercial quantity  
The Crown alleges that what was supplied was at least a commercial quantity of the prohibited drug so the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the amount of the drug supplied was not less than the quantity prescribed by law for this particular drug, that is heroin, as being a commercial quantity.  
For the prohibited drug heroin a commercial quantity prescribed by law is 250 grams including admixture and you heard some reference to this in the evidence.  This is the total weight of the quantity of the particular substance.  It must include a prohibited drug, but it does not matter what the percentage of purity is."" (SU 23 ....)
77It is true that this precise point was not taken at trial, although it is clear that there was always an issue as to whether that which Ms Suto was transporting to Adelaide was a quantity of a prohibited drug.  It appears to have been assumed at trial, but there was no admission to that effect, that if the substance being transported was a prohibited drug then the prohibited drug was heroin.  Hence the circuity of reasoning which led to the Crown seeking to establish weight by reference to how much heroin $206,000 could buy.
78Even though this point was not taken in terms at the trial, and even though there appears to have been an assumption by the parties that if the substance was a prohibited drug that drug was heroin, the Crown was not absolved from establishing beyond reasonable doubt the essential elements of the offence in Count 1 which included the supply of a substance being not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug.  This it failed to do.  It follows that in relation to each of the applicants the conviction for the offence in Count 1 must be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered.  
79That, however, does not end the matter.  Section 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides:
""7(2) Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence, and the jury could on the indictment have found the appellant guilty of some other offence, and on the finding of the jury it appears to the court that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved the appellant guilty of that other offence, the court may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the verdict found by the jury a verdict of guilty of that other offence, and pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed at the trial as may be warranted in law for that other offence, not being a sentence of greater severity.""
80The correct approach to the application of s7(2) was considered by Johnson J (with whom Price and RA Hulme JJ agreed) in Tonari v R [2013] NSWCCA 232 where his Honour said:
""213 Before this Court can return verdicts on lesser charges under s.7(2), the Court must apply the rigorous approach outlined in Spies v The Queen [2000] HCA 43; 201 CLR 603 (""Spies""). 

214 Offences under s.61I are wholly included offences by reference to ss.61J and 61Q: Spies at 611-612 [23]-[24]. 

215 I am satisfied that the verdicts of the jury demonstrate that the jury was affirmatively satisfied of facts that constitute each of the s.61I offences: Spies at 613 [27]. 

216 The power conferred by s.7(2) is a very useful one which, in appropriate cases, will result in the saving of time and expense and avoid the inconvenience and worry of victims and witnesses having to testify once again before a jury: Spies at 620 [47].

217 The power under s.7(2) is to be exercised with great caution: Spies at 620 [47]. The need for caution is directed to the issue whether it really does appear that the jury was so satisfied of the facts constituting the other offence: Spies at 621 [48].""
81The plurality (Gaudron McHugh Gummow and Hayne JJ) in Spies v R [2000] HCA 43; 201 CLR 603 said:
""23 The power conferred by s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act is most likely to be exercisable in situations where the ""other offence"" is one which is wholly within the ultimate facts of the offence on which the accused has been convicted and which the court sets aside in the appeal. The classic case is a conviction for assault occasioning grievous bodily harm where the court is of the opinion that the prosecution has failed to prove, or there has been a misdirection on, the issue of grievous bodily harm. In those circumstances, the entry of a conviction for common assault would be a clear case for the exercise of the power under s 7(2). In R v Vella this Court refused to grant special leave where the Court of Criminal Appeal of Queensland had substituted a verdict of common assault for a conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Latham CJ said: 
""All charges of assault, with whatever additional aggravating circumstances as compared with common assault, necessarily include the elements constituting the offence of common assault. Therefore it appears to me the section necessarily applies in such case."" 
24 Other pairs of offences which readily come to mind as likely candidates for the application of the sub-section include murder and manslaughter[10], rape and carnal knowledge, assault with intent to commit rape and indecent assault, incest and carnal knowledge, robbery under arms and robbery, larceny and receiving, housebreaking and receiving, obtaining a chattel by false pretences and obtaining credit by false pretences, many substantive offences and attempts to commit them, burglary and housebreaking, embezzlement and larceny. However, s 7(2) can be applied in any case where it appears to the court ""that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which prove the appellant guilty of that other offence"". Thus, in R v Grasso, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria thought that, having regard to the indictment and the evidence, it could substitute a conviction of assault occasioning actual bodily harm after setting aside a conviction of assault with intent to commit rape. 

...
27 The words ""must have been satisfied of facts"" indicate that it must appear to the court that, having regard to the evidence, the conviction on the charge which is quashed necessarily meant that the accused was guilty of acts or omissions which, as a matter of law, constitute another offence. The other offence must, of course, be one which the ""jury could on the indictment have found the appellant guilty of"". As Callaway JA pointed out in Cervelli, it is not necessary that the relevant facts ""be logically implied by the verdict, because regard may be had to the evidence and common ground at the trial."" Nevertheless, the court must be able to say that, given the evidence at the trial and what was common ground, the conviction verdict demonstrates that the jury were affirmatively satisfied of those facts which constitute the other offence. ...""
82In this case Count 2 on the indictment (which was the alternative to Count 1) was in the following terms:
""Between 3 March 2010 and 22 March 2010 at Sydney and elsewhere in and outside the State of New South Wales knowingly took part in the supply of a prohibited drug.""
The elements of that offence are the same as those for Count 1 except for the requirement to prove that the quantity of prohibited drug was a commercial quantity.  In relation to Count 2, all that the prosecution must prove is that the quantity was not less than 5 grams which is an ""indictable quantity"".
83Here the evidence of Ms Suto was that the package was 20 cms long and 10 cms high in a sort of a brick shape but not weighing as much as a brick.  I am prepared to infer as would the jury that a package with those dimensions, shaped like a brick but not weighing as much as a brick, would weigh at least 5 grams.
84What that means is that although the applicants have succeeded in relation to Count 1 the issues which they raised in the appeal in relation to the reliability and truthfulness of Ms Suto, questions of identification and the Crown case theory, still have to be considered by this Court.  This is necessary to determine whether a verdict of guilty of the offence in Count 2 had been made out or whether such a verdict is unreasonable and unable to be supported having regard to the evidence.
85The law in this area is now well settled.  In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 the plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) said:
""The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal

11 It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:
""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".
12 This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""
13 The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""
...
14 In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"" In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:
""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1).  The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""""
86With those principles in mind, in a case such as this where so much depended upon the acceptance of the evidence of Ms Suto, it is important to remember that the jury was the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence.  It had the benefit of having seen and heard Ms Suto.  The question is whether despite that consideration, this is one of those cases where ""the accumulation of inconsistent and unsatisfactory evidence can serve to undermine a Crown case.  The question is whether that point is reached in a particular case so that the verdict or verdicts are unsafe and unsatisfactory"" (Cusack v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 155; Beazley JA (with whom Blanch and Howie JJ agreed) at [89]).
87The jury was well aware of the potential problems with the evidence of Ms Suto.  Not only did both counsel appearing for the applicants at trial stress in considerable detail what they regarded as inconsistencies and untruths in her evidence, but the trial judge gave strong warnings as to the reliability of her evidence.  At SU 47-50 his Honour set out the circumstances of Ms Suto and in particular the fact that she was criminally involved in the matters giving rise to Counts (i) and (ii) and that she had obtained a significant advantage insofar as the sentence which she received by agreeing to co-operate with the police.  Having reviewed those matters in considerable detail, his Honour said:
""For these reasons her evidence must be scrutinised with great care because of the circumstances in which she comes forward as a witness, and these circumstances may make her evidence unreliable.  In light of the bargain that was negotiated on her behalf, or by her, she may well feel locked in to that arrangement and thus simply be relating a story that accords with the basis upon which the bargain was reached.  She may be trying to exculpate herself or minimise her role by either fabricating or exaggerating the role of others, or simply just not telling the truth about critical matters.  It is to be borne in mind that on her own version, she is in a position to relate details about what happened from her direct knowledge in order to give her version greater credibility.  She may fabricate or exaggerate allegations against the accused persons, or each of the accused persons, for reasons that could never be known.  There may be other reasons for her to falsely implicate one or other of the accused which are not apparent or, more importantly, not capable of exposure.  It may be to shift the blame away from other people that are unknown.
A person who wishes to shift blame or falsely implicate another for his or her own benefit may be very persuasive and may be capable of pretending that he or she is truthful in recounting these events.  In considering any interest she may have had in minimising her own role, you bear in mind that in doing so the witness may be seeking to protect herself from prosecution and imprisonment for more serious crimes.
This warning I give you in relation to this aspect of the matter is borne from the experience of courts over many years in relation to the potential unreliability of those who are criminally concerned with relevant events and may wish to give evidence to fulfil some promise or to obtain some self benefit.  Persons who give evidence in these circumstances, who admit to committing crimes in the past, may be inherently unreliable by the very character of their self-admitted conduct.  I advise you that this warning I give is not because I have formed any personal view about the evidence, nor because this warning is a consequence of my personal experience.""  (SU 51-52)
""This being so, unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Suto is both an honest and accurate witness in the account she has given in relation to the matters requiring proof by the Crown, you cannot find either of the accused guilty.  Before you can convict the accused you should examine the evidence of Ms Suto very carefully in order to satisfy yourself that you can act safely upon that evidence to the high standard required in a criminal trial.  Again this caution is not based upon any personal view I have of the evidence.  Where the Crown case relies or substantially upon the evidence of a single witness, a jury must always approach that evidence with particular caution because of the onus and standard of proof placed upon the Crown.
I am not suggesting to you that you are not entitled to find a particular accused guilty upon the evidence of Ms Suto in conjunction with the other evidence.  Clearly you are entitled to do so, but only after you have carefully examined the evidence and satisfied yourself that it is truthful and reliable in the relevant respects beyond reasonable doubt."" (SU 52-53)
88His Honour then reviewed the evidence of Ms Suto in relation to prior inconsistent statements, in particular the first statement which she made to the police on 2 June 2010 which she herself acknowledged contained a number of lies.  His Honour also referred to some differences between the agreed statement of facts on which Ms Suto was sentenced and her evidence at the trial.  His Honour then gave a strong direction as to what use could be made of prior inconsistent statements when assessing the credibility of a witness.
""If there is an inconsistency established between a previous statement or evidence and evidence given in this court, it may be taken into account in either assessing the credibility of the particular witness in a particular respect, or in assessing the credibility of the witness generally.  In considering such inconsistencies you may, if you are satisfied that there are inconsistencies, regard those matters as reflecting adversely upon the truthfulness and/or the reliability of the witness.  The significance of these matters in relation to a particular witness will depend upon a number of matters, including the significance of the inconsistency or the number of the inconsistencies or, of course, the significance of the witness in the case in conjunction with other matters.""  (SU 54-55)
89His Honour gave a further warning in relation to the evidence of Ms Suto as to her identification of Messrs Cuzman and Bucataru.  His Honour said:
""Secondly, she is the only person who alleges the detail of what occurred in the house about the exchange of the birthday present for the yellow shoebox, which she said contained the cash.  If you are satisfied that she did meet people in a house, you will need to scrutinise her identification of the men she said she met with special care, because evidence of identification where a person is seeking to identify someone with whom they're not necessarily familiar, or not overly familiar with, or have not met often, may be unreliable.  
This warning is, of course, concerned with the reliability of the evidence of identification.  But, of course, in this case, there is a strong attack upon the honesty of the witness for the matters I have already outlined.  Of course, a dishonest witness may be inherently unreliable for many reasons quite different from those relevant to a witness who's reliability alone is an issue.  Special caution is necessary before you accept the identification evidence because of the possibility that even a completely honest witness may be mistaken in his or her identification of a person with whom they may not be greatly familiar.  I am not suggesting that the evidence of such a witness must be regarded as unreliable, but it is the fact that the evidence of such a witness may be unreliable.  The common experience of the criminal courts over the years, both here in Australia and overseas, has demonstrated that identification evidence in these circumstances may turn out to be unreliable.  There have been many notorious cases over the years in which completely honest evidence of identification has been demonstrated either by DNA testing or by other means to have been wrong and innocent people have been convicted, sometimes with irreversible results.""  (SU 57-58)
90It is not without significance that the jury after the summing up and after they had commenced their deliberation asked to review the transcript of Ms Suto's testimony, including responses to the Crown, and in cross-examination (19.10.2012).
91The difficulty for the applicants, particularly Mr Bucataru, is that the overwhelming effect of the evidence, particularly the telephone intercepts, is to the effect that Mr Magyari regarded the ""present"" as a valuable commodity which was being taken down to Adelaide.  A strong indicator of this is the use of the tracking device to keep a check on the location of Ms Suto.  The reference to ""$206"" in exchange for the delivery of the ""present"" is strongly suggestive of an illegal process taking place.  Despite the qualifications and (it may be fairly said) evasiveness of Ms Suto in relation to parts of her evidence, the likelihood of drugs being delivered is very strong.  This is because of Mr Magyari's known activities as a drug supplier and the complicated manoeuvring which occurred before Ms Suto met with Mr Bucataru in Adelaide.  Mr Magyari's anxiety about the meeting and the handing over of the package strongly support that inference (i.e., E15 and E16).
92One of the difficulties with the approach followed by the applicants in the appeal is that they focused on particular aspects of Ms Suto's evidence which did not reflect favourably upon her but to a significant extent lost sight of the total effect of the evidence adduced by the Crown.
93As already indicated, the fact that Ms Suto was an unreliable witness in some respects had less bearing on the Crown case against Mr Bucataru than in relation to Mr Cuzman since there was no dispute that Mr Bucataru was present at his house in Adelaide on 21 March 2010 when Ms Suto delivered the ""present"".  There was also the communication between Mr Bucataru and Mr Magyari before the meeting and the telephone contact between Mr Magyari and Ms Suto at that time.  I am satisfied that it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Bucataru knowingly took place in the supply of a prohibited drug on that occasion.
94The basis of Mr Cuzman's challenge to the evidence implicating him is that there was no independent evidence that he was in Mr Bucataru's house on 21 March 2010.  The resolution of that issue did depend very much upon whether the jury accepted the evidence of Ms Suto on that issue.  That this issue was essentially a jury question emerges clearly from the evidence.
95In chief the evidence of Ms Suto was:
""CROWN:  Did anyone introduce you to the lady?A.  No.
Q.  So is it the case that when you first went into the kitchen after your shower the lady was already there?A.  Yes.
Q.  Did she give you some food something to eat?A.  Yes.
Q.  While you were there in the kitchen did anybody else come in?A.  A bit later, yes.
Q.  Who?A.  The fat gypsy.
Q.  The fat gypsy, all right.   What happened when he came in?  Did you have a conversation with him?A.  Yes.
Q.  What did you say to him?A.  I said what Csaba told me to say, the present was $206.
Q.  When you said that to the fat gypsy what did he then say to you?A.  He said that he wasn't expecting me and he's not happy.  He needed to talk to Csaba, next time he wants to see him.
Q.  Wanted to see him?A.  Yes.
Q.  What did you say to that?A.  I said ""all right"".
Q.  How were you feeling then?A.  A bit scared because I thought he was a bit annoyed, yeah.
Q.  Had you had any sleep by this stage?A.  Yes.
Q.  You had, all right.
HIS HONOUR: 
Just explain that.  You said you had a shower.  Did you go to sleep after the shower?A.  Yes.
Q.  Well, tell us.  That's what the Crown's asking you.A.  Yes.
CROWN:  
How long were you - A.  A couple of hours.
Q.  A couple of hours.  All right.
HIS HONOUR: 
Q:  Just so I understand, if nobody else:  You had a shower, then you had a sleep?A.  Yes.
Q.  For a couple of hours?A.  Yes.
Q.  Then you went into the kitchen to get some food is that what you're saying?A.  Yes.
Q.  Right.
CROWN:  
Q.  After you had this conversation with the man you've described as the fat gypsy, where you said you were scared, what was the next thing that he said to you?A.  That he's coming back soon.
Q.  He's coming back soon?A.  Yeah, I have to wait.
Q.  What did you do then?  Well, first of all, after he said that, what did he do or where did he go?A.  He just left.  I don't know where he went.
Q.  You were still in the kitchen?A.  Yes.
Q.  Where did you go from the kitchen if anywhere?A.  Nowhere.
Q.  All right.  Now, you're in the kitchen, the man you've described as the fat gypsy has left after telling you to wait.  What happened then? What was the next thing that happened?A.  He came back with a bag - not him - someone else.  The thin friend.
Q.  The thin friend?A.  Yes.
Q.  When you say the thin friend, is that someone you've already been speaking about?A.  Yes, yes.
Q.  What have you referred to him as before?  Not the thin friend?A.  The thin gypsy yes. I'm sorry.
Q.  The thin gypsy okay.  So the thin gypsy came back did he?A.  Yes.
Q.  What did he do when he came back?A.  He gave me another bag.
Q.  Can you describe that other bag?  Just tell us what it looked like.A.  Yeah, it was like a shoebox.
Q.  Well a shoebox, you said bag?A.  In the bag, yes.
Q.  So there were two things, were there.  Was there a shoebox and a bag?A.  Yes.
Q.  Do you remember the colour, for instance of the bag?A.  Yellow or yellowish, yeah.
Q.  Sorry.A.  Yellow.
Q.  What was yellow the shoebox.A.  The shoebox was yellow all right.
...
CROWN Q:  At that stage, or at that point in time, did you look in the shoebox?A.  No.
Q.  How did the shoebox feel in terms of weight?A.  Yes.  It was not as heavy - well it was heavier than a box of chocolate but not as heavy as a brick or something.
Q.  This is the shoebox is it?A.  yeah.
Q.  The shoebox that the thin man gave you?A.  Mmm.
Q.  All right.  Now, when he gave you that bag, what did you do with it?A.  When I left I took it with me.
Q.  When did you leave, then.A.  After I got it.
Q.  After you got the bag?A.  Mmm-hmm.
Q.  With the shoebox in it?A.  Mmm-hmm.
Q.  Did you look in it when you got in the car at some stage?A.  No.
Q.  Where did you put the shoebox then?  When you got in the car, where did you put the shoebox?A.  To the same place, in the front of - the front seat of my car.
Q.  I think you said in the mother-in-law seat, is that right?A.  Yes.
Q.  Where did you go then?A.  Sydney.
Q.  Sydney.A.   [No verbal reply].
Q.  How did you get to Sydney?  Did you drive?A.  Drove, yes I was driving.""
96In cross-examination by Mr Coroneos on behalf of Mr Bucataru the following exchange took place between him and Ms Suto:
""CORONEOS:  Q.  At some stage you were in the kitchen talking to somebody?  Do you recall that?A.  Yeah.
Q.  You were asked this question by the Crown at page 108 of the transcript at point 4:
""Q.  All right.  Now, you're in the kitchen.  The man you've described as the fat gypsy has left after telling you to wait.  What happened then?  What was the next thing that happened?""
Do you recall being asked that question?A.  Yeah.
Q.  Your answer was as follows.  You said, ""He came back with a bag"".  Then there was long pause by you, I suggest, and then you said, ""Not him, someone else, the thin friend.""A.  Yeah.
Q.  You were asked, ""What happened next?""  Your first response was, ""He came back with the bag,"" referring to the person you've described as the ""fat gypsy"".  That was the case, was it not?A.  No, he took it and the thin one came back.
Q.  You then went to your car and drove back to Sydney, didn't you?A.  Yes."" (T.285 - 4.10.2012)
97In cross-examination on behalf of Mr Cuzman by his counsel, Mr Price, the following exchanges took place between him and Ms Suto:
""PRICE:  Q.  Part of your evidence is that on 21 March 2010, you had a conversation with a person in the kitchen of the house in Adelaide that you had previously met and knew to be a person known to you only as the fat gypsy; correct?A.  Correct.
Q.  Now, you've said a few different things about what happened that day as you've given your evidence over the last week; would you accept that or  A.  Well, doesn't change the facts.
Q.  Well, at page 108 of the transcript, I'll just take you to a couple of those issues or a couple of those points.  Page 108 of the transcript, you told the Court in response to questions asked of you by the learned Crown Prosecutor:
""Where did you go from the kitchen, if anywhere?A.  Nowhere.
Q.  All right.  Now you're in the kitchen.  A man you've described as the fat gypsy has left after telling you to wait; what happened then; what was the next thing that happened?A.  He came back with a bag.""
You said, and then you had a long pause, and then you said:
""Not him, someone else.""A.  Well, can't I think about the question or   I thought I can.
Q.  No, do you remember giving that response?A.  Yes.
Q.  I'm not criticising you.A.  Well, it seems like that.
Q.  I'm just saying, do you remember giving that response?A.  Yes.  And I corrected it.
Q.  Then you changed your position, you said, ""The thin friend"".A.  Exactly.
Q.  Then the Crown asked you, ""The thin friend?"" as a question.  You said, ""Yes,"" and then you clarified it as, ""The thin gypsy.""  Yes?A.  Yes.
Q.  Mr Coroneos asked you about that very same point   I think it was yesterday   at page 285 of the transcript, and there was this exchange between Mr Coroneos and yourself at point 5 of the transcript:
""Q.  At some stage you were in the kitchen talking to somebody; do you recall that?A.  Yeah.
Q.  You were asked this question by the Crown at page 108 of the transcript, point 4:
'Q.  All right.  You're in the kitchen.  The man you've described as the fat gypsy has left after telling you to wait.  What happened then?  What was the next thing that happened?'
Q. Do you recall being asked that question?A.  Yes.""
Q.  So Mr Coroneos is asking exactly the same thing about what I've just asked you about; all right?A.  Mm.""
""Q.  Your answer was as follows.  You said, ""He came back with a bag,"" then there was a long pause by you, I suggest, and then you said, ""Not him, someone else.  The thin friend.""A.  Yeah.
Q.  You were asked, ""What happened next?""  Your first response was, ""He came back with the bag,"" referring to the person you've described as the fat gypsy.  That was the case, was it not?A.  No.  He took it and the thin one came back.""
Q. That's what you said to Mr Coroneos yesterday, as is recorded in the transcript, page 285, point 27.  Is that right, or is that just a mistake?A.  In order of the actions   doesn't matter which one was first or second.  I never said any different stories, that I went to Adelaide, had some Romanian sausage and coffee and then came back to Sydney.  I always said the same thing.  If I went for a shower first or after, that doesn't change any facts.
Q.  Are you a little fuzzy on your memory of what actually happened in that kitchen on that day?A.  No.""
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  I object to that, your Honour.  I object to the way my friend has put those questions, because he's suggesting that the witness has said something different to what she said originally   that is, on p 108.  He's suggesting that she has then said something different, as I understand his cross examination, on p 285, and in fact she doesn't say something different.  What she says is, when she's asked and I'm looking at p 285, when Mr Coroneos said, ""You were"".  
HIS HONOUR:  You can sit down, Mr Price.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Sorry, your Honour?
HIS HONOUR:  Sorry.  I'm just asking Mr Price to sit down while you're on your feet.  Yes?
CROWN PROSECUTOR:
""Q.  You were asked, 'What happened next?'  Your first response was, 'He came back with the bag,' referring to the person you've described as the fat gypsy.  That was the case, was it not?""A.  No.  He took it and the thin one came back.""
HIS HONOUR:  Right.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  You see, Mr Coroneos is suggesting to her that in fact where she said, ""He came back,"" she meant the fat gypsy, and she says, ""No, I didn't mean that, I meant the thin gypsy.""  Even though she said, ""He came back with the bag,"" not him  
HIS HONOUR:  Yes, I understand.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  I mean, she's simply saying, ""I didn't ever say that,"" and  
HIS HONOUR:  Well, with respect, I think the point of Mr Coroneos' question was to suggest that's what she meant.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Yes.
HIS HONOUR:  But she said, ""That's not what I meant.""
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  No.
HIS HONOUR:  And I thought the point of his questioning was to suggest that that was a slip on her part.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Yes.  But now, as I understand it, Mr Price is saying that she has now said something different when she answered Mr Coroneos' question, and what I'm saying is  
HIS HONOUR:  I think that's a matter for comment rather than for the witness to further comment upon.  I note your objection, Mr Crown.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Yes, thank you, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR:  I think the point of the Crown is well made, unless you've got something else to say about it, Mr Price.  These are matters for comment in due course, aren't they?
PRICE:  Yes.
HIS HONOUR:  I mean, if you want to take up  
PRICE:  I don't want to take it up.
HIS HONOUR:  No, no, just hear me.  If you want to take up what is the implication of the line of questioning of Mr Coroneos, you're welcome to do that.  You're not obliged to accept her answer, either in relation to the matters raised in cross examination or the evidence she gave in chief.  That's a different issue.  I think the Crown's objection, that what you put isn't the representation of what she said in cross examination, is well founded.  But you're welcome to deal with it in another way if you wish.
PRICE:  No.  I just wanted to put to her the different comments made as things were put to her, in fairness, from the transcript, that's all.  Now I'm going to go to her statement.
HIS HONOUR:  Right.
PRICE: Q.  Now, as has been put to you during these proceedings, you gave a statement in relation to this matter on 11/11/2011.  Do you recall that?A.  Yes.
Q.  At page 9 of the statement, paragraph 47, you told this to the police   actually, I'll go back a paragraph to put it into context.  Page 8 of 11, paragraph 46, you said you went to the kitchen for some food:
""While in the kitchen I met a woman who I began talking with.  I think it was someone's wife, because she lived there.  We had a conversation about general stuff, like what I'm doing, where I'm from, stuff like that.  I ate some food.""
Do you remember that?A.  Yes.
Q.
""Shortly after, another man came into the kitchen.  I would describe this man as being a bit taller than me, about 175 to 180 centimetres tall, a bit round, his belly, or overweight.  Big face, big lips, protruding dark brown eyes, dark coloured skin, short black hair.  I don't remember what he was wearing.  This man was the fat gypsy that Csaba and I had met on our first trip to Adelaide.""A.  Correct.
Q.  That's what you told the police 11/11/2011; right?
""When this man came into the kitchen I had a conversation with him to relay what Csaba had said to me over the phone.  I said, '$206 for the present'.""
Right?A.  Yeah.
Q.  ""He then responded"" and you've already given evidence about who was standing where earlier on in the cross examination that I had with you, he said to you:
""I wasn't expecting you.  I was expecting Csaba.  I told him I need to speak to him because I'm not happy.  Next time tell him he has to come.""A.  Yeah.
Q.  You said, all right, you said you were a little bit scared because he sounded annoyed, ""All I wanted to do was to tell him what Csaba told me and get out of there.""A.  Yeah.
Q.  He said, ""You have to wait a couple of hours.  I'll be back.""  Then he walked out of the kitchen, right?A.  Yeah.
Q.  You never saw him again, did you?A.  No.
Q.  After that conversation, paragraph 49, ""I""   being you   ""went into the bedroom and slept for a couple of hours.""  Right?A.  Yeah.
Q.  Okay.  Now, that's the sequence of events, isn't it?  Yes?A.  Yeah.
Q.  So, you'd just driven there, all that way, you're in the kitchen speaking to the woman, having some food, hadn't had a sleep yet, and this person comes in and then has this quick conversation with you, is off to the side of you and then leaves and you never see him again; correct?A.  Yeah.
Q.  That's the context, isn't it?A.  Don't forget, I saw him two times before or once.
Q.  You saw him before.A.  Yeah.
Q.  At the restaurant.A.  Yeah, that's right.
Q.  And you never saw him another time?A.  So.
Q.  But you just said two times before?A.  One time before; I just corrected.
Q.  Right.  See, what I suggested to you, of the very first questions I asked you this morning was that you knew the person you identified to the police from the person that you met at the restaurant.  You made a mistake when you thought that was the same person in the kitchen of the house.  Do you understand that?A.  Yeah.
Q.  All right.  Is it possible, as you sit there now, as we've gone through and asked all of these questions and you've gone back and searched your memory, that you were mistaken?A.  No.
Q.  Notwithstanding that you might have said some things differently in your evidence in relation to questions asked of you by the Crown or Mr Coroneos, do you want to change anything from what I've just read from your statement now?A.  If I was mistaken, it was only small details that I wouldn't remember, tomorrow or yesterday, that doesn't change anything.
Q.  So that's a no, you don't want to?A.  Yeah, that's right.
Q.  What I'm putting to you, ma'am, just so you're clear, is that Mr Cuzman, the person you've described as the fat gypsy, was never in that house, in that kitchen, on that day; you're mistaken; that's what I'm putting to you?A.  Okay.
Q.  Do you agree or disagree?A.  Obviously, I have to disagree.
Q.  You're mistaken about it when you either told the police that that was the person when you gave your statement or that you agreed to a proposition that they put to you; you were mistaken when you told the police about that on 11/11/11 and now you've stuck with it and you have to stick to the script; that's what I'm putting to you?A.  I believe I wasn't.
Q.  You never told the police when you were arrested on 2 June 2010 anything about a fat gypsy back then, did you?  No?A.  No.""  (T.410-416 - 5.10.2012)
...
Q.  You're saying what you think you can get away with to help the Crown case, that includes saying things that you never really saw, like swapping suitcases or whether or not Mr Cuzman was actually in the kitchen that day; you're making it up.A.  No, I'm not.
PRICE:  Nothing further.  Thank you, your Honour.
WITNESS:  If I want to make up something, I would have made up more serious things, okay.""  (T.417 - 5.10.2012)
98The foregoing is the entirety of the evidence, both in chief and cross examination in relation to the presence of Mr Cuzman in Mr Bucataru's house on 21 March 2010.  It is clear from that evidence that the jury who saw and heard the evidence being given were in a far better position to assess the truthfulness and reliability of Ms Suto than is this Court.  This is particularly so when Ms Suto had already been extensively cross-examined as to her credit.  

99From the point of view of the task which this Court has to carry out, there is nothing in the transcript of Ms Suto's evidence insofar as it relates to Mr Cuzman, which is internally inconsistent, nor is there anything which she said which is obviously false.  Where on two occasions she said something which she wished to change she immediately corrected herself.  Given the position of advantage of the jury in relation to this evidence by Ms Suto, I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the reliability and truthfulness of her testimony in relation to Mr Cuzman.
100I do not accept the submission, on behalf of Mr Cuzman, that if the evidence of Ms Suto were accepted, it is insufficient to establish the elements of the offence in Count 2.  That Mr Cuzman appeared to be angry when told the price of the package which was delivered allows an inference that he was aware of its contents.  The fact that sometime thereafter the amount of money requested by Mr Magyari was handed over to Ms Suto by Mr Bucataru allows the inference that Mr Cuzman had communicated the price to Mr Bucataru and that they had agreed to pay it.
101It follows therefore, for the reasons I have set out, that this is not one of those cases where the potential untruthfulness and unreliability of a crucial Crown witness has so undermined the Crown case that the jury's verdict is unreasonable and is not supported by the evidence.  The jury because of the strong warnings provided by his Honour, and because of the detailed challenges to the evidence of Ms Suto made by counsel for the applicants, were well aware of the need for them to scrutinise her evidence very carefully.  This they clearly did as is indicated by their request for the transcript of her evidence shortly after the summing up concluded.  Nevertheless, they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the applicant.  
102Mindful of the obligations of this Court pursuant to M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 and SKA v The Queen [20-11] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400, I have perused the evidence so as to reach my own conclusions.  While it is clear that Ms Suto was careful not to implicate herself in further criminal activities when giving her evidence, her performance under extensive cross-examination was robust and I am satisfied, allowing for the advantage of the jury in this matter, that it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the applicants were guilty of the offence in Count 2 of the indictment.
103A consequence of that conclusion is that there is no basis for setting aside the jury's verdict in relation to Count 4.  It was accepted by the applicants that if the conviction for the offence in Count 1 was upheld (and by implication therefore a conviction of the offence in Count 2), the conviction for the offence in Count 4 should also be upheld.  No submissions were made to the effect that there were any additional elements in Count 4 which had not been established in the trial.
104The offence in Count 2 is clearly less serious than that in Count 1.  Because the convictions of the applicants for the offence in Count 1 must be set aside, it is necessary that the applicants be re-sentenced for the lesser offence in Count 2.  This will inevitably result in a lower sentence.
105For a number of reasons it is not appropriate for this Court to re-sentence the applicants.  No submissions have been made to this Court in relation to re-sentencing in respect of Count 2.  This Court has no information as to the present circumstances of the applicants which would be relevant on re-sentencing (Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 at [124]).  In those circumstances, the most appropriate course is for the matter to be remitted to the District Court for re-sentence in relation to Count 2 and Count 4.
106That said it is appropriate to draw attention to the fact that the maximum penalty to which this Court's conviction of the applicants on the second count renders them liable is imprisonment for 15 years.  The jury's verdict carries with it the implication that the jury accepted that the amount paid by the applicants was $206,000.00 for whatever quantity of whatever drug they were knowingly involved with the supply of.  While any new sentences may be expected to be less than the terms imposed by Norrish DCJ for the offences the subject of the first counts, those new sentences should reflect the jury's conclusion to which I have referred.  The question of whether bail should be granted pending re-sentence is a matter for the District Court.

107The orders which I propose are as follows:
Christian Cuzman
(1)The application for leave to appeal against conviction in respect of Count 1 on the indictment is allowed and the verdict of guilty in respect of that offence entered 23 October 2012 is set aside.
(2)In lieu thereof Christian Cuzman is convicted of the offence in Count 2 on the indictment.
(3)The conviction of the offence in Count 4 on the indictment is confirmed.
(4)The sentence imposed by Judge Norrish QC on 29 November 2012 is quashed.
(5)The proceedings are remitted to the District Court so that Christian Cuzman can be re-sentenced for the offences in Counts 2 and 4.
Georghe Bucataru
(1)The application for leave to appeal against conviction in respect of Count 1 on the indictment is allowed and the verdict of guilty in respect of that offence entered 23 October 2012 is set aside.
(2)In lieu thereof Georghe Bucataru is convicted of the offence in Count 2 on the indictment.
(3)The conviction of the offence in Count 4 on the indictment is confirmed.
(4)The sentence imposed by Judge Norrish QC on 29 November 2012 is quashed.
(5)The proceedings are remitted to the District Court so that Georghe Bucataru can be re-sentenced for the offences in Counts 2 and 4.
108GARLING J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
109RS HULME AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL and with his Honour's reasons.

		17 October 2014",2014-10-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765042,NW v R [2014] NSWCCA 217,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Garling J.
2McCALLUM J: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Garling J in draft.  I joined in the orders of the Court for reasons which differ in some respects from those expressed by his Honour.
3As Garling J has explained, the definition of the term ""child abuse material"" is broader than the definition of the term ""for pornographic purposes"" previously adopted in the statute and the elements of the new offence are different.  Subject to the requirement to establish that the matter in question be depicted or described in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being offensive, the current definition would apply to any material depicting the private parts of the child, whereas it was an element of the earlier offence that the material depict the child engaged in sexual activity or placed in a sexual context.
4As to count 2, rather than viewing the matter as one of miscarriage of justice, I consider that the defects in the indictment deprived the District Court of jurisdiction: cf Doja v R [2009] NSWCCA 303; (2009) 198 A Crim R 349 at [158]-[159] per McClellan CJ at CL; Grove J agreeing at [181].   
5Count 2 alleged an offence of using a child under the age of 14 years for the production of child abuse material contrary to s 91G(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900.  As at the dates alleged in the indictment, that was an offence unknown to the law.  This is not a case of an indictment describing a known offence in words similar to the statute so as to be ""sufficient in law"" in accordance with s11 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  Nor is it a case in which this Court can substitute the verdict found by the jury pursuant to s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, as submitted by the Crown.  That section applies where the jury ""could on the indictment have found the appellant guilty of some other offence"".  Those words make plain that the source of the integrity of any special verdict of this Court is the indictment. I do not think the section can properly be applied as a mechanism for curing an indictment which failed to invoke the jurisdiction of the court below: cf Doja at [53] per Spigelman CJ.  
6The position is more complex in the case of count 1, which alleged an offence that was known to the law for part but not all of the period alleged.  The indictment on that count was also defective, but it is a defect that was amenable to rectification during the trial by application to amend the dates.  However, since that did not occur, the result must be that the conviction is quashed.  The conviction could only be sustained on the basis that the applicant possessed child abuse material at some point between the commencement of the Crimes Amendment (Child Pornography and Abuse Material) Act 2010 (from 17 September 2010) and 31 October 2010, the end-date alleged in the indictment.  However, since the defect was not identified until after the jury returned its verdict, the consequence is that the applicant has been deprived of a trial on the issues.  Accordingly, I agree with Garling J that there has been a miscarriage of justice in the trial of that count.
7It remains to explain my reasons for joining in orders in the form pronounced on 26 August 2014.  The jury's verdict amounted of itself to a conviction on each count: Griffiths v R [1977] HCA 44; (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 301 per Barwick CJ; at 313 per Jacobs J; at 334 per Aickin J (Stephen and Murphy JJ not dealing directly with that point).  It follows from the way in which I have analysed the issues in the present case that there could not be a new trial on Count 2, since it alleges an offence unknown to the law.  For the same reason, it makes no sense to enter a verdict of acquittal on that count.  Whether it would be appropriate or possible to find a bill in respect of the events that gave rise to that charge would be an issue for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In all the circumstances, I agreed with Garling J that the appropriate determination of the appeal was to make an order for a new trial pursuant to s 8 of the Criminal Appeal Act.  
8GARLING J: On 12 September 2013, an Indictment was presented against the appellant, to whom I shall refer as ""NW"", which charged the following two counts, namely:
""Between 1 January 2008 and 31 October 2010 at Glossodia and elsewhere in the State of NSW [NW] did possess child abuse material
Section 91H(2) Crimes Act (NSW) 1900""
and also that:
""Between 29 May 2009 and 1 December 2009, at Deane Park in the State of NSW [NW] did use [TW], a child then under the age of 14 years, namely approximately 18 months old, for the production of child abuse material
Section 91G(1)(a) Crimes Act (NSW) 1900""
9A jury was empanelled before Letherbarrow SC, DCJ in the District Court to hear those charges.  On 24 September 2013, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts.  
10The appellant, NW, has lodged an appeal against his conviction on these counts.  
11On 26 August 2014, the Court pronounced orders allowing the appeal and ordered that there be a new trial. For the reasons which appear below, I joined in the orders which were pronounced by the Court on that date.
A Legal Issue is Identified
12After the jury returned its verdicts of guilty, the proceedings were adjourned for sentence to Monday 2 December 2013.
13On that day, the Crown Prosecutor who had appeared at the trial, informed the Court that there was a legal difficulty with the convictions, with which the District Court ought deal prior to proceeding to impose any sentence.
14It had become apparent to the Crown Prosecutor that, with respect to Count 1, the terms in which the Indictment was preferred were incorrect because of a number of statutory amendments, which took place during the period covered by the dates in the charge.  With respect to Count 2, the prosecutor informed the Court that the offence with which the appellant had been charged did not exist in that form in the time period alleged in the charge.
15The Crown Prosecutor informed the trial Judge that, as he understood the position with respect to these two counts, there would need to be an appeal, and if the problem that he had identified existed, the appeal ought be upheld and there would need to be a new trial.
16However, as the appellant had pleaded guilty to a third count, which was not put before the jury, and there was no difficulty with the correctness of that count, his Honour was urged by the parties to impose sentence with respect to that count.
17On 20 December 2013, with respect to the third count, the District Court imposed a bond pursuant to the provisions of s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for a period of 2 years from 20 December 2013 to 19 December 2015. There is no appeal against this conviction and sentence.  After the sentence on Count 3 was imposed, the appellant was released on bail pending further hearing of the proceedings in this Court.
Notice of Appeal
18On 26 March 2013, the appellant filed a Notice of Appeal against conviction. There were eight grounds nominated. They are as follows:
""1. Count 1 in the indictment is invalid as the section of the Crimes Act 1900 as charged was not the law during all the period alleged in the indictment.
2. Count 1 in the indictment is invalid as the essential definition identifying an element of the offence was not the law during all the period alleged in the indictment.
3. Count 1 of the indictment is invalid as the elements of the offending behaviour changed twice during the period alleged in the indictment.
4. Count 1 of the indictment is invalid as the maximum penalty for the offence as charged was not the maximum during all the period alleged in the indictment.
5. Count 2 in the indictment is invalid as the section of the Crimes Act 1900 as charged was not the law during all the period alleged in the indictment.
6. Count 2 in the indictment is invalid as the essential definition identifying an element of the offence was not the law during all the period alleged in the indictment. 
7. The finding of guilty for Count 1 is unreasonable as the Tendency notice permitted the use of evidence for Count 2 in respect of Count 1.
8. The finding of guilty for Count 2 is unreasonable as the Tendency notice permitted the use of evidence for Count 1 in respect of Count 2.""
19In considering these grounds, it is convenient to commence with considering Count 2, and in particular Grounds 5 and 6 which raise the issue of invalidity.
Grounds 5 and 6: Count 2
20It is to be recalled that Count 2 of the Indictment dealt with conduct in the period 29 May 2009 to 1 December 2009. The count was charged as being one of using a child ""... for the production of child abuse material"". The section identified on the Indictment was s 91G(1)(a) of the Crimes Act.
21On the appeal, the parties agreed that in 2009 and up to 16 September 2010, the terms of s 91G did not include the use of the phrase ""... for the production of child abuse material"", but rather included the use of the phrase ""... for pornographic purposes"".
22Section 91G, as it existed in 2009, defined ""pornographic purposes"" in this way:
""91G(3) For the purposes of this section, a child is used by a person for pornographic purposes if:
(a) the child is engaged in sexual activity; or
(b) the child is placed in a sexual context, or... 
for the purposes of the production of pornographic material by that person.""
23The phrase ""child abuse material"" became part of the Crimes Act as a consequence of the commencement of the Crimes Amendment (Child Pornography and Abuse Material) Act, on 17 September 2010. Relevantly, the definition of ""child pornography"", which I have set out above, was repealed and a definition of ""child abuse material"" was included in s 91FB of the Crimes Act.
24The definition of ""child abuse material"", it is accepted by both parties, is different from and broader than the definition of ""pornographic purpose"". It is in the following form:
""Section 91 FB Child abuse material - meaning
(1) In this Division:
""child abuse material"" means material that depicts or describes, in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive:
(a) a person who is, appears to be or is implied to be, a child as a victim of torture, cruelty or physical abuse, or 
(b) a person who is, or appears to be or is implied to be, a child engaged in, or apparently engaged in a sexual pose or sexual activity (whether or not in the presence of other persons), or
(c) a person who is, appears to be or is implied to be, a child in the presence of another person who is engaged or apparently engaged in a sexual pose or sexual activity; or
(d) the private parts of a person who is, appears to be or is implied to be, a child.""
""Private parts"" are defined as a person's genital area or anal area and the breasts of a female.
25Section 91 FB(2) provides a range of matters which are to be taken into account in deciding whether a reasonable person would regard material as being offensive.  
26It is to be observed that the definition of the phrase ""child abuse material"" is broader than the definition of the phrase ""pornographic purposes"" because the more recent definition includes a specific reference to the depiction of the private parts of a person, whereas the earlier material required the depiction to be in a particular context or in a particular pose.
27It was the Crown's principal submission at trial that the offence was complete because the photograph showed the child's private parts. The child depicted in the photos, the subject of the charge was naked and her private parts could be seen. On that basis, the photographs were said to have constituted child abuse material.  Being satisfied of that fact alone would not have been sufficient, without more, to meet the definition in the earlier legislation of ""pornographic purpose"". 
28The repealed and current sections are also different in another material respect.  The repealed definition of ""pornographic purposes"" did not require any reconsideration, objectively, of the offensiveness of the material.  A jury considering an offence charged under the repealed legislation, as this charge should have been, needed to consider and decide if the content of the photographs in fact depicted sexual activity or the existence of a sexual context, and whether the child was engaged in the sexual activity or placed in the sexual context ""... for the purposes of the production of pornographic material"".  
29Under the current section, which did not exist at the time of the alleged conduct, and in accordance with which the jury were directed, before a guilty verdict can be returned, the jury must be satisfied that depiction of the individual must be in a manner which a reasonable person would find offensive having regard to the matters set out in s 91 FB(2), and that the depiction is of a child and is of a prohibited kind as s 91 FB(1) describes.  
30Shortly put, not only is the definition different, but so are the elements of the respective ""old"" or ""new"" offences.  
31It is simply not possible to equate the two offences, their elements and their content although they are obviously intended to address the same, or substantially the same, conduct.  
32Accordingly, it will be seen that the jury was asked to return a verdict in respect of an offence, the terms of which did not exist at the time the conduct, the subject of the charge, was alleged to have taken place.
33In her written submissions on the appeal, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that, pursuant to the provisions of s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act, it was open to this Court to impose a substituted verdict:
""... because there is sufficient similarity between the old offence of producing 'child pornography' and the current offence of producing 'child abuse material'""
Further, the Crown submitted, it could not be said that there had been a substantial injustice to the appellant.
34In oral submissions, the Crown Prosecutor accepted as is clear from a reading of the statutes that there was a significant difference between the definitions to which I have earlier referred. She also accepted that the newer definition of child abuse material was broader than the one that it replaced. She also accepted that, on the facts put to the jury with respect to Count 2, it was open to the jury to be satisfied that an offence had been committed in reliance upon the broader and more recent definition, which may not have constituted an offence under the earlier definition.
35In summary, the offence charged did not exist for the period charged.  An analogous offence did exist, but there were material and significant differences in the definitions and the elements of the offence.  The significant difference was in the definition of the conduct which was prohibited by the statute.  The principal submission put by the Crown to the jury during the trial did not address the relevant definition of the prohibited conduct, but rather the broader definition, which did not necessarily accord with the offence provisions of the time.
36In those circumstances, it seems clear that the conviction cannot stand because there has been a miscarriage of justice.  NW has been convicted of an offence that did not exist in the terms in which he was charged.  The difference between the statutory provisions is such that there is no room for the operation of s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  The conviction on Count 2 ought be quashed.
37In light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to make a final determination of the question which is not without difficulty, as to whether the indictment (with respect to Count 2) was or was not invalid.  It is also unnecessary to determine whether the District Court had jurisdiction to hear the indictment.  In light of the conclusion that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, there would be no different result, whether this Court concludes that the indictment was or was not invalid and whether or not the District Court had the jurisdiction to hear this charge.
Grounds 1 to 4: Count 1
38The period of the offence alleged in Count 1 was from 1 January 2008 through to and including 31 October 2010.  
39Up until 1 January 2009, namely, in the first 12 months of the period covered by the offence charged, the offence was one against s 91H(3) of the Crimes Act, and not s 91H(2) as the indictment alleged.  Section 91H(3) provided that a person who had child pornography in his possession was guilty of an offence.  Child pornography was defined by relation to whether it depicted a child (that is, a person under the age of 16) engaged in ""... sexual activity, or in a sexual context ..."".  Any such depiction had to be in a manner which would cause offence to reasonable persons.
40With effect from 1 January 2009, as a consequence of the commencement of the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2008, s 91H(3) was repealed, and the offence of ""possession of child pornography"" was merged into s 91H(2).  As well, the maximum penalty for the offence increased from 5 years to 10 years.  Relevantly, for the purposes of the present charge, the definition of ""child pornography"" did not change with this amendment.
41Thus, the only change of substance, relevant here, was an increase of the maximum penalty for the offence from 5 years to 10 years.  I do not regard the structural change or the numerical change, as being of any substance.  
42On 17 September 2010, namely about 6 weeks before the end of the period of time covered by the offence, a new s 91H was substituted upon the commencement of the Crimes Amendment (Child Pornography and Abuse Material) Act.  The new s 91H proscribed conduct by reference to ""child abuse material"" instead of the phrase ""child pornography"".
43Thus, the terms in which the appellant was charged in Count 1, namely that he possessed ""child abuse material"" reflected the legislation which existed for only the final 6 weeks of the 34 month period covered by the offence charged.
44The definition of child abuse material for the offence charged in Count 2 is the same as for the offence charged in Count 1.  I have set out the definition above at [19].
45The definition of child pornography is different from ""pornographic purpose"" which was the relevant definition for the offence in Count 2.  It has an objective element, namely whether the depiction would cause offence to a reasonable person.  The existence of this element brings the definition closer to child abuse material than the offence in Count 2.
46However, for the purposes of the offence in Count 1, the current definition is broader than the repealed one because it includes the depiction of the private parts of a person, whereas the repealed definition did not.
47The conviction of the appellant in Count 1 may well have occurred because, at an unspecified time, but during the period charged, the jury was satisfied that the appellant had in his possession material which depicted a child's private parts.  Such a conviction could only lawfully be sustained if that possession was proved to the jury's satisfaction to have occurred in the final six weeks of the period and not before, 17 September 2010.
48No direction was given to the jury, nor was one sought, which would have led to a verdict for such a short period.  
49As well, one of the significant factual issues at the trial with respect to Count 1, was whether, during the period charged in the offence, the appellant was actually in possession of the material found on a particular computer, and whether, if he was in the possession of the computer, the material was on the computer at the time he was in possession of it.  This issue arose because the computer upon which the relevant images were found was not always in the exclusive possession of NW.  Others had access to it, and from time to time used it.  At other times, NW was not living at the premises where the computer was kept.  
50A further factual issue at the trial was whether the dates upon which certain photographs were taken, and transferred on to the computer, or else downloaded onto the computer from the internet, was accurately reflected by the date contained on the camera's chip, and also within the computer meta-data.
51The existence of these two factual issues means that it was necessary for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that at a particular time, or times, NW was in possession of material prohibited by the statute.  Because the legislation changed in a substantive way on 17 September 2010, the jury could only have returned a verdict of guilty on Count 1 (as charged) if it was satisfied that these two factual issues occurred within the period after the legislation changed.  
52If the jury was only satisfied about NW's possession of the prohibited material, at a time prior to 17 September 2010, then it could not properly have returned a verdict which accorded with the charge as framed.
53The parties to the appeal are agreed that the directions of the trial Judge did not differentiate the periods to reflect the statutory amendments.  Nor was he asked to give any such directions.
54NW submitted on the appeal that the terms in which Count 1 was preferred, and the absence of legislation to support the Count for the entirety of the period charged, and the significance of the difference between the definition of ""child pornography"" and ""child abuse material"" as demonstrating that his conviction on Count 1 constituted a miscarriage of justice.
55In her written submissions, the Crown Prosecutor argued that, as the offence was correctly stated with respect to the period of 6 weeks, the appellant may have been lawfully convicted if the jury was satisfied that in that period he had been in possession of child abuse material.  In a theoretical sense, this submission may be accepted.  However, reference to the way in which the trial was in fact conducted, meant that it was not submitted to the jury, nor was the jury directed in terms that reflected this submission.  In short, the jury was never directed that it could only return a verdict of guilty if it was satisfied of possession and of material of a particular kind after 17 September 2010.  
56Whilst in some circumstances the Crown could fairly submit that having regard to the evidence, a conviction could stand because, if the dates on the indictment were amended, no miscarriage of justice had occurred, I am not persuaded that such a submission should be accepted in this case.  
57Having regard to the entirety of the length of time charged in the Count the significant differences in the statutory definitions between ""child pornography"" and ""child abuse material"", as I have outlined above, the significant factual issues about the existence of the material on the computer and the appellant's possession of it, and in the absence of any submission to the jury, and more importantly, specific directions from the trial Judge about the effect of the legislation, a miscarriage of justice has occurred.
58Accordingly, I would uphold the appeal with respect to Count 1 and quash the verdict.
Grounds 7 and 8: Counts 1 and 2
59These grounds deal with the correctness of the admission of evidence as tendency evidence with respect to the Counts that were charged. In light of the fact that I am of the view that there has been a miscarriage of justice and that the verdicts ought be quashed, it is unnecessary and inappropriate to engage in what is an entirely hypothetical exercise, as to whether evidence tendered was or was not properly admissible.
60There is no need to determine these grounds.
Result
61In the result, I am satisfied that there has been a miscarriage of justice with respect to the proceedings of the jury on both Counts 1 and 2, and that the verdicts returned by the jury should be quashed.
62The appellant submitted that the Court ought enter verdicts of acquittal with respect to the charges.  This is not the appropriate approach in the circumstances of this case.  Because the charges that were preferred did not correctly reflect the legislation, entering an acquittal would be inappropriate.
63There was evidence upon which the Crown relied which, depending upon the terms of any charge, and the evidence which may or may not be admitted, may be sufficient to constitute an offence against the legislation as it stood at the relevant time.
64Having regard to all of the facts and circumstances, including the fact that for a period of time the appellant was held in custody with respect to these charges, until the Crown discovered the errors with respect to the indictment, it will be a matter entirely for the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether any further indictment is to be preferred and, if so, in what terms.
65In all of those circumstances and for those reasons, I joined in the orders pronounced on 26 August 2014, which were as follows:
(1)Appeal allowed;
(2)Convictions entered on 24 September 2013 in respect of Counts 1 and 2 on the Indictment are quashed;
(3)Order that there be a new trial.

2765044,Baquiran v R [2014] NSWCCA 221,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  On 5 April 2013 the applicant was sentenced by Knox DCJ to a total term of imprisonment of 12 years, with an 8 year non-parole period, on one count of supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine and one count of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, both contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).  On the former count, an offence of participating in a criminal group, contrary to s 93T(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), was taken into account on a Form 1.
2The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his sentences on four grounds, including that he has a legitimate sense of grievance when his sentence is compared to those of his co-accused, some of whom were sentenced by Knox DCJ.  Others had been sentenced earlier by different judges. 
3The applicant was a member of a drug supply syndicate that operated out of premises, owned jointly by the applicant and his ex-wife, upon which the business ""Solartint"" was conducted.  The applicant was the proprietor of the business and other members of the syndicate worked for it, including Sabas Capili who was the manager of the business.  The sentencing judge found that the applicant was the principal of the syndicate.  Others involved included Francis De Vera, Rowena Olaivar (who was the applicant's girlfriend), Joel Tongol and Mario Tabuan.  The syndicate sourced drugs from an associated manufacturing operation conducted from other premises.  Persons involved in that operation included Eric Lim, Nghia Huynh, Sythat Hay and Oliver Bui.
4The count against the applicant of supply of a commercial quantity arose out of three sales of methylamphetamine to two undercover police officers, the amounts supplied being 58 grams, 84 grams and 169.3 grams respectively.  
5The count of supply of a large commercial quantity related to the intended supply of one kilogram of methylamphetamine to an undercover police officer.  As those in charge of the manufacture (referred to by the syndicate as ""the Viets"") did not wish to take the risk of supplying a kilogram of the drug in one lot, two supplies of approximately 500 grams each were arranged.  A number of the offenders (including the applicant) were arrested at the time of supply of the first tranche (being 460 grams).
THE SENTENCES IMPOSED
6The offenders were sentenced as follows:

THE SENTENCING JUDGMENT
9In sentencing the applicant, Capili, Huynh and Lim, Knox DCJ reached the following conclusions concerning the roles of the principal offenders:
""In terms of the roles of those involved directly and to whom reference has been made in these proceedings, it does seem to me, and I find, that Baquiran was the principal behind the scheme. Capili was the manager of Baquiran's Solartint business at West Ryde.  For the purposes of this scheme he was Baquiran's right hand man.  I will hear further in relation to that matter when the matter of Capili is dealt with this afternoon but for these proceedings, that is the basis on which I operate.  De Vera appears to have acted as a point of communication and conduit to others outside the group.  He appears to have been the negotiator to the undercover operative on at least some of the transactions.  Judge Jeffreys, in proceedings involving that co-offender, found him to be the spokesman for the group.  Mr Jameson, who appears today on behalf of Mr Baquiran, submits that he was the initial negotiator.  Both Capili and De Vera were employees of Baquiran and effectively subject to his direction and, to some extent, to his control.  There seems to be no issue taken by them or even of them about his control or his directions; indeed they appear to be enthusiastic participants.  Ms Olaivar, who identified Lim finally, was in an emotional relationship with Baquiran and also appears to have been subject to either his control or direction.
Lim was a supplier to Baquiran and one with whom Baquiran dealt.  He was referred to at various stages as either 'Unc' or occasionally 'Eric'.  My Huynh also dealt with Mr Lim in terms of the provision of advice by Lim as to the manufacture.  It seems that Mr Lim was also working with Huynh and Hay.  He was and I find him to have been the one who gave Huynh instructions and was a point of advice and consultation.  Mr Dawe QC submits that his role was more one of a cooperative effort.  With respect, his role seems to me to be beyond that.  Huynh and Lim were both involved in different stages of the manufacture.  They had a similar role to each other in terms of the ultimate manufacture, but I find that it was Mr Lim who was providing the advice and was apparently in a more senior position, at least in terms of experience"" (pp 5-6).
10Before finding that ""the range of criminality in these matters is at or just below mid-range"" (p 30), his Honour made the following findings concerning the drug manufacture and supply operations:
""The total enterprise was a significant operation involving methylamphetamine.  While there is no hierarchy of drugs for sentencing purposes, the experience of this Court is that methylamphetamine is a drug of a particularly pernicious nature with destructive consequences of both a societal and personal nature.  Here the drugs involved were of substantial purity, value and amount as reflected in charges laid.  The joint and individual motivations of the offenders were financial and in some cases followed their association over the years when some of them had been involved in drug usage.  All offenders knew each other and apparently had been involved in the drug world through their own earlier drug consumption. They had graduated from consumption through to what becomes a significant supply and manufacturing operation.  Their individual habits escalated.  They had developed those contacts within the world of supply and the manufacture of drugs as well as that of the precursor chemicals, associated material and the establishment of the laboratories.
In terms of the supply, the matters that I take into account are that those actions pursuant to this enterprise took place over weeks and certainly the months of December 2009 and January 2010.  However, their involvement came to an end, in the case of the majority of them, on 28 January 2010.  It was a commercial operation with the inevitable inference and, in my view, overwhelming inference that it was to be for the purposes of ongoing supply, not, for example, a one-off supply to friends.
The scheme involved was sophisticated.  It involved multiple telephone usage.  It involved the purchase of items such as the identical backpacks.  It involved the switching of phones presenting difficulties and additional demands on police intelligence and interception resources.  Baquiran, for example, was using a mobile service connected in the name of a five year old child.
... 
I do not accept the submission that [the applicant] was a mere participant and find he was the principal, as I have said, providing the premises at the Solartint premises ... securing the drugs, being involved in the negotiations and the discussions"" (pp 20, 21 and 39).
11In relation to the applicant's subjective circumstances, the sentencing judge noted, inter alia, a report of Dr Martyn Patfield who is a psychiatrist at Justice Health.  Dr Patfield diagnosed the applicant as having ""Chronic psychotic illness, probably Schizophrenia, complicated by longstanding entrenched abuse of psycho stimulants"".  He referred to the applicant as presenting ""with a long history of psychotic symptoms including paranoia and auditory hallucinations"" and that he ""also reports visual hallucinations (which is unusual in schizophrenia but certainly reported)"".  His Honour then concluded:
""Whatever the submissions in relation to his mental health he certainly had the intellectual acumen and cunning to be able to be continuously involved in an ongoing commercial methylamphetamine supply operation.  He was able to switch phones as he did on some occasions indicating a clear awareness of the interception procedures by the police.
He also had the capacity and the awareness of the drug trade to make the arrangements that he did in terms of financing.  The proceedings in De Vera, a matter before Judge Jeffreys, indicate that at one stage Mr Baquiran asked De Vera to check the number on the undercover operative's vehicle as part of the determination of whether the deal was risky.  There are related references to that in other parts of the papers.  It seems that he was the one who discussed and initiated the parameters of the deal with Capili and made arrangements with Capili as to going to the transfer point"" (p 40).
12His Honour had guarded views about the applicant's prospects for rehabilitation as he could see ""little evidence, particularly in the absence of sworn evidence that [the offenders and the applicant in particular] are going to sever their connections with those in the drug environment which they have experienced and participated in for ... some time"" (p 41).
13The sentencing judge allowed a utilitarian discount of 25% for the applicant's early plea of guilty and made a finding of special circumstances, resulting in the overall non-parole period being fixed at two-thirds of the applicant's total sentence.
GROUNDS OF APPEAL
GROUND 1 - THAT THE LEARNED SENTENCING JUDGE ERRED IN HIS CONSIDERATION OF THE APPLICANT'S MENTAL HEALTH
14The applicant first submitted that the sentencing judge ""expressly reduced the weight to be afforded to the psychiatric evidence initiated by the District Court and tendered by the Crown by virtue of his view as to the facts being inconsistent with significant psychiatric illness"".  
15I do not consider that his Honour did this.  The effect of his Honour's reasoning referred to in [11] above was, first, that, notwithstanding his mental illness, the applicant was fully conscious of his wrongdoing which involved the application of ""intellectual acumen and cunning"" and, secondly, that the consequence was that his mental illness did not either reduce his moral culpability for his offences or cause them (compare Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [54]).  These conclusions were not inconsistent with the psychiatric evidence which did not assert the contrary to be the case.  Contrary to the applicant's submissions, the evidence of his mental illness did not therefore warrant ""a moderation of the significance of general deterrence in sentencing"" (submissions [35]).  I do not consider there to have been any reason why the applicant was ""not an appropriate medium for making an example to others"" (Muldrock at [53]).
16Secondly, the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge made factual errors when dealing with the applicant's mental illness.  One of those errors is dealt with under Ground 2(b) below.  The other was in the finding that the applicant asked De Vera to check the registration number of the undercover operative's vehicle (see [11] above).  There was however no error in this finding as it was supported by the Statement of Agreed Facts (p 7, third paragraph).
17Thirdly, the applicant alleged that his sentence of imprisonment ""would weigh more heavily on [him] than a person in normal health"" (see Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [177]).  This submission should be rejected in the absence of any evidence, medical or otherwise, suggesting this to be the case.
GROUND 2 - THAT THE LEARNED SENTENCING JUDGE MADE MATERIAL FACTUAL ERRORS WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTS AND ROLE OF THE APPLICANT 
18The factual errors asserted by the applicant were as follows:
(a) That the applicant decided to reduce the amount [the subject of the large commercial quantity count] initially from 1 kg to a lesser amount to ensure that payment was made and received first
19The sentencing judge erred in making this finding as the Statement of Agreed Facts before his Honour in relation to the sentencing of the applicant made it clear that this decision was made by the ""Viets"" (referring to the manufacturers), rather than the applicant (p 9).
(b) That it was the applicant who discussed and initiated the parameters of the deal with Capili and made arrangements with Capili as to going to the transfer point
20The evidence did not justify a finding that the applicant ""initiated the parameters of the deal"", although it did justify the other aspects of this finding which is quoted at [11] above. 
(c) That the applicant sent a text message to Olaivar that said ""only 17 short, 0.857 see you tonight eight thirty""
21This was an error as it was Mr Lim rather than the applicant who sent the message.
(d) That the applicant was using a mobile service connected in the name of a five year old
22This was also an error as the person using this mobile service was Mr Lim, not the applicant.
(e) That each of the offenders other than Lim was found with money and drugs
23This finding (made at p 24) was erroneous so far as it applied to the applicant.
Conclusion
24Whilst these errors do not, when considered alone, appear to have been of fundamental significance to his Honour's sentencing of the applicant, they no doubt formed part of the material upon which his Honour's finding that the applicant was the ""principal"" of the drug supply syndicate was based.  This finding is dealt with at [30] to [47] below.  I have concluded that it was erroneous.
GROUND 3 - THAT THE LEARNED SENTENCING JUDGE ERRED IN HOLDING THAT HE WAS BOUND BY THE FACTUAL FINDINGS MADE WITHIN THE REMARKS ON SENTENCE BY OTHER JUDGES WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY SENTENCED OTHER CO-ACCUSED
25Knox DCJ said at page 12 of his judgment that he was bound by the findings made by Jeffreys DCJ in the course of sentencing De Vera.  In particular he referred to Jeffreys DCJ's findings as to the involvement of De Vera. 
26Jeffreys DCJ found that De Vera acted on behalf of Baquiran and at his instruction and direction (pp 12-13).  Knox DCJ did not say that he used this finding that De Vera was subordinate to the present applicant to support his finding that the present applicant was the principal of the supply organisation, but the applicant suggests that he may have done so.
27If he did, that was an impermissible use of Jeffreys DCJ's findings.  Those findings were relevant to the proceedings before Knox DCJ to identify the basis upon which De Vera had been sentenced.  In that sense they were part of the factual circumstances that Knox DCJ needed to take into account in sentencing Baquiran (R v Tisalandis [1982] 2 NSWLR 430 at 434-5 per Street CJ).  However Baquiran's role had to be determined by Knox DCJ by reference to the facts in evidence before him, essentially those set out in the Statement of Agreed Facts.  As Basten JA pointed out in R v Chandler [2012] NSWCCA 135 at [6] (referred to with approval in Ith v R [2013] NSWCCA 280 at [61]), sentences of co-offenders may occur on differing factual bases if the evidence before the sentencing judges differs.  Whilst material in relation to the sentencing of De Vera and other co-offenders was tendered without objection in the proceedings before Knox DCJ, the purpose of the tender was clearly the former purpose I have identified and it could thus not be used as evidence of the truth of the matters asserted in it or, in the case of the other sentencing judgments, of the accuracy of the findings made in them.  The applicant firmly, and correctly, asserted this to be the position in his written submissions to the sentencing judge (Ex SB12 at 4).
28Knox DCJ's reference to Olaivar being ""subject to either [the applicant's] control or direction"" (p 5) reflects a departure from these principles as that proposition was derived not from the Agreed Facts concerning Baquiran but from the evidence in the proceedings concerning Ms Olaivar.  This was one of the matters that the sentencing judge no doubt took into account in concluding that the applicant was the ""principal"" of the drug supply operation, a finding that I conclude below was erroneous.
GROUND 4 - THAT THE APPLICANT HAS A LEGITIMATE SENSE OF GRIEVANCE WHEN HIS SENTENCE IS COMPARED TO [THOSE OF] HIS CO-ACCUSED, ... IN PARTICULAR, LIM, CAPILI, DE VERA AND OLAIVAR
Whether it was proved that the applicant was the principal of the drug supply syndicate
29Integral to the applicant's submissions in relation to this ground is the contention that the sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant was the ""principal"" of the drug supply syndicate.  I turn to consider that contention first.
30The matters that the Crown relied upon before the sentencing judge to support the conclusion that the applicant was the principal of the drug supply syndicate were as follows:
""(1) The fact [the applicant] was the proprietor of Solartint; (2) The three transactions in December were conducted out of the Solartint business premises; (3) He personally sourced the drugs from co-offender Lim for the 3 transactions in December 2009 and on 28 January 2010; (4) The offender would pass the phone over to De Vera to communicate on the mobile phones with the UCOs; (5) Offender asks De Vera if 'the key has called', to which De Vera replied that 'the key' would only speak with Baquiran [Statement of Facts, p 4, paragraph 2]; (6) De Vera informs UCOs that he has to relay any proposal back to his associates [p 3, paragraph 7]; (7) He would provide feedback to Lim as to quality of the drugs [p 5, para 4]; (8) The offender directs the co-offenders, for example, telling Capili how he would pass over the drugs to De Vera on 9 December and tells De Vera to get the registration plate of the UCO's vehicle [p 7, para 3]; (9) Conversations between the offender and Lim on 28 January, for example, at 13.14 '.. i just find excuse so I can organized [sic] all my boys.  I hope they will not back out and don't know that I'm giving them a half a roll of films' [p 10, para 3].  He then travels to Huynh's to 'see the stuff'; (10) Arrested at the scene in car with Olaivar; (11) The offender after obtaining methylampethamine would divide it up, giving Capili more than the others, who included De Vera and Tongol, they on sold it and settled up with the offender later [p 16, para 6].""
31Proposition (1) was correct but did not indicate that the applicant was the ""principal"" of the drug supply operation.
32Proposition (2) was also correct but again did not indicate that the applicant was the principal.  The Solartint premises were a convenient meeting place because the applicant, Capili, De Vera and others worked at the premises, with Capili being the manager of the business conducted there.  De Vera lived in the garage at the premises.  Nevertheless, the applicant's ownership (with his ex-wife) of the premises from which the drug syndicate operated and his proprietorship of the Solartint business which operated from the same premises is a reflection of the important role he had in the syndicate and therefore of his criminality.
33Proposition (3) was correct.
34As to (4), the Statement of Agreed Facts does not suggest that this happened more than once (on 9 December 2009).  The reason that the applicant handed the phone over on that occasion is not apparent.  That he might have acted as a principal in delegating the handling of the call to De Vera is only one of a number of possibilities.
35The sentencing judge did not take proposition (5) into account as he considered it equivocal (p 11).
36Proposition (6) does not indicate the existence of any particular hierarchy as it is consistent with there being a level of mutual responsibility and coordination amongst the ""associates"".
37The Statement of Facts does not suggest that feedback as referred to in Proposition (7) was given more than once.  In any event, its provision does not give significant support to the proposition that the applicant was the principal of the supply organisation as he was a heavy drug user and was thus an obvious person to provide information as to the quality of the drugs.
38The two examples given in Proposition (8) were correct but constituted the only evidence of directions to co-offenders given by the applicant.  
39Moreover the Agreed Facts refer to directions given by co-offenders.  For example, during the course of the transaction on 30 December 2009, De Vera directed Olaivar to assist by ""sending people around the corner"", and on 25 January 2010 Capili told the applicant to record the undercover officer's car registration plate and house number.  This is a direction to the same effect as that earlier given by the applicant to De Vera.  
40The evidence thus provides only limited support for the sentencing judge's conclusion that the applicant had the ""power to give directions"".  In any event, that power does not appear to have been peculiar to the applicant and does not provide a basis for differentiating between his role and that of De Vera and Capili.  It follows that the sentencing judge's conclusion that Capili and De Vera were ""effectively subject to [the applicant's] direction and, to some extent, to his control"" (p 5) does not appear to be well-founded so far as the drug operations, as distinct from the conduct of the Solartint business, are concerned.
41Proposition (9) was correct but is of only limited significance as it is not evidence of any communications between the members of the supply syndicate but is simply a claim made by the applicant to one of the suppliers in which he may or may not have overstated his role.
42Proposition (10) is correct but does not assist in determining whether the applicant was the principal, particularly as others were arrested at the scene or on their way there.
43Proposition (11) reflects a statement of Olaivar to the police.  As it is contained in the Statement of Facts tendered to support the sentencing of the applicant, it can be treated as evidence against the applicant.  It provides some evidence of an important role being adopted by the applicant but its significance is lessened by the fact that Capili was given more of the drugs than the others (who may have included the applicant).  Moreover, it is unclear whether the applicant's role in this respect was a mechanical one only or represented an important decision-making position.  
44As noted earlier (see [10]) the sentencing judge referred to the applicant being the principal of the supply operation as he had provided the premises, secured the drugs and been ""involved in the negotiations and the discussions"".
45As to the first of these matters, the applicant did provide the premises but, as noted earlier, many of his co-offenders also worked there and De Vera lived there, making it a convenient location from which to operate the syndicate.  Secondly, the applicant did secure the drugs from Lim but Olaivar often accompanied him.
46Thirdly, the applicant was involved in the ""negotiations and the discussions"" (presumably a reference primarily to those with the undercover officers) but De Vera appears to have had a more prominent role in those negotiations and discussions.
47I conclude in light of these matters that there was insufficient evidence to justify the sentencing judge's conclusion that the applicant was the principal of the supply operation, it being necessary that that proposition be established beyond reasonable doubt (R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [26]-[27]).
The bases of the sentences of the main co-offenders (Lim, Capili, De Vera and Olaivar)
48Knox DCJ sentenced Lim at the same time that his Honour sentenced the applicant.  His Honour found that Lim's role in the manufacturing process was ""as a directing person, a person of advice and a higher and different level than that of Huynh"" (p 47).  His Honour regarded ""the roles of both Lim and Baquiran as being different but being at about the same level of responsibility in the overall scheme.  Baquiran has more criminality given his involvement in the organisational sense of directing and negotiating but clearly Lim had a responsibility in terms of directions and advice giving and was also the subject of ongoing discussions with Mr Baquiran in relation to the provision of the drugs"" (p 48).  Lim was allowed a 25% discount on sentence for an early plea of guilty.
49Knox DCJ found that Capili was Baquiran's ""right hand man"" and that both Capili and De Vera were ""effectively subject to [the applicant's] direction and, to some extent, to his control"" (p 5).  Later, his Honour found that Baquiran was the principal but ""Capili was certainly at a senior level but under his direction"" (p 25).  In his further judgment of 10 May 2013 concerning Capili, Knox DCJ said:
""It is clear, in my view, that the offender was not only the manager of the Solartint business, Baquiran's senior assistant and intimately involved in the transactions and illegality, that he knew what was going on in relation to the supply to the undercover operative, but was fully aware of the nature of this enterprise.  There are no charges of manufacture for this offender compared to the relevant matters of Huynh or Lim"" (p 21).
50His Honour referred to Capili's role as being ""at a lesser level - namely that of a senior assistant.  His involvement in the events of the offence represent [sic] criminality above low range but below mid-range"" (p 23).  His Honour allowed a 25% utilitarian discount to reflect Capili's early plea.
51In comparing Capili's role to that of Olaivar, his Honour said:
""[Olaivar] was a vulnerable girlfriend of the co-offender Baquiran.  He had a dominant personality in respect of her in any event.  She became addicted to methylamphetamine after meeting him and it is a matter of some inference that that, and the associated effects of the addiction, must have been known to others in this group"" (p 20).
52In his sentencing judgment of 12 March 2013 in relation to De Vera, Jeffreys DCJ said:
""In this case, although the offender was participating with the undercover operative, it is clear in my view that the offender is not the person making the decisions in relation to the ultimate supply and prospective supply to the undercover operative"" (p 10).
""The evidence shows that the offender was acting on behalf of Baquiran, directly communicating with the undercover operatives on behalf of Baquiran, that he agreed with the undercover operatives and in fact supplied quantities of drugs to the undercover operatives.  His role was that of a front man who dealt with the undercover operatives, received drugs from Baquiran and others on behalf of the organisation, delivered them to the undercover operatives and received money in return and gave the money to Baquiran and others"" (pp 12-13).
53De Vera received a 25% utilitarian discount against his sentence to reflect his early plea.  His Honour was satisfied that De Vera's judgment in relation to his participation in the events the subject of the charges was impaired from the use of drugs.  His Honour found this to be a relevant mitigating circumstance on the basis of what Wood CJ at CL said in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346.  His Honour also found that De Vera had shown ""deep contrition"".  
54In her sentencing judgment of 27 January 2012 relating to Olaivar, Syme DCJ said:
""I take into account the following matters:  First, the offender was a girlfriend of one of the principals of the syndicate.  Second, she started using, and quickly became addicted to, the drug ice.  Her involvement in the drug ice initially was via another friend of hers who introduced her to the principal.  As a result of this offender's rapid addiction to the drug, her boyfriend's physical control over her increased, and in her emotional state she became powerless to exercise her own will.  Evidence of this is the fact that not only did the offender act to assist the syndicate, she also lent her boyfriend a significant amount of money, probably about $35,000, that she had saved from legitimate sources.
Prior to her involvement with the principal and her addiction to drugs, this offender was a person of very good character, who worked hard in three jobs in order to support her family who live in the Philippines.  The involvement of this offender with the syndicate was somewhere between two and six months.  What I would say is that the offender's drug use spanned a period of about twelve months according to her evidence.  I am prepared to make a finding that her involvement in the syndicate, to a substantial extent, appears to have been between two and six months; her involvement on a peripheral level was probably a little more than that"" (pp 2-3).
Her Honour then referred to Olaivar's ""peripheral role"" in the organisation, her addiction to the drug involved and the control that the principal of the organisation (Baquiran) had over her.  
55Her Honour gave a 50% discount against sentence for Olaivar's early plea and her assistance to authorities.  
The parity principle 
56As French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said in Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [28], the parity principle requires ""that like offenders should be treated in a like manner"" but ""allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances"".  Whilst an appellate court will, because of the discretionary nature of the sentencing judges' decisions, exercise caution before intervening, it will do so where there is a marked disparity between offenders' sentences that cannot be explained by differences in the offenders' offences or circumstances.
Comparison of the sentences
57The not greatly dissimilar total sentences imposed upon Lim and Baquiran (11 years and 2 months, and 12 years imprisonment respectively) are explicable on the basis of Knox DCJ's finding that Baquiran was the principal of the supply syndicate and that, whilst the roles of Lim and Baquiran were different, they were ""at about the same level of responsibility in the overall scheme"" (p 48).  However, as I have found that the finding that Baquiran was the principal of the supply syndicate was not well-founded, the similarity in the sentences cannot be justified.  
58Whilst the evidence showed that Baquiran had an influential position in the supply organisation, it did not demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that he was the principal thereof.  As the respective roles of Lim and Baquiran were critical elements in his Honour's determination of the appropriate sentences to impose, Baquiran would be justified in concluding that he should have received a lesser sentence than Lim, particularly bearing in mind that Lim had, and Baquiran had not, been sentenced for a manufacture offence as well as supply offences.  
59Even if it be accepted, as it must, that the evidence did not establish that Baquiran was the principal of the supply syndicate, there were different circumstances relevant to the sentencing of De Vera and Baquiran that warranted the imposition of a higher sentence on Baquiran than on De Vera.  As the plurality observed in Olbrich at [19], care must be taken in using labels such as ""principal"" to describe the role of offenders in relation to drug offences:  the labels must not obscure the necessary assessment of what the offender did.  Whilst Baquiran was not established to be the principal, the evidence did in my view establish that he had a more important role in the syndicate than that of De Vera, particularly in his sourcing of the drugs and providing the premises out of which the syndicate operated.  Furthermore, De Vera was sentenced on the basis, not applicable to the sentencing of Baquiran, that his judgment in relation to his participation in the events giving rise to the charges was impaired by the use of drugs and that he had shown deep contrition.  In contrast, Knox DCJ noted that Baquiran lacked awareness of the seriousness of his offending behaviour.  In light of this, his mental illness and drug addiction his Honour held ""considerably guarded"" views about Baquiran's prospects of rehabilitation.
60Capili received a not dissimilar sentence to that imposed on De Vera (a head sentence of 7 years and 6 months for the former and 7 years for the latter).  In sentencing him, Knox DCJ said that Capili was at a senior assistant level, having a higher strategic role but a lesser operational role than De Vera (pp 17 and 18).  The evidence at their joint sentencing hearing suggested that Baquiran had an important role both at a strategic and operational level.  In those circumstances, and because of his sourcing of the drugs from the manufacturers and provision of the premises in which the syndicate operated, Baquiran could not justifiably be aggrieved at receiving a sentence significantly greater than those imposed on both Capili and De Vera.  
61The other co-offender to whom the applicant made particular reference in the context of the parity principle was Olaivar.  However, her different role and circumstances (see [54] above), and the discount of 50% on sentence that she was allowed, indicated that her sentence was justifiably markedly less than that imposed on Baquiran.  
62Taking these matters into account, I consider that Baquiran's overall head sentence should be reduced to 10 years imprisonment so that it is less than that imposed on Lim but still significantly more than those imposed on De Vera and Capili.  Adopting the sentencing judge's finding of special circumstances, the non-parole period should again be two-thirds of the overall head sentence.  
63In reaching these conclusions, I have taken into account the applicable maximum sentences and standard non-parole periods.  These are maximum sentences of life imprisonment or a $550,000 fine, or both, on the supply large commercial quantity offence; 20 years imprisonment, or a $385,000 fine, or both, on the supply commercial quantity offence; and 5 years imprisonment on the Form 1 offence.  The former supply offence has a standard non-parole period of 15 years and the latter, 10 years.  I have also taken into account the applicant's entitlement to a 25% discount on sentence for his early plea.
64Moreover, I have had regard to the sentencing judge's findings concerning the subjective circumstances of the applicant and the seriousness of the illegal activities of the syndicate.
ORDERS
65I propose the following orders:
(1)Leave to appeal against sentence granted.
(2)Appeal allowed.
(3)Quash the sentences imposed by the District Court on the applicant on 5 April 2013 and substitute the following sentences.
(4)On count 1 of the Indictment, sentence the applicant to 10 years imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months commencing on 28 January 2010 and expiring on 27 September 2016, and an additional term of 3 years and 4 months expiring on 27 January 2020.  This sentence takes into account the matters on the applicable Form 1.
(5)On count 2 of the Indictment, sentence the applicant to a term of 5 years and 6 months imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years and 8 months commencing on 28 January 2013 and expiring on 27 September 2016, and an additional term of 1 year and 10 months expiring on 27 July 2018.  
(6)The total sentence to which the applicant is sentenced is 10 years imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months commencing on 28 January 2010 and expiring on 27 September 2016 and an additional term of 3 years and 4 months expiring on 27 January 2020.
(7)Accordingly, the applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 28 September 2016.
66ADAMSON J:  I have had the benefit of reading the reasons in draft of Macfarlan JA and Bellew J.  I agree with Macfarlan JA's reasons and the orders his Honour proposes and also with the additional comments of Bellew J.
67BELLEW J:  I have had the benefit of reading, in draft, the reasons of Macfarlan JA.  I agree, for the reasons expressed by his Honour, that the sentencing judge erred and that this Court should exercise its discretion to re-sentence the applicant in the manner his Honour has proposed.  However, I wish to add some observations in relation to the finding of special circumstances which was made by the sentencing judge.
68His Honour's conclusions relevant to the issue of special circumstances were as follows:    
(i)none of the offenders had any ""prior relevant convictions"" (ROS 32);
(ii)none of the offenders had previously served a term of imprisonment (ROS 32);
(iii)all of the offenders had found imprisonment onerous, although not to a degree which was over and above that which might otherwise have been expected (ROS 33);
(iv)the applicant had enjoyed little in the way of family support since being taken into custody, which gave rise to ""further doubts about any support structure being available to him on release in terms of matters of rehabilitation"" (at ROS 39); and
(v)there was little evidence that the applicant would sever his connection with those in the ""drug environment"" upon his release (at ROS 41).  
69Arising from these conclusions, I make the following observations.  
70Firstly, a person's previous good character, and the fact that he or she will be serving a custodial sentence for the first time, will not ordinarily constitute special circumstances:  Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [36] per McClellan CJ at CL, R A Hulme and Schmidt JJ agreeing.  
71Secondly, as the sentencing judge acknowledged, there was no evidence to support the conclusion that the conditions of the applicant's incarceration were more onerous than usual:  Langbein v R [2008] NSWCCA 38; (2008) 181 A Crim R 378 at [113] per McClellan CJ at CL, Hall and Price JJ agreeing.  Accordingly, this factor provided no support for a finding of special circumstances.
72Thirdly, the absence of family support was necessarily relevant to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation.  It led his Honour to express further doubts about those prospects, as did the absence of any evidence that the applicant was intending to sever his previous connections with ""those in the drug environment"".    
73Finally, against this background, his Honour expressly acknowledged (at ROS 33) that a finding of special circumstances in the present case was ""a matter of leniency"", before stating (at ROS 41) that it represented ""an element of generosity to these offenders and to (the applicant) in particular"".  
74In my view there was, to say the least, a real issue as to whether the finding of special circumstances was properly made.  Some of the factors cited by his Honour, such as the absence of any prior criminal history and the fact that the applicant was in custody for the first time, provided little or no support for such a finding.    Others, such as the lack of family support and the absence of evidence suggesting that the applicant would cut ties with criminal associates upon his release from custody, tended positively against it.  Moreover, the leniency which was inherent in the finding was expressly acknowledged by his Honour on two separate occasions.
75Notwithstanding these matters, the Crown did not argue against a finding of special circumstances when the matter was before the sentencing judge.  The Crown similarly raised no issue about the matter before this Court.  In all of these circumstances, it would operate unfairly to the applicant if this Court were to adopt a different approach to that of the sentencing judge.  However, in light of the matters to which I have referred it is appropriate that I repeat the observations I made, with the concurrence of Bathurst CJ and Hoeben CJ at CL, in R v Tuuta [2014] NSWCCA 40 at [57]:    
""Circumstances which are not properly regarded as being ""special"" should not be elevated into that category (see R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at 719; [68]; R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 per Spigelman CJ at [20]).  In order for special circumstances to be made out there must exist significant positive signs which show that if the offender is allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation is likely to be successful, and that this is not merely a possibility (see R v Carter [2003] NSWCCA 243 at [20])"".  **********

2765045,Youkhanis v R [2014] NSWCCA 220,"Judgment

1GLEESON JA: I agree with Garling J. 

2FULLERTON J: I agree Garling J. 

3GARLING J: The applicant was convicted by a jury on 13 February 2012, of an offence contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act 1900 in that, on 13 February 2010, he stole a sum of money from the person of Mr Mohit Sharma.

4The conviction was entered by Ashford DCJ after the jury returned its verdict. On 4 April 2012, her Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 18 months which was suspended under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

5Over 18 months later, after the expiry of the sentence, the applicant filed a Notice of Application for an extension of time within which to lodge a Notice of Appeal. 

6The basis of the application for an extension of time was that the delay was:

""... due to the complex nature of this matter and the delay in receiving transcripts and exhibit material.

The appellant is a person of prior good character (excluding the conviction in this case). He has a desire and wish to study law. A conviction for a matter of this kind would disqualify him from practicing law.""

7The Crown did not oppose the grant of an extension of time and it is appropriate in my view, and I would propose, that an extension of time be granted. 

8I will hereafter refer to Mr Youkhanis, the applicant, as the appellant. 

Notice of Appeal

9The Notice of Appeal seeks only to address matters relating to conviction. There were four grounds of appeal.

10On 4 September 2014, when the matter came before the Court for hearing, senior counsel for the appellant indicated that the appellant no longer pressed Grounds 3 and 4. Accordingly, it is only necessary to consider the first two Grounds.

11They were in the following form:

""1. That the evidence of the main prosecution witness lacked probative force to the extent that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. 

2. The appellant's conviction in relation to count 2 is, in the light of his acquittal in respect of count 1, unreasonable within the meaning of s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912."" 

The Original Indictment

12When the indictment was presented before Ashford DCJ and a jury on 30 January 2012, the Director of Public Prosecutions charged the appellant with two counts. 

13Count 1 on the Indictment was the offence of robbery contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act 1900, and Count 2, which was expressed to be in the alternative to Count 1, was of the offence of stealing from the person, which is also an offence contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act.

14The trial commenced on 30 January 2012, and the jury retired to consider its verdict on 13 February 2012. It returned later that day and found the accused not guilty of Count 1, namely, robbery, but guilty of Count 2, namely, stealing from the person.

15In light of the grounds of appeal, it is necessary to review the evidence in the case presented by both parties at the trial. 

Crown Case

16Prior to the events in question, and for a period of about 18 months up until the end of October 2009, the appellant supplied to Mr Mohit Sharma, who was the victim of the offences for which the appellant was indicted, a number of Apple iPhones which Mr Sharma would then sell on eBay for a modest profit. For the purpose of engaging in those modest commercial transactions, Mr Sharma would contact the appellant on a mobile telephone number which ended in 945. (It is convenient to refer to the mobile telephone numbers relevant to the trial by using their last three digits.) 

17Some months after that initial arrangement ceased, during which period no further contact was made, the appellant made contact with Mr Sharma on 27 December 2009, by sending him a text message from a mobile telephone number 969. The appellant then told Mr Sharma that he could acquire a large number of iPhones at a very good price. All contact with respect to this new transaction was carried out by the appellant, either using the 969 number, or else by using a mobile phone with a blocked number. 

18It was the Crown case that in early 2010, Mr Sharma agreed to buy 75 iPhones from the appellant at $600 per handset, making a total cost of $45,000. This number was later increased to 100 handsets. The appellant and Mr Sharma arranged to meet on the evening of 12 February 2010 to complete the transaction. They eventually met on that evening at about 11pm. 

19It was the Crown case that Mr Sharma arrived at the address which the appellant had given him, the appellant got into his car and directed him to a second location which was at the end of a poorly lit cul-de-sac near to a park in the suburb of Cecil Hills. 

20It was the Crown case that during the drive the appellant made four calls on Mr Sharma's phone to a mobile phone number ending in 700. The appellant said to Mr Sharma that the people they were meeting had guns and were ""dangerous"". The appellant demanded to see the money. Mr Sharma showed him a bag which Mr Sharma had placed in the back seat of his car containing $45,000. He did not show him the balance of the money which was also in another bag in the back seat of the car.

21It was the Crown case that at the end location in the poorly lit cul-de-sac at the edge of a park in Cecil Hills, the appellant stepped out of Mr Sharma's vehicle, took the money bag containing $45,000 from the back seat of the car and ran off into the park. 

22A central feature of the Crown's case was that the appellant had, whilst at his place of employment at the Vodafone store in Mt Druitt, obtained two sim cards that were later activated as the mobile phone numbers 969 and 700. In other words, these two numbers were obtained and used by the appellant for his purposes, including this transaction, and were not unknown to him, as he claimed.

Appellant's Case

23It was the appellant's case at trial that he had had no contact whatsoever with Mr Sharma since they had last spoken in late 2009. 

24The appellant said that he knew nothing of the two telephone numbers ending 969 and 700; that he did not send a text message to Mr Sharma in December 2009; he did not tell Mr Sharma that he could access 100 iPhones at a good price; that he did not make arrangements to meet Mr Sharma on 12 February 2010; and that he did not take the bag of money containing the $45,000, from Mr Sharma's car and run off with it.

25Shortly put, it was the appellant's case that he knew nothing about the allegations, but that Mr Sharma had serious financial difficulties related to his unsuccessful gambling activities, had kept the money for himself,had a motive to lie, and had lied about all of these events.

Evidence at Trial

26It will be obvious that in a trial such as this, when both Mr Sharma and the appellant gave conflicting evidence, that it was necessary for the jury to carefully weigh up the versions given by both Mr Sharma and the appellant, make a careful assessment of their credibility, and take into account and weigh in the balance all of the objective facts which were established, including those established by the circumstantial evidence. 

27The Crown argued that Mr Sharma's account ought to be substantially accepted, and submitted to the jury that it was corroborated in material respects, by independent and objective evidence. 

28The appellant's case to the jury depended upon the evidence that he gave to the jury, and the extensive attack which he made on Mr Sharma's credibility. As well, the appellant relied upon the fact that he was of prior good character, to which a number of witnesses attested and were not challenged. 

Evidence of Mr Mohit Sharma

29Mr Sharma gave evidence of the previous dealings between himself and the appellant. The detail of that is contextual only. 

30Mr Sharma said that in December 2009, whilst he was in India visiting his family, he received a text message from a mobile phone number ending in 969. At that time he did not recognise the number, but the message said that it was from the appellant. Mr Sharma knew the appellant by the name of Garmin, rather than Ramin. 

31When Mr Sharma returned from India, he rang the 969 number and spoke to the appellant. He recognised the appellant's voice. The number ending 969 was thereafter used by Mr Sharma to send text messages to, or else telephone, the appellant. Mr Sharma said that the appellant had told him that he had a large quantity of phones for sale at a really good price. He told the appellant that he would look into it and consider it.

32In January 2010, Mr Sharma agreed to buy 100 handsets from the appellant. Mr Sharma made arrangements to sell 75 of the handsets to a buyer in America and the balance of the 25 handsets to his close friend, Mr Chiraag Tulsiani. 

33The appellant told Mr Sharma that he wanted to be paid in cash. Mr Sharma made arrangements for the American buyer to transfer the appropriate sum of money to his account. On 12 February 2010, which was the day Mr Sharma's American contact had transferred money into his account, he attended at the CBA Ingleburn branch and withdrew $45,000 in $50 and $100 notes. 

34At that time, the appellant was using a blocked number to contact Mr Sharma. There was a deal of contact on that evening according to Mr Sharma, the effect of which was that the original meeting which was due to occur at 8pm was delayed until after 11pm. 

35In preparation for the meeting, Mr Sharma's friend, Chiraag Tulsiani, came to his house at about 9pm and gave him a total of $16,000 for the 25 handsets which he was purchasing. This money was in two envelopes and was placed on the backseat of Mr Sharma's car. At that stage Mr Sharma put the $45,000, which was in a separate bag provided by the Bank, on the backseat of the car as well.

36According to Mr Sharma's evidence, the appellant asked to be picked up at his friend's house and taken to another place where a person in possession of the telephones would meet them.

37Mr Sharma picked up the appellant in his Ford Falcon motor vehicle, which had the numberplate ""Mohit"" from an address in Wetherill Park that he had been given. When he picked up the appellant, Mr Sharma said that, although it was February, the appellant was wearing a black hoodie jacket, and black pants with small redlines. 

38The number plate was of some significance because the appellant denied knowing that the first name of Mr Sharma was Mohit, although he agreed that he had seen the number plate on many occasions prior to February 2010.

39The description of the clothes was also of some significance in the appellant's case because he denied owning any such clothes, and his sister who gave evidence, said that she had not seen such clothes being worn by the appellant. The clothes were also said to be inappropriate for a warm month such as February. 

40Thereafter they set off for the alleged rendezvous. A precise address was not given, but Mr Sharma said that the appellant gave him directions as to where to go. Mr Sharma said that during the course of the journey the appellant borrowed his telephone and, so far as it appeared to Mr Sharma, called others on a number of occasions.

41About half way through the journey between Wetherill Park and Cecil Hill, the appellant asked Mr Sharma to stop the car saying that he wanted to search him in case he had ""any weapons or any gun or anything like that"".

42The appellant went on to describe to Mr Sharma that the person with the telephones that they were meeting was ""kind of dangerous"". There was further discussion about a search. Ultimately, the search did not go ahead because the appellant said to Mr Sharma ""just show me the cash then I'll not search you"". Mr Sharma showed him the cash and, according to him, the appellant said ""Okay, no worries"". 

43This incident caused Mr Sharma to be apprehensive and uncomfortable. He was reassured by the appellant and was directed into a cul-de-sac and was told where to stop with the bonnet of his car facing towards a house. The appellant told Mr Sharma that it was his house and they would have wait for the other individual who was bringing the telephones. 

44Whilst they were waiting in the cul-de-sac, the appellant used Mr Sharma's phone on two occasions. During the last of these occasions, the appellant became quite angry and was apparently abusing the person at the other end of the telephone. 

45According to Mr Sharma, when that telephone call concluded, the appellant did not speak to him. Mr Sharma asked him if the telephones were being delivered and why he had become so angry. According to Mr Sharma, the appellant did not reply until finally he said ""Okay let's go into the house"". 

46At that time the appellant opened his door on the passenger's side of the car. By the time that Mr Sharma opened his driver's side door to get out, the appellant had opened the back passenger door, reached in with his right hand, picked up the bundle of money which he had been shown earlier and ran off with it.

47Mr Sharma tried to stop him but the appellant pushed his hand away and ran off into the park with the bundle of money and Mr Sharma's mobile telephone.

48It was dark and raining. Mr Sharma did not run into the park after the appellant. He said he did not do so because he was scared. He said he was scared because he thought someone else might be coming, and that they might shoot him.

49Mr Sharma closed the two car doors and drove his car back around the corner where there was street light and immediately called 000. The 000 operator sent the police, who took Mr Sharma to the Green Valley Police Station. 

50Mr Sharma's phone records showed four calls from his mobile telephone between 11.54 pm on 12 February 2010 and 12.06 am on 13 February 2010. All four calls were to a mobile phone number ending in 700. Mr Sharma's evidence was that he did not know whose number that was. These four calls matched the calls which Mr Sharma said the appellant had made having borrowed his phone. 

Other Prosecution Evidence

51According to the prosecution evidence, the number 700 was registered to a Mr Tonny Luu at 220 North Liverpool Road, Green Valley. Mr Luu gave evidence that he had lived at that address since 2009, together with his family. He said that he had been to the same high school as the appellant, and in the same year. They were friendly at school with each other, but he had not seen the appellant since they finished high school in 2007. Mr Luu denied that he knew anything of the phone number 700 and said that he had never subscribed for, nor had he ever operated, that number. 

52One of the other numbers, ending in 969 and being the number upon which Mr Sharma contacted the appellant during January, was registered to Mr Ali Scaf. It was also registered on the basis that Mr Scaf lived at 220 North Liverpool Road, Green Valley. Mr Luu, who had lived there for a significant period of time, said that he did not know Mr Scaf and Mr Scaf had never lived at his address in Green Valley. 

53Evidence was given by an analyst at Vodafone, Mr J Santos, that the two numbers ending in 969 and 700, which were registered respectively to Mr Scaf and Mr Luu, had been registered at the Vodafone store at Mt Druitt where the appellant worked. His evidence also established that a number of calls from the number ending in 969 were made through a call tower at Market Town Mt Druitt at a time when the appellant was at work at the Mt Druitt store. 

54A police investigator gave evidence that no DNA or fingerprints of the appellant were recovered from the motor vehicle. He also gave evidence that, despite extensive enquiries, he could not identify a person by the name of Ali Scaf having the driver's licence number or the date of birth provided on the Vodafone records. It was the Crown's case that Mr Ali Scaf was an entirely false name and a fictitious person.

55Mr Wayne Hancock gave evidence from his perspective as a fraud investigation manager employed by Vodafone. With respect to the number ending in 969, he gave evidence that the account had been created with the name of Ali Scaf at the Vodafone store at Mt Druitt at a time and on a day when the appellant was at work. He also gave evidence that the records showed that the entries were done in the Mt Druitt store by an employee who entered to the store dealer's code to access the records and create the entry in the fictitious name of Ali Scaf. 

56Mr Chiraag Tulsiani also gave evidence. He gave evidence that he had known Mr Sharma for some period of time and was friendly with him. He said that Mr Sharma used to supply him with iPhones for which he usually paid in cash. He said that in February 2010 Mr Sharma told him he was sourcing 100 iPhones from the appellant. Mr Tulsiani agreed to buy 25 of the iPhones. 

57He said on 12 February 2010, he withdrew $10,000 in cash from an ANZ account and the rest from his Westpac account. He said the cash, which totalled $16,000 was contained in two envelopes, and in each envelope there was a bank withdrawal slip. He wrapped the two envelopes in a yellow plastic bag and took the money to Mr Sharma's house. He was later informed of what had occurred. He attended the Green Valley Police Station and retrieved his money which was still in the possession of Mr Sharma. 

58Of significance to the appellant, although led in the Crown case, was the evidence of Mr Graham Stephens, the regulatory affairs manager of the Star City Casino. He proved that Mr Sharma was a member of the Casino Rewards Program. It was the appellant's case that Mr Sharma had a gambling problem, and that the money which the appellant was said to have stolen had in fact in been used by Mr Sharma to pay gambling debts.

59Mr Stephens said that Mr Sharma had become a member of the Rewards Program in October 2008, but across the lifetime of his membership there had been a loss of $31,393. His evidence was that at the time of the events in question, Mr Sharma did not owe any money to the casino.

Evidence for the Appellant

60As earlier indicated, the appellant gave evidence. He agreed that he had met and had dealings with Mr Sharma up until about November 2009. He said that the last text communication he had with Mr Sharma was on 1 November 2009, and that he had not seen or spoken to him or sent him any text messages since that time. 

61He said that he had had no contact with Mr Sharma during 2010; that he did not know anyone by the name of Ali Scaf; and he did not know anything about the mobile phone number ending 969. 

62He denied having anything to do with the creation of the accounts for the mobile phone number ending 969 and the mobile phone number ending 700 which was registered in the name of Mr Tonny Luu. He agreed that he knew Mr Luu, but that he had not seen him since completing his Higher School Certificate.

63He agreed that he received an email on 21 March 2010 from Mr Sharma, which had questioned him about what had happened and had sought the return of the money, to which he had not responded, but said that he did not read it until after he had been questioned about the matter by the police. 

64The appellant said that since he was not charged until late September 2010, he was at that stage unable to remember where he was on the evening of 12 February 2010. 

65He denied owning clothing of the kind described by Mr Sharma.

66The appellant was cross-examined about a number of things. With respect to the mobile phone number 969, it was put to him that the activity on that number through the Market Town Mt Druitt tower coincided with his working hours at Vodafone at Mt Druitt, and the activity on that number on towers in other locations coincided with him having left work. 

67The appellant agreed that on 2 February 2010, for a period of one second, his own mobile telephone, number 945, called the 969 number of which he said he had no knowledge. He agreed that the phone records showed that the call went through the Market Town Mt Druitt tower and the employment records showed he was at work at that time. The only explanation that he could offer was that it was perhaps a work-related call.

68The appellant completely denied any of the facts, matters and circumstances surrounding the events giving rise to the loss of cash described by Mr Sharma on the evening in question. In particular, he denied sending the text message to Mr Sharma on 27 December 2009 which put the events into train (on the account of Mr Sharma). Ultimately, that denial could not be maintained because of the production of records which showed the existence of such a message. 

69Shortly put the appellant denied any involvement in the offence whatsoever.

70Three witnesses were called in the appellant's case, and each gave evidence of his good character.

Exhibits

71There was significant documentary evidence tendered by the Crown dealing with copies of text messages which Mr Sharma said that he had received; multiple telephone records of various numbers; and accounts for various telephone numbers.

Ground 2: Inconsistent Verdicts

72It is convenient to commence an analysis of the appeal by reference to the second ground of appeal. 

73The appellant submitted that the fact that the jury acquitted him on the first count of robbery but convicted him of stealing from the person, constituted an inconsistent verdict because the fact that the jury had acquitted the appellant on Count 1 meant that they could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the credibility of the evidence of Mr Sharma, and accordingly, the conviction on Count 2 was inconsistent with that approach. 

74There were a number of submissions made by senior counsel for the appellant. First, he submitted that Mr Sharma was the critical witness in the Crown case whose evidence underpinned the whole of the Crown case with respect to both Counts 1 and 2. Secondly, he submitted that the evidence on Counts 1 and 2 was essentially the same and that, in order to acquit on one count and convict on the other, the jury was relying upon the same evidence of Mr Sharma as to the time, the place and the circumstances with respect to each Count.

75He next submitted that there had been a substantial attack on Mr Sharma's credibility, and in particular regarding his reliability and truthfulness, which must have borne fruit because the jury acquitted the appellant on Count 1 of the Indictment. Accordingly, he submitted that the jury could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the veracity and accuracy of the evidence of Mr Sharma, and hence should have acquitted on Count 2.

76Finally, he submitted that the only rational explanation for the guilty verdict on Count 2, was a compromise by the jury: 

""... perhaps taking into account the excellent character of the accused, his youth and matters of that kind.""

77The Crown submitted that there was no inconsistency between the verdicts which the jury returned on Counts 1 and 2. 

78The Crown submitted that the obvious logical and rational explanation, which stood apart from any assessment of Mr Sharma's credibility, was that the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about an ingredient of the offence charged in Count 1, which was not an ingredient of the offence charged in Count 2. 

79The Crown submitted that in order to prove the offence of robbery in Count 1, it was necessary for the Crown to establish that a threat or offer of violence, putting the victim in fear, coincided with the taking of the money. The Crown submitted that such an element is not necessary for the proof of the alternative charge of stealing from the person.

80The Crown noted that before the jury, the Crown case relied upon a threat or offer of violence, namely that which emanated from the appellant when he made a statement to Mr Sharma about a threat of violence that may in the future be coming from a third person, namely the unidentified supplier of the telephones, who was allegedly coming to the meeting in the cul-de-sac.

81The Crown submitted that the jury may well have been satisfied that Mr Sharma was frightened by the appellant's revelation about the potential danger, but it may not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such revelation constituted a threat or offer of violence or, if it did constitute such a threat or offer, that it was one made by the appellant or, if both of those matters were established, that the threat or offer of violence coincided with, or else was reasonably contemporaneous with, the taking of the money.

82The Crown submitted that nothing in that process of reasoning involves an assessment of the credit or believability of Mr Sharma, and thus it was open to the jury to find the appellant not guilty of the first count, but guilty on the second count.

Discernment

83In MacKenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 366, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ considered the question of inconsistent verdicts. They said:

""Where, as is ordinarily the case, the inconsistency arises in the jury verdicts upon different counts of the originating process in a criminal trial, the test is one of logic and reasonableness.""

At 367, their Honours said:

""... the respect for the function which the law assigns to juries (and the general satisfaction with their performance) have led courts to express repeatedly, in the context both of criminal and civil trials, reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense. Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge's instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt."" (References omitted)

84This decision was cited in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at [6]-[8]. In Markuleski at [40], the judgment of McHugh J in Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; (1998) 197 CLR 316 was also cited. In Osland, McHugh J said this at [120]-[121]:

""When there is no legal or technical inconsistency in the verdicts, a conviction can only be set aside where the inconsistency in the verdicts demonstrates that no reasonable jury who had applied their minds to the evidence could have arrived at the two different verdicts. In such a case, the Court of Criminal Appeal sets aside the conviction because it is unsafe or unsatisfactory.

In determining whether the inconsistency points to an unsatisfactory conviction, the appellate court must consider the evidence, the issues, and the directions which the jury were given. ... An examination of the directions, issues and evidence may confirm that apparently inconsistent verdicts are in fact inconsistent and demonstrate that the conviction is unsafe. Just as frequently, however, examination of the issues, evidence and directions may show that apparently inconsistent verdicts are not inconsistent and that there has been no failure in the reasoning process of the jury."" (References omitted)

85The authorities call attention to the facts, issues and directions in each particular case. As Spigelman CJ said in Markuleski at [73]-[74]:

""The circumstances of a particular case may lead to the conclusion that a jury which has found that it had a reasonable doubt with respect to a complainant's evidence on one count, ought to have had such a doubt with respect to other counts. However, it does not follow that that must necessarily be the case.

It is not, however, easy to formulate principles as to when a jury should conclude that a reasonable doubt on one count, notwithstanding the complainant's evidence on that matter, means that the jury ought to have a reasonable doubt about other counts, about which the only evidence is from the complainant.""

86It is obvious that the presence or absence of corroboration may be a relevant point of differentiation between verdicts on individual counts. After all, in many cases juries are given strong warnings about the dangers of acting on the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant. 

87A court considering a question of inconsistent verdicts needs to be cautious before concluding that a jury (as a whole) has acted contrary to its clearly explained duty. Particularly where there is evidence to support the verdict, there is a need for great caution in presuming that a jury has acted inappropriately in reaching a conclusion of guilt in some circumstances and a contrary conclusion in others: Still v R [2010] NSWCCA 131 at [60] per Johnson J, Basten JA and Rothman J agreeing. 

88The offences with which the appellant was charged are both contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act, and both involve each of the elements of larceny, namely that the property must be taken from the person or the immediate personal care of another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of that money.

89However, for robbery, which was the offence charged in Count 1, there must be violence, or a threat or offer of violence, which induces the victim to part with the property taken. It is not sufficient if there was violence or threat thereof made after the property was taken: R v Foster (1995) 78 A Crim R 517. Thus, the actual or threatened application of force must precede the taking of the goods and be reasonably proximate to it. 

90The directions given to the jury by the trial Judge on the elements of the charge were concise. No submission was made at trial seeking further directions with respect to the elements of the offence. It was not submitted on appeal that the directions were inaccurate or inadequate. 

91In giving her directions, the trial judge said this:

""In respect of the first count the Crown must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused took the property of Mohit Sharma, in this case money, with the intention of depriving Mohit Sharma, the owner of the money, of it permanently. ... The taking of the money, that is the property, has to be accompanied by the victim being put in fear by an offer of violence.""

92Her Honour went on to summarise the evidence to which reference has been made earlier about the events which occurred on the way to where the vehicle stopped. She also drew the jury's attention to what occurred at the time the money was taken. She said, referring to the events in the cul-de-sac this:

""... when the call was finished Sharma said [the appellant] exited the motor vehicle, opened the back door and took the bundle of cash in a bag which Sharma had previously shown him and then ran to the park. Sharma said he was scared as he thought someone might be coming who was going to shoot him or something. ...""

93Her Honour went on to deal with the alternative charge set out in Count 2. She said:

""Now the alternative count, if you are not satisfied the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt all of those elements of count 1, then you must return a verdict of not guilty to that charge and then you go on to look at the elements of the alternative count of stealing form the person of Mohit Sharma. The essential elements of count 2 are in essence the same as count 1 with the exception of the element of placing Mohit Sharma in fear. 

Thus again the property taken must belong to someone other than the accused, that is the property of Mohit Sharma and taken from him. The property, that is the money, must be taken by the accused and carried away by him with the intention of permanently depriving Mohit Sharma of the money which is of value, and the money must be taken without the consent of Mohit Sharma.""

94It is clear from her Honour's concise directions that there was a significant element which differentiated the charges which the appellant was facing on each count: i.e. the element of whether or not at the time of the taking of the money, Mr Sharma was put in fear by a threat of, or an offer of, violence. 

95In the particular circumstances here, there being no other person present at the time of the taking, that offer or threat of violence had to come from the appellant. 

96The Crown relied upon the earlier conduct in the car as it drove towards the cul-de-sac, including the description of those coming to deliver the phones, as having put Mr Sharma in fear sufficiently at the time of the taking of the money to constitute the offence of robbery. It was open to the jury to reject that argument. In so doing, it did not have to form a view of the veracity or credibility of Mr Sharma, but rather could have logically and reasonably simply formed the view that the Crown had not proved that element of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. 

97Because of that obvious difference, and because that obvious difference provides a logical and reasonable conclusion which differentiates the verdicts on the two counts, I would not be prepared to find that the verdicts were inconsistent, as the appellant submits.

98I would not be prepared to uphold this ground of appeal.

Ground 1 - Unreasonable Verdicts

99The appellant submits that the evidence of Mr Sharma was so poor and so lacking in credibility and reliability that the verdict on Count 2 was unreasonable and ought to be set aside.

100I have earlier set out at some length all of the evidence. 

101There were a number of features which corroborated Mr Sharma's evidence and particular parts of it. They included:

(a)his banking records which showed the withdrawal of the sum of $45,000 on the day in question;

(b)the evidence of Chiraag Talsiani with respect to the withdrawal of the sum of $16,000, the placing of it into two separate envelopes, the handing over of it to Mr Sharma and the money being retrieved from Mr Sharma's car after the events in question;

(c)the telephone records of Mr Sharma's mobile telephone which indicated that, at the time of the events in question, four calls were made to a number which was unknown to him, and the registered owner of which was a fictitious person, but the number was associated with the appellant;

(d)the immediate complaint by Mr Sharma in telephoning 000 to report the robbery at a time when he was in his car in the vicinity of the location at which he said the robbery occurred;

(e)the receipt by him in December 2009 of a text message whilst he was travelling in India, from the appellant, a fact which was ultimately not challenged. It was this message which was the start of the train of events in question, with which the appellant asserted he had no connection;

(f)the record of text messages on Mr Sharma's mobile phone which was tendered and became Exhibit E, which demonstrated the unfolding of the negotiations for the purchase of the phones consistently with the account given by Mr Sharma.

102As well there was significant and probative circumstantial evidence which told against the appellant's version, and supported the Crown case.

103The circumstantial evidence with respect to the two mobile phone numbers ending in 700 and 969 which pointed to the appellant as the person who had supplied false names and registration details for those mobile services, and kept them under his control and used them for various communications in the course of the events as described by Mr Sharma, directly contradicted the appellant's account of the events. It was very powerful evidence which also supported the Crown case.

104In particular, the telephone calls made to the mobile telephone number 700, at or around the time of the events in question from Mr Sharma's phone, could only have been made by the appellant. However, he denied any involvement with the number ending in 700.

105Thus, there was a strong, albeit circumstantial, case put forward by the Crown before the jury which did not relate to the credibility of Mr Sharma, and which implicated the appellant in the commission of these offences.

106In considering a ground of appeal such as this, it is always necessary for this Court to satisfy itself by reference to the whole of the evidence, as to whether it has a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant. If it does, then that is a reasonable doubt which the jury must have had: see M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 - 495.

107As French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ said at [14] in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400:

""14. In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

'In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""

108This Court always needs to keep in mind that the starting point in the determination of an application of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses: see M at 493 per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ.

109I have carefully read and given close attention to the whole of the evidence in these proceedings. I accept that there were some answers given by Mr Sharma in the course of his cross-examination which did not reflect well on his credibility. But his evidence was corroborated in material respects. On the other hand, there is reason to doubt that the appellant himself gave entirely truthful evidence, particularly when saying that he had no role in any of the events in question.

110Having carefully reflected on the whole of the evidence, I do not have any doubt at all about the guilt of the appellant. In my view the verdict on Count 2 was not unreasonable. 

111There was corroborated evidence from Mr Sharma who, although he was not the best witness, nevertheless gave quite compelling evidence as to what had occurred. The appellant, who, I accept, had no obligation to give evidence and of course no obligation to prove anything, nevertheless gave evidence which, frankly, was largely unbelievable. It did not accord with the circumstantial evidence obtained by the Crown and which did not rely at all on Mr Sharma's credibility.

112I would propose that this ground of appeal be dismissed. 

Summary

113I have not been persuaded by the appellant that the verdicts were inconsistent, nor that his conviction of the offence, contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act, of stealing from the person was unreasonable. 

114I would propose the following orders:

(2)Leave to appeal granted.

(3)Appeal dismissed.

2765046,Regina v Lolesio [2014] NSWCCA 219,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Garling J.
2McCALLUM J: I agree with Garling J.
3GARLING J:  This is a Crown appeal pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against a sentence imposed upon the respondent, Mr Anthony Lolesio in the District Court at Sydney on 20 December 2013.
4On 17 September 2013, a jury found Mr Lolesio guilty of two offences of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900.  Each of these offences carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years.  
5On 20 December 2013, Blackmore DCJ sentenced Mr Lolesio to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 16 September 2013, and expiring on 15 September 2015, and a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 15 September 2017.  
6Because his Honour imposed an aggregate sentence, he specified that the indicative sentence for each of the offences was a non-parole period of 18 months.
7On 30 January 2014, the Crown appealed.  As ultimately formulated, the Crown relied upon the following grounds:
(1) His Honour failed to disclose any, or any adequate, reasons as to how he came to impose the aggregate sentence imposed pursuant to the provisions of s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, in that he failed to specify how, and on what basis, the aggregate sentence was structured and how he came to the view as to the overall length of sentence.  
(1a) His Honour reduced the respondent's moral culpability on the basis of a factual finding that was not reasonably open to him on the evidence.
(1b) His Honour erred in finding that the objective seriousness of the offences ""falls well below the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" leading to the imposition of a sentence that is manifestly inadequate.
(2) The sentence is manifestly inadequate.
The Indictment
8The indictment presented to the Court at trial contained six charges.  There were two underlying events giving rise to the charges in the Indictment.  One occurred on 14 July 2011, the second occurred on 21 July 2011.  In respect of each of those events, there were three charges in the indictment, each expressed to be in the alternative.  
9The complexity of the Indictment does not need to be examined for the purposes of this appeal, because the jury returned a verdict of guilty with respect to the most serious of the three alternative offences charged for each event.  
10There is no appeal against these convictions by the respondent.  The only appeal before the Court is that by the Crown with respect to the sentence imposed.  
Facts
11In his Remarks on Sentence, Blackmore DCJ recorded the facts.  They are largely not in dispute on this appeal, and it is convenient to set out the facts here by reference to what his Honour found.  
12Mr Lolesio was born in June 1991.  He was married to Chloe, who was a few months younger than Mr Lolesio.  By 2010, their marriage had produced one child.
13In April 2011, Mr Lolesio became angry when he found that he had been ""ripped off"" by an individual who was indebted to him and who was declining to pay the monies owed.  These feelings of frustration and anger were ongoing and strong.  At the time, he was not in regular employment which led to financial stress. This financial stress also contributed to his unresolved feelings of anger. 
14These feelings remained unresolved at the time he and his wife became parents for the second time, when their child, referred to as ""A"", who was the victim in respect of the offences, was born on 31 May 2011.  
First Offence - 14 July 2011
15With respect to the first of the two offences, when A was aged about six weeks, on the morning of 14 July 2011, she had been put down to sleep by her mother, who had then gone out.  A was left under the care of the respondent.  
16During the course of the day, the respondent took out his anger over his financial woes and his frustrations generally on his six week old baby.  He inflicted injuries to her lower limbs, involving on the right side, fractures to the ankle, the foot and the first and second metatarsals, and on the left side, fractures to the left foot and the first metatarsal. As well, the injuries involved associated bruising and swelling.  The right ankle fractures involved metaphyseal fractures to the tibia and fibula.  
17These injuries were inflicted by the respondent on his baby at a time when no-one else was in the house.  Having inflicted the injuries, Mr Lolesio did not take any steps to have the baby taken to a hospital, or to have her examined by a medical practitioner. He did not disclose what he had done to his wife.
18On the following day, because of concerns over her crying, the respondent's wife, Chloe, took the baby to St George Hospital. The fractures were not detected at the Hospital, and the baby was discharged home.  
19According to the expert evidence before the Court during the trial, the lower limb fractures must have been inflicted by one of two methods: first, by pulling and twisting of the lower limbs which caused a shearing at the end of the bone involving a significant level of force; or secondly, by the respondent flailing the baby in a really forceful way.  The metatarsal fractures to the left and right foot must have been caused either by a crushing injury which crushed the bones, or by holding the baby's feet and bending them in hyperflexion, up and down.  
Second Offence - 21 July 2011
20On the Thursday, following the baby's release from hospital, Chloe, went out on the afternoon of 21 July 2011, again leaving A in the care of the respondent.  She arrived home between 5.30 and 6.00pm and observed that A was distressed.  The respondent claimed to his wife that the baby had fallen out of her bassinet.  
21On the following day, Chloe noticed that A's fingers were heavily swollen and lumpy.  She called an ambulance.  The baby was taken initially to St George Hospital, but was then transferred to the Sydney Children's Hospital.  
22On this second occasion, it appears that the respondent had again taken out his frustration and anger on the baby. He inflicted the following injuries: metaphyseal fracture injuries to both right and left forearms and wrists, additional right and left foot metatarsal fractures, being the third and fourth metatarsals on the right foot and the fifth metatarsal on the left foot.  As well, the respondent fractured four of his baby's ribs, being the third, fourth, fifth and sixth ribs, and inflicted a blow which resulted in a left side acute subdural haematoma.  
23According to the expert evidence, in order to inflict the rib fractures, a lot of forceful squeezing would be required.  In respect of the haematoma, the expert evidence was that the injury was a rotational injury caused by significant or severe movements which were quite forceful, and which were repetitive rotational movements.  In short, the respondent had severely shaken his baby causing the subdural haematoma.
24The sentencing Judge found, consistently with the verdict of the jury, that the injuries inflicted on the baby were, on both occasions, deliberately inflicted, and inflicted with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm.  The injuries themselves constituted grievous bodily harm.  
25His Honour went on to say this:
""The offences are all aggravated by the fact that the offender abused his position of trust and that the victim was a vulnerable person, given her age.  In terms of assessing the objective seriousness of the offences it is particularly relevant to have regard to the age of the child, at the time of the injury the baby was some six weeks old, consequently she was entirely defenceless.  
The offender I find, out of frustration and anger, took out that anger on the baby, given the age of the baby and the mechanism of the injury described by Dr Tzioumi in each case the offender must have realised that serious injury would have been caused to the child.""
26His Honour was satisfied that whilst there was no ongoing injury to the bones, but the baby's bones did not heal correctly.  In respect of the subdural haematoma, his Honour noted that the expert evidence during the trial was that it was too early to say what would result from an injury of that kind in the longer term.  
27Although the sentencing Judge did not specifically refer to it, the undisputed evidence was that at the time he inflicted the injuries, the respondent weighed 170kg.  His baby weighed 4.6kg.  
Remarks on Sentence
28His Honour, the sentencing Judge, recited the details of the facts and the injuries to which I have referred above.  He concluded that the objective seriousness of the offences fell well below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  His Honour said this:
""This is obviously a difficult case but looking at the facts as objectively as I can the injuries are not as serious as some that have been seen in other cases.  The manner in which the injuries were caused was quite cruel but fortunately the offender did not go further and cause permanent injury.
In my view the objective seriousness of the offences falls well below the middle of the range of objective seriousness, a standard non-parole period does not need to be applied in these cases, a standard non-parole period remains as one of the guideposts to the sort of penalty that should be applied.""
29His Honour went on to review the subjective case for the respondent.  He noted the respondent's age, and observed that the respondent and his wife had married when they were both quite young and started having children almost immediately.  He noted that both had little by way of life experience when they commenced having a family.
30His Honour accepted the opinion of Dr Greenberg, a psychiatrist, that the respondent was in the upper levels of mild mental retardation.  He rejected the evidence of Professor Hayes, a psychologist, that the respondent had an extremely low level of intellectual functioning.  
31His Honour noted that the respondent had attended school until Year 8, was bullied, and had in the past attempted on one occasion to commit suicide.  
32His Honour called attention to the respondent's past criminal history - the most significant of which was an offence committed whilst he was a juvenile.  His Honour declined to regard this as an aggravating factor, but concluded that he was unable to find that his behaviour on the occasions the subject of the charges was ""... necessarily out of character"".
33His Honour then made the following observations about the baby, which were the subject of specific challenge by the Crown (Ground 1A).  He said:
""[A], unlike their first child, was apparently quite a noisy and somewhat difficult baby.  Such behaviour in a child is challenging even for mature and experienced parents which certainly the offender was not.  It has to be recognised that a parent is capable of lashing out in frustration when dealing with a crying baby.""
34His Honour went on to find that the respondent did not have consistent and satisfying employment, which meant that he was at home with his children, a factor which added to his general frustration and anger.  
35His Honour was persuaded that, at the time of these offences, the respondent was under pressure of various kinds.  He said this:
""Whilst I accept that these offences were caused by a build-up in frustration, it must also be recognised the way in which the injuries were caused was quite deliberate.""
36He went on to assess the respondent's subjective case in this way:
""In my view there is evidence that allows me to find that the offender is not a bad person.  He is essentially a good man who, by reason of his upbringing and his inherent intellectual functioning and the pressures on him as a father with a growing family at a time when he had no consistent work, became angry and frustrated and did something which was very, very wrong.""
37His Honour thought that there were good prospects for rehabilitation provided that there was significant intervention when the respondent was released on parole.
Sentence
38His Honour determined to impose an aggregate sentence.  He said this:
""I will impose an aggregate sentence in relation to each of the offences of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm there will be a non-parole period of one year and six months imprisonment and a total term of three years imprisonment.  Those sentences will be partially concurrent.""
39His Honour then went on to impose an aggregate sentence consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years imprisonment commencing on 16 September 2013, and expiring on 15 September 2015, and a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 15 September 2017.
40The aggregate sentence involves, notionally, a degree of accumulation between the two indicative sentences. However, that accumulation is different in length, depending upon whether one has regard to the nonparole period, or the balance of term.
41The Crown's appeal identifies in Grounds 1a and 1b, two specific errors in the sentencing remarks.  It will be convenient to consider these two grounds first.  It will be convenient to consider the other two grounds (1 and 2) later.
Ground 1a - Erroneous Factual Finding Leading to a Reduction of Moral Culpability
42It is convenient to deal with this Ground first.  When considering the factors relevant to the sentence, and in particular the subjective features relating to the respondent, the sentencing Judge made the remarks about A being apparently a noisy and somewhat difficult baby.  I have set out those remarks in [33] above.  
43The Crown submitted that this finding directly related to the conclusion reached by the sentencing Judge shortly after, where he included the behaviour of the baby as being one of the factors ""...working together at the time that he injured the victim"".  
44The sentencing Judge went on to say that in carrying out his exercise, it was necessary to understand the pressures ""that were working on the offender at the time"".
45The Crown submits that, if relevant, these remarks could only be addressed to an assessment of the moral culpability of the respondent.  The Crown submits that the factual finding, namely that the baby was a noisy and somewhat difficult baby, and such behaviour would be challenging for a mature and experienced parent, and further that it had to be recognised that a parent was capable of lashing out in frustration when dealing with a crying baby, simply did not arise on the evidence before the sentencing Judge.  
46In the course of the trial, the respondent himself did not give evidence.  No witness gave evidence of the behaviour of the baby at or immediately prior to the occasions when she was assaulted.  The only evidence that was before the sentencing Judge as to A's behaviour at each of the times before she was injured, came from the respondent himself, and is only to be found in the fourth electronically recorded interview which was given on 16 August 2012.  
47In each of the four interviews with respect to the first assault, the respondent denied that he was in any way responsible for that offence.  He, therefore, gave no version of events which included any crying or other behaviour on the part of the baby at, or immediately prior, to the time of that offence.  
48In the fourth interview on 16 August 2012, the respondent admitted for the first time that he was responsible for the injuries which formed the basis of the second offence.  He told the interviewing police officer that he was feeling frustrated and angry because of his inability to obtain the repayment of money.  He said that he was missing his family because he was living far away from them, and although he was living with his wife's aunt's family who were happy, he felt frustrated because he did not have his family around.  He said in that context ""I just ... I lost control of myself and just shook my baby instead.""
49He was asked to tell the police officer what had happened and he said:
""I picked her up out of her bed.  I was kissin' her, tellin' her it's, everything's gonna to be alright, daddy's gonna to get some money for us, and ... then I dunno, for some reason, I just lost control of my hands.  I just, I, I let anger take over me at that point and then I just grabbed my baby and just shook her."" (sic)
50He was asked if the baby was crying before he picked her up.  He said ""No, she was, she was, she was quiet"".
51This account of events which formed part of the evidence at trial does not provide the basis for the challenged finding. 
52There was some rather general evidence in the trial that the baby cried quite a lot, and was a ""...continuously crying type of baby"".  There was also some general evidence that she was often quite unsettled, and because she often cried, that could be annoying.  None of this evidence related directly to the circumstances at, or prior to, the time when the offences occurred.  
53Those comments were made by various of the witnesses at the trial and it was open to his Honour to accept them.  However, the Crown submits that it was not open to his Honour conclude that those features were present at, or immediately prior to, the commission of each of the two offences, and that thereby they had a causal relationship with the offender's conduct such as to reduce his moral culpability.  
54Counsel for the respondent submitted that the approach of the Crown to identifying the evidentiary basis for the express conclusion of the sentencing Judge was erroneous because it was unduly narrow.  
55Counsel for the respondent pointed to the totality of the evidence which had been given.  He relied, in particular, upon the evidence from Scott Gregory (husband of the aunt of the respondent's wife) with whom the offender and his wife and children were living, to the effect that:
(a)A cried quite a lot;
(b)she might be described as a noisy baby;
(c)the offender would often look exhausted;
(d)the offender was flustered;
(e)A had a ""good set of lungs"" on her;
(f)sometimes he [Mr Gregory] wanted to run out of the house screaming because A was noisy;
56Chloe's mother, Tania Hetaraka, gave evidence that when she visited shortly after the birth, A was crying a lot and was quite unsettled for most of the time whilst she was there.  She visited up until about two weeks prior to these offences.  The respondent's wife, Chloe, gave evidence that the baby was a ""screamer"" and was ""annoying, a continuously crying type of baby"" which didn't bother her because of her past experiences with other babies.  
57Counsel for the respondent submitted that the sentencing Judge was entitled to disregard the version of events which the respondent had given in his electronically recorded interview, and to infer from this evidence that given the young age of the respondent and the fact that this was only his second child, the elder child being born about 12 months earlier, the probabilities were that in truth the baby was crying at the time shortly prior to these assaults.  Accordingly, he submitted this finding was open to his Honour.  
58In my opinion, error has been demonstrated.  In the context in which the remarks were made by the sentencing Judge, it is clear that he regarded the influence of the baby's crying and the respondent's reaction to it ""lashing out in frustration"" as being relevant in the assessment of the subjective features of the respondent's offending.  The Crown, in my view, is correct to submit that the sentencing Judge regarded this finding as lessening the respondent's moral culpability for the offence that occurred.  His Honour's specific reference to the capacity of a parent to lash out in frustration ""when dealing with a crying baby"", is a direct finding of fact that this is what occurred in these circumstances.
59This was an erroneous finding.  The evidence did not permit that finding to be made.  The respondent denied that there was any crying immediately prior to the offence, and the general indications and descriptions of the baby's conduct given by the other witnesses in their evidence, were so non-specific as to time and place and so unrelated to the events in question, that it was not open to the sentencing Judge to conclude that there was a causal relationship between the conduct of the respondent and any crying on the part of the baby.  
60I am persuaded that error has been shown here, and I would uphold this ground of appeal.
Ground 1b - Error in Finding Objective Seriousness
61It is convenient to commence the consideration of the Grounds of Appeal with this ground.
62An assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence, that is to say, the extent of the objective criminality involved, is one which is carried out without reference to matters personal to the particular offending, but is determined by reference to the nature of the offending: Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27].
63This Court has emphasised that the assessment by the sentencing Judge of the objective seriousness of an offence is a matter which is usually not susceptible of interference on appeal.  In Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], Spigelman CJ, with whom Simpson J agreed, said:
""37 Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour. In my opinion it was open, although I have some hesitation in deciding so and find it to be at the lower end of the range which could reasonably be held to be so characterised.""
64Simpson J said at [46] this:
""46 The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing judge. It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion. As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55CLR 499. The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.""
65However, consistently with the observations of Simpson J, Basten JA said in R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [51]:
""51 ... Nevertheless, the appellate court retains a statutory responsibility under s 5D or s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act to intervene in circumstances where, upon an application of the correct principles, error is established: R v KB [2011] NSWCCA 190 at [53] ... .""
66The Crown submitted that the assessment that the offences fell well below the middle range of objective seriousness was not reasonably open to the sentencing Judge.  Thus, it submitted error was established.
67The Crown pointed to the following factors as being relevant to that assessment, and which did not, on their face, appear adequately to have been taken into account by the sentencing Judge:  the fact that the victim was only six or seven weeks old, and was complete vulnerable without any means of communication other than crying; the disparity in weight between the respondent at 170kg and the victim at about 4.6kg was remarkable; the respondent held a position of trust with respect to his newborn daughter, which he abandoned; and that the respondent's motivation for hurting his child was related to his own anger, stress and a sense of frustration arising from extraneous issues.  
68In addition, the Crown pointed to the injuries and described them as severe.  The Crown noted that the baby suffered at least 15 different fractures.  Of particular importance, the Crown noted that the injuries to the baby's ribs must have involved great force.  This submission was based upon the expert evidence of Dr Tzoumi.
69In combination, the Crown submitted that the assessment by the sentencing Judge was erroneous and that objectively he ought to have found that the offence was very serious.  
70The respondent submitted that it was necessary to keep in mind that the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending is traditionally regarded by this Court as being one for the sentencing Judge, and one in respect of which this Court is reluctant to intervene.  The respondent called in aid authorities of this Court, to which I have made reference at [63]-[65] above.
71As well, the respondent submitted that the Remarks on Sentence were thorough and careful, and that it could not be said that his Honour had failed to have regard adequately to all of the factors which were relevant in the particular case.  In particular, the respondent pointed to the fact that the trial Judge, immediately prior to making his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences, had noted that the manner in which the injuries were caused was quite cruel, and that such a statement by the trial Judge addressed many of the factors pointed to by the Crown in its submissions in this Court.  
72Counsel for the respondent also pointed to the fact that the assessment of objective seriousness relates to the particular offence for which the respondent was convicted, namely, causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause that harm.  Putting it differently, counsel for the respondent submitted that whilst the offence was a serious one, within the many factual examples of offences against the same provision, the sentencing Judge was right to regard this offence as falling well below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
73Notwithstanding the caution that this Court must exercise when considering a ground of appeal such as this, I am well persuaded that the assessment of objective seriousness of this offence by the sentencing Judge was erroneous.  
74The passage relating to the assessment to which I have earlier made reference in [28], appears to me to indicate that the sentencing Judge placed altogether too much emphasis on the fact that the injuries were not as serious as some seen in other cases, and that there was no permanent injury caused, with the result that little, if any, weight has been given to all of the other relevant circumstances.
75Whilst the seriousness of the injuries caused is one element which has to be considered in an assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence, it is not the only feature.  In this case, the features which required careful assessment were:
(a)the complete vulnerability of the victim as a six week old baby;
(b)the position of trust which the respondent occupied as the father of the victim;
(c)the enormous physical disparity in size and strength between the respondent and the victim;
(d)the deliberateness of the conduct which was wholly unrelated to anything which the baby had done, and the intention with which the conduct was engaged in, namely, an intention to cause grievous bodily harm;
(e)the cruelty of the manner in which the injuries were caused, and the force and violence necessarily perpetrated by the respondent on the baby;
(f)the seriousness of the physical injuries actually perpetrated, even making due allowance for the fact that, on the probabilities, there has been no permanent injury.
76Each of these features was present in each offence.  By the time of the second offence, it must have been obvious to the respondent that his conduct on the first occasion had led to injury, sufficiently serious for the baby to have been taken to hospital and to have been admitted overnight with obvious signs of injury.  Although the detail of what had occurred was not then obvious, that the baby had been injured and was in pain, was clear.
77At the hospital on the first occasion, the baby's feet were swollen and she had purplish bruising around her big toes.  As well, she was brought to hospital because of her crying and the inability of her mother to settle her.  
78The respondent had witnessed all of these things before he undertook the second assault on the baby.  In my view, in considering the second offence, his previous experience of what had occurred when he assaulted the baby a few days earlier, is undoubtedly an aggravating factor in the objective seriousness of the second assault.  
79In my view, an assessment of the objective criminality involved in each of these offences would be in the middle range of objective criminality and objective seriousness.  The second offence was more serious than the first.
80Accordingly, I conclude that the sentencing Judge was in error in making an assessment of this feature, and as its obvious from his remarks, that his assessment related directly to the sentence which he imposed.  
81I would uphold this Ground.
Ground 1 - Aggregate Sentence
82The Crown submitted that the indicative sentences, here 1 year and 6 months non-parole, with a total sentence of 3 years for each offence, notwithstanding that on any view the second offence was more serious than the first, reveal error in the aggregate sentence ultimately reached.  
83The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge paid little more than lip service to the requirements of s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
84The respondent submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge to indicate that the sentences which he imposed were the same for each of the offences, and that no error of any relevant kind had been demonstrated.
85The remarks of the sentencing Judge on this issue are short.  He said:
""I will impose an aggregate sentence in relation to each of the offences of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, there will be a non-parole period of one year and six months imprisonment and a total term of three years imprisonment.  Those sentences will be partially concurrent.""
86Section 53A, with which his Honour was obliged to comply when imposing an aggregate sentence, is in the following form:
""53A Aggregate sentences of imprisonment
(1) A court may, in sentencing an offender for more than one offence, impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all or any 2 or more of those offences instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each.
(2) A court that imposes an aggregate sentence of imprisonment under this section on an offender must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the following:
(a) the fact that an aggregate sentence is being imposed,(b) the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence (after taking into account such matters as are relevant under Part 3 or any other provision of this Act) had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence.
....
(5) An aggregate sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with this section.""
87In R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219 at [56], R A Hulme J (with whom Hall J agreed), discussed the importance of proper compliance with s 53A(2)(b).  At [56] he said:
""56. McClellan CJ at CL has referred ... to the provisions of s 53A, including the requirement in s 53A(2)(b) that a court must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence. In an apparent attempt to give effect to this requirement, the sentencing judge in this case said:
'I am imposing an aggregate sentence. In my opinion each of these four offences is of similar seriousness and each would warrant, taking into account the discount for early plea, a sentence of four years imprisonment. There would have to be a degree of accumulation.'  ""
88In dealing with a similar basis for an appeal, Fullerton J (with whom Basten JA and Davies J agreed), said in SHR v R [2014] NSWCCA 94 at [40] this: 
""40 Whilst the announcement of an indicative sentence is not itself amenable to appeal on grounds of manifest excess or severity (see Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 36 at [227]), s 53A does not relieve the sentencing judge of the obligation to assess the criminality for the separate offending inherent in the individual counts. It follows that if there is patent error in the appointment of an indicative sentence that may reveal error in the aggregate sentence ultimately imposed (see R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199 at [17]). Subject to the situation where error in the specification of an indicative sentence is patent (for example where it exceeds the maximum sentence or where the sentence approximates a worst case where the facts do not support that finding), a challenge to the sentence does not involve scrutinising the indicative sentences for error, but whether the aggregate sentence is sustainable. In PD v R [2012] NSWCCA 242, Beech-Jones J observed at [44] (with Basten JA and Hall J agreeing), that for this Court to intervene the applicant must demonstrate that any error in the specification of an indicative sentence (which would necessarily include breach of the obligation to indicate individual sentences in compliance with s 53A(2)(b)) is material to the outcome.""
89With respect, I entirely agree with what Fullerton J has written.
90What it is ultimately necessary for this Court to consider is whether error has been shown in the aggregate sentence.  I have earlier indicated my views with respect to two specific errors underlying the sentence which was imposed.  Ground 4, which complains that the sentence was manifestly inadequate, will be a convenient vehicle, in this case, to consider whether there was error demonstrated in the aggregate sentence.  
91His Honour, the sentencing Judge, did not, in imposing the aggregate sentence which he did, comply with the provisions of s 53A in the way mandated.  Whether this is determinative of the appeal can be considered conveniently in the next ground of appeal.
Ground of Appeal 4 - Manifest Inadequacy
92The Crown submitted that the sentence ultimately imposed was manifestly inadequate.  It was submitted that it was apparent from this manifestly inadequate sentence that too much weight had been given to the subjective circumstances of the respondent, and in the result the sentence did not reflect the objective criminality of the offending, or else pay proper attention to the principles of sentencing: s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
93The Crown draws attention in its submissions to the particular need for general deterrence in cases of the kind here, and to the statutory guideposts of the maximum penalty of 25 years, and the standard non-parole period of 7 years, as indicating that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.
94The respondent points to the fact that the injuries, although apparently serious, have in fact resulted in no on-going disability.  The respondent accepted that the matters were objectively serious, but that the injuries were properly at the lower end of the scale.  
95The respondent submitted that there was a particularly strong subjective case, and that although the sentence may be regarded as lenient, it was not in all of the circumstances, outside the appropriate range.
96Ultimately, the respondent submitted that even if the Court were to form the view that the sentence was unduly lenient, the Court would not uphold the appeal in the exercise of its residual discretion.  
97Because I have been satisfied with respect to Grounds 1a and 1b that specific error has been shown, on one view it is unnecessary to consider this ground at all.  
98However, since the primary purpose of a Crown appeal is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts engaged in the exercise of imposing the sentence, it is important in this case to express a view about the sentence which was imposed, assuming that no error had been shown in the facts and circumstances found by the sentencing Judge.
99Even if I were satisfied that no error had been shown and, as indicated earlier, I am so satisfied, then I would have found that this sentence was manifestly inadequate.  
100The offences of which the respondent was found guilty are very serious.  Not only do they involve the infliction of grievous bodily harm, but also that conduct was accompanied by an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.  The maximum sentence, 25 years, and the standard non-parole period, 7 years, are guidelines to which a sentencing Judge is obliged to have regard.  They of course, do not dictate the sentence that is to be imposed.  The length of the maximum sentence and of the standard non-parole period themselves demonstrate the seriousness with which the legislature regards these sentences.  
101Even if the sentencing Judge was correct to find that this offending was at the lower end of the scale, it is simply not adequate to have imposed an aggregate sentence of 2 years imprisonment.  There were two offences.  The second offence more serious than the first.  Both offences carried a specific intent to cause grievous bodily harm to a most vulnerable victim, and from a person in a position of trust.  
102On the sentencing Judge's view of the facts and circumstances, the sentence that was imposed was wholly inadequate and manifestly so.
103Even if I had not been persuaded to find error, I would have found that the sentences were manifestly inadequate.
Residual Discretion
104Where error has been shown, on an appeal under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, by the Crown, this Court may ""... in its discretion vary the sentence and impose such sentence as to the said court may seem proper"".  
105As well, there exists a residual discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence, even though a sentence is erroneously lenient: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462.
106In considering the exercise of the Court's residual discretion, the respondent relied upon two affidavits, one of 15 July 2014 affirmed by him, and of 16 July 2014 affirmed by his solicitor.  
107Those affidavits show that, since being taken into custody, the respondent has undertaken appropriate courses with respect to drug and alcohol consumption, and appropriate courses with respect to parenting skills.  His conditions of imprisonment are such that, having regard to his classification, he has been allowed to work in the laundry which is outside the jail but within the grounds of the John Moroney Correctional Complex, and he lives in the Honour House, which is also outside the jail, but nevertheless within the correctional complex.  
108The respondent is hopeful that upon becoming entitled to work release, he can obtain work with his former employer at the Target warehouse at Blacktown.  The respondent informs the Court that he has regular visits from his wife, family and friends.
109The affidavit of the solicitor annexes various reports and notes from the file of the Corrective Services Department.  Those annexed notes attest to the fact that the respondent has been employed largely since he arrived at the John Moroney Complex, and has displayed a willingness to work and is working well.  
110The notes also indicate that when assessed on 22 May 2014, with respect to future prospects of parole, the process and expectations, he responded genuinely positively to what was involved.  The staff member of the Windsor Community Corrections Team recorded the respondent appeared to be genuinely remorseful about his offending, that he did not attempt to minimise his actions, but found it hard to explain why he reacted the way he did.  
111It can be readily accepted, since neither of these affidavits were challenged, that the prospects of the respondent being successfully rehabilitated are good, and that the Court may conclude that there is little likelihood of re-offending.
112However, I do not think this is a matter in which the Court could possibly exercise its residual discretion.  The sentences did not reflect the seriousness of the offending and, notwithstanding the subjective matters, which are relied upon, a failure of this Court to correct the sentence would simply result in a term of imprisonment which was wholly inadequate.
113I am not persuaded to dismiss the Crown appeal on this basis.  Rather, I am of the view that it is necessary to vary the sentence that was imposed, and to impose a sentence that would be proper.
Re-sentencing
114The objective circumstances of the offence have already been addressed.  I accept that the injuries inflicted upon his baby, A, did not give rise to permanent or lasting injuries and disabilities.  Nevertheless, as has been identified in [75] above, there were features of the objective seriousness which required careful assessment.
115As I conclude, a proper assessment of the objective criminality involved in each of these offences meant that they fell generally in the mid-range of objective criminality and objective seriousness.  
116There was a reasonably persuasive subjective case.  The respondent is a young man.  
117The report of Professor Greenberg dated 15 November 2013, was before the sentencing Judge.  From that report, it appears that the respondent, other than having a history of hypertension and a recent onset of diabetes, had a largely unremarkable past medical history.
118He reported that he began to drink alcohol at the age of 12, and by the time he reached 16, and up until he turned 20, he was drinking up to five to ten bottles of beer each day.  From time to time he had had alcoholic blackouts, and engaged in early morning drinking.
119He began smoking cannabis at the age of 11 years, and had become a heavy user by the age of 16.  He told Professor Greenberg that he had ceased alcohol and drug use in 2011.  
120He was brought up in a family where he was the fourth of five siblings.  He reported to Professor Greenberg that he had difficulty with literacy, having been regarded as slow at learning whilst at school and had attended special class throughout his schooling career.  He told Professor Greenberg that his wife had recently helped him with his reading skills.
121Professor Greenberg expressed this opinion:
""... Mr Lolesio may be functioning in the upper levels of mild mental retardation range, or of borderline intellectual functioning.""
122He apparently had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder as a consequence of sexual abuse at the age of seven.  
123By the time that he was convicted, Mr Lolesio and his wife Chloe had three children, and she was well advanced in her fourth pregnancy.  That child has since been born.  Since the offence in question, and prior to entering custody, Mr Lolesio had turned to religion, and embraced Christianity and obtained gainful full-time employment. 
124About two years prior to the offences in question, Mr Lolesio had been convicted of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in the company of others for which he had been given a bond for 12 months.  He was at that stage a juvenile, and was subject to the supervision of the juvenile justice system.  There do not seem to have been any difficulties with his complying with the bond.  
125This suggests that it would be appropriate to ensure that the respondent has the benefit of a lengthier period in the community under supervision than would otherwise be the case in accordance with the statute.  
126I am satisfied that the Court ought make a finding of special circumstances.  The respondent is young.  This was his first significant offence.  His prospects of rehabilitation and not offending will be significantly advanced by an ample period of supervision in the community, and he has a large, young family to care for upon his release.  
127Notwithstanding the subjective case advanced for the respondent, any sentence imposed must act as a general deterrent.  It must also reflect the objective seriousness of the offending.
128In respect of Count 1 on the Indictment, taking into account all of the relevant matters, I would impose a sentence of 3 years non-parole, plus a 2 year balance of term being 5 years in total.  That sentence should commence on 16 September 2013, when the respondent first entered into custody.  
129In respect of Count 2 on the Indictment, which I regard as a more serious offence, I would impose a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 6 months non-parole period, plus a balance of term of 3 years, making a total of 6 years and 6 months.  
130To reflect the overall criminality involved, it is necessary for there to be an accumulation between the sentences on Counts 1 and 2, and accordingly, I would commence Count 2 on 16 March 2014, thereby provided for a period of accumulation of 6 months.
131The effect of these sentences is that the respondent will have a non-parole period of 4 years and a total sentence of 7 years.  
132I propose the following orders:
(a)Appeal allowed;
(b)Quash the sentences on Counts 1 and 2 imposed on the respondent in the District Court on 20 December 2013;
(c)On Count 1, being the offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm between 21 June 2011 and 16 July 2011, impose a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 16 September 2013, with a balance of term of 2 years;
(d)On Count 2, for the offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm between 14 July 2011 and 23 July 2011, impose a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months, with a balance of term of 3 years.  The sentence on this count is to commence on 16 March 2014;
(e)The date upon which the respondent will be first eligible to be released on parole is 15 September 2017.

		17 October 2014",2014-10-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765052,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Lucas [2014] NSWSC 1441,"Judgment
1R A HULME J:  Mr Craig Lucas (the defendant) was charged with offences of intentionally or recklessly damaging property (s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) and intimidation (s 13(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW)).  The charges were dismissed by his Honour Magistrate Miszalski at the Liverpool Local Court on 28 March 2014.
2The charges arose from an incident at the home of the complainant on 21 November 2013.  It was the prosecution case that the property damage offence was committed by the defendant having deflated a tyre on the complainant's car.  The intimidation was said to have occurred as a result of the defendant's general conduct and utterances outside the front and back doors of the house.
3The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against the dismissal of the charges pursuant to s 56(1)(c) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).  Such an appeal is as of right but must be on a ground that involves a question of law alone.  There are six grounds of appeal, which I am satisfied do involve such a question, and they may be summarised as involving the following contentions:
The magistrate erred in refusing to permit the prosecutor to lead evidence to establish that there was a ""pattern of violence"", such evidence being relevant pursuant to s 7(2) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act.  (Grounds (i) to (iii)).
The magistrate erred in holding that, where functional interference with the property is the basis of the prosecution case for the purposes of a charge under s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, the prosecution is required to establish that the property has been rendered inoperable by the defendant's conduct. (Ground (iv)).
The magistrate erred in failing to make any findings of fact and to provide reasons for the dismissal of proceedings for the alleged offence against s 13(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act. (Grounds (v) and (vi)). 
4The orders sought are to the effect that the orders dismissing the proceedings should be set aside and the matter be remitted to the Local Court to be dealt with by a different magistrate according to law.  The plaintiff does not seek costs.
5The defendant, through his legal representative, did not seek to make any submissions in opposition to those made on behalf of the plaintiff and has conceded that the appeal should be allowed and the orders made.  Nevertheless, it is necessary for me to be satisfied that the concession is appropriate and that the asserted errors are established:  Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Barbato [2013] NSWSC 1882 at [6] (Hoeben CJ at CL). 
The proceedings 
6The defendant was in a domestic relationship with the complainant that ended in about mid-2010.  For a substantial period of time thereafter she took steps to conceal from him where she and their two children were living.  However, he found where they were living in May 2013 and he was permitted to have contact and access to the children.  He would visit the home from time to time but because of his behaviour she had come to insist that he not come inside the house.  
7The prosecution case was that on the evening of 21 November 2013 the defendant turned up at the complainant's home unannounced and uninvited.  The complainant ushered her son to come in from the backyard where he was playing; her daughter was already inside the house.  She then locked the front and back doors.  She described the defendant's behaviour thereafter as involving him yelling and screaming (for example, she said he was ""yelling about how he's going to hurt us, how he's going to hurt my family"") and pulling on the front door (""it was being pulled at which made me fearful that he was trying to get into the house by pulling the door off"").   He also threatened to deflate the tyres of her car which was parked in front of the house and in fact did so in relation to one of the tyres. 
8The complainant rang triple 0 and the recording of her conversation with the operator was in evidence.  The prosecutor contended that it provided support for her account which rendered her version more acceptable than the defendant's. 
9The first two police officers to arrive on the scene gave evidence.  They claimed to have seen the defendant crouched down beside the complainant's car in the vicinity of a tyre.  Their evidence concerning whether they actually saw him deflating the tyre was not entirely satisfactory but the complainant gave evidence of seeing him do so.  One of the officers said that he saw that a tyre had been deflated so that it had ""very little air, probably 5 psi"". The complainant, however, said that ""it was flat enough that I could see it was flat, but not flat enough for me to not be able to drive it to go and put the air in it"". 
Error in dismissal of the property damage charge
10The property damage charge alleged that the defendant:
""did intentionally or recklessly damage property, to wit, left rear tyre of motor vehicle [registration number], owned by [complainant]"". 
11At the conclusion of the prosecution case the defendant's solicitor submitted that no prima facie case had been established.  He contended that ""a diminution of the air in the tyre ... does not amount to damage"".  He referred to Hammond v R [2013] NSWCCA 93; 85 NSWLR 313 and submitted that there had not been any ""functional interference"" with the tyre.  At the most, the air in the tyre merely needed to be ""topped up"".   The prosecutor submitted that there had been interference with the functionality.  The tyre had been rendered ""somewhat inoperable"" in that the complainant had been required to rectify the damage by taking the car to a service station to reinflate it. In reply, the defendant's solicitor submitted that having to put air in the tyre was no different to someone having to wipe spittle off a seat in a police station, which was the factual situation in Hammond v R, and so there was no ""functional interference"". 
12The magistrate then said:
""HIS HONOUR:  I think as I understand that particular decision, it's to do with two aspects.  One is functionality and in effect it goes to the extent of rendering something inoperable, even if it's for a short time.  Here, of course, it took a long time to get to that particular point but it wasn't flat enough to prevent it from being driven.  It didn't render it inoperable.  In those sort of circumstances it seems to me that on that argument there would be real problems.
As far as the argument concerning the ownership, Mr Meakin, I wouldn't accept that.  I think that that's really looked at as a gift to her.  She is driving it around.  You can't separate the tyres from the vehicle.  It's the vehicle itself.  I wouldn't accept that.  ON THE ASPECT OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A PRIMA FACIE CASE, TO THE EXTENT THAT SHE COULD DRIVE IT TO TOP IT UP, I THINK THAT THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM AS FAR AS THE CASE IS CONCERNED AND THAT WOULD BE DISMISSED THEN.""
13Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the magistrate erred in law in holding that ""damage"" in s 195 required, in the circumstances of this case, that the car was rendered ""inoperable"". 
14In Hammond v R, Slattery J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J agreed) provided an extensive historical review of the case law in relation to offences involving damage to property (at [42]-[69]).   He concluded (at [41], [69] and [77]:
""[M]ere interference with the functionality of an object (without material damage) may constitute s 195(1) 'damage'.""
""[T]he course of authority in both England and Australia now supports the conclusion that interference with functionality of the property in question alone, even without physical harm to or 'derangement' of the property is sufficient to establish 'damage' within the Crimes Act, s 195.""
""[T]he element that a 'person ... damages' property in this Crimes Act, s 195(1) charge requires the proof of facts that establish either physical harm to or functional interference with the property the subject of the charge, so as to show that the thing was rendered imperfect or inoperative in the context in which the property exists.""
15One of the cases relied upon was Samuels v Stubbs (1972) 4 SASR 200 where it was held (at 203-4) that it was ""unnecessary to establish such definite or actual damage as renders the property useless, or prevents it from serving its normal function"". 
16Another of the cases relied upon was A (a Juvenile) v The Queen [1978] Crim LR 689 which provided an approach that Slattery J considered ""useful for the present case"".  He described it thus (at [50]):
""The A (a Juvenile) test requires the court to look at the specific property in question and consider:
(i) whether its physical appearance changed as a result of the act, despite reasonable attempts at cleaning, so that it may be described as 'imperfect'; or  (ii) whether as a result of the act the property was rendered 'inoperative', or unable to be used for its ordinary functions for a period whilst its imperfections were eliminated. 
If the property can be described as either 'imperfect' or 'inoperative' in these senses, then the property has been 'damaged' within the meaning of the Crimes Act, s 195 ..."". 
17The finding of the magistrate in the present case (that the tyre ""wasn't flat enough to prevent it from being driven.  It didn't render it inoperable"") was to the effect that the prosecution failed because it had not established that what the defendant was alleged to have done prevented the car from ""serving its normal function"".  
18However, in my view the evidence was such that the prosecution had established a prima facie case.  The evidence was capable of supporting a conclusion that there had been an interference with the functionality of the tyre, and the car itself, by necessitating that the complainant take it to a service station to pump air into the tyre before normal function was restored.  Put in terms of A (a Juvenile), it was unable to be used for its ordinary functions for a period whilst its imperfections were eliminated"". 
19Ground (iv) is upheld.
Error in excluding evidence of a pattern of violence in relation to the intimidation charge
20Section 7 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act provides:
""7  Meaning of 'intimidation'
(1) For the purposes of this Act, intimidation of a person means:
(a) conduct amounting to harassment or molestation of the person, or
(b) an approach made to the person by any means (including by telephone, telephone text messaging, e-mailing and other technologically assisted means) that causes the person to fear for his or her safety, or
(c) any conduct that causes a reasonable apprehension of injury to a person or to a person with whom he or she has a domestic relationship, or of violence or damage to any person or property.
(2) For the purpose of determining whether a person's conduct amounts to intimidation, a court may have regard to any pattern of violence (especially violence constituting a domestic violence offence) in the person's behaviour.""
21The complainant's evidence commenced with her recounting that she had been in a relationship with the defendant for about 19 years and that they had separated in 2010.  The prosecutor then attempted to adduce evidence about prior violence in the relationship and the following transpired:
""Q. ... Could you describe to the Court the nature of your relationship with Mr Lucas?
MEAKIN:  I object, if your Honour pleases.
HIS HONOUR:  Why?
  MEAKIN:  I'm sorry, your Honour?
HIS HONOUR:  Why?
MEAKIN:  The nature of the relationship, if my friend is, as I said, asking questions in terms of paras 3, 4 and 5 are objectionable on the basis that they might disclose allegations of uncomplained about offences and other things.
HIS HONOUR:  What I'm interested in is what happened on this day.
MEAKIN:  That's exactly right, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR:  That's where we're at.  Paragraph 6.
PROSECUTOR:  I certainly hear what your Honour says in relation to that.  I'm just relying on s 7 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act - I understand your Honour will be well aware of that section - in relation to any pattern of violence leading up to the events that are alleged to have occurred on 21 November last year, given there's a charge pursuant to s 13 of the Act of course of intimidation on this particular witness.  I don't propose to rehash 20 years of--
HIS HONOUR:  Not going to happen.  If you can just stick to what happened on this day and then you can look at whatever else you might need but the idea of going directly to that particular section, as I've seen other prosecutors do in the past where they try and tender the record of the accused--
PROSECUTOR:  Your Honour, I certainly--
HIS HONOUR:  Look, there's some fundamentals about this.  Something happened on a particular day.  Can we find out what happened?
PROSECUTOR:  Yes, your Honour:  I hear what your Honour says in relation to that.  If I could just quickly explain, I was just trying to address it in chronological order.  I didn't mean to push the point with your Honour.
HIS HONOUR:  No, no.  Come on.""
22The magistrate's reference to ""paragraph 6"" indicates that he had the statement of the complainant in front of him.  It was at that paragraph that her account of the incident on 21 November 2013 commenced.  The content of the preceding three paragraphs is what the prosecutor must have been intending to adduce to establish a ""pattern of violence"".  They are as follows:
""I have known Craig LUCAS for 19 years.  We were partners for 16 years and have been separated for three and a half years.  Due to his violent rage and threats we separated on very bad terms.  He had beat and raped me while we were still together.  Police knew there were issues between us after we separated and applied for an AVO on my behalf in 2010.  The AVO specified no contact between him and myself and my kids.  I only allowed phone contact to let him know his children were ok.
I have kept the location of myself and my family from Craig to keep us safe.  I have feared for the past few years that Craig may find us and he did in May.
Since May Craig has continually shown up uninvited to the house.  He has occasionally brought presents such as a new TV and new fridge.  He then returns, again unannounced, and demands the items back.  This has included demanding toys, jewellery and clothes back from his, and my, fourteen year old daughter.  Craig also regularly swears at the kids and has called my daughter Leah ""a fat slut"".""
23Minds might differ about whether what is contained in those paragraphs was sufficient to establish a ""pattern of violence"" but that is beside the point; the magistrate did not rule against the prosecutor on the basis of a lack of probative value.  It must also be observed that it was clear from the complainant's abortive attempts to refer to previous incidents that there had been a number of them in far more recent times than those summarised in the statement. 
24The italicised words in the above extract from the transcript are capable of two interpretations.  Counsel for the plaintiff contended that it amounted to the magistrate having ""shut ... off entirely"" the prosecutor leading evidence to establish a pattern of violence.  This was conceded by the defendant.  But at the hearing of the appeal I indicated to counsel that it may also be interpreted as the magistrate indicating no more than that the prosecutor should lead evidence of the actual incident itself before leading any other evidence under s 7(2) if it was then considered necessary.  
25Upon closer examination of the transcript of the evidence of the complainant I have come to the view that the plaintiff's interpretation should be rejected.  I am satisfied that the magistrate was merely indicating that the need for any evidence of a past pattern of violence would only become apparent once the complainant had given evidence of the incident in question.  In other words, if the evidence was clear that there had been act(s) amounting to intimidation, there would be no need for other evidence to support an inference that there was.  Leading evidence of past incidents might turn out to be a waste of time in a busy court.  
26Counsel for the plaintiff submitted:
""By permitting the court to have regard to any pattern of violence in the defendant's behaviour, s 7(2) makes it clear that evidence which is capable of establishing such a pattern is relevant.  That the legislature has expressly permitted reference to such evidence recognises that conduct which might not on its face appear to amount to intimidation with the meaning of s 7(1) may amount to such where the complainant has been subjected to a pattern of violence in the context of a domestic relationship.  Contrary to the contention of the defendant's solicitor at the hearing, there is no precondition on admissibility to the effect that the content of the evidence has been the subject of previous formal complaint(s).  That may be relevant to questions of prejudice and/or weight, but does not constitute a threshold bar on admissibility.  At the very least, the prosecution should be permitted to adduce such evidence on the voir dire in the event that an objection is made.""
27The matter was the not the subject of argument but for present purposes I am prepared to accept the correctness of that submission.  Clearly, s 7(2) renders evidence of any pattern of violence in a defendant's behaviour potentially relevant but it will not always be so.  The need for such evidence will depend upon whether there is an issue as to ""whether a person's conduct amounts to intimidation"".  Some conduct will clearly amount to intimidation without looking at anything aside from the incident in question.  In such a case, there would be no probative value (within the meaning of that term in the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)) in evidence of conduct of a defendant on past occasions.  In other cases, the conduct might be equivocal or open to interpretation as to whether it amounted to intimidation and evidence of past behaviour might be highly probative on the issue.
28In my respectful view the magistrate in this case was adopting a practical and common sense approach of seeing what the evidence was concerning the incident in question.   After having led that evidence it was open to the prosecutor to seek to lead evidence of previous incidents but she did not attempt to do so.  I accept that this may well have been because she thought the magistrate had ruled against her; but that was her error, not the magistrate's.
29When I raised this issue at the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that subsequent passages in the transcript supported her interpretation of what the magistrate had said in the emphasised passage in the extract above.  I have carefully considered the evidence in its entirety.  What appears is that on one occasion when the complainant began to speak about a previous incident there was an objection which the magistrate upheld (T27.47 - 28.3).  On four subsequent occasions when the complainant did likewise and there was an objection it was the prosecutor who indicated that she did not press it and there was no need for the magistrate to rule (T29.50; T30.30; T33.13; and T34.46).  I see this as nothing more than an attempt by the magistrate to first confine the prosecutor to leading evidence about the incident and the prosecutor thereafter complying with that approach.  There was nothing in any of these exchanges that conveyed that the magistrate would never regard evidence of defendant's past behaviour as relevant and admissible.
30Finally, I observe that the evidence of the complainant as to what she said about the defendant's conduct on 21 November 2013 was clearly capable of amounting to intimidation without the need for recourse to evidence of past behaviour to ascertain whether it was.  This may provide another explanation for the prosecutor not pressing for the admission of such evidence, but I suspect it is more likely that she misconstrued what the magistrate had said.
31My conclusion in relation to grounds (i) to (iii) is that no error by the magistrate has been established.
Error in relation to reasons for dismissal of intimidation charge
32Principles relating to the obligation of a magistrate to give reasons were helpfully summarised by Bellew J in Director of Public Prosecutions v Sadler [2013] NSWSC 718:
""[77] When a Magistrate determines to dismiss a charge, whether on the ground that there is no prima facie case or because on all of the evidence the Magistrate is not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused person, there is an obligation, which Judges of this Court have emphasised, to give reasons for that decision (see Wililo (supra) at [54]; (see for example Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited (2006) 67 NSWLR 402 at 408 per Johnson J). 
[78] Some allowance must, of course, be made for the circumstances in which ex tempore reasons are delivered (see Acuthan v Coates (1986) 6 NSWLR 472 at 485 per Mahoney JA). The Court of Criminal Appeal has consistently said that an overly critical approach should not be taken where ex tempore reasons are given in a busy list, immediately following submissions (see for example Rose v R [2013] NSWCCA 71 at [41] citing Gommesen v R [2012] NSWCCA 226 per Garling J at [37] - [38], McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum J agreeing; see also Warner (aka Jeremy Pachenko) v R [2013] NSWCCA 10 per S Campbell J at [33], Hoeben CJ at CL and Davies J agreeing). Whilst such observations have generally been made in the context of appeals following sentencing proceedings in the District Court, I accept that they are no less applicable when considering ex tempore reasons delivered in a busy list in the Local Court.
...
[80] Moreover, and even when full weight is given to the observations set out in [78] above, the Magistrate's failure to provide any reasons at all for his decision constitutes error. It has been observed that it is not satisfactory for an appellate court to be left to undertake an analysis of exchanges between the bench and counsel during submissions in an attempt to ascertain a Magistrate's reasons for making a particular determination (see Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited (supra) at [19] per Johnson J citing R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94; R v Thompson (2005) 156 A Crim R 467). ...
[81] In respect of the submission made by counsel for the defendant that extensive reasons were not necessary I accept, as a general proposition, that the extent of the duty to give reasons depends upon a number of factors including the nature of the decision, the circumstances in which it is made, and the purpose that the statement of reasons is intended to serve (see Mifsud v Campbell (1990) 21 NSWLR 725). However, at the very least, reasons must be such as to enable a proper understanding to be gained of the basis upon which the decision has been reached (see Pettitt v Dunkley [1971] 1NSWLR 376 per Asprey JA at 382, cited in Soulmezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 257). ...""
33At the conclusion of the evidence the prosecutor addressed in some detail (the transcript runs over four pages).  
34The solicitor for the defendant addressed more succinctly (just under a page of transcript).   He drew attention to what he characterised as a paucity of detail about what it was alleged that the defendant had said that amounted to intimidation.  He submitted that there was no evidence of any threats having been made on this occasion, as opposed to previous occasions.  He referred to the triple 0 call recording and submitted that where there is a break in the conversation between the complainant and the operator when the complainant is clearly speaking to the defendant one can only hear her side of the conversation.  He conceded, however, that some banging and other noise was audible.  He made a submission that the complainant had said something to the triple 0 operator and one of the attending police that indicated that she was not being candid.  
35The solicitor then referred to the evidence given by the defendant.  He referred specifically to one aspect of it which the prosecutor had submitted showed a lack of credibility but which he described as ""nit-picking"".  He concluded his submissions with the general contention that the charge had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
36The transcript then records:
""HIS HONOUR:  I agree with you.  THE MATTER IS GOING TO BE DISMISSED.""
37This was not a case of inadequate reasons.  It is a case of no reasons at all. Nothing was said by the magistrate from which it may be discerned what he thought of the evidence overall and what findings of fact he made, or was disinclined to make.  One is left wondering whether the magistrate agreed with all of the submissions for the defendant; some of them; or the last thing that was said?  If it was the latter, why did his Honour agree?
38Grounds (v) and (vi) must be upheld.
Orders
39I make the following orders:
1. Appeal allowed. 2. Set aside the orders of his Honour Magistrate Miszalski made on 28 March 2014 at Liverpool Local Court dismissing proceedings against the defendant for the offences of intentionally damaging property and intimidation.
3. Remit the matter to the Local Court, differently constituted, to be dealt with according to law.

		21 October 2014",2014-10-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765062,R v Sumpton (No. 3) [2014] NSWSC 1556,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1At about 10.50 am today, Tuesday 21 October 2014, it was brought to my attention that a note had been delivered indirectly to Mr Dennis who appears for the accused in the trial that has now been running for something like six days in front of the jury and 11 days including the pre-trial voir dire.

2The note that was delivered has been marked for identification 13 and it includes a list of addresses, one of which is circled and I am told relates to a person identified as Darius Ohlsen with a date of birth 19 December 1960. Mr Ohlsen is to be a witness in the trial. In handwriting are the words.
""He was a close associate of Andrew Sumpton in period just before Michelle Robert's murder, he would be my suspect."" 

3Mr Dennis received a note when he arrived at Court on Wednesday 15 October 2014. The note was found under the door of the registry of this Courthouse in Grafton that morning and appears to have been placed under the door on the afternoon of 14 October 2014 (a Tuesday) between the hours of 4 and 5.30 pm. 14 October 2014 was the day that the jury was empanelled. Mr Dennis brought the note to the attention of the learned Crown Prosecutor and they have been attempting to resolve the matter without involving me or disrupting the trial. 

4A concern shared by both parties is that the note may have emanated from a member of the jury. The basis of that concern is the fact that the note discloses a more detailed knowledge of the evidence than was reported in the local newspaper. If it was a juror who delivered the note, there may be a problem with the trial continuing. Relevant to the decision that I now have to make, it may be that it would affect the verdict and involve some improper conduct by a member of the jury: s 73A Jury Act 1977 (NSW). I hasten to say that while some involvement by a juror is possible, there is no real evidence to support this. Nevertheless, in view of the possible consequences for the trial and any proceedings that might arise after the trial, it is the joint position of counsel that I should direct an investigation pursuant to s 73A of the Jury Act. I agree with the joint position of the barristers. 

5I am told and accept that there are closed circuit television cameras outside and around the curtilage of the Courthouse here in Grafton and that it may be that viewing of that CCTV footage would disclose the identity of the person who delivered the note. I am also told that the sheriff or court officer in Grafton who has had assistance at times during the trial is alone today and that places her in an impossible position in terms of undertaking such an investigation now because she is very busy handling the jury itself. 

6I am told that there is likely to be a shortage of witnesses to occupy the full day and that she may have an opportunity to review the CCTV footage later in the day. There is also the possibility that she could gain some assistance from either the Lismore or Coffs Harbour office of the sheriff. 

7Accordingly, I direct that there be an investigation by the sheriff into the delivery of the note which is MFI 13 and envelope MFI 12. At this stage specifically directed to a viewing of the CCTV footage outside of the Grafton Courthouse and once that is done to further report to me with a view to allowing the parties to view that footage. 

ADDENDUM TO JUDGMENT

8On closer review of s 73A, and to reflect the terminology of that section, I revised the order to substitute the word ""request"" for the word ""direct"".

9In the course of the day a sheriff from Lismore attended and located the relevant part of the CCTV footage. The relevant part was burned to a DVD. The local sheriff and the Lismore sheriff reported to me in chambers that the footage did capture the person delivering the note and that the person was not a member of the jury. The report was brought to the attention of the parties and the DVD played in Court in the presence of the parties and their legal representatives. All parties agreed that the person depicted in the DVD was not a member of the jury. No further application was made and the trial continues.

		06 November 2014",2014-10-20 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765065,Commissioner of Police v Pecover [2014] NSWSC 1427,"Judgment

Introduction

1The Commissioner of Police appeals pursuant to s 70(1) of the Local Court Act 2007 (NSW) and Pt 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) or alternatively under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) against orders of Brown LCM on 18 February 2014. The orders were made following the hearing of an application by the police (Detective Senior Sergeant Ricki Lindner (Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner)) pursuant to s 219 of Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW) (LEPRA) that certain items, which had been seized from Dr Pecover's (the defendant's) residence on 18 December 2007 pursuant to a search warrant, be forfeited to the Crown. The Magistrate ordered:

All files on drives items 4 (2 v 40GBHDD, 3HEOBJGO, 3HEOBPBC) and 5 in allocated space to be copied onto DVD media and returned to Simon Pecover within 60 days. Thereafter drives 4 and 5 are forfeited to Crown and may be destroyed.

Tower Compucon ANK112662 and items 7, 9, 10, 14 to be returned forthwith to Simon Pecover following removal of items 4 and 5.

2Items 4 and 5 were described in the application:




Item 

Description


4

1 x 'Compucon' brand computer hard drive 
S/N: ANK1102662, also containing Seagate 40GB hard drive (Model - ST340824A - S/N: 3 HEOBPBC)


5

1 x N696 External Hard Drive

3By summons filed on 18 March 2014, the Commissioner specified the following grounds of appeal:

(a)Denial of procedural fairness by improperly rejecting expert evidence in circumstances where the expert was not cross-examined.

(b)Not pressed.

(c)Denial of procedural fairness by not acceding to the prosecutor's application to call further evidence.

(d)Erred in taking judicial notice in relation to the storage of data on computer systems.

(e)Erred in the application of s 219 of LEPRA.

(f)Erred in the application of the evidential onus under s 219 of LEPRA.

(g)Failure to give reasons or adequate reasons for the decision.

4The appeal lies only on grounds that involve a question of law alone: s 57 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. Each of the grounds set out above involves a pure question of law. Accordingly the Commissioner has a right to appeal on these grounds.

Facts

Seizure of the items

5Items 4 and 5 were seized in the course of the execution of search warrant on 18 December 2007 at Dr Pecover's residence. A total of 39 images were found on both items which, in the view of the forensic examiner, constituted child abuse material within the meaning of Div. 15A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (see s 91FB) and ""child pornography material"" within the meaning of s 473.1 in the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). No charges were laid because the Commonwealth DPP considered there to be no reasonable prospect of conviction as exclusive possession could not be established.

6On 14 October 2013 Dr Pecover inquired by email of Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner about the return of seized items and, in particular, missing business, minerals exploration and mining files on seized computer drives. Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner responded by email on 15 October 2013 that some items would be returned but, in respect of the balance, she would apply to the Local Court for a ""disposal order"".

7On 21 October 2013 Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner filed an application in the Local Court for orders under s 219 of LEPRA that, relevantly, items 4 and 5 be forfeited to the Crown. The basis on which a forfeiture order was sought was that the items might contain child abuse material that had not yet been identified and that therefore Dr Pecover could not be lawfully entitled to their possession. 

The proceedings before the Magistrate

8The application was heard by Brown LCM on 18 February 2014. Ms Ferguson, police prosecutor, appeared. Dr Pecover appeared for himself. Dr Pecover handed up submissions but did not give evidence at the hearing.

9After some preliminaries, Ms Ferguson called Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner to prove that she had personally served Dr Pecover with a certificate pursuant to s 177 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) that contained the expert evidence of Senior Sergeant John McCulloch. Dr Pecover had no objection to the certificate although he submitted that Senior Sergeant McCulloch was not independent. The certificate was admitted and marked as an exhibit. 

10In the certificate Senior Sergeant McCulloch deposed that he was an electronic evidence specialist employed by the NSW Police Force. He addressed the complexity of data storage. He opined that, in order to be certain that prohibited data is completely removed from a hard disk, it is necessary to identify all prohibited data but that it was not technically feasible to do so. He explained that data can be deliberately hidden or obfuscated, and that such data may be recoverable only with specialised tools or with passwords and cryptographic keys known only to the person who hid the data. He said that it is possible to conceal child abuse material inside seemingly innocuous images and documents. He said:
""Not only is the person attempting selective removal at risk of breaching the law if data on a storage device is inadvertently missed, such data can potentially provide the owner a defence if he or she later commits a crime involving the possession of prohibited material using that device.""

""In my experience, the presence of prohibited material in 'plain view' on a hard disk is often accompanied by other material of a similar or more severe nature which has been hidden.""

11His Honour then indicated that he had read Senior Sergeant McCulloch's certificate. The balance of Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner's evidence in chief was follows:
Q. Detective Sergeant so in a nutshell you're relying on the expert's report in regard to this application for the disposal of property?
A. I'm relying on the experts report in regards to item 4 and 5. Items 11 and 13 we could not examine due to the age and item 12 is corroded which Mr Pecover told me when we took it, it was corroded anyway so as the Magistrate's quite rightly said there wasn't anything found on 11, 13 or 12 due to corrosion so the only items that are being contended are here are items 4 and 5 and there's child abuse material located on both of those. So I was seeking a court approval to have it forfeited to the Crown for that reason.

HIS HONOUR: Well that means that 11, 12 and 13 are to be returned to Mr Pecover.

FERGUSON: That's the evidence in chief of this witness your Honour.

12Dr Pecover confirmed that he did not want to cross-examine Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner, who was then asked to step down. His Honour then asked Ms Ferguson what in items 4 or 5 justified a refusal to return them. Ms Ferguson responded that they contained images of child pornography to which his Honour responded that the expert certificate was ""less than persuasive"" and that it was ""primarily speculation"". Ms Ferguson offered to recall Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner. His Honour then said:
""It's a matter for you how you run your case but it's not just going to stand up on the basis of what appears to me to be quite inadequate material.""

13Ms Ferguson then reiterated her offer to recall Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner. The Magistrate confirmed that he accepted, as it was undisputed, that images found on items 4 and 5 amounted to child abuse material and refused leave to recall Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner. A discussion followed between the Magistrate and Dr Pecover that related to technical matters concerning computers that had not been the subject of evidence. An extract from the exchange is set out below:
HIS HONOUR: Well hang on, let's deal with the drives, rather than the division of space under NTFS on both systems. Ms Ferguson, we seem to have an issue, apparently, with there being multiple hard disk drives in the Compucom tower.

FERGUSON: Your Honour, my understanding is that we're talking about one contained box, the serial number for that being ANK1102662. Within that box there is the slave and the hard drive.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, well that's common, but there should be two hard disk drives; one master, one slave. In 2008, that would be a fairly normal arrangement.

RESPONDENT: Well if I can make a comment your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Just hang on. Now we've got reference, as Mr Pecover says, to a Seagate 40 gig. External drive with a serial number 3HE0BPBC, but he says there's another drive with a serial number what, Mr Pecover?

RESPONDENT: Well the serial number you just quoted your Honour is an internal drive in that tower unit and there's a second internal drive in that tower unit which is 3HE0BJ60. Now, they operate as two independent drives. One is not a slave specifically holding the operating system. I know this because when the compute was originally built, it had two 40 gig. drives that were striped(as said) together to act as one.

HIS HONOUR: They were a RAID array [Redundant Array of Inexpensive Discs], were they?

RESPONDENT: Correct. Now, that RAID array failed some time - I lost the entire PHD as a result -

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I've done that myself.

14Later in the proceedings, Brown LCM proposed what his Honour described as a ""fairly simple solution"", namely that the files in allocated space on the drives be copied onto a medium that could be returned to Dr Pecover and the drives could thereafter be trashed. His Honour continued:
""They're not going to be worth anything and that solves everybody's problem. In my view the files are property and they've got to be returned. There's nothing wrong with them.""

15Ms Ferguson reminded the Magistrate of the expert evidence that illegal material can be hidden within the files. The following exchange occurred:

HIS HONOUR: Well that argument would mean that every computer seized could never be returned because something could be hidden in it somewhere. That's ridiculous. If these are files which are open to access and they're not encrypted, the police are able to read them if they want to. If they haven't done so, that's not Mr Pecover's problem given that the police have had it for six years. It seems to me that the files are obviously important, they're of value if they relate to his business. Since they're clearly open to access, the decisions about whether they contain images and whether they've got concealed steganographic images in them is something which nobody's ever going to answer anyway. To simply claim that because there have been some inappropriate images found, all the other files are tainted is, frankly ridiculous. Files are files.

. . . 
FERGUSON: Your Honour, the informant officer is maintaining that the police can't give that material back because we cannot guarantee that it doesn't contain --

HIS HONOUR: But you have absolutely no evidence to establish that it does contain anything.

FERGUSON: I would have to rely on that expert's report--

HIS HONOUR: But it doesn't tell me anything either.

16There was a further exchange about item 5 as follows:

FERGUSON: I'm told in item 5, the offending material was found in normal files.

HIS HONOUR: Well I expect it would have been. I don't imagine anybody would reconstruct it from unallocated space. It's not terribly easy to do, especially if there's been a lot of data input and output onto the drive, but we're not trying to copy unallocated files in any event. It's only going to be files whose names are listed in the file allocation tables that are going to be picked up, if you copy them, not the ones that have been erased, not partial files, not the blocks that have been left orphaned from files that have been erased and partly overridden. It's only the name files that are going to be copied and that appears to be one, clean from the prosecution's point of view and two, all that Dr Pecover wants. Dr Pecover, do you have any mans of determining whether anything is missing if you get copies of the named files?

17Later, Ms Ferguson said, of the actual computer tower, that the officer was not aware of where it was located. His Honour responded:
""Well, that's a police problem. It's his property and they've got to give it back to him.""

18His Honour then made the orders set out above but did not give reasons.

Reasons

Relevant legislation

19Part 17 of LEPRA provides for property in police custody. Division 1 deals with confiscated knives and other dangerous articles and implements. Division 2 deals with other property. It relevantly applies to property that is in police custody in connection with an offence, whether or not proceedings for the offence have been commenced: s 216(1)(a) of LEPRA. Section 218 relevantly provides that a police officer who seizes property must return it to the owner or person who had lawful possession of the thing before it was seized if the police officer is satisfied that it is lawful for the person to have possession of the thing. Section 219 relevantly provides:
Disposal of property on application to court
(1) A court may, on application by any person, make an order that property to which this Division applies:
(a) be delivered to the person who appears to be lawfully entitled to the property, or
(b) if that person cannot be ascertained, be dealt with as the court thinks fit.
(2) In determining an application the court may do any one or more of the following things:
. . .
(d) order, if the person who is lawfully entitled to the property cannot be ascertained, that the property be forfeited to the Crown,
(e) make any necessary incidental or ancillary orders.
. . .
(4) If the property is not money or is not fit or suitable for sale, or fails to sell at public auction, it is to be disposed of in accordance with the directions of the Commissioner.
(5) An order under subsection (2) (a) that provides for the extinguishment, whether in whole or in part, of any interest in property operates to extinguish the interest according to its tenor.


20Section 144 of the Evidence Act relevantly provides:
Matters of common knowledge
(1) Proof is not required about knowledge that is not reasonably open to question and is:
(a) common knowledge in the locality in which the proceeding is being held or generally, or
(b) capable of verification by reference to a document the authority of which cannot reasonably be questioned.
(2) The judge may acquire knowledge of that kind in any way the judge thinks fit.
(3) The court (including, if there is a jury, the jury) is to take knowledge of that kind into account.
(4) The judge is to give a party such opportunity to make submissions, and to refer to relevant information, relating to the acquiring or taking into account of knowledge of that kind as is necessary to ensure that the party is not unfairly prejudiced.


21Section 177 of the Evidence Act relevantly provides that evidence of a person's opinion may be adduced by tendering a certificate signed by the person that states the person's expertise and sets out an opinion that the person holds and that is expressed to be wholly or substantially based on that knowledge. There are requirements of notice and service on the other party, who may, with notice, require the person to be called.

Ground (a): alleged denial of procedural fairness by improperly rejecting Senior Sergeant McCulloch's evidence

22The Commissioner contended that, in circumstances where no objection was taken to Senior Sergeant McCulloch's expert certificate and he was not cross-examined, it was a denial of procedural fairness not to accept his evidence and to make an order that was implicitly (in light of the failure to give reasons) founded on a rejection of his evidence.

23As a matter of general principle, a tribunal of fact is entitled to accept or reject evidence, in whole or in part, whether it has been challenged or not. The assessment of evidence is pre-eminently a matter for the tribunal of fact and such assessment does not, without more, give rise to a question of law: Azzopardi v Tasmanian UEB Industries Limited (1985) 4 NSWLR 139. The principles of procedural fairness do, however, apply to such assessment and may, in certain circumstances, give rise to a legitimate expectation that a party will be put on notice if evidence which is not challenged is not to be accepted. Whether there has been a denial of procedural fairness is a matter of ""practical injustice"": Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6; 214 CLR 1 at [34] and [38] per Gleeson CJ.

24Practical injustice has been found as a result of a denial of procedural fairness in circumstances where, for example, a judge stops a party from developing a submission as to why an expert's opinion ought not be accepted and then makes findings in accordance with the expert's opinion: Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54; 161 CLR 141; or when a judge fails to indicate that a custodial sentence is being contemplated on an appeal by the accused from a non-custodial sentence: Parker v DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 282 (Parker). The sphinx-like judge, once venerated as an ideal, is no longer viewed favourably because of the practical injustice that can result when a party is not put on notice of what is to come: Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44; 167 CLR 568 at 571 per Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ.

25Where a conclusion is not obviously open, or might not have reasonably been anticipated, procedural fairness may require an opportunity to be given to make further submissions. As Kirby P said in Parker at 296:
Fair procedure requires, at least for important decisions and those critical to the determination of a case, that considerations of importance to the judicial officer's conclusions should be drawn to
the notice of the parties affected or their representatives so that a fair opportunity is presented for contrary argument to persuade the judicial decision-maker to a different view. 

In the present case, the Magistrate made it clear in the exchanges that he did not think much of Senior Sergeant McCulloch's certificate and that he did not consider it to provide a sufficient reason for the computer drives not to be returned to Dr Pecover. To that extent the police prosecutor was put on notice that she could not assume that his Honour would accept the opinion notwithstanding that it was not the subject of challenge by objection or cross-examination. Indeed the exchanges indicated that his Honour did not fully appreciate the gravamen of Senior Sergeant McCulloch's evidence. Nonetheless, these exchanges occurred before the orders were made and, indeed, from the time the certificate was tendered. It was open to the police prosecutor to seek to persuade the Magistrate of the force and effect of the evidence or to apply to have Senior Sergeant McCulloch attend to explain his evidence further. Although it might have been perverse or irrational (in the Azzopardi sense) for the Magistrate not to accept the expert evidence, I do not consider that it can fairly be said that his Honour did not put the police prosecutor on notice of the view he had formed that it was of limited utility during the course of the hearing before orders were made. 

26I am not satisfied that (a) has been made out.

Ground (c): denial of procedural fairness by not acceding to the prosecutor's application to call further evidence

27As referred to above, the police prosecutor sought to recall Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner when it became apparent that the Magistrate had reservations (the basis of which was not articulated) about the expert certificate of Senior Sergeant McCulloch. The police prosecutor may have considered that Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner, as the police officer in charge of the matter, could explain to the Magistrate, perhaps better than she herself was able to, the reason she was seeking the forfeiture order by reference to Senior Sergeant McCulloch's evidence. Although the Magistrate did not raise his concerns about Senior Sergeant McCulloch's certificate with Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner, I do not consider that his Honour was obliged to, since the matters in the certificate constituted expert evidence and there was no suggestion that Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner had the relevant expertise.

28The Commissioner submitted that there was a denial of natural justice in Brown LCM refusing leave to recall the officer-in-charge and said that the material in the police brief could have been tendered had she been recalled. The material in the police brief was germane to the reason why the relevant police officer (Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner) was not satisfied that it was lawful for Dr Pecover to have possession of items 4 and 5 and, accordingly, why there was no obligation under s 218 of LEPRA for Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner to return the items to him.

29However, as the summary of the proceedings in the Local Court set out above indicates, the Magistrate accepted, because it was undisputed, that child abuse material had been found on items 4 and 5 and, accordingly, did not consider that any further evidence as to that matter ought be permitted to be adduced. 

30The Commissioner has not identified any material in the police brief that would have been germane to the decision that the Magistrate had to make. The question for the Magistrate was whether an order ought be made under s 219, not whether the police officer was obliged to return the items under s 218. Although the Magistrate may have misapprehended the law (as to which see further below), I do not consider that the Magistrate's refusal to allow Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner to be recalled amounted to a denial of procedural fairness in these circumstances. 

Ground (d): judicial notice of storage of data on computer systems

31The exchanges recorded in the transcript show that the Magistrate appeared to have more than a passing knowledge of computer systems and the storage of data. His Honour engaged Dr Pecover in a technical discussion, for which there was no foundation in the evidence. Facts in issue must be proved in court in accordance with the ordinary rules of evidence, which include s 144 of the Evidence Act. Proof is not required about knowledge that is both ""not reasonably open to question"" and is ""common knowledge"", subject to the requirements of s 144. Whether the Magistrate's statements about the workings of computers were reasonably open to question does not emerge. However, I do not consider that they could be regarded as amounting to ""common knowledge"". Furthermore, even if the information about computers was capable of fulfilling both of these requirements, the Magistrate failed to give the police prosecutor any opportunity of dealing with that information. It was simply sprung on the parties from the Bench without notice. There was a failure to comply with s 144(4). This in itself amounted to a denial of procedural fairness: Farkas v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 141 at [16] per Basten JA, RA Hulme J agreeing.

32The Magistrate must be taken to have had regard to the workings of computers which were the subject of discussion with Dr Pecover in the course of the hearing. He was in error in so doing for the reasons set out above. The plaintiff has established an error of law. This ground has been made out.

Grounds (e) and (f): the construction of s 219 of LEPRA and the onus of proof

33The effect of s 218 is that the obligation of a police officer to return property that has been seized arises only if the police officer is satisfied that it is lawful for the person from whom it was seized to have possession of it. If the police officer is not so satisfied, then there is no obligation to return it unless an order for its return is made under s 219. An application under s 219 can be made by ""any person"". It follows that either the putative owner or the relevant police officer can apply for orders in relation to the property. Where there is no application by the putative owner, the police officer may apply for an order under s 219 so that the status of the property can be determined and either it can be returned, or forfeited to the Crown and thereafter destroyed or sold.

34Section 219 must be construed by reference to its purpose. As Johnson J said in Carolan v State of New South Wales [2013] NSWSC 1593 at [6]:
It has been said that an application under s 219 LEPRA does not involve ordinary litigation, but has, as one of its objects, the protection of police who have in their possession property, with the provision designed to resolve a situation where the police entertain a doubt as to whether the person applying for the delivery of the property does in fact have lawful title to the property: Commissioner of Police v Bennett (McInerney J, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 17 October (1991) 9 Petty Sessions Review 4311 at 4314; Fantakis v Commissioner of Police [2013] NSWSC 685 at [44].

35An order may be made to deliver the property to a person who appears to be lawfully entitled to it. If such a person is not ascertained then the Court determines what happens to the property. If there is someone who claims to be lawfully entitled to it, that person (or someone claiming through that person) has the onus of establishing lawful entitlement: Carolan at [7]. To determine who bears the onus by reference to the identity of who happens to be the applicant (the plaintiff in the Local Court), whether a police officer or the person claiming to be entitled to possession, would be irrational. Legislation ought be construed rationally and in accordance with its purpose. 

36The approach taken by the Magistrate was revealed by the exchanges in the course of the hearing, including most obviously: ""It's his property and they've got to give it back to him."" The Magistrate asked why the police ought to be entitled to retain items 4 and 5 when the correct question was whether Dr Pecover had established to the civil standard that he was lawfully entitled to possession of these items. The Magistrate failed to apply s 219 and failed to address the correct question. The Magistrate has misdirected himself by defining the question of fact other than by reference to the correct law: Azzopardi, at 156 per Glass JA. 

37The circumstance that the Magistrate applied the incorrect test might explain why the uncontroverted evidence of Senior Sergeant McCulloch that it was impossible to ensure that no illegal material was on the discs or to remove all illegal material did not lead to forfeiture orders being made in respect of items 4 and 5. However, it is not necessary to speculate about this matter since it is, for present purposes, sufficient to say that grounds (e) and (f) have been made out.

Ground (g): failure to give reasons 

38The Magistrate, when determining Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner's application under s 219 of LEPRA, was exercising a judicial function. Accordingly his Honour was obliged to give reasons for his orders: Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 278-281. More detailed reasons are required when there is a statutory right of appeal: Soulemezis at 280.

39Ground (g) has been made out. In the present case, his Honour did not give any reasons for the orders that he made. Although the exchanges between Bar and Bench can reasonably be expected to shed some light on his Honour's thinking, such exchanges are no substitute for reasons and may simply be regarded as a means of testing propositions, rather than amounting to reasons for a considered view arrived at on the basis of evidence and submissions. As Johnson J said in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited [2006] NSWSC 343; 67 NSWLR 402 at [19]:
It is not satisfactory that an appeal court is left to undertake an analysis of exchanges between the bench and counsel during submissions in an attempt to ascertain a magistrate's reasons for determination: R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 at para 11; R v Thompson (2005) 156 A Crim R 467 at 474-5 (para 32). 

The defendant's submissions

40To the extent to which Dr Pecover's submissions concern questions of law raised in the appeal, they have been dealt with above. In Dr Pecover's submissions in the proceedings before me, he has addressed various factual matters concerning the merits of the application in the Court below. It is not appropriate that I address these submissions since it is not for this Court to determine the merits of the application, which is to be remitted for hearing before the Local Court.

Relief

41The plaintiff has made out grounds (d), (e), (f) and (g). Detective Senior Sergeant Lindner did not have a hearing of her application under s 219 of LEPRA before the Magistrate in accordance with law. The Magistrate's decision cannot stand. It must be set aside and remitted to the Local Court.

42The Commissioner did not seek costs of the proceedings. Ms Adams SC, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, confirmed that the order sought was that each party pay his own costs of the proceedings.

43The plaintiff sought an order that, if the matter is remitted to the Local Court, it be heard by a magistrate other than Brown LCM. Dr Pecover opposed that order and submitted that Brown LCM ought be given the opportunity to hear the matter again. In all the circumstances, including the grounds of appeal that have been made out, I consider it to be in the interests of justice that the matter be heard by a different magistrate. 

Orders

44I make the following orders:

(1)An order pursuant to s 59(2)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 setting aside the order of the second defendant made on 18 February 2014 ordering the return of specified goods in Police custody to the first defendant within 60 days (the decision);

(2)An order pursuant to s 59(2)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 remitting the decision to a Magistrate other than Magistrate Dr RA Brown to be dealt with according to law.

(3)Order each party to pay his own costs.

		28 October 2014",2014-10-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765068,R v Rice & ors (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1447,"Judgment (EX TEMPORE - revised) 1This trial commenced before me on 20 October 2014.  After the jury were allowed to leave that afternoon I was provided with two separate notes from the jury, which are now MFI 3 and 4.  For reasons to which I will come it is now apparent that although there are two separate notes, they were in fact written by the one member of the jury.  That would explain, at least in part, why the terms of the notes are almost identical.
2MFI 3 is in the following terms: 
""I saw one of the accused names this morning and Googled it.  Nothing came up in the results.  Would that be a problem?  (It was before I was selected as a jury [sic]).""
3I infer that the bracketed part of the note is a reference to the extensive directions that I gave the jury immediately following empanelment, included in which was a prohibition placed upon conducting any type of inquiry outside the courtroom.  It is apparent from the note that the member of the jury concerned was at pains to emphasise that her inquiry had been conducted prior to those directions being given.
4The names of the accused Koloamatangi and Popovic are anonymised on the court list.  The names of the accused Rice and Vukovic appear in full.  It follows that it is one of the latter two accused whose name was the subject of the search.
5The notes were drawn to the attention of counsel for each of the accused.  The matter was left at that point so that counsel could have the opportunity of reflecting on the matter overnight and obtaining instructions.
6Upon the commencement of proceedings on 21 October Mr Pickin of counsel, who appears for the accused Vukovic, drew my attention to two articles which appeared in the Illawarra Mercury Newspaper on 15 December 2012 and 21 March 2013, respectively and which are now MFI 5.  In the absence of knowing which of the two accused was the subject of the search, Mr Pickin made an application that the jury be discharged.  He submitted that there was a ""perceptible risk"" that as a consequence of the search the member of the jury may have become aware of the extraneous and prejudicial material contained in MFI 5.  Mr Pickin's submissions were largely predicated on the assumption that the name searched by the member of the jury was that of the accused Vukovic.  His submissions also tended to ignore the fact that MFI 3 expressly stated that no results were obtained from the search which had been conducted.   
7When the matter first arose on 20 October 2014 Mr Watson of counsel, who appears for the accused Rice, informed me that as far as he was aware there was no material on the Internet relating to his client.  It seems that overnight, Mr Watson's attention was drawn to the existence of such material, although it is not before me in evidence.  Mr Watson did not make a formal application that the jury be discharged but suggested that an inquiry be made of the juror in question to ascertain, amongst other things, the nature and extent of the search.  
8Mr Brasch, who appears for the accused Popovic, made no application, although he did not oppose that made by Mr Pickin. 
9Ms Davenport SC, who appears for the accused Koloamatangi, did not make a specific application.  However, she expressed considerable concern arising from the fact that her client was named in one or other (or perhaps both) of the articles upon which Mr Pickin's application relied.  She supported the submission of Mr Watson that I question the jury member to ascertain what name she searched.
10The Crown Prosecutor opposed the application but endorsed the proposal that I enquire of the jury member about the extent of the search which was undertaken.  The Crown indicated, in response to a question from me, that depending upon the information which was elicited as a consequence of the juror being questioned, his position as to the application may change.
11In those circumstances I considered it appropriate to exercise the power under s55D of the Jury Act and examine the juror in question.  The juror was identified and affirmed.  The questions I asked her elicited the following information:  
(i)the name of the accused who was the subject of the search was the accused Rice, not the accused Vukovic;
(ii)the search conducted was by way of a Google search engine on a mobile phone; 
(iii)in stating in the note (MFI 3) that ""nothing came up in the results"" the juror intended to convey that there were ""no matches"".  
12At that point the juror was asked to retire to the jury room.
13When I asked the officer to identify the author of MFI 4, I was informed that the author was in fact the same juror from whom I had previously taken evidence.  Why two notes were written is not clear but in any event, is immaterial.
14In the light of this evidence, Mr Pickin conceded that his application was of less weight than might otherwise have been the case.  Whilst he did not abandon the application he acknowledged, as I understood it, that there was no evidence which suggested that the juror had searched his client's name on the Internet, or anywhere else.  It would be fair to say, I think, that the force of that position was acknowledged (if not expressly, at least impliedly) by counsel for the remaining accused.  The Crown Prosecutor, on the basis of the information elicited from the juror, opposed the application. 
15In my view, it is not appropriate for the jury to be discharged.  On the evidence before me a search was conducted of one of the accused, namely the accused Rice, which brought no results.  No formal application has been made on behalf of that accused that the jury be discharged.  There is no suggestion that the material in MFI 5 would have become available as the consequence of a search of the name of the accused Rice.  Moreover, there is no reason to reject the evidence of the member of the jury as being, in any way, unreliable or untruthful.  
16In circumstances where the name of the accused Vukovic was not searched (the application to discharge the jury having been made only by him and not by any other accused),  and quite apart from the juror's assurance that there was no match in any event, I am satisfied that there is no risk that the material in MFI 5, which was published in a regional newspaper some time ago, has come to the attention of any member of the jury. 
17Accordingly, the application for a discharge of the jury is refused.

2765071,CS v R [2014] NSWCCA 229,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2R A HULME J:  CS (the applicant) was sentenced in the District Court at Wollongong on 26 February 2013 by his Honour Judge Conlon SC to imprisonment for 10 years 6 months with a non-parole component of 7 years 6 months in respect of five offences of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 16 (s 66C(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) and one offence of aggravated act of indecency with a child under 16 (s 61O(1)).  
3Brief details of each offence and the individual sentences are as follows:

Facts
4The facts of the offences were described in a statement of agreed facts which included that they were ""representative of ongoing conduct between the offender and [the complainant] over the time period"". 
5The complainant was born in June 1987 and was aged between 10 and 14 when the offences occurred.  She and her family moved from Australia to Saudi Arabia in 1994. The applicant and the complainant's mother were working at the same school in Saudi Arabia and he became good friends with the complainant's family. He moved into their compound and continued living there for some time. 
6After separating from her husband in 1997, the complainant's mother moved back to Australia with her children. The applicant followed about six months later and moved into the family's home in Bulli, where he had his own room. 
7Towards the end of 1997 when the complainant was 10 she woke up one night and, after failing to get back to sleep, joined the applicant in his bed. She regularly did this when she had trouble falling to sleep in Saudi Arabia.  She went back to sleep but at some stage awoke to find the applicant removing her clothes. This had not happened before; she did not understand what was going on and did not say anything. The applicant got under the sheets and performed cunnilingus (count 1). The complainant said she just lay on the bed wondering what was happening.
8One day in the winter of 2000 when the complainant was 12 she was getting ready for school but the applicant told her to hide and wait.  Her siblings walked to school and he drove her mother to her workplace.  When he returned home, he and the complainant went to a bedroom where he told her to undress.   He also undressed and proceeded to perform cunnilingus as she lay on the bed (count 2).  After doing this for some time he moved up and had penile/vaginal intercourse ""until he finished"" (count 3).
9On a Saturday afternoon in March - May 2001 when the complainant was 14, her mother was napping and her siblings were out. The applicant entered the kitchen where the complainant was sitting and her out to the lounge room.  He lay down with the complainant sitting in front of him. He then indicated that he wanted her to perform oral sex on him. She had not done this before but he had previously explained it to her.  She took his penis in her mouth and he began to sigh and moan (count 4).  She stopped after a short time because she felt humiliated and degraded and left the room. 
10Towards the end of 2001 when the complainant was 14 there was an occasion when she was getting out of the shower and found the applicant in the bathroom with a Polaroid camera. He instructed her to stand in a suggestive pose and took a photograph.  He ""was very excited"" and led her by the hand to his bedroom.  He instructed her to lay on the bed with her legs apart, exposing her vagina, and took a photograph of her in that pose (count 5).  She said that she felt very vulnerable and extremely uncomfortable. 
11The final incident occurred on 1 May 2002. The complainant, still aged 14, returned home from school one day to find the applicant alone in the house. They went into his bedroom where he instructed her to take off her underwear. The applicant undressed and then lay on his back on the bed.  She climbed on top of him and inserted his penis in her vagina (count 6). They had sexual intercourse for a short period until the noise of the garage alerted them to the fact that her mother and siblings had arrived home.  She quickly left the room and went and had a shower.
12The applicant did not use a condom on any occasion.  He had counselled her about having unprotected sex with boys, saying that they would not be so careful to avoid ejaculating inside her.  
13Shortly after the last incident of sexual intercourse the complainant's mother found the photographs referred to in count 5 and confronted the applicant.  He moved out of the home but remained in regular contact with the family. 
14The complainant approached the police for the first time in 2010.  The applicant was arrested on 15 September 2011 after having made admissions in a covertly recorded telephone conversation with her. 
Personal circumstances of the applicant
15The applicant was one of two children. He was raised by his mother after his parents separated when he was six. He did not have much contact with his father when he was young. He left school after Year 11 and worked with his father in a scientific laboratory. He trained as a forensic toxicologist and subsequently found employment in that field. His father took a position as a biochemist in Saudi Arabia in about 1994-5 and after visiting, the applicant found work in an international school, where he met the complainant's mother. 
16A report of a forensic psychologist was before the sentencing judge. The applicant informed the psychologist that he was not in a de-facto relationship with the complainant's mother. The psychologist also indicated that the applicant reported that the age of the complainant was immaterial to his attraction to her, rather being an extension of his positive emotional relationship with her (a claim the sentencing judge described as alarming). Notwithstanding this the applicant expressed considerable remorse in respect of the offences. The sentencing judge accepted that he was genuinely remorseful. 
17The applicant had been treated for depression for many years. His sister passed away in 2012 after a long battle with alcohol. The applicant was her sole carer for the last few years of her life and had a very close relationship with her profoundly deaf son. 
18There was no history of similar offending; indeed, no criminal history at all. The psychologist indicated that it was difficult to label the applicant with a psycho-sexual disorder and that ""there are no other symptoms of such a diagnosis"".  He noted his history of problems with alcohol and depression and concluded that attention to psycho-sexual matters alone ""would not solve his problems"".   He said ""he would benefit from attention for a wide range of issues"".
19Considering all the material, and particularly the fact that the applicant had not since re-offended, the sentencing judge found good prospects of rehabilitation.  
Ground 1 - The judge erred in failing to take into account a relevant period of pre-sentence custody
20The applicant was arrested in Victoria on 15 September 2011.  He was extradited to New South Wales and released on bail on 17 September 2011.  The earliest of the sentences was ordered to commence on the date of sentencing, 26 February 2013.  It appears to have been by oversight that the sentence was not ordered to commence 3 days earlier.
21A judge is required by s 47(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) to take into account ""any time for which the applicant has been held in custody in relation to the offence"".  A failure to do so constitutes legal error but does not render the sentence ""contrary to law"".  The error is amenable to correction on appeal, not by way of re-opening the sentencing proceedings pursuant to s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act:  Achurch v The Queen [2014] HCA 10; 306 ALR 566.  The Crown conceded that this ground should be upheld.  The concession was appropriate, notwithstanding that the practical effect upon the overall sentence is quite minimal.
Ground 2 - The judge erred in imposing an overall sentence with an effective non-parole period that fails to reflect the finding of special circumstances
22Section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires that the balance of the term of a sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more.  The sentencing judge found that there were special circumstances:
""At forty-nine years of age this will be the first time the offender serves a custodial sentence. Partial accumulation will also be required.  The combination of these factors is sufficient reason for me to make a finding of special circumstances and to vary the statutory ratio.""
23Where sentences are accumulated it is conventional sentencing practice to adjust the non-parole period of the final sentence so as to ensure, where appropriate, that the usual proportions contemplated by s 44(2) are maintained in the overall sentence:  Hejazi v R [2009] NSWCCA 282; 217 A Crim R 151 at [35]-[36] (Howie J).  
24From time to time this Court is faced with arguments about whether a finding of special circumstances has been reflected in the overall result of accumulated sentences.  Sometimes it is found that through inadvertence or miscalculation it has not and the Court will be inclined to intervene.  But on other occasions it is found that the overall result is precisely what the judge intended and no intervention is warranted.  See, for example, Fina'i v R [2006] NSWCCA 134 at [31]-[40]; Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [33]-[37]; and BT v R [2012] NSWCCA 276 at [27]-[33].  In CM v R [2013] NSWCCA 341, with the concurrence of Ward JA and Harrison J, I said:
""[40] Where there is no adjustment of the 3:1 ratio of non-parole period to parole period reflected in the overall term, it may either reflect what the sentencing judge specifically intended, or it may be the result of inadvertence or miscalculation. A recent example of the former may be found in Houri v R [2013] NSWCCA 279; see also Phipps v R [2008] NSWCCA 178; and Stoeski [[2008] NSWCCA 230]. Examples of both varieties of the latter can be found in the cases collected by McClellan CJ at CL in Fina'i v R [2006] NSWCCA 134 at [31]-[40]. Appeals asserting such error are not uncommon, and as Howie AJ remarked in Maglis v R [2010] NSWCCA 247 at [24], their success will often 'depend upon what can be gleaned of the Judge's intention from the sentencing remarks'.""
25The applicant submitted that the intended departure from the ""statutory proportion"" was given effect in the individual sentences but not in respect of the overall sentence.  There was nothing to be achieved by departing from the statutory proportion in relation to the sentences for counts 2, 3 and 4 because the balance of terms of those sentences were almost completely subsumed by the non-parole period of the sentence for count 6.  
26It was also submitted that there was no point in the judge finding that there were special circumstances beyond just the partial accumulation of sentences if it were not to be reflected in the overall sentence.  Accordingly, by inference, the judge must have intended a greater degree of departure from the statutory proportion in the overall term than was in fact achieved.  
27Reference was made to SS v R; JC v R [2009] NSWCCA 114 which was said to involve ""essentially indistinguishable circumstances from those in the present application"".  Individual sentences were imposed which comprised non-parole periods that were 66.67 per cent of the head sentence but after partial accumulation of sentences the overall sentence comprised a non-parole component that was 71.43 per cent of the total term.  In the present case, the non-parole periods for counts 2, 3, and 4 are 66.67, 60, 66.67 per cent respectively of their head sentences but in the overall sentence the non-parole component is 71.43 per cent of the total term.
28Submissions were also directed to further reasons why a finding of special circumstances was warranted in this case (delay and the applicant's history of depression).  But there was such a finding; the ground is concerned with whether there was error in failing to reflect it in the overall sentence.
29The Crown submitted that where the ratio between non-parole and parole periods is challenged, the principal focus of enquiry should be whether the non-parole period imposed is the minimum period that the applicant must spend in custody having regard to all the elements of punishment, the objective seriousness of the offence and the applicant's subjective circumstances. The third basis of the finding of special circumstances, partial accumulation, supports the conclusion that his Honour found special circumstances in order to preserve the statutory ratio in relation to the overall sentence, rather than to extend the period on parole to a period longer than three years. In oral submissions, the Crown submitted that a supervision period of three years was adequate to address the mental health issues faced by the applicant. 
Consideration
30The ratios for the individual counts were altered and the total non-parole period comprised 71.43 per cent of the total term. Although the alteration of the ratios for the individual counts was greater, in my view it is likely that the sentencing judge altered the ratios of the individual sentences for practical reasons; that is to impose sentences with non-parole periods in round figures.  For example, the 3 year sentence for count two would have involved a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months if the statutory proportion was maintained but his Honour set the non-parole period at 2 years.  The same reasoning may be inferred in relation to the sentences for counts 3 (a non-parole period of 3 years instead of one of 3 years 9 months) and 4 (a non-parole period of 2 years instead of one of 2 years 3 months. 
31The real focus should be upon the non-parole period of the final sentence (count 6) and upon the non-parole component of the total term.  The non-parole period for count 6 is 50 per cent of that sentence.  The non-parole component of the total term is 71.43 per cent.  In relation to the latter, there is an allowance for a 3 year period for supervision under parole.  No further period of supervision would be available, even if the parole period was longer: cl 218 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2014 (NSW).
32I am satisfied that the judge was conscious of the effect of the partial accumulation of sentences upon the proportion of the total term represented by the non-parole component.  The primary need for finding special circumstances was the accumulation.  He made a substantial adjustment of the non-parole period for the final sentence (count 6) in order to achieve an intended overall result.   
33The additional feature cited by his Honour (""at forty-nine years of age this will be the first time the offender serves a custodial sentence"") was really of little weight, and on its own would be a rather dubious basis for finding special circumstances at all:  see, for example, Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [36] (McClellan CJ at CL).  It did have an impact in the overall result but it was appropriately modest, resulting in a reduction of the total non-parole component from the usual 75 per cent with the practical effect being a reduction of 4.5 months.
34The fact that after announcing the individual sentences the judge announced the total term and the overall non-parole component further confirms that he had fashioned the sentences so as to achieve a result he intended.
35Finally, I do not (with respect) accept the submission that SS v R; JC v R involved ""essentially indistinguishable circumstances from those in the present application"".  In that case it was concluded that the judge had overlooked the impact that the accumulation of sentences would have upon the finding of special circumstances and there were more cogent reasons for the finding than in the present case.  SS was aged 15 at the time of the offences, 17 at the time of sentencing and he was said to have made good progress towards rehabilitation whilst in custody.   Even then, the non-parole component of the total term was only reduced by this Court by a further period of 4 months.
36I would not uphold this ground.
Ground 3 - The sentences imposed on counts 3 and 6 are unreasonable or plainly unjust Ground 4 - The overall term and effective non-parole period are unreasonable or plainly unjust
37It is convenient to deal with these two grounds together.
38The sentences imposed varied from 2 years (count 1), 3 years (counts 2 and 4) to 5 years (count 3) and 6 years (count 6). The applicant submitted that although the differing acts - cunnilingus for counts 1 and 2, fellatio for count 4 and penile-vaginal intercourse for counts 3 and 6 - may have warranted some variation in the sentences, the severity of the sentences for counts 3 and 6 was not justified. There is no hierarchy regarding forms of sexual intercourse and the seriousness of a particular offence depends on all the circumstances: the submissions cited Ibbs v R [1987] HCA 46; 163 CLR 447 at 452; R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172; 187 A Crim R 152 at [26]; R v Hibberd [2009] NSWCCA 20; 194 A Crim R 1 at [20]. 
39Furthermore, there is no apparent rationale for the one year increase between count 3 and count 6. If anything, a lesser sentence was warranted for count 6 given the brevity of the conduct and that the complainant was older.  Generally, the younger the child the more serious was the offence: the submissions cited R v KNL [2005] NSWCCA 260; 154 A Crim R 268 at [41]-[42]; MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; 164 A Crim R 93 at [22]. 
40It was submitted that before the discount for the guilty plea, the nominal starting point for count 3 was more than half the maximum penalty, while that for count 6 was more than two-thirds the maximum. The offences did not disclose especially serious instances of offending conduct, particularly given the range of offending conduct covered by the offence. 
41The Crown submitted that while it is true that the type of sexual penetration is not determinative of the objective seriousness of an offence, it is not erroneous to regard it as a significant factor. Furthermore, count 6 represented the last of many counts of sexual abuse, with the complainant having been groomed to the point where she was an active and enthusiastic participant.  It was also submitted at the hearing that the 50 per cent non-parole to parole ratio somewhat undermines the significance of the length of the term. 
42In relation to the final ground, the applicant submitted that the total extent of accumulation of the last sentence upon the first sentence, that is 4 years and 6 months, exceeded what was called for in considering the principle of totality. The overall term and non-parole period similarly failed to properly reflect the principle and are unreasonable or plainly unjust. 
43The Crown pointed to various factors that warranted the overall sentence imposed, such as the maximum penalties for the offences; the duration of the offending behaviour and the variety of sexual acts; the fact that the offences were not isolated incidents; and the applicant's position of trust. 
Consideration
44Counts 3 and 6 involved penile-vaginal intercourse. The other s 66C(2) counts involved cunnilingus and fellatio. Fullerton J summarised how courts deal with ""hierarchies"" of sexual offences in R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172; 187 A Crim R 152 at [26]: "" ... While there is no hierarchy of sexual acts that constitute sexual intercourse for the purposes of the criminal law, it is generally accepted that some forms of sexual activity may be regarded as more serious than others (see Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447). This is of course necessarily modified by the context in which the offence occurred, and other circumstances of the particular offending to which Simpson J referred in AJP [R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575] at [24]-[26]."" 
45It was open to the judge to impose heavier sentences in respect of counts 3 and 6 based upon the nature of the intercourse they involved. There were a variety of other factors that bore upon the assessment of the sentences as well.  The incident with which count 3 was concerned involved two offences; the cunnilingus (count 2) and the penile-vaginal intercourse (count 3) but the sentences for these offences were ordered to be served concurrently.  That incident occurred when the complainant was aged 12 and in the context of ongoing sexual activity for over 2 years.  The incident with which count 6 was concerned was the final act after over 4 years of ongoing sexual activity with the sentencing judge remarking that ""he had so groomed this child that by the time she was about fourteen, having become so conditioned to his predatory conduct, she began to 'consent' to it"". 
46The sentencing judge referred to the complainant's victim impact statement which was tendered without objection and was read.  After making some observations about its contents he said they ""simply serve to highlight the most serious nature of the offending conduct"". 
47The objective gravity of these offences was at a high level.  The sentencing judge was right to take into account the ""gross breach of ... trust"" and that the applicant had ""substantially exploited the youth of the complainant"".  He was also correct in rejecting any suggestion that the offending was ""opportunistic"".  Indeed, at the hearing of the application, counsel for the applicant (with his customary responsibility and candour) accepted that his client had acted when opportunity arose, knowing that the complainant had become habituated to his conduct. 
48I accept that the sentences for counts 3 and 6 and the overall term were heavy but I am not persuaded that they were unreasonably so.  I would not uphold these grounds.
Orders
49I propose the following orders:
1 Leave to appeal against sentence granted
2 Appeal allowed in part.
3 Quash the dates of commencement of each sentence and specify new commencement dates as follows:
Court 5  -  23 February 2013
Count 1  -  23 February 2014
Counts 2 and 3  -  23 February 2015
Count 4  -  23 February 2017
Count 6  -  23 August 2017
4 The applicant will become eligible to be released on parole when the last non-parole period expires on 22 August 2020.
50 GARLING J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.

2765073,R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 9) [2014] NSWSC 1460,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

Application for a âno caseâ (ref T2599)


	
	Following the completion of the Crown case the accused, Michael Issakidis, made a no case submission in respect of the two counts on the indictment that concern him, namely Counts 1 and 6. He was joined in that application in respect of those counts by the other accused Anthony Dickson. For the reasons I will shortly explain, Mr Dickson's application was completely dependent on the success or failure of MrÂ Issakidisâ application.
	
	
	On 21 August 2014 both accused were arraigned before a jury panel. The indictment contained six counts. As I have stated, only Counts 1 and 6 concerned Mr Issakidis. Count 1 charges each accused with an offence contrary to sÂ 135.4(5) of the schedule to the Criminal Code Act (Cth) (the Code), namely that:
	


âBetween about 15 November 2005 and 2 December 2011 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere [each accused] did conspire with [the other] to dishonestly cause a loss, or to dishonestly cause a risk of loss to a third person, namely the Commonwealth, knowing or believing there was a substantial risk of the loss occurring.â


	
	Count 6 on the indictment charges each of Mr Dickson and Mr Issakidis with a conspiracy under sÂ 11.5(1) of the Code to commit an offence under sÂ 400.3(1), namely that:
	


âBetween about 15 November 2005 and 25 June 2012 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere [each accused] did conspire with [the other] to deal with property of a value of $1 million or more believing it to be the proceeds of crimeâ.


	
	Counts 2 to 5 on the indictment charge only Mr Dickson. They are alternative counts to Count 1.
	
	
	From the outset it can be seen that both Counts 1 and 6 allege what has been described in this case as a âclosed conspiracyâ, that is, a conspiracy between two and only two persons, namely both accused. Partly for that reason and partly because at this point there does not appear to be any material distinction in the evidence against both accused pointing to the existence of an agreement, it has been accepted that if the no case submission on Count 1 is upheld in respect of Mr Issakidis, then it would follow that Mr Dickson should also be acquitted on that count (see sÂ 135.4(11) and Darby v R [1982] HCA 32; 148 CLR 668). In effect, Mr Dickson cannot be found guilty of conspiring with himself.
	
	
	Further, from the outset the Crown has accepted that the âpredicate crimeâ for Count 6 is Count 1, that is, the âproceeds of crimeâ that were said to have been laundered by Count 6 is the proceeds of a crime constituted by Count 1. This has the consequence that an acquittal on Count 1 for any accused must lead to an acquittal on CountÂ 6. Hence in this case Mr Issakidis' submissions were exclusively directed to whether he has a case to answer on Count 1. If it is held that he does not, then an acquittal for him on Count 6 and for Mr Dickson on Counts 1 and 6 ordinarily follows.
	


Approach


	
	In Doney v Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 at 214 to 215 the High Court stated:
	


âIt follows that, if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.â


	
	It was accepted by the Crown that its case on Count 1 concerning MrÂ Issakidis is a circumstantial one. In that respect senior counsel for Mr Issakidis, Mr Byrne QC, referred the Court to the following passage from the judgment of King CJ in Case Stated by DPP (No 2 of 1993) (1993) 70 A Crim R 323 at 327:
	


âI would re-state the principles, in summary form, as follows. If there is direct evidence which is capable of proving the charge, there is a case to answer no matter how weak or tenuous the judge might consider such evidence to be. If the case depends upon circumstantial evidence, and that evidence, if accepted, is capable of producing in a reasonable mind a conclusion of guilt beyond reasonable doubt and this is capable of causing a reasonable mind to exclude any competing hypotheses as unreasonable, there is a case to answer. There is no case to answer only if the evidence is not capable in law of supporting a conviction. In a circumstantial case that implies that even if all the evidence for the prosecution was accepted and all inferences most favourable to the prosecution which are reasonably open were drawn, a reasonable mind could not reach a conclusion of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, or to put it another way, could not exclude all hypotheses consistent with innocence, as not reasonably open on the evidence.â (emphasis added)


	
	However the Crown referred to a number of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal of this State which arguably articulate a different approach in respect of applications for a directed verdict in circumstantial cases, including R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39, and R v PL [2012] NSWCCA 31 (âPLâ). In particular in PL at [32] Bathurst CJ, Simpson and Adamson JJ stated:
	


âIt is also clear from the authorities that the sufficiency of evidence to warrant a conviction is to be resolved without regard to evidence which favours the accused as, for example, by qualifying, contradicting or explaining the evidence in support of a conviction [citation omitted]. Further, in a case such as the present which depends in the main on circumstantial evidence, a judge cannot direct a verdict of acquittal if there is evidence in support of the Crown case on which the accused could be convicted even though a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence can be formulated â¦â (emphasis added)


	
	In deciding this matter I am bound to follow this approach.
	
	
	There is a further aspect of this application. From the outset Mr Byrne QC has also submitted that none of the acts and utterances of MrÂ Dickson that expressly or implicitly implicate his client in the alleged conspiracy charged by Count 1 were admissible to that effect because there is not reasonable evidence of his client's involvement independent of those acts and utterances (see Ahern v R [1988] HCA 39; 165 CLR 87 at 93) (âAhernâ).
	
	
	In this State it has been held that that issue is addressed in the same manner as a no case submission, although there is a discretion reposed in the trial judge to exclude the use of evidence in that manner if it will âoperate unfairlyâ against an accused (see R v Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 at 466A) (âMastersâ). No question of the potential exercise of any such discretion has yet arisen.
	
	
	Two matters follow at this point. First, in considering whether there is a case for Mr Issakidis to answer on the conspiracy charged by Count 1, regard cannot be had to the acts and statements of Mr Dickson which expressly or implicitly assert Mr Issakidis' involvement in the alleged conspiracy or some aspect thereof. Thus, the question as to whether he has a case to answer merges into the same question as to whether the test in Ahern is satisfied (see R v Chai (1992) 27 NSWLR 153 at 187G).
	
	
	Second, if I am satisfied that there is a case to answer then the Ahern test will also be satisfied. In that event, the acts and utterances of MrÂ Dickson which expressly or implicitly assert the involvement of MrÂ Issakidis in the alleged conspiracy or some aspect thereof will be able to be used as evidence of Mr Issakidis' involvement, subject to the exercise of any discretion to prevent that occurring (Masters at 466A).
	


The Scope of Count 1


	
	Some weeks prior to the close of the Crown case the Court provided the parties with a note setting out a draft of directions for the jury in relation to the elements of each count (the âproposed directionsâ) and the rationale for those directions (MFI 35). Subject to one matter, the parties proceeded on the basis that the proposed direction correctly identified the elements of the offences charged by Counts 1 and 6 as they apply to this case.
	
	
	In respect of Count 1 the proposed direction relevantly stated:
	


â2.Â Â Â The offence on Count 1 of the indictment has been committed by the accused [ â¦ ] if and only if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that between 15 November 2005 and 2Â December 2011:

2.1Â Â Â He meant to enter into an agreement with [the other accused] to:

Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â cause Neumedix Health Australasia Pty Limited (âNeumedixâ), to lodge income tax returns claiming depreciation expenses based on the alleged cost of the purported acquisition of intellectual property by Neumedix where no such cost or obligation had been incurred by Neumedix; and

Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â thereby induce the Commissioner of Taxation to accept that Neumedix sustained substantial tax losses;

2.2Â Â Â That

Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â intentionally causing Neumedix to lodge income tax returns claiming depreciation expenses based on the alleged cost of the purported acquisition of intellectual property by Neumedix when no such cost or obligation to pay had been incurred by Neumedix and believing that to be so; and

Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â doing so to induce the Commissioner of Taxation to accept that Neumedix sustained substantial tax losses;

was conduct that was:

Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people; AND

Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â known by the accused [ â¦ ] to be dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people;

2.3Â Â Â That each of Mr Dickson and Mr Issakidis intended to dishonestly cause a loss or a risk of loss to the Commonwealth pursuant to their agreement;

2.4Â Â Â That [the accused] knew or believed that the loss would occur or that there was a substantial risk of the loss occurring; and

2.5Â Â Â That either Mr Dickson or Mr Issakidis committed an act pursuant to their agreement.â


	
	It was common ground that the phrase âto payâ should be inserted after the word âobligationâ in [2.1(a)] of the proposed direction.
	
	
	Further, as between the Crown and Mr Dickson there is a dispute as to whether the phrase âtruly or genuinelyâ should be inserted between âhadâ and âbeenâ in [2.1(a)] of the proposed direction and its equivalents so as to reflect the Crown's allegation that any such obligation that might be recorded in any document was in fact a sham. It is not necessary to resolve that debate for the purposes of this application. The issue of substance raised by this application is whether MrÂ Issakidis has a case to answer in respect of so much of the Crown case that asserts that he entered into and maintained an agreement with MrÂ Dickson of the kind referred to in [2.1] of the proposed direction on either formulation.
	
	
	It is important to appreciate the nature of the agreement alleged by the Crown. It is an agreement specifically directed toward the provision of tax returns by NeuMedix that falsely claimed depreciation costs concerning the acquisition of various items of intellectual property. It is not sufficient, for example, for the Crown to prove that Mr Issakidis was, say, simply reckless as to that consequence, that is that he agreed to various matters with Mr Dickson but was only reckless as to whether a false return would be lodged. Instead the Crown will ultimately have to prove that Mr Issakidis agreed to that outcome. Equally, provided that the Crown can prove that he agreed to the achievement of that outcome, then it will not matter if the precise amount of depreciation claimed or the entities that are said to have sold the intellectual property to NeuMedix was not known to him.
	


The Nature of the Crown Case


	
	I outlined the general scope of the Crown case in R v Dickson, R v Issakidis (No 1) [2014] NSWSC 1068 at [7] to [8]. I will not repeat that description but further details based on the evidence tendered in the Crown case need to be noted.
	
	
	The tax returns initially lodged by NeuMedix for each of the financial years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 were tendered in the Crown case. Each of those returns discloses the receipt by NeuMedix of very large amounts of assessable income based upon its subscription for all of the units in the unit trusts that were part of the structured finance deals that NeuMedix undertook with the ANZ Bank and its clients. Each of those tax returns also claimed even larger amounts of deductions for depreciation expenses which, if allowed, meant that no tax was payable by NeuMedix.
	
	
	The evidence was to the effect that Mr Dickson prepared the tax returns for the financial years 2007, 2008 and 2009 and that the 2010 return was prepared by a firm of accountants, Walsh & Walsh, and then lodged on Mr Dickson's instructions.
	
	
	The evidence also suggests that depreciation expenses in the tax returns were based upon the amortisation of the alleged cost of the acquisition of three items of intellectual property, namely patents and associated intellectual property which were identified as âGenvaxâ, âCGSâ and âColoGeneâ. The evidence reveals that, after the Australian Tax Office (the âATOâ) commenced reviewing and possibly auditing NeuMedixâs tax returns, material was provided to the ATO which is capable of suggesting that depreciation expenses claimed in the tax returns were based on the costs it is said that NeuMedix incurred in acquiring those items from the Cayman Islands company, Athena Health Patents Incorporated (âAthenaâ). Unsigned acquisition agreements between NeuMedix and Athena were supplied to the ATO along with valuations of the intellectual property which was said to support the bona fides of the costs of the acquisitions recorded in the unsigned agreement. The valuations were provided under the letterhead of Karkalla International Holdings Limited (âKarkallaâ).
	
	
	The evidence in the Crown case also reveals that a set of amended tax returns for NeuMedix for each of the financial years 2007 to 2010 were later lodged. The Crown's evidence suggests that those returns were prepared by an accountant employed by NeuMedix, Mr Adrian Compton, on the instructions of Mr Dickson. Although the figures in the amended returns in respect of some items of depreciation and the disclosable income arising out of NeuMedixâs participation in the unit trusts to which I have referred varied from the original returns, by and large it appears that the methodology in respect of those two items did not differ materially from that used in preparing the original returns.
	
	
	Mr Dickson's signature is to be found on all of the tax returns except the initial 2009 return which was lodged electronically on his instructions.
	


Evidence relied upon by the Crown


	
	There is no evidence that Mr Issakidis saw any of NeuMedix's tax returns, that he saw any of the unsigned assignment agreements purporting to record an acquisition of intellectual property by NeuMedix from Athena upon which the claims for depreciation expenses were based, or that he ever saw the valuations on the letterhead of Karkalla which were provided to the ATO to support the depreciation claims. Nevertheless the Crown submits that an inference is reasonably open that MrÂ Issakidis agreed with Mr Dickson to effect the lodging of returns claiming false depreciation expenses and that each of them took steps to achieve that aim.
	
	
	The submissions made on behalf of Mr Issakidis by Mr Byrne QC emphasised the absence of any evidence connecting him to the tax returns lodged and referred to other evidence which indicated that matters of finance, structuring and tax were generally left to MrÂ Dickson and not undertaken by Mr Issakidis. So much of those general observations can be accepted although that does not preclude Mr Issakidis being a party to any conspiracy. Of their nature conspiracies can contemplate different roles and responsibilities being assigned to and undertaken by the various co-conspirators.
	
	
	The material relied upon by the Crown as demonstrating at least a prima facie case against Mr Issakidis was set out in its written submissions filed in support of its resistance of Mr Issakidis' application. Although the Crown referred to a wide range of documentary evidence concerning Mr Issakidis, given the nature of the alleged conspiracy I will address the matters that appear to directly concern the ANZ transaction, the acquisition of intellectual property from the inventors, the material provided to Walsh and Walsh and, in particular, the Karkalla assignments.
	
	
	At this point I note that parts of the Crown submissions address MrÂ Issakidis' experience and qualifications. The evidence reveals he is a businessman with substantial experience especially in property development and that he has legal qualifications. The Crown submissions also referred to certain contractual obligations that one of his companies incurred in favour of NeuMedix which appear to have involved a requirement that Mr Issakidis review and advise upon NeuMedix's legal relationships and review and advise upon matters concerning its finance arrangements (Exhibit A p 793).
	
	
	In this area of the law there is no role to play for imputed knowledge. IÂ will treat what is known about Mr Issakidis' expertise and duties as a basis for inferring that, generally, if he was sent material on the relevant topics he read it and was capable of understanding it. Beyond that and, bearing in mind Mr Byrne QC's submissions about what the evidence reveals in fact occurred between Mr Dickson and Mr Issakidis, I will not make inferences concerning what Mr Issakidis must have known or what he must have done beyond what the evidence reveals by what was sent or said to him or sent or said by him.
	


ANZ transaction


	
	The first part of the Crown submissions concerns the evidence of MrÂ Issakidis' involvement in the negotiation, execution and implementation of the structured finance transactions with the ANZ Bank. It is important to note three critical and related features of those transactions.
	
	
	First, pursuant to those transactions NeuMedix was to receive substantial cash distributions.
	
	
	Second, as a consequence of NeuMedix becoming a 100 per cent unit holder of the relevant unit trusts it incurred an obligation to declare an even greater amount of assessable income being the net profit of the relevant trust. In fact, the ratio between the cash received and the income attributed to NeuMedix was 9 to 100.
	
	
	Third, the terms of those transactions were not such that they necessarily required NeuMedix to defraud the Commonwealth to realise any net economic benefit from its participation. Instead whether or not NeuMedix could realise any such net benefit depended upon its ability to generate and claim permissible tax deductions. In the case of NeuMedix it was said that that could be achieved by claiming depreciation expenses arising from the incurring of substantial costs in acquiring patents and associated intellectual property.
	
	
	The material referred to by the Crown is capable of demonstrating MrÂ Issakidis' knowledge at the relevant times of the first two features of the structuring transactions that I have identified (see for example Exhibit A pp 347-358 and 511 F-M).
	
	
	The position is the same with the third feature, namely the necessity for NeuMedix to claim deductions and the manner in which NeuMedix indicated that it would claim deductions. For example, on 9 May 2008 Mr Issakidis was copied in on an email from Mr Dickson to a representative of the ANZ Bank which explained the precise basis that NeuMedix would claim tax deductions, namely by depreciating or amortising the cost of acquiring patents (Exhibit A p 2293).
	


Acquisition of intellectual property


	
	Next it is necessary to note the Crown tendered a series of signed agreements evidencing the acquisition by Athena of the three items of intellectual property, that is Genvax, CGS and ColoGene, from their respective inventors. Those agreements and the undisputed evidence of the inventors that were called is more than capable of demonstrating that Athena acquired the Genvax intellectual property in January 2007, the CGS Intellectual Property in March 2007 and the ColoGene intellectual property in November 2007.
	
	
	As I have previously noted the depreciation claims that were in fact made in the tax returns lodged on behalf of NeuMedix was based upon what appear to be unsigned agreements in which NeuMedix supposedly acquired the relevant intellectual property from Athena. Also, as previously noted Athena was incorporated in the Cayman Islands. There is evidence capable of demonstrating that, at the very least, Mr Dickson controlled Athena. For example, on 12 January 2007 Mr Dickson sent an email to a firm of solicitors in the Cayman Islands issuing instructions for the change of name of Athena and the composition of its Board of Directors (Exhibit A p 858). On 16 May 2008 Mr Dickson wrote to an ANZ Bank representative and described Athena as NeuMedixâs âintellectual property warehousing companyâ (Exhibit A p 2295).
	
	
	The evidence that was tendered by the Crown in its case is capable of supporting the inference that Mr Issakidis was aware of the fact that Athena acquired the intellectual property for at least Genvax and CGS and was aware of the terms upon which it was acquired.
	
	
	In relation to the acquisition of Genvax, Mr Issakidis faxed a power of attorney purportedly executed on behalf of Athena which was said to confer authority on a firm of solicitors who otherwise acted for MrÂ Issakidis to execute the various documents for the acquisition of the Genvax intellectual property by Athena from its inventors (Exhibit A pp1170-1409).
	
	
	In relation to the acquisition of the CGS intellectual property, on 26 June 2007 Mr Issakidis wrote to a representative of CGS on the letterhead of âNeuMedix Health Groupâ concerning a dispute that had arisen. In the letter he referred to the âexecution of the agreement between our respective companiesâ. The evidence that has been tendered to date only evidences the existence of signed agreements between CGS and Athena, such that the inference is reasonably open that in his letter MrÂ Issakidis was referring to those agreements. Consistent with this there is evidence that later in 2007 Mr Issakidis participated in the drafting of a letter to CGS on the letterhead of Athena (Exhibit A ppÂ 1757-1761).
	
	
	Further on 1 April 2006 Mr Issakidis was sent a draft letter by MrÂ Dickson which was intended for the ANZ Bank. (Exhibit A p 392D). The letter referred to an intention on the part of NeuMedix to âtransfer full ownership of these technologies to the Cayman Islands then assign/ licence the technologies to NeuMedix Health Australia Proprietary Limitedâ. The reference to âthese technologiesâ in this passage appears to include Genvax and CGS.
	
	
	In addition this material is also capable of demonstrating that MrÂ Issakidis was aware that Athena was an entity controlled by MrÂ Dickson.Â Â In particular the documentary exchange with the representatives of CGS indicate that both he and Mr Dickson were able to speak on Athena's behalf.
	
	
	It should be noted, however, that I was not referred to any similar documentation which indicated that Mr Issakidis was aware of the fact of the acquisition of the ColoGene intellectual property by Athena and the terms and conditions upon which it was acquired.
	


Walsh & Walsh


	
	In the latter part of 2007 Walsh and Walsh Accountants were retained by NeuMedix. The principal of that firm, Mr Walsh, explained that the retainer was initially to prepare financial statements for NeuMedix although he said at a later stage the firm prepared at least one tax return. On 8 November 2007 Mr Dickson sent an email to Mr Issakidis attaching a memorandum (the âNovember memorandumâ) (Exhibit A p 1815). Mr Dickson described the November memorandum as a âdraft memo to accountantâ.
	
	
	Six days later Mr Issakidis sent the November memorandum to MrÂ Walsh by email. The memorandum asserted that NeuMedix had acquired the Genvax intellectual property for $200,000,000.00 payable over four years under an assignment agreement dated 15 January 2007, and had acquired the CGS intellectual property under an assignment agreement dated 5 March 2007 for $60,000,000.00 payable over four years. The November memorandum stated that: âThe technologies were acquired from an Intellectual Property Broking Group, Karkalla International Holdings Limitedâ. On one version of this memo this passage is blurred but whether this reflects a subsequent correction is a matter that need not and cannot be decided at this point.
	
	
	The November memorandum also referred to NeuMedix entering into an option agreement with Karkalla for, inter alia, the acquisition of intellectual property in respect of ColoGene. The November memorandum asserted that NeuMedix had secured debt funding from, inter alia, Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Proprietary Ltd (âDampier Asia Pacificâ) to meet its obligations.
	
	
	On 14 December 2007 Mr Dickson sent Mr Issakidis an email attaching âFour docs for Accountantsâ (Exhibit A p 1999). About three hours later MrÂ Â Issakidis sent the email and attachments to Mr Walsh.Â Â The attached documents included an unsigned assignment agreement pursuant to which Karkalla sold to NeuMedix the intellectual property relating to Genvax, and an unsigned assignment agreement pursuant to which Karkalla sold the intellectual property relating to CGS to NeuMedix. It also included an unsigned option deed under which NeuMedix could acquire the intellectual property concerning ColoGene from Karkalla (the âKarkalla Assignmentsâ).
	
	
	It appears that in early January 2007 there was a meeting between Mr Issakidis, Mr Dickson and Mr Walsh. During that meeting Mr Dickson stated he would prepare NeuMedix's tax returns. Later in January 2007 and then again in February 2007 Mr Walsh sent draft financial accounts for NeuMedix for the financial year 2007 to Mr Dickson and Mr Issakidis. Those draft accounts claim depreciation costs in a manner consistent with what was stated in the November memorandum and the Karkalla Assignments. They also claim a loss of the disposal of intellectual property of some $100,000,000.00 which appears to reflect the other unsigned agreement enclosed with Mr Issakidis' email of 20 December 2007 (Exhibit A pp 2104 and 2124).
	
	
	Ultimately on what appears to have been 19 March 2008 Mr Issakidis and Mr Dickson signed a set of accounts for NeuMedix for the financial year 2007 (Exhibit A pp 1553-1565 and 2257). These accounts included an entry for depreciation and another entry for loss on the disposal of intellectual property which was consistent with what was stated in the November 2007 memorandum and the Karkalla assignments.
	
	
	However, on what appears to be 22 June 2009 Mr Issakidis and MrÂ Dickson signed a revised version of NeuMedix's 2007 accounts which claimed a much larger depreciation figure, being a figure which corresponded with the amount claimed in NeuMedix's 2007 financial year tax return. This set of accounts claimed depreciation expenses in an amount which was consistent with the unsigned agreements recording an acquisition of the relevant intellectual property for CGS and Genvax by NeuMedix from Athena that was later provided to the ATO. As I have noted there is no direct evidence that Mr Issakidis saw those assignment agreements. This change in the accounts appears to have been precipitated by MrÂ Dickson, possibly around March 2009.
	
	
	This further set of accounts signed by Mr Issakidis maintained a reference to the provision of funding from Dampier Asia Pacific which was also contained in the first set of accounts that he signed.
	
	
	In any event, as is to be expected, there were a number of communications with Walsh & Walsh between early 2008 to the time of the signing of both sets of accounts for the financial year 2007. Many of the emails recording those communications that were tendered do not contain any indication that they were sent to Mr Issakidis, however some were. In particular on 27 February 2008 and 28 February 2008 (Exhibit A pp 2229 and 2756) Mr Issakidis was copied in on an email from an accountant at Walsh & Walsh to Mr Dickson which indicated that she was undertaking work on a draft tax return. These emails were capable of conveying to Mr Issakidis, if he did not know already, that there was a connection between the contents of the financial statements and the contents of any tax returns to be lodged on behalf of NeuMedix.
	
	
	As I have stated, it is a reasonable inference that Mr Issakidis read and comprehended the material that he was sent, received and certainly that he signed. It follows that it is reasonably open for a jury to conclude that Mr Issakidis knew that the financial statements that were being and had been drafted by Walsh & Walsh would be based on the assertions that were made in the November memorandum, backed up by the Karkalla Assignments, as to the effect of those assignments and that it was proposed, initially at least, to prepare tax returns on that basis.
	


The Karkalla assignments


	
	The next issue that arises is whether there is evidence from which the jury could conclude that Mr Issakidis knew that any claim for depreciation expenses based on the Karkalla Assignments was false, i.e. is there evidence capable of establishing that he knew that there was no obligation on the part of NeuMedix to pay any such amounts. In my view there was.
	
	
	Without being exhaustive I note the following matters: First, there is evidence that Mr Issakidis knew that the entity that acquired the intellectual property for Genvax and CGS from the inventors was Athena and not Karkalla International.
	
	
	Second, there is evidence that he knew of the terms upon which Athena acquired the intellectual property from the inventors of CGS and Genvax. There appears to be a substantial discrepancy between those amounts and what was disclosed as to the consideration payable in the Karkalla Assignments, at least so far as the acquisition of intellectual property by Athena from the inventors of CGS and Genvax was concerned. Broadly the consideration paid by Athena was the entering into of a non-recourse loan for $1.3 million and $1.8 million respectively plus a promise to pay fifty per cent of the gross revenue following commercialisation. On one view the very large amount apparently agreed to be paid to Karkalla by NeuMedix might be seen as having a correspondence with the promise to pay fifty per cent of the gross revenues to the original inventors. However, the evidence is capable of supporting a conclusion that the technologies were, to the knowledge of all concerned, at such an early stage of development that no value of that kind could be so attributed.
	
	
	Third, in respect of Genvax the Crown tendered an assignment agreement between Athena and NeuMedix dated 2 January 2007 which was signed by Mr Dickson and Mr Issakidis for NeuMedix and under which NeuMedix agreed to pay $18 million for the relevant patents and intellectual property (Exhibit A p 857). This is not the agreement upon which any part of the depreciation claim in any tax return was based in that the consideration paid is too low to generate anything like the type of depreciation expenses that were sought to be claimed.
	
	
	The Crown contended that this document was prepared to enable MrÂ Dickson and Mr Issakidis to persuade Barclays Bank to process a payment out of Australia of funds that NeuMedix had received from its participation in the first of the structured finance deals it had entered into with the ANZ Bank. It is unnecessary to address that contention. What is relevant to note is that, on its face, this agreement appears to be completely inconsistent with the Karkalla assignment concerning Genvax that Mr Issakidis sent to Mr Walsh and which was described in the November memorandum.
	
	
	Fourth, there is evidence capable of demonstrating that Mr Issakidis knew that Mr Dickson effectively controlled Karkalla. In October 2005 Mr Issakidis received an email in which Mr Anthony Dickson described Karkalla as âbeneficially owned by John Dicksonâ (Exhibit A p 211). John Dickson is Anthony Dickson's brother. On 22 June 2006 Mr Issakidis received an email from Mr Dickson attaching a draft deed of release which appears to describe Karkalla as an entity associated with himself and Mr Dickson (Exhibit A ppÂ 427E, 427H).
	
	
	In December 2007 Mr Issakidis was sent an invoice for the placing of an advertisement by Karkalla that listed its office address as the same address as that of NeuMedix in Sydney and listed a contact person as being a NeuMedix staff member (Exhibit A p 1996).
	
	
	Fifth, the accounts that Mr Issakidis signed in 2008 are capable of conveying the statement that the source of NeuMedix's funding to acquire the intellectual property from Karkalla was Dampier Asia Pacific whereas there is evidence capable of supporting a finding that MrÂ Issakidis knew that was not the case.
	
	
	On a number of occasions Mr Issakidis engaged in email correspondence with an alleged representative of Dampier Asia Pacific called Jay Corbett (see for example Exhibit AÂ ppÂ 1518, 1518A, 1519B, 1519C). Evidence was given by Mr John Dickson which, if accepted, is capable of founding a conclusion that Anthony Dickson and Mr Corbett are the same person and that Mr Issakidis was aware of that. John Dickson's evidence on that topic and his credit generally was strongly attacked in cross-examination. However at no point of the trial, including this one, is it my function to assess matters of credibility.
	
	
	Further, there is evidence that in early 2007 Mr Issakidis arranged for the transfer of the funds received by NeuMedix from its first structured finance deal with the ANZ Bank to Dampier Asia Pacific's bank account overseas. In doing so it appears that Mr Issakidis completed forms which were submitted to the transmitting bank stating that the funds were to be used to fund the acquisition of intellectual property (see Exhibit AÂ pÂ 1437). However, a note that has been tendered, which is said to be in the handwriting of Mr Issakidis, is capable of being construed as recording an agreement to divide the funds up with the majority to be allocated to Mr Dickson, another person, and some portion to Mr Issakidis personally, with the rest to be used to fund Athena to purchase the intellectual property from inventors (see Exhibit A pÂ 624). The subsequent flow of funds appears to be consistent generally with that construction of the note (see Exhibits S and T).
	
	
	This material appears to be inconsistent with the documents apparently sent by Mr Issakidis which stated the funds were being sent to Dampier Asia Pacific to fund the purchase of intellectual property. Instead the material is capable of suggesting that, to Mr Issakidis' knowledge, the funds were being sent to Dampier Asia Pacific so that Mr Anthony Dickson could control the funds from offshore for later distribution to his and, to a lesser extent, Mr Issakidis' personal benefit as well as to fund the acquisition of intellectual property from the inventors by Athena.
	
	
	The significance of this material at this point is that it is capable of founding a conclusion that Mr Issakidis knew that Dampier Asia Pacific was not a third party financier able to fund $100 million of NeuMedix's purchase of intellectual property, but was instead a vehicle for Mr Anthony Dickson to park and then later distribute the cash received from the ANZ Bank. In turn this is capable of supporting a finding that Mr Issakidis knew that NeuMedix did not in truth need any $100 million facility to meets its obligation to Karkalla because there was no such obligation.
	


Conclusion


	
	In the end result I am satisfied that there is evidence capable satisfying a jury that: firstly Mr Issakidis knowingly provided documents to Walsh & Walsh that falsely asserted that NeuMedix had incurred an obligation to pay substantial amounts for the acquisition of intellectual property from Karkalla; secondly, that he did so understanding that Walsh & Walsh would use that information to prepare financial accounts; thirdly, that he was aware of a connection between the preparation of any such financial accounts and the contents of NeuMedix tax returns; and fourthly, that he knew that the basis upon which NeuMedix would address its potential exposure to pay tax on its assessable income from the unit trust was by claiming depreciation based on its cost of acquisition of patents. Further, there is also evidence capable of satisfying a jury that he took active steps to facilitate a number of those matters.
	
	
	However, as already indicated, there is little or no evidence of any direct connection between Mr Issakidis and the tax returns as lodged and the agreements that the depreciation claims were apparently based on. At most there is the revised financial year 2007 accounts for NeuMedix that he signed which also included the note from Dampier that I have described. Instead the evidence is capable of suggesting that, at some point in perhaps late 2008 or early 2009, Mr Dickson determined to change course with the financial accounts of NeuMedix and its tax returns and instead based the depreciation claims on alleged assignments from Athena to NeuMedix. As I have stated, the only evidence of Mr Issakidis being possibly aware of that is his signing of the revised 2007 accounts.Â Â Nevertheless I am satisfied that MrÂ Issakidis has a case to answer on count 1. The evidence that I have outlined is material upon which a jury could be satisfied that he maintained an agreement with Mr Dickson of a kind referred to in [2.1] of the proposed direction. Just because Mr Dickson may have changed the ultimate method of implementing their agreement, would not lead to Mr Issakidis avoiding criminal liability.
	
	
	If there was an agreement of the kind alleged it appears to be one that contemplated Mr Dickson taking ultimate implementation responsibility for the preparation and lodgement of NeuMedix's tax returns. Of course whether a jury will conclude that there was such an agreement is a different matter but I am nevertheless satisfied that there is a case to answer.
	
	
	For the sake of completeness I note two further matters. First, IÂ consider it self-evident that, if the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of an agreement of the kind contemplated by [2.1] of the proposed direction, then it also could be satisfied by the test of dishonesty set out in proposed [2.2].
	
	
	Second, in his written submissions Mr Byrne SC made reference to sÂ 9.1 of the Code which excludes criminal responsibility for some offences on some occasions where the accused has the mistaken belief or is ignorant of certain facts.
	
	
	The above ""findings"" concerning Mr Issakidis, tentative as they are, do not appear to leave any room for the operation of this section at this point of the trial. The potential application of this provision would need to be considered further.
	
	
	Accordingly it follows that I dismiss the no case submission put on behalf of both accused in respect of Counts 1 and 6.

		14 June 2016",2014-10-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765074,R v Sumpton (No. 2) [2014] NSWSC 1440,"Judgment

1The accused is on trial for one count of murder and two counts of damaging property by fire. The prosecution alleges that the accused murdered the deceased by stabbing and bashing her and then attempted to cover up his actions by setting fire to her and her house. The circumstances of the alleged offence and the nature of the prosecution case are set out in a little detail in my pre-trial judgment excluding evidence of admissions made by the accused in a recorded interview with police: see R v Sumpton [2014] NSWSC 1432 at [4] - [6] and [16]. The trial before the jury has reached its sixth day.

2By notice dated 27 August 2014 and amended 25 September 2014 and 30 September 2014, the prosecution seeks to adduce tendency evidence pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). 

3The notice indicates that the tendency that the prosecution seeks to prove is a tendency in the accused ""to have a particular state of mind, namely a sexual interest in women of Asian appearance"".

4The accused, through his counsel Mr Dennis, objects to the evidence. The parties flagged the issue in advance of the trial and I received informally a bundle of documents relied upon by the Crown.

5Exhibit VD-9 is the Crown's bundle on the tendency issue. The bundle includes two tendency notices (only one of which is pressed as tendency evidence), the statements of the proposed tendency witnesses, a statement of a Dr Berry, extracts of an electronically recorded interview with the accused (ERISP) and a number of black and white photocopies of pages of a Facebook profile in the name of Andrew Sumpton. In addition to that material, I also have the evidence adduced in the earlier voir dire (see R v Sumpton (supra) at [7]-[15]), the opening statements of counsel and the evidence elicited to this point of the trial. 

ADMISSIBILITY OF TENDENCY EVIDENCE IN NEW SOUTH WALES

6For tendency evidence to be admissible the evidence must have ""significant probative value"", either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by (in this case) the prosecution: s 97(1)(b) Evidence Act. 

7Further, because these are criminal proceedings and the evidence is sought to be adduced by the prosecutor, the evidence cannot be used against the accused ""unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused"": s 101 Evidence Act.

8The dictionary to the Evidence Act says that the ""probative value of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue"".

9In New South Wales, an assessment of probative value does not encompass matters going to the reliability of the evidence or the credibility of the witnesses providing it: R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 at [60]-[68]. The Victorian Court of Appeal had described the approach in R v Shamouil and other New South Wales cases as ""manifestly wrong"" and declined to follow it: Dupas v The Queen [2012] VSCA 328; 218 A Crim R 507 at [63]. In R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121, a majority of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal determined that R v Shamouil remained the law of New South Wales. Unless the High Court resolves the issue to the contrary, or the Court of Criminal Appeal reverses its decision in a subsequent case, trial Judges in this state are bound to follow the approach in R v Shamouil and R v XY. The conflict in the authorities is subject to a thorough and interesting analysis in Odgers' Uniform Evidence Law (11th Edition, 2014) at [1.3.14760]. 

THE TENDENCY EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE

10The evidence comes from three sources and is quite different and diverse in its detail. The common feature is the reference to ""Asian"" women or women of Asian appearance. There is no evidence to suggest any connection between those sources such that the probative value of the evidence (assuming it has any) is diminished by the reasonable possibility that there has been some form of joint concoction or collaboration between the witnesses: see Hoch v the Queen [1988] HCA 50; 165 CLR 292, Pfennig v The Queen [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461, AE v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 52 at [44]; BSJ v The Queen [2012] VSCA 93.

11The first source of the evidence is the accused's ex-partner Alexandra Beeching-Marshall. The part of her statement identified in the Amended Tendency Notice is as follows:
""52. When we were on speed Andrew had an interest in watching Asian porn. Different types of porn but particularly Asian porn. It became habit for him to put Asian DVD porn on the t.v. Andrew owned five Asian DVDs porn video's. We had several other porn DVD's but he always wanted the Asian DVDs. Andrew had a particularly favourite shop selling pornography and adult toys in Brisbane that he would take me to about four or five occasions. That was his favourite shop it was called Kaos I don't recall the suburb name where it was.

53. Andrew had introduced the 'porn' into our relationship he would buy toys and other adult items from the store. I bought some items on line as well.

54. Sometimes watching the Asian porn made me a bit self conscious, because we watched so much Asian porn they were all skinny girls. I'm a bit larger.""

12The Crown also relies on other parts of Ms Beeching-Marshall's statement but does not seek to use those parts as evidence of tendency. I understand that there may be a separate objection to other parts of her evidence. 

13The second source of the tendency evidence comes from a neighbour of the accused Darius (Dave) Ohlsen. The relevant part of his statement is in paragraph 13:
""I don't know if this is relevant but I wanted to add that since I have known Andrew he told me he had gone down to Newcastle and booked into a Motel. He still had his Hyundai at the time. He told me that he got a taxi to where the 'hookers' are. He told me that he picked up one who he said was Asian, he told me that he had a heap of 'speed' and dosed them both up. He made it plain that he 'liked it rough'. After that he ditched her. That is what Andrew told me.""


14The third source of the evidence comes from one of the detectives investigating the case. Detective Grahame Burke interrogated a Facebook profile in the name of Andrew Sumpton. That profile includes a photograph of the accused, giving rise to the inference that the profile is owned and operated by the accused. I do not understand that to be subject of any dispute. The accused had 115 Facebook ""friends"". Of those friends, a vast majority (around 90%) were young women of Asian appearance. There are photographs of those ""friends"" on the accused's Facebook profile. Relevant pages of the Facebook profile are annexed to Mr Burke's statement in the form of black and white photocopies. 

15From this evidence, the prosecution says that a jury might find that the accused has a particular (and sexual) interest in women of an ""Asian"" appearance. 

16The victim of the crime with which the accused is charged was a woman of Asian appearance.

RELEVANT ISSUES IN THE TRIAL

17To assess the probative value of the proposed tendency evidence and the extent to which it might rationally affect the existence of a fact in issue, it is necessary to identify the issues between the parties and the other evidence that the Crown has adduced and intends to adduce. 

18It is the Crown case that the murder had a sexual motive or connotation of some kind. The evidence of this is strong. It includes the fact that when the victim's charred remains were found she was naked except for a pair of underpants which were down around her knees. Further, of the 24 stab wounds inflicted to the victim, six were in the upper thigh and peri-vulval region. There is also evidence that the deceased visited a neighbour's house wearing lace lingerie a reasonably short time before she was murdered. 

19The evidence establishes that the accused and the victim were together in the hours leading up to the victim's death. The evidence of the precise timing is somewhat vague and, according to the opening statement on behalf of accused, of some significance. The accused denies having any sexual contact with the victim. In the lengthy ERISP the accused denied any physical contact with the victim apart from the possibility of incidental contact when they brushed past one another in the course of their time together. He says that when he left her she was alive and well. He returned some time later and found that her house was on fire. 

20The accused said in the ERISP that he had a sexual dysfunction resulting in him being unable to achieve an erection without therapeutic drugs (Q 813-819). He told the police that Viagra did not help (Q 1670) but that a company (AMI) had prescribed a drug that was taken by injection. This allowed him to achieve an erection (QQ 1671-1680). His account to the police included that the last time he had intercourse was with his ex-partner Ms Beeching-Marshall and that this ""would be getting close to"" twelve months earlier. When asked (at Q 1698-9) whether he had attempted to have ""sexual interludes"" since then he said:
""No, I'm not interested mate."" 

21Asked (at Q 829) whether he ""still [got] the urge?"" he said:
""Mate, why would I get the urge? If it won't work it won't work.""

22Asked (at Q 1642) whether his intention was to get her drunk he said:
""Mate, look, she could've walked past me stark bollocky naked and I [wouldn't] have been able to do a thing anyway so what's the flippin' point?""

23Another relevant piece of evidence from the ERISP is at Q 1630:
""Q All right. What did you tell Mr Johnson or Steve as you referred him to about the lady that you were going to see?
A. What did I say to him? I met a lady, I think she's an Asian lady and then he said he, yeah, have some fun, he said, you might even get your end in.

Q. He said that or you said that?
A. I don't remember. I can't get me end in, mate, I told you it's just pointless.""

24One of the investigating detectives (Mr Sippel) was cross-examined to establish that inquiries have confirmed that the accused had contact with AMI in relation to ""that matter"" (ie sexual dysfunction) (T 472). There is also a statement of a Dr Berry who is a consultant at AMI confirming that she spoke to accused on 23/8/2010 about his difficulty in gaining and maintaining an erection and diagnosed ""severe erectile dysfunction"". Ms Beeching-Marshall will also give evidence confirming the accused's ""sexual problems maintaining an erection"" and the medication he used to deal with that problem. 

25In opening to the jury, Mr Dennis said that the issue in the case was not whether the deceased was murdered but whether the accused was responsible for the murder. He also said:
""Another issue will be Mr Shane Martin, the boyfriend of the deceased. Now, there are a number of stab wounds, 24 stab wounds, the Crown says that there's a sexual flavour or connotation of what has happened particularly as it's not disputed, the deceased's underpants were found drawn part way down her legs. Mr Martin is an interesting witness who will be cross-examined vigorously. An assessment of his credibility, his believability, will, I anticipate feature significantly in your evaluation of the evidence.""

26Mr Dennis has asked a number of the firefighters who were in attendance whether the accused asked them ""was the boyfriend in there"". He also asked another witness about a conversation in which the deceased made complaint about somebody who might readily be inferred to be her boyfriend. Yarnah Cook, T 565-565:
Q. At some stage during the day do you recall [the deceased] using your mother's phone?
A. It was my phone that she used.

Q. She was complaining about a male person wasn't she?
A. Yes.

Q. She was saying that this male had stayed at her house the night before?
A. Yes.

Q. That he'd gotten there at 11pm and left at about five in the morning?
A. Yes.

Q. She complained that this man hadn't said goodbye?
A. Yes.

Q. She said words along the lines of ""He always bloody uses me"" is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. Do you know which man she was talking about?
A. No sorry.

Q. Do you know if Mandy had a boyfriend at the time?
A. No.

Q. Did you form any view about who she was talking about?
A. No.

27It appears that one of the hypotheses to be advanced on behalf of the accused is that Mr Martin may be responsible for the killing.

28In the light of the issues between the parties, and in particular the fact that the sole issue in the trial is the identity of the murderer, the fact (if it can be established) that the accused had a sexual interest in Asian women is a matter of considerable significance. 

THE EVIDENCE OF MS BEECHING-MARSHALL

29In providing some helpful preliminary submissions on Friday, Mr Dennis submitted that the evidence of Ms Beeching-Marshall lacked significant probative value for the following reasons:
(i)It lacks contemporaneity with events surrounding the murder.

(ii)The use of pornography featuring Asian women as a sexual stimulant does not lead to an inference that the accused had a sexual interest in Asian women upon which he would necessarily act. Mr Dennis said ""there is not a relevant similarity inasmuch as we're talking about pornography as opposed to sexual activity itself"".

(iii)The tendency evidence is not sufficiently similar to the events alleged in the murder and, in particular, there is no suggestion that the victim and the accused were using ""speed"" or similar type drugs in the time leading up to the killing. 

30When the argument resumed on Monday, Mr Dennis relied on written submission in which it was contended that the evidence lacked significant probative value because (i) the alleged activity was ""only a limited part of a broader range of sexual behaviour"" and (ii) the witness herself is not a person of Asian background and had been in a relationship with the accused for a period of around 10 years.

31There is authority to support the proposition that a substantial effluxion of time between the events subject of the tendency (or coincidence) evidence and the subject offence may diminish the probative value of the evidence: see R v Watkins [2005] NSWCCA 164; 153 A Crim R 434 at [42] (Barr J). However, two things can be observed in the present case. First, the effluxion of time is not great. In R v Watkins there was an effluxion of time of around 14 or 15 years. Here, the effluxion of time is not completely clear but it is nothing of that magnitude. The accused said that his last sexual encounter with his ex-partner was around twelve months before the murder. Second, the evidence of Ms Beeching-Marshall concerns events that occurred after the accused began to suffer from sexual dysfunction. In the context of the issues between the parties and the accused's assertion that he did not have sexual urges, that fact is more significant than the precise length of time between the events relied on as tendency evidence and the alleged offence. 

32As to the submission that the use of pornography depicting Asian women is a different thing to actually engaging in sexual activity with Asian women, I note the observations of James J (with whom McClellan AJA and Grove J agreed) in R v MM [2004] NSWCCA 364:
""60 ... It would appear to me that his Honour held that evidence that the respondent collected and viewed child pornography and fantasised about sexual acts with children, regarded as evidence of a tendency the respondent had, was simply irrelevant, that is to say it was not evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of whether the respondent had committed any of the offences alleged by the Crown or, differently expressed, was not evidence that, if it were accepted, could establish any relevant tendency to act in a particular way.

61. I do not accept that the evidence, regarded as evidence of a tendency the respondent had, was irrelevant. Evidence that the respondent, as a person charged with offences of child sexual assault, had collected and viewed child pornography and had fantasised about sexual acts with children satisfies the criterion of relevance under s 55 of the Evidence Act, in that the evidence is capable of rendering more probable that the respondent acted in the ways in which he is alleged by the Crown to have acted. In my opinion, no expert evidence was required in order to make such evidence admissible. It is in accordance with common human experience that a person who has had thoughts, particularly persistent thoughts, about some type of act is, at least to some extent, more likely to perform an act of that type than a person who has never had such thoughts. It is not to the point that many persons who fantasise about some act never actually do it.""


33In PGM v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 310, the trial Judge excluded evidence of child pornography because the multitude of images that the Crown sought to adduce, and the nature of those images, would be ""so prejudicial"" that the trial would miscarry. It was not excluded because it lacked probative value. 

34Further, in R v PWD [2010] NSWCCA 209 Beazley JA (with whom Buddin J and Barr AJ agreed) said at [79]:
""The authorities are clear that for evidence to be admissible under s 97 there does not have to be a striking similarities or even closely similar behaviour.""

35Plainly, as was held in R v Harker [2004] NSWCCA 427, the evidence must ""transcend the mere fact"" that the respondent was having inappropriate sexual conduct with another person. See also R v Milton [2004] NSWCCA 195 at [31]. 

36As to the fact that there is no evidence that the victim and the accused were using ""speed"" on this occasion, that is not a matter upon which the Crown relies in pressing the admissibility of the tendency evidence. It is the suggestion of a sexual interest in Asian women that is at the core of the Crown's notice, not the use of drugs. It might also be observed that the accused and the complainant were using large quantities of alcohol, and possibly prescription drugs in the time leading up to the killing -although there is a qualitative difference between those drugs and amphetamine. The lack of striking similarity between the tendency evidence and the behaviour in the hours before the murder does not deprive the evidence of its probative value as evidence of the tendency that the prosecution seeks to prove: R v PWD (supra). 

37I have reached the conclusion that the evidence of Ms Beeching-Marshall has significant probative value. The accused's sexual interest in Asian women (if accepted) has a significant capacity rationally to affect an assessment of the probability that the accused attempted to, or did, have some sexual contact with the deceased. That in turn, would affect an assessment of the likelihood that the accused (not somebody else) murdered her. The probative value of the evidence is considered by reference to the things that the accused puts in issue including whether it is reasonably possible that a person other than the accused (and specifically Mr Martin) committed the crime and his assertion that he has little or no interest in sex as a result of his sexual dysfunction. 

38I do not understand how the fact that the activity is a limited part of the accused's sexual behaviour diminishes the probative value of the relevant aspect of his sexual interests. Nor do I accept that the fact that the accused was involved in a relationship with a non-Asian person means, as a matter of logic or common experience, that the accused does not have a sexual interest in women of Asian appearance. 

39Turning to s 101, and whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial affect that it may have on the accused, I accept that the evidence has some capacity to cause prejudice to the accused. This is because of the reference to taking of illegal drugs. However, that reference is not part of the tendency that the Crown seeks to establish. In the absence of the reference to illegal drug use, I am unable to discern any relevant prejudice in the evidence. If the evidence of drug use is not led, there is little or no prospect that the jury will misuse the evidence. The jury will be directed as to the proper use it can make of the evidence, namely as part of the circumstantial case that the Crown will rely upon to establish that it the accused, and not some other person, who killed the victim. 

40When I raised the question of omitting the reference to the drug use from the evidence, Mr Dennis submitted that he did not think that the evidence could be severed. I am unable to agree with this submission. Plainly, if the accused seeks to introduce the evidence of speed use or if he would prefer the Crown to lead the evidence of speed use, that is a forensic choice open to him. However, I do not accept that the use of speed is so intrinsically connected to the central features of the tendency evidence of Ms Beeching-Marshall that it is, in effect, either all or nothing. I indicate that if it were ""all or nothing"" I would allow all of the evidence and provide the jury with directions in relation to the limited use that could be made of the use of amphetamines and caution them against using it to draw adverse inferences against the accused. 

41The accused submits that ""the use of pornography may lead to an assessment of bad character and/or moral condemnation in the minds of some jurors"". I very much doubt that this is so. I do not think that the use of adult pornography is generally regarded in the community as a matter that would lead to a conclusion that a person is one of bad character. There is no suggestion that the use of pornography was other than consensual and it is certainly not pornography that might lead to criminal sanction. In any event, that is a matter that can be overcome by direction.

42The final matter said to give rise to possible prejudice to the accused concerns the use of the term ""Asian"". It is said that this is a ""broad"" term and Mr Dennis observes that Asia includes many developing and under-developed nations. It is submitted the accused's use of pornography depicting women from that region ""might be considered [by the jury] to be particularly exploitative behaviour"". While I appreciate the ingenuity of this submission, I am not sure that the fact that the pornography in question is described as ""Asian"" porn distinguishes it from most pornography in this respect. There is nothing in the bare descriptions of the material that gives rise to an inference that the participants were exploited or came from under-developed economies. 

43In assessing the possible prejudicial effect of the material, it is important to observe that there is no attempt by the prosecution to have the pornographic videos played to the jury or even to provide graphic descriptions of what is depicted in them. 

44For those reasons my ruling is that the evidence of Ms Beeching-Marshall is admissible. I would have made this ruling provisional upon the reference to illegal drug use being omitted. To be clear, I would have ruled that the reference to the accused and his ex-partner using ""speed"" is inadmissible. It is not relevant to the tendency that the prosecution seeks to establish. However, I accept that counsel for the accused may make, or may already have made, a forensic decision that there is some advantage in having the use of amphetamine adduced. 

45Of course, the record should be clear that this forensic choice has been forced upon him by my ruling, over his objection, that the evidence is admissible: cf Stanoevski v The Queen [2001] HCA 4; 202 CLR 115 at [48] (Gaudron, Kirby and Callinan JJ). 

THE EVIDENCE OF MR OHLSEN

46The evidence that the accused admitted that he visited Asian prostitutes is capable of supporting the prosecution case that the accused had a sexual interest in Asian women. For the same reasons I have provided in relation to the evidence of his use of pornography depicting Asian women, in light of the issues at the trial, I find that it has significant probative value.

47The accused submitted that ""the alleged utterances of the accused relate to one event only"". That fact (assuming it to be) does not undermine the probative value of the evidence. It is not the frequency of visits but the fact that Mr Ohlsen alleges that the accused specifically told him that he visited ""Asian"" prostitutes that provides the evidence with its probative value. In making the assessment, it is important to consider that allegation along with the other evidence including the assertion by Ms Beeching-Marshall that the accused always wanted to look at the ""Asian porn"" even though there was other pornography available to him.

48The accused also asserts that the fact that the visits to prostitutes involved the use of ""speed"" (amphetamines) distinguishes the evidence from the events giving rise to the current proceedings. As I have said in relation to that aspect of Ms Beeching-Marshall's evidence, and contrary to the accused's submissions, I am of the opinion that this aspect of the evidence is severable. As I have also said, there is evidence in the present case that the accused and the deceased were well affected by intoxicants, albeit of a very different kind. 

49In spite of Mr Dennis' careful submissions, I have concluded that the evidence that the accused visited an Asian prostitute has significant probative value in the light of the other evidence and the issues in the trial.

50Mr Dennis submits that the evidence of Mr Ohlsen may cause prejudice to the accused for a variety of reasons. He raises the fact that the use of prostitutes may lead to a conclusion of bad character or moral condemnation. This is a legitimate concern but is a matter that can be dealt with by directions. 

51Two other aspects of the evidence are capable of causing prejudice to the accused. First, there is again reference to the use of ""speed"". I make the same ruling in relation to that matter as I made with respect to the evidence of Ms Beeching-Marshall. 

52The second aspect of Mr Ohlsen's statement that has a capacity to cause prejudice to the accused is the statement that the accused allegedly made to Mr Ohlsen that he ""liked it rough"". The tendency notice does not suggest that the prosecution is seeking to prove that the accused had a tendency to engage in ""rough"" or violent sex. Even if that was its intention, the potential prejudice is too great to permit such evidence to be led. The expression is vague and it is far from clear what is meant by it. In the course of argument, the learned Crown Prosecutor accepted that this part of the evidence should not be led. I would reject it. 

53However, provided the reference to ""rough"" sex is omitted, my ruling is that the prosecution may adduce the evidence that the accused told Mr Ohlseen that he used to visit Asian prostitutes. Once again, I record that I would have excluded the evidence of drug use but for the stance taken by the accused. 

THE FACEBOOK FRIENDS

54The evidence of pictures of the accused's Facebook friends raises different considerations.

55The first question is whether the evidence is capable of giving rise to the inference that the accused had a sexual interest in Asian women (relevance, s 55). The second question is the extent to which it has that capacity (probative value, s 97). The third question is whether the evidence may cause prejudice to the accused and, if so, does the probative value substantially outweigh that prejudicial effect (s 101). 

56I would answer the first question in the affirmative. If accepted, the evidence ""could"" affect ""directly or indirectly"" the existence of a fact in issue, namely whether the accused had a sexual interest in Asian women.

57However, that is as far as it goes. The extent to which the evidence has that capacity (its probative value) is slight. There is no evidence led to rebut the possibility that the accused had legitimate reasons for the number of his Facebook friends who are Asian women. There is no evidence as to whether the accused knew the ""friends"" in real life. There is no evidence as to when the Facebook friends were invited or accepted. There is no evidence as to whether it was the accused or the friend who made the initial contact or ""friend request"". There is no evidence as to what, if any, contact there was between the accused and the friends. None of the photographs have any particular sexual content - they are predominantly headshots although some of the photographs might be considered to be somewhat alluring or seductive. There is no commentary that gives the photographs any sexual content. There is no evidence of sexualised ""messaging"" or ""chat"" between the accused and the friends. The photographs depict women much younger than the victim; the detective describes them as ""young teenage Asian women"". 

58Even allowing for the fact that the evidence must be considered in the light of the other tendency evidence (and in particular the accused's use of pornography featuring women of Asian appearance and his visit to an Asian prostitute), the evidence does not have ""significant probative value"". Accordingly, it is inadmissible pursuant to s. 97.

59If I am wrong about that conclusion, I would exclude the evidence under s 101. The number of images may distract the jury from its true task. The fact that the accused befriends ""young teenage Asian women"" may cause the jury to make moral or ethical judgments against the accused that have no relevance to the issues between the parties in view of the age of the victim in this case. I am unable to contemplate any direction that is capable of curing that potential prejudice. Such directions are more likely to highlight the issue than to alleviate the possibility that the jury might misuse the evidence. The probative value of the evidence does not substantially outweigh ""any prejudicial effect that the evidence may have on the accused"". 

60I should note that if I am erroneous in my assessment of the probative value of the evidence, that error is likely to have infected my conclusion as to the application of s 101. That is, if the evidence has greater probative value than I have concluded, it may be that the probative value does substantially outweigh the possible prejudicial effect of the evidence. However, in making the assessment under s 101 I have been influenced by the number of images that the Crown seeks to tender and the possible misuse of the evidence. In other words, I have focussed largely on my assessment of the prejudicial effect of the evidence in making the determination under s 101. 

CONCLUSION AND RULINGS

61For those reasons, I make the following rulings:
(1)I allow the evidence of Ms Beeching-Marshall that the accused watched pornography depicting women of Asian appearance.

(2)I allow the evidence that the accused told Mr Ohlsen that he visited an Asian prostitute.

(3)I reject the evidence of the accused's use of illegal drugs unless the accused consents to, or insists upon, its introduction.

(4)I reject the evidence of the accused saying that he ""liked it rough"".

(5)I reject the evidence derived from the accused's Facebook profile.

2765088,Petty v Zhao [2014] NSWDC 174,"Judgment

1This is an application by the plaintiff to strike out certain particulars in relation to the plea of justification set out in the Amended Defence, and for particulars as requested in relation to paragraph A8.3 of the plaintiff's letter dated 6 August 2014. 

2As the application required me to read the correspondence between the solicitors, I directed the plaintiff to provide submissions no later than 4:00pm 16 October 2014, and for the defendant to provide submissions by 4:00pm 21 October 2014, the day before the matter was listed for argument. Regrettably, counsel for the plaintiff did not provide his own submissions until the day before these proceedings and, although the correspondence was attached to his email, the file was not in a printable format. 

3Additionally, the ambit of complaint was considerably enlarged. The plaintiff's letter of 2 October 2014 identified the objections as relating to paragraphs 8.a(iv) - 8.a(vi) of the amended defence and the particulars in paragraph A8.3. The submissions of counsel for the plaintiff referred to additional matters as follows:

(a)that the Defendant provide particulars of paragraph 8(a)(ii) of the Amended Defence, failing which it be struck out;

(b)that the Defendant provide particulars of paragraph 8(c)(i)1 of the Amended Defence, failing which it be struck out;

(c)that the Defendant provide particulars of paragraph 8(c)(ii)3 of the Amended Defence, failing which it be struck out;

(d)that the Defendant provide particulars of paragraph 8(c)(ii)5 of the Amended Defence, failing which it be struck out;

(e)that the Defendant provide particulars of paragraph 9 of the Amended Defence, failing which it be struck out;

(f)Particulars of people to whom an (the) email was sent.

4Counsel for the defendant has responded both to the objections raised when the matter was before the court on 10 October 2014 and to the six matters raised in the submissions provided to him on 20 October 2014, but has indicated in his submissions that some of these submissions are done ""on the run"". I have taken this into account when dealing with the plaintiff's objections.

The relevant statutory provisions

5The plaintiff's application is made pursuant to rr 14.28 and 15.10 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR""). Counsel for the defendant refers me to s 57 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and rr 14.7, 14.8 and 14.14 UCPR.

6Counsel for the plaintiff does not refer me to any authority, but merely to the general obligation to provide particulars of justification. However, as is pointed out by Professor Brown (Brown on Defamation (Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, United States) (2nd e.d., Carswell)) at [20.4(2)] and Gatley on Libel and Slander (13th e.d., Sweet & Maxwell) at [29.1], there are specific principles which should be applied to the provision of particulars of justification and to the degree of specificity which may be required. 

7Counsel for the defendant helpfully refers me to Sims v Wran [1984] 1 NSWLR 317 at 321G, where Hunt J stated:

""There is often a fine line between giving particulars of the case which a party proposes to make and disclosing the evidence by which that case is to be proved. It all depends upon what is necessary to guard the other party against surprise. If the other party cannot otherwise be so guarded, it may sometimes be necessary for a party to disclose his evidence, or at least a broad outline of it. The starting point is what is necessary to guard the other party against surprise; the starting point is not what can be said without disclosing the evidence to be led. It is however important to emphasize that, ordinarily speaking, particulars are concerned with the nature of the case which is to be made by way of evidence; particulars are not to be used, except in the extraordinary case, to ascertain the legal characterization which a party places upon the facts and matters already identified in the particulars: cf Master Butchers Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1974] 1 NSWLR 350 at 359. Generally, it may be assumed that such argumentative matters or concepts will be either made clear in the pleadings or apparent from the facts and matters stated in the particulars supplied. If they are not, then the other party may in some cases be entitled to particulars in order to know the nature of the case he has to meet. But this situation will be rare.""

8I briefly note the relevant principles in relation to the particulars of justification necessary for the imputations arising from the matter complained of (which is set out below). The matter complained of sets out a dispute about parking and damage to the defendant's car in considerable detail, and the imputations reflect that factual matrix. Where the defamatory charge is sufficiently specific so that the plaintiff would know what must be established in justification, particulars may not be required at all: Cohen v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1965] NSWR 1484. In Cohen, Asprey J stated at 1486:

""if the words charged as a libel are themselves so specific, so precise that the plaintiff must know from them what the charge is, no further particulars are required.""

9This statement reflects what has long been the law in England, where Goddard LJ in Marks v Wilson-Boyd [1939] 2 All ER 605 at 608 explained that there was no hard and fast rule for the provision of particulars in all cases, and that each case turned on its facts:

""In the opinion of the court, there is not, nor ought there to be, an absolute rule of practice that, whenever a plea of justification is raised in the common form ""that the words are true in substance and in fact,"" an order for particulars must be made in this general form. A plaintiff is entitled to know with certainty on what the defendant intends to rely in support of his plea. Indeed, it has been said that the justification ought to state the facts with as much particularity as an indictment. No doubt in the great majority of cases a plea in this bald form ought to be supplemented by particulars from which the plaintiff can ascertain the precise nature of the charge which it is proposed to make against him, for he needs this information in order to prepare his evidence for the trial. Each case, however, must depend on its particular facts. If the words charged as a libel are themselves so specific-that is, precise-that the plaintiff must know from them what the charge is, no further particulars are required. Counsel for the respondents agreed that, if, for instance, the libel were (to take a clear case), ""The plaintiff is a thief because he stole my watch from my house last Monday,"" no further particulars would be required, and, if asked for, would be properly refused on the other hand, were the charge merely, ""The plaintiff is a thief,"" he would be entitled to the facts and matters on which the defendant intended to rely in support of his plea that the plaintiff was a thief.""

10Additionally, while the defendant is required to give particulars, he or she is not required to give details of the evidence upon which he or she relies: Brown v The Brisbane Newspaper Co Ltd [1902] QWN 25. In Church of the New Faith Inc v Bower & Australian Broadcasting Commission (1977) 18 SASR 554, Bray CJ said at 559 that the court would be careful to see that the defendant ""is not compelled to disclose his evidence to any greater extent than that which is necessary to enable the plaintiff to know the precise charges he has to meet"".

11Having noted these principles, I now set out the text of the matter complained of and the imputations.

The matter complained of

12The text of the matter complained of is as follows:

(1)Dear griffin [sic] community members:

(2)My name is Yocy Zhao from #27 the shore terraces, I recently had some extremely unpleasant experiences with my neighbor Mr. Geoffrey Petty from #25 who constantly parks his BMW X3 on the common driveway. This selfish and careless and unlawful action leaves me with a very narrow path to drive in/out causing me many troubles.

(3)About 2 months ago, my Range Rover got hit and scratched by Mr. Petty's garage door when he was trying to open his door. It happened when we were driving pass his X3 to try to park into our garage.

(4)Mr. Petty was aware the consequences of his action and agreed to compensate our damage.

(5)The next day, my husband took the car to Range Rover's officially appointed workshop, they quoted $1,200 (attached pic of the quotation), my husband tried to save him some money by taking the car to another workshop which we had our Porsche fixed at there before, we bargained and got a discount price of $880 under the condition of to wait 3 weeks as they were fully booked.

(6)We presented the both quotations to Mr. Petty and of course he chose the cheaper one. We waited 3 weeks to send our car to fix, and during the repairing period of one week, the workshop offered us a loan car for $250/day which we are surely entitled, but we refused and borrowed a car from a friend. All because we were trying to HELP and SAVE his money as much as we could. I sincerely did the best a neighbor could have done.

(7)We got our car back on the 8/April, we came to visit Mr. Petty on the 9th after I saw him drove back home in his X3, but he didn't open the door, so I swing by the next day and got told by his son that Mr and Mrs Petty went on holiday. I would be much appreciated if Mr. Geoffrey Petty opened his door and explained to me in person than just hiding in his home escape from this matter.

(8)Then we left a message to his son asking Mr Petty to come to see us when they come back.

(9)We waited patiently until they got back home before the long weekend, we didn't bother him and were expecting him to visit us proactively on the next few days but he didn't show up, so my husband went to see him on the 28/April. He talked with bad attitude said he didn't have the cheque with him, and would come to see us the next day.

(10)He didn't show up on the next day as he said, so I went to see him a day after, he was extremely rude and disrespectful to me, I asked him when to pay me, he wouldn't gave me a specific time then he shut his door before I finish talking. I had also told them to STOP parking his car on the driveway.

(11)Until now, he is still parking his X3 there and not paying me nor apologize to me for his damage.

(12)I truly don't understand if a decent person specially a barrister would knowingly violate the law, treat me rude and disrespectful especially after all the kind things we have done for him. I'm very furious and disappointed by having such a neighbour living next to me!!!

(13)I have the authorization from #23 to represent for them and myself who are effected the most by Mr. Petty's unacceptable action, I request the strata and building manager to stop him parking his car on the common driveway immediately, to stop causing damages and problems to me and to other residents.

(14)Kind regards.

(15)Yocy Zhao.

13The imputations pleaded as arising are as follows:

(a)The plaintiff cannot be relied upon to pay his just debts.

(b)The plaintiff evaded paying an acknowledged debt owed to the defendant's husband.

(c)The plaintiff knowingly violated the law.

a. The additional imputations which were carried by the email and which were defamatory of the Plaintiff and which were substantially true were:

i. That the Plaintiff is s selfish man;

ii. That the Plaintiff is a careless man;

iii. That the Plaintiff is cheap;

iv. That the Plaintiff is extremely rude:

v. That the Plaintiff is extremely disrespectful;

vi. That the Plaintiff is ungrateful;

vii. That the Plaintiff is infuriating;

viii. That the Plaintiff is extremely unpleasant;

ix. By way of false innuendo, that the Plaintiff is a bad neighbour.

16This poorly pleaded and unparticularised defence must be redrafted, as is noted below.

The plaintiff's objections

17Many of the plaintiff's objections evaporated when counsel stopped looking at the correspondence and instead considered the issues. I take into account, when considering the adequacy of provision of these particulars, the strident tone adopted in the plaintiff's solicitors' correspondence and indeed in the orders sought in this application. Solicitors should correspond with each other in a courteous fashion, whether or not there is provocation. Some of these issues could have been resolved by a simple telephone conversation between counsel.

18Having made that general observation (which is also relevant as to the costs order), I set out the particulars in dispute.

Paragraph 8.a(ii)

19This complaint was resolved during argument by counsel for the defendant confirming that the 5 March 2014 conversation was the occasion of provision of the two competing quotations to the plaintiff.

Paragraph 8.a(iv)

20The plaintiff points to asserted inconsistencies in the particulars as to when the plaintiff's cheque was stated to have been placed in the defendant's letter box. The defendant says she does not know when the letter was placed in the letter box; she only knows when she received it. Any alleged inconsistency is a matter for cross-examination at the trial, and I decline to order further answers to this particular. 

Paragraph 8.a(v)

21The plaintiff seeks the identity of the person referred to as ""the resident of 23 Griffin Court Glebe"" to whom the defendant says he spoke (23 Griffin Court is the home unit on the other side of the plaintiff's dwelling). I apprehend that a family of five persons lives there, and the plaintiff says he is entitled to know to whom the defendant says he spoke. 

22This is a request for the name of a witness, which is not generally a proper basis for particulars. The defendant has identified the relevant resident at number 23 who told her about this conversation (as opposed to the persons to whom the plaintiff spoke) as a lady named Mrs Cui Di Yu. That is a sufficient answer.

23I decline to order further particulars or to strike out this particular.

Paragraph 8.c(i)1

24This is an objection to the reference to ""the alleged Rule 11 of the Road Rules"" on the basis of relevance. 

25The defendant has particularised a claim that the plaintiff was parked upon a ""driveway"". Regulation 198(2) Road Rules 2008 (NSW) provides:

""(2) A driver must not stop on or across a driveway or other way of access for vehicles travelling to or from adjacent land unless:

(a) the driver:

(i) is dropping off, or picking up, passengers, and

(ii) does not leave the vehicle unattended, and

(iii) completes the dropping off, or picking up, of the passengers, and drives on, as soon as possible and, in any case, within 2 minutes after stopping, or

(b) the driver stops in a parking bay and the driver is permitted to stop in the parking bay under these Rules.

Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units.""

26There is nothing to take the plaintiff by surprise or cause embarrassment by the reference to this rule. Whether it succeeds or fails at the trial (the plaintiff claims that this provision does not apply to the driveway in question) is not for me to determine, as it is a matter for the trial judge or the jury. I note there is also a reference to the relevant provisions in the By-Laws that is not challenged.

27I decline to strike out this particular.

Paragraph 8.c(ii)5

28The defendant has particularised that the plaintiff had been asked ""many times"" by the Building Manager and by the defendant not to park in the driveway because it was contrary to the By-Laws. The plaintiff is seeking particulars of each time he had been asked by those persons.

29The matter complained of identifies occasions that the defendant asked the plaintiff not to park there. If there were additional occasions, these should be individually listed and the substance and (approximate) date provided.

30The occasions when the plaintiff was spoken to by the Building Manager are not within the defendant's knowledge unless the Building Manager told her about it. If she had any conversations with the Building Manager, she should set out the substance of the conversation and the date.

31The defendant should provide particulars of any additional conversations with the plaintiff not referred to in the matter complained of, and the dates and substance of her conversations with the Building Manager, in 14 days.

Paragraph 9

32No objection having been raised to the form and lack of particularisation of these imputations prior to 20 October 2014, I direct that these matters be attended to within 14 days, as offered by the defendant. Given the lack of felicity with which the pleading is drafted, the defendant should pay the costs thrown away by reason of the need to file and serve a further amended defence.

Particulars of people to whom the email was sent

33The defendant has provided the email addresses to which the email was sent, this being an email list of her neighbours. In the course of argument, it emerged that the defendant had taken this list from an email sent to her by the plaintiff; she had simply pressed the ""reply"" button and included the text of the matter complained of. 

34There are 13 apartments in this particular development. Apart from the plaintiff, the defendant and Mrs Cui (at number 23), there are only ten other relevant residents. The plaintiff himself has those names in his computer system, and is just as able as the defendant to identify them. The only order I propose to make is to require the defendant to send, to the solicitors for the plaintiff, the email from which she extracted these addresses, as I apprehend that this list of addresses may be of significance in relation to the qualified privilege defence. 

Costs

35The defendant has had a greater degree of success than the plaintiff, and the appropriate order for costs of this argument is for those to be the defendant's costs in the cause.

Orders

(1)The defendant is to file a further amended defence in 14 days particularising and pleading, in proper form, any plea of contextual truth.

(2)The defendant pay any costs thrown away by reason of the filing of the further amended defence.

(3)The defendant is to provide particulars in 14 days as follows: 

(a)Each conversation with the plaintiff in which she asked him not to park in their driveway. 

(b)The email sent by the plaintiff to the defendant to which she pressed ""reply"" for the purpose of publishing the matter complained of.

(4)Costs to be defendant's costs in the cause.

(5)Reply filed 14 days thereafter.

(6)Matter stood over to the Defamation List on Friday 28 November 2014.

		22 October 2014",2014-10-21 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765090,Freeburn v The Cake Decorators Association of NSW Inc. (No 2) [2014] NSWDC 173,"Judgment

1The defendants bring proceedings for stay or summary dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for defamation on the basis of:

(a)Sections 60, 67 and the proportionality principle (Bleyer v Google Inc [2014] NSWCA 897 at [51]); and/or

(b)Rules 12.7 and 13.4(1) of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), namely that the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious, or an abuse or process, or bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

2Alternatively, the defendants seek orders for the striking out of parts of the plaintiff's claim as follows:

(a)The plaintiff's true innuendo claim;

(b)The proceedings against one or more of the defendants. In particular, the defendants submit that the failure of the plaintiff to identify how the third defendant is a publisher has not been provided.

3The defendants further seek costs orders as follows:

(a)A prospective order capping or denying the plaintiff's entitlement to costs of these proceedings, in the event that she is successful in obtaining damages;

(b)A costs order against the plaintiff, in favour of the first and second defendants only, for the hearing on 15 August 2014 in relation to their successful challenges to the form and capacity of the imputations. I made this order on 17 October 2014, and set out below the reasons for my decision;

(c)Costs orders in relation to any portion of the pleadings (or entire claim) against a party that are struck out following the orders set out above.

4Two factors make this case unusual. The first is that the matter complained of consists of largely of the plaintiff's and third defendant's defamatory publications about the second defendant. The second is that, while the plaintiff resists summary disposal of her claim, the plaintiff and defendants have exchanged texts for apologies and the defendants have undertaken to the court to publish the apology they have drafted in the next issue of the first defendant's newsletter (""Pipeline""). Counsel for the parties agree, in relation to damages, that this case has, in Mr Dilworth's words, ""gone past"" the damages stage, in that what the plaintiff wanted was the publication of her apology rather than the apology the defendants have undertaken to provide to the court. The case has now evolved into what Mr Dilworth calls a ""battle of apologies"". 

5An additional relevant factor - one that, unfortunately, is not unusual to this particular defamation action - is that all the parties to this litigation are ordinary members of the community with limited financial means. The plaintiff has the care of a disabled child; the first defendant is a not-for-profit association of cake decorators with no assets of significance; the third defendant is on a disability pension. None of the parties has any prior experience even of litigation (let alone the complexities of defamation law), none of them has insurance, and none of the individuals receives a salary or has the kind of assets upon which to rely to pay the already significant legal fees they have incurred.

6These proceedings initially came before me for argument in relation to defects in the statement of claim: Freeburn v The Cake Decorators Association of NSW Inc. [2014] NSWDC 88. I took the step of sending the proceedings to the District Court's mediation facilities forthwith, for the reasons so eloquently expressed by Allsop ACJ in Cush v Dillon; Boland v Dillon [2010] NSWCA 165 (""Cush"") at [3]:

""It is to be hoped that the parties can see the possibility of compromise in an attempt to avoid significant further costs over such small verdicts. Compromise would avoid the risk of financial ruin to one party, or all parties, by the continuation of this litigation and would also avoid the risk of having to recognise, in due course, that all is lost save honour and life, on both sides.""

7In Cush the plaintiffs were each awarded $5,000 for a slander published to one person. The defendant, a board member tasked with investigating serious complaints about Mrs Cush which led to her dismissal, told another board member it was common knowledge Ms Cush and another board member, Mr Boland (who was married) were having an affair (cf Cairns and Morosi v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (1983) 2 NSWLR 708, where a jury found such an imputation not to be defamatory). Issues of proportionality were never raised during the three long District Court hearings and three appeals in Cush, but Allsop ACJ's observations are relevant to any proceedings where the smallness of the verdict may be out of proportion to the significant costs of continuation of the litigation.

8The parties in these proceedings have not been able to resolve the issues in these proceedings in the Court-ordered mediation. The defendants now call upon the court to use its case management powers to bring the proceedings to an end, on the basis that the cost of the proceedings is out of all proportion to the issues and remedy, in circumstances where an apology has been on offer for some time. 

9While concepts of proportionality in litigation have been viewed as inappropriate or inapplicable in the past (Barach v University of New South Wales [2011] NSWSC 431; Manefield v Child Care NSW [2010] NSWSC 1420), obiter comments in recent decisions of the High Court (Expense Reduction Analysts Group Pty Ltd v Armstrong Strategic Management and Marketing Pty Ltd (2013) 250 CLR 303 at [39]; Tajjour v New South Wales [2014] HCA 35), and as applied in Bleyer v Google Inc [2014] NSWSC 897 (sed quaere: Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 231 at [153] - [161]), are submitted to be indicators of changing judicial views.

10The burden of proof lies on the moving party, and it is a significant burden. For the purposes of this application, all the averments in the statement of claim must be assumed to be true: Ewing v Times Newspapers Ltd [2011] NIQB 63 at [32] (""Ewing""), citing O'Dwyer v Chief Constable of the RUC [1997] NI 403 at 406C. O'Dwyer's case also underlines that the summary procedure for striking out pleadings is to be used only in plain and obvious cases. In approaching such applications, the courts should be particularly cautious in any developing field of law where the court is asked to determine such points on assumed or scanty facts pleaded in the statement of claim. While evidence by affidavit may be admissible (Ewing at [35]; Cumberland v Clark (1995 - 6) 39 NSWLR 514 at 528), the facts must be construed in the plaintiff's favour, which is what I have done. 

11In practical terms, applications raising Jameel (Yousef) v Dow Jones & Co Inc [2005] QB 946 (""Jameel"") issues should not be painstaking examinations of the extent of readership or the factual evidence, but an overall (though equally careful) analysis of the parties' submissions as to whether the proceedings can hurdle the very high bar of being considered ""simply not worth the court time and costs which they entail"" (Ewing at [37]). This principle is sometimes alternatively stated as being whether ""the game is worth the candle"", a sixteenth-century gamesters' saying (based on the expense of candles, then something of a luxury, for late-night card games): Jameel at [57], citing Schellenberg v British Broadcasting Corporation [2000] EMLR 296 at 319.

The matter complained of

12The matter complained of, in the first draft of the statement of claim, was a motion moved by the second defendant, published on page 17 of Pipeline. The parties agreed, in earlier orders, to ""striking in"" the whole of the Pipeline newsletter as being the matter complained of, with the result that the ten motions moved by the plaintiff in relation to the first and third defendants appear between pages 5 - 10 as motions 5 - 15, immediately preceding the 8-line motion the parties agree was put forward by the second defendant. The matter complained of therefore consists principally of criticisms and disparaging remarks made by the plaintiff about the defendants and, to a lesser degree, by the third defendant about the first defendant. 

13While this may have been an unusual course for the parties to take (it was done by consent), it means that, unlike the matter complained of in Cush (where the other statements made by the defendant about Ms Cush and Mr Dillon were not included); the factual matrix and context of the matter complained of is therefore not in dispute, a relevant factor in this application. 

14The imputations pleaded as arising, and the costs orders made following argument as to their form and capacity, are set out later in this judgment.

Circumstances leading to the publication

15The background to the matter complained of is as follows. It is not in dispute that the plaintiff is a member of what has been referred to as an ""alternative association"" (defendants' submissions, paragraph 10), namely the Cake Decorators Guild, as well as being a member of the first defendant. According to the plaintiff's own chronology, she became dissatisfied with the conduct of the first and second defendant in 2007. A mediation at Hornsby Local Court failed to resolve the issues. A series of motions were brought by the plaintiff, second and third defendants against each other in 2012. The plaintiff complained to the Department of Fair Trading in August 2012, the same month during which the first defendant published the second defendant's motion for the plaintiff to be the subject of a lifetime membership ban. On 16 September 2012 the plaintiff sent a letter to the second defendant ""on legal advice"" (Exhibit 2, p. 2), demanding an apology and that the word ""INVALID"" be placed beside all records of the first defendant and all correspondence of the third defendant. Other committee members also sought apologies.

16The plaintiff requisitioned a Special General Meeting on 10 November 2012, according to documents provided to me on 20 October 2014 (and marked by me as Exhibit C), at which she moved four motions. The first two were to amend the Constitution to provide that if the first defendant was wound up, any surplus funds could be paid to a like minded Association, and that local branches would not have to return those surplus funds but could send them direct to this like-minded Association. The remaining two motions were for the first defendant to ""cease operation, be dissolved and wound up"" within one month of these changes to the Constitution, to permit them to take effect, and that a committee of administration (of which the plaintiff would be a member) be appointed to wind up the first defendant's affairs. The information given to the members (using the same underlining and bold text as appears in this document) and the end of these motions is as follows:

""Background information: Successive Management Committees (or parts thereof) have brought the Association into disrepute. Many years have been fraught with unrest, reprehensible conflict and mismanagement, culminating in the bogus formation of the present ""Management Committee"". The Cake Decorator's Association of NSW is operating contrary to the Association Incorporations Act of NSW 2009 No 7 [sic] and the Constitution of the Cake Decorator's Association of NSW Inc. with no resolution forthcoming.

Threats of past and pending legal actions - and divisive factions within - have forced the Association into an untenable position directly as a result of the lack of proper management. All efforts to advise successive ""Management Committee"" factions to uphold the Constitution and the Law have failed.

The noble aspirations of the Association at formation have been abused and succumbed [sic]. Now, the onerous decision is in the hands of the membership - flounder on or put the CDA to rest.

The above motions clear the way for us to move into the future in the knowledge that not all has been lost from the fruitful and happier 30 years of the Association.""

17The notice of meeting for 10 November 2012 (Exhibit C) states that the organisers were endeavouring to arrange for a Community Justice Facilitator of the Attorney General's Department to attend. However, the members voted against the resolutions, and the first defendant was not wound up, nor were its assets given to the ""like minded Association"" referred to in the motions.

18The plaintiff and her faction continued to seek publication of an apology for the second defendant's motion for a lifetime ban of the plaintiff, as published in Pipeline. By 30 December 2012, Mrs Howlett, a member clearly in the plaintiff's camp, had drafted an apology acceptable to the plaintiff. According to an email of 3 January 2013, ""Eileen [the second defendant] has been removed as president"" (Exhibit 2). The parties have informed me that the motion the second defendant brought for the expulsion of the plaintiff (which is the matter complained of) was withdrawn at the February 2013 meeting.

19On 10 January 2013, Mrs Howlett had sent the agreed apology to Pipeline for publication, but this was not published at that time, because the third defendant objected to it. By this stage there were three apologies to be published. While some of the problems arose from the typing (Exhibit 2, p. 36), the third defendant considered the apology too abject. The first defendant recorded a Minute on 7 March 2013 requiring apologies in Pipeline to five persons in addition to the plaintiff, and the text of those apologies had now been agreed.

20On 22 March 2013 a Mrs Webster, the editor of Pipeline wrote to Mrs Howlett, who was coordinating the apology correspondence, advising that the deadline for Pipeline was approaching, and that she needed a copy of the apology on letterhead, dated and signed ""as per the National letter of apology which was printed in Pipeline"" (Exhibit 2, p. 39). Mrs Howlett wrote querying this, and Mrs Webster replied on 25 March 2013:

""Lorraine, I need a copy of something on letterhead, signed. If you recall when the National apology was printed, it was on letterhead, dated and signed. I am unable to give Pipeline copies of letters that so far don't seem to exist. At this stage we are unaware of the dates of these letters of apology nor [sic] who signed them. I am following instructions as to what is to go in Pipeline."" (Exhibit 2, p. 38). 

21This step was, however, never taken by the plaintiff or by anyone on her behalf. No further requests were made by the plaintiff, or anyone, for an apology, or for publication of any apology by Pipeline. There was only what Ms Rao called ""complete radio silence"" from that time onwards. Eight months later, without a Concerns notice having been issued beforehand, the plaintiff commenced proceedings for defamation on the last day prior to the limitation period commencing. That statement of claim was served just before Christmas 2013.

The matter complained of

22The matter complained of, as attached to the current pleading, first sets out some unrelated motions, followed by the text of the plaintiff's motions (which counsel for the plaintiff agrees consists of an attack on all the defendants), appearing on pages 5 - 10 of ""Pipeline"". As was the case with the motions to wind up the first defendant (set out above), much of the text is underlined, in italics, in bold, or in a combination of these, suggestive of the possibility that these documents had the same authorship. 

23The text is as follows:

""I, Kay Freeburn, of Southern Suburbs Branch

Give notice that I will move the following motions at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 23rd February 2012.

Motion 5. That by Special Resolution the ""Term' [sic] of office for the State Committee of the CDA of N.S.W. Inc. must begin at the conclusion of the AGM in 2014, henceforth, and in accordance with the Constitution, the Term of office shall be two (2) years from the AGM 2014 and elections held, in accordance with the Constitution, every even numbered year for all State Committee positions. This change to be permanent and registered with the Department of Fair Trading until and/or unless lawfully changed by means of a Special Resolution at a General meeting of the Association in accordance with the Constitution of the CDA of N.S.W. Inc. and the Associations Incorporation Act.

Background information: The ""extension"" of the Term of office by an ordinary Motion put in 2008 was not legal. The Association is in a dire legal predicament because of the ""extension"" that did not change the Constitution of the CDA of N.S.W. Inc. (Clause 49.2) and was never registered (see CDA Clause 75.3) as per the Incorporations Act, which requires registration within 28 days of the Special Resolution being passed to change the Constitution and acknowledgment in writing from the DFT before any such change can take effect.

The amended 'Term' of office will allow Committee to be legally established between National conference years.

Motion 6. That by Special Resolution as once only event, ALL POSITIONS ON THE STATE COMMITTEE BE DECLARED VACANT at the next AGM to be held in 2013. A caretaker Committee of Management be elected by a show of hands from written submission/s signed by the nominating member/s and/or nominations taken from the floor at the postponed (2012) AGM (set to be held in 2013) to serve until the 2014 AGM and oversee the proper process for the 2014 State Committee elections, to conduct the business of the Association and to carry out such duties as prescribed by the Constitution. Such service on the caretaker Committee to be deemed as 'non-consecutive' for the 2014 elections.

This once only event must be registered within 28 days of the AGM with the Department of Fair Trading until and/or unless lawfully changed by means of a Special Resolution at a General meeting of the Association in accordance with the Constitution of the CDA of N.S.W. Inc. and the Associations Incorporations Act.

Background information: The ""extension"" of the Term of office by an ordinary Motion put in 2008 was not legal. The Association is in a dire legal predicament because of the ""extension"" that did not change the Constitution of the CDA of N.S.W. Inc. (Clause 49.2) and was never registered (see CDA Clause 75.3) as per the Incorporations Act, which requires registration within 28 days of the Special Resolution being passed to change the Constitution and acknowledgement in writing from the DFT before any such change can take effect.

The amended 'Term' of office will allow Committee to be legally established between National conference years and bring all positions into proper step with the Constitution.

Motion 7. That by Special Resolution Clause 48 of the Constitution of the CDA of N.S.W. Inc. be changed to read ""The Chairperson of an Annual General Meeting must accept motions for which no notice of motion has been received provided:""

Background information: No Chairperson should disallow or arbitrate on matters the nature of which may be otherwise prejudicial to the Association's interest. Clauses 48.1, 48.2 and 48.3 to remain unchanged.

Motion 8. That by Special Resolution the Constitution specifically prescribe the agenda for all meetings of the Cake Decorator's Association of N.S.W. Inc. to include 'General Business' and 'Any other Business'.

Background information: To permit free and open dialogue between the Membership and Committee on matters of importance to the Association be it at any level of management.

Motion 9. That by Special Resolution Clause 39.1 be amended to read: ""the Secretary shall prepare a ballot paper on the form prescribed by the By-Laws for these positions that are contested. The order of the names appearing on the ballot paper shall be decided by lot conducted by the Secretary, assisted by the Registrar, at a State Committee meeting.""

Background information: The lot must be open to scrutiny and conducted by accountable members to provide every possible assurance regarding the validity of the lot.

Motion 10. That by Special Resolution: The Constitution Clause 39.4 be amended or incorporated to read ""Clause 39.4.1 'The Ballot Paper' shall consist of one or more sheets of paper officially printed with positions contested and nominees names with corresponding boxes to be numbered by the voter.

39.4.2 A vote shall be exercised by placing a sequential number in the box against the name of each and every nominee in order of preference beginning with number one (1) for most preferred candidate in each position contested.

39.4.3 Each position contested will have a separate set of boxes, one against each nominee for that position and preference will again begin with number one (1) (most preferred) ending with the highest number for the candidate least preferred for that position.

39.4.4 Any error in the numbering sequence for any position contested will VOID THE ENTIRE BALLOT PAPER and no vote or preference for any candidate in any position contested will be recorded for that voter. A mistake can be corrected by a cross (X) through the box and the desired number clearly written beside the box.

39.4.5 Instructions on HOW TO VOTE and HOW VOTES WILL BE COUNTED are to be printed with the Ballot Paper in Pipeline giving specific instructions and an example of 'How to vote'.""

Background: Treatment of votes in the 2010 election was different from any other year. Members were not informed of that different method - which still is not clear. Members need to know how to vote and how their votes are counted to have confidence in the election process and avoid uncertainty regarding the validity of the system.

Motion 11. That by Special Resolution: The Membership of the CDA of N.S.W. Inc. instruct the State Committee to advise Mrs. Eileen Manning, Mrs. Pauline Simpson and Ms. Wendy Simpson that they must show reason why they should not be censured/disciplined as per Clauses 17, 17.1 & 17.2 at the next General Meeting of the Association.

Reasons: The CDA of N.S.W. Inc. has been brought into disrepute because...

1. Mesdames Manning and Simpson and Ms. Simpson refused, without notice, to attend a property convened State Committee Meeting called by Mrs. Manning, of which due notice had been given to all State Committee members. At this meeting NO BUSINESS could be conducted with the exception of appointing Mrs. Lyn Hammond to a vacant State Committee position as per Clause 59.1.

2. Mesdames Manning and Simpson and Ms. Simpson held three (3) unconstitutional meetings (claiming them to be State Committee meetings) held within two (2) days without the required seven (7) full days notification from the proper Secretary, Mrs. Sylvia Fitch, and without informing all State Committee Members.

3. Mesdames Manning, Simpson and Ms. Simpson, with Mrs. Vivian Heaton's knowledge, WITHOUT A QUORUM then ""dismissed"" the duly elected and nominated State Committee members. Mrs. Hammond has not been notified of her official and correct appointment, any meetings nor her ""dismissal"".

4. Ms. Simpson 'usurped' the position of ""Secretary"" without authority and without the required registration notification to the DFT breaching CDA of N.S.W. Inc. Constitution (14 days) (Clauses 75, 75.1) and the Act (28 days). (The position of Secretary is still in dispute and the circumstances have been resubmitted to, and are under investigation by, the Department of Fair Trading.)

5. Since the 'bogus' State Committee formation until November 2012, Mrs. Lorraine Howlett had not received any notification of State Committee meetings nor had she received, as requested, minutes of any such meetings yet Mrs. Manning has stated that Mrs. Howlett is still a member of the Committee.

6. Letter dated 8th February, 2012, to all CDA Branch Secretaries, with Mrs. Manning and Ms. Simpson named on CDA letterhead, publicly states, without substantiating evidence, emails and letters from State Committee members including Mrs. Howlett ""are not only threatening but also trying to blackmail the remaining committee members into resigning or running the association contrary to our constitution."".

7. The 'bogus' State Committee have [sic] unconstitutionally called Mrs. Sylvia Fitch and Mrs. Kay Freeburn to show reason why their memberships should not be rescinded. These actions are without substance, are untra [sic] vires (beyond the power of the 'bogus' State Committee) and therefore leave the CDA open to legal ramifications.

8. Mrs. Manning has threatened Mrs. Fitch with legal action for Mrs. Fitch replying to the allegations printed against her.

9. The 'bogus' State Committee has not addressed the many legal issues still hanging over the Association.

10. Though he does not say he represents her, Mrs. Manning has instructed a solicitor (a ""good friend and neighbour"") to write letters stating that correspondence in regard to Association business is to be sent to him. She has stated that she has involved a next-door neighbour in matters of the business of our Association.

11. The State Committee, under President Manning, without valid reason refused to accept nor publish nomination/s from financial member/s for positions to be contested in the 2012 elections thus denying the member/s rights and denying the membership a choice of candidate/s thus rendering the whole election unconstitutional and/or the Committee action ultra vires.

12. The State Committee, under President Manning, without valid reason refused to accept nor publish valid Motions to be put to the AGM.

13. Mrs. Manning used obscene language to a member on the telephone -independently witnessed by non members [sic]. Not only is this unbecoming of the position of President, who representing the members, but also brings the Association into disrepute.

14. Mrs. Manning and Mrs. Simpson with Ms. Simpson are in acrimonious conflict and unable to put aside personal differences for the good of the Association. None is acting in the best interests of the membership and the State Committee is crippled and dysfunctional to the point of implosion. The Association has been brought into disrepute and is under constant legal threats.

Background: There has been demonstrated self interest, breaches of the Constitution and the Act (2009), unsubstantiated accusations and cringe-worthy correspondence representing the Membership. The membership should be shocked and disappointed in these actions as we were expecting clear, legal amendment of past wrongs and genuine, trustworthy, proficient and open management to promote and progress our craft of cake decorating and our Association.

Motion 12. That by Special Resolution the Draft Constitution be amended and the following section be removed: (Clause unknown) ""Disciplining of Members. A complaint may be made to the Committee by any person that a member of the Association, is acting in a manner prejudicial to the interest of the Association or its members. The Committee will take such action, as deemed appropriate, including suspension or termination of membership. 8.1 If the Committee expels or suspends a member, the Secretary must, within 7 days after the action is taken, cause written notice to be given to the member of the action taken, of the reasons given by the Committee for having taken that action and of the members' right of appeal under Clause 9.""

Background information: This section is inherently unfair and unjust, it is ludicrous that any 'person' (including non-members) can cause the expulsion of a Member. That Member will not be informed until AFTER the event and be presumed 'guilty' before being able to defend any accusation. Every Member will be at the mercy of any unscrupulous group or individual of acrimonious character. CDA [sic].

Clause 17 (proposed for amendment) deals with discipline.

Motion 13. That the draft Constitution be withheld until a new Constitutional Sub-committee can be formed and the draft re-checked and/or reformulated by that Sub-committee.

Each Branch to receive a copy of the adjusted Draft No, 2. All proper amendments received from members or branches are to be incorporated into Draft No. 2 and approved or rejected at the 2013 Delegates meeting. The New Constitution must be ratified by the membership at a General meeting or the 2014 AGM (whichever occurs first) and be registered with the DFT before coming into effect.

Background information: The Constitutional Sub-Committee does not exist as it has run the allowable 12 months permitted by the Constitution but has not finalised a workable Constitution. Amendments were proposed as soon as the draft was distributed and many amendments have been put since then. To save money, time and effort, each branch must have the opportunity to input and the Draft Constitution should be clarified as soon as possible to avoid misinterpretation and constant amendment. The New Constitution must be just and fair, as well as being unambiguous, easy to understand and implement, be in the best interests of the membership, protect the membership at all times, represent the Association and conform with the Association's Incorporation Act 2009 (No. 7) and any other legal requirement.

Motion 14. That by Special Resolution Clause 39.2 be expanded to read: 'the Secretary shall prepare a list, in alphabetical order, of all candidates for all positions who have supplied a personal resume in accordance with Clause 38 including brief biographical details of the candidates supplied from the personal resume. Each position must have the name of the candidate/s printed next to that position even if the candidate is the only candidate and will be elected unopposed.""

Background information: Members must know who is running for positions on our State Committee, [sic] Any anonymous candidate declared ""Elected unopposed"" before, during or after voting is unacceptable.

Motion 15. That the State Committee of the CDA of N.S.W. Inc., apologise in writing - unreservedly - to Mrs. Marian Jones, Mrs. Sylvia Fitch and Mrs. Kay Freeburn for the unconstitutional and ultra vires attempts to expel each of them.

Background information: The Association is under threat of legal action because of the incorrect manner these expulsion attempts were performed by the State Committee or parts thereof.

[I have not set out Motions 16 and 17 are motions to withdraw the life membership of another member, Mrs Marian Jones, for ""acting in a manner unbecoming"" and failing to produce invoices, misleading the membership and other matters. Counsel for the plaintiff did not know who had moved these motions. 

Motion 18 is a motion by a Mrs Margaret Vidler for the second defendant to be censured/disciplined on 10 grounds.

Motion 19 is a motion by the third defendant for the second defendant to be censured/disciplined on 17 grounds.]""

24The next item on the agenda is the State Committee's motion about the plaintiff, drafted by the second defendant, which is the subject matter relied upon by the plaintiff as giving rise to the imputations. This unnumbered motion, containing many misspellings and grammar errors (unlike the August 2012 motion), is as follows:

""I [sic] State Committee of NSW give notice that I will move the following motion to be held on the 23rd February 2013:

That Mrs Kay Freeburn be expelled as a member from the Association at teh [sic] 2012 AGM and not allowed to rejoin the Association as a member.Reason For [sic] continually bombarding memebes [sic] with letters for her personal agenda. For committing acts that bring the Association into disrepute - for failure to follow the Constitution. For accusing the State committee of mal-administration and suppling NO proof of this. For causing members distress by her repeated letters to them and brenaches [sic]. Failure to give good reason why the Committee should not rescind her membership.""

The imputations

25The parties asked me to rule upon the imputations as arising only from the portion of the matter complained of which consists of the first defendant's motion: [2014] NSWDC 88. The revised statement of claim contained further errors which were corrected by the plaintiff's legal representatives in consultation with the defendants' counsel, Ms Rao. The imputations currently pleaded are:

(a)That the plaintiff made allegations of maladministration by committee members of the first defendant when she had no evidence of such allegations.

(b)That the plaintiff is a nuisance and a troublemaker who does not provide proof of her allegations of maladministration by committee members of the first defendant.

(c)[Deleted]

(d)That the plaintiff does not act fairly.

(e)That the plaintiff has a personal agenda which is not in the best interests of the first defendant.

(f)That the plaintiff has damaged the first defendant's reputation.

(g)That the plaintiff has acted outside the bounds of the constitution of the first defendant.

(h)That the conduct of the plaintiff was so serious that it deserved a lifetime ban from being a member of the first defendant.

The true innuendo plea

26The plaintiff alternatively brings a true innuendo plea as follows:

""10. On or about August 2012 the First Defendant published the August 2012 edition of Pipeline magazine (The August Pipeline).

11. The August Pipeline (on page 8) contained the following:

""Motion 4

The State Committee give notice to move the following motion at the Annual General Meeting that: Mrs Kay Freeburn be expelled as a member from the Association at the 2012 AGM and not allowed to join the Association as a member.

Reasons: For continually annoying members with letters for her personal agenda for committing acts that bring the Association into disrepute - for failure to follow the constitution. For accusing the State Committee of maladministration and supplying NO proof of this. For causing members distress by her repeated letters to them and branches. For failure to give good reason why the Committee should not rescind her membership"" (""the extrinsic facts"")

12. The Plaintiff says that the extrinsic facts were known to those whom the matter complained of was published and would lead a reasonable person knowing the facts to conclude that the words in the matter complained of have defamatory meaning.""

27The defendants' challenge to this pleading is set out in more detail below.

The aggravated damages claim

28The plaintiff pleaded the following particulars of aggravated damages:

(a)The plaintiff's knowledge of the falsity of the imputations;

(b)The conduct of the defendants in publishing the matter complained of without giving the plaintiff any opportunity to respond to the allegations being published about her;

(c)The defendant's [sic] extravagant and sensational description of the actions of the plaintiff;

(d)The plaintiff advised the defendant [sic] by letter dated 16 September 2012 that she considered that matter published by the first defendant in the August 2012 edition of ""Pipeline"" which matter was substantially the same as the matter complained of to be defamatory and, by way of a written notice invited the defendant [sic] to issue an apology and retraction;

(e)The defendant [sic] has failed to make any apology or retraction, or any other form of offer of amends to the plaintiff.

(f)The defendant [sic] after receipt of the notice referred to in paragraph e) above substantially repeated the matter published by the first defendant in the August 2012 edition of ""Pipeline"" being the matter complained of.

29These particulars are deficient. The particulars in relation to the apology are conceded to be incorrect and to require repleading, and the identity of each of the defendants needs to be set out with precision. However, this is a minor matter in these proceedings.

The current state of the pleadings

30After the defendants succeeded in having a number of the imputations struck out in the hearing on 4 July 2014, they were awarded costs. The repleaded statement of claim was challenged and the matter listed for argument on 15 August 2014. 

31The argument was resolved on 15 August 2014 by the plaintiff further amending the statement of claim to incorporate the defendants' objections. Ms Rao told the court on that day, in relation both to the true innuendo plea and the proceedings generally, that she was seeking instructions to bring an application for summary dismissal application on proportionality principles, as well as to challenge the true innuendo plea. 

32After hearing from both parties in the course of this application as to the costs of 15 August, I made orders on 15 October 2014 that the plaintiff should bear the costs thrown away in relation to the argument which was to take place on that day, indicating that I would give reasons for so doing in this judgment. 

33My reasons for doing so are that the redrafted imputations still included rolled-up pleas (such as imputation (b)), imputation (h) has now been repleaded twice and, while imputation (f) (which is new) was not challenged, this was only because it was new, and a party seeking leave to amend a pleading generally pays the costs thrown away by reason of the amendment. The timetable provided for the plaintiff to supply particulars of the true innuendo pleading; this was never done, and the true innuendo plea (discussed in more detail below) is misconceived.

34This was the plaintiff's second attempt, and the correcting of some of these errors (including correction of factual errors in the aggravated damages claim) will require the filing of a further statement of claim. As the first and second defendants (who took carriage of the argument) were substantially successful in their second challenge to the statement of claim, for these reasons, they should be entitled to a second costs order in their favour. 

35The first and second defendants have therefore now successfully obtained two costs orders in relation to the statement of claim, and a further pleading will have to be filed. Additionally, as Ms Rao reminds the court, the basis upon which the third defendant is asserted to be liable for the publication has never been stated; this is one of the reasons for Ms Rao and Mr Hogg submitting the claim against her should be struck out. 

36The fact that the plaintiff will have to file a fourth pleading and has incurred costs orders is regrettable, but not an issue warranting striking out of proceedings on any proportionality basis. Only in the most extreme cases (of which Ewing is an example) would such a step be taken. The issues relevant to proportionality in these proceedings do not arise from the procedural history but from the issues set out below. 

Issues relevant to proportionality

37The parties raised the following issues in relation to proportionality:

(a)The real issue in defamation proceedings should be vindication of reputation. Ms Rao submits that the nature of the plaintiff's vindication is apparent from the full text of the matter complained of (including her own motions), and that the subject matter of these proceedings, if set out in a judgment, will do none of the parties anything but harm. Additionally, she submits that the conduct of the plaintiff (as set out in the motions in the matter complained of) indicate that the plaintiff is not motivated by vindication but by vendetta: Wallis v Valentine [2002] EWCA Civ 1034. Mr Dilworth submits his client should have her day in court to vindicate her reputation. Principles of proportionality have no part to play in defamation litigation in Australia, and every litigant, including the plaintiff, has the right to proceed with their claim up to a hearing, no matter how poor those prospects appear. Those few cases where proportionality has been considered relevant in the United Kingdom all relate to publications to very few persons, whereas in Australia many cases of publication to one person only (of which Cush is one) have been the subject of consideration in the High Court and Court of Appeal without any curial comment to the effect that a publication to one person was disproportionate to the costs involved.

(b)The costs of hearing this case should be considered. Mr Dilworth submitted that the costs of the hearing would be moderate: he suggested $45,000 - $50,000 (on the basis of a 3-day hearing). Ms Rao advises that the defendants will plead defences of qualified privilege (including reply to an attack), honest opinion and unlikelihood of harm. It is possible that the defendants may bring a cross-claim of some kind against the plaintiff (O'Neill v Foster (2004) 61 NSWLR 499; Green v Schneller (Supreme Court of NSW, Levine J, 18 March 1998)), or seek a jury trial. The separately represented third defendant will need to seek a determination as to liability for publication. Ms Rao estimates that the hearing could exceed three weeks, and the total legal costs for all represented parties (including the separate costs of the third defendant) would be in excess of $300,000, a figure comparable to the hearing costs in Bleyer v Google Inc.By way of comparison, in Bodenstein v Hope Street Urban Compassion [2014] NSWDC 126, the parties told me that the defendants' costs of a three-day hearing on qualified privilege issues for two publications to one person (resulting in judgment for the defendants) were in excess of $100,000. Admittedly those costs were largely incurred in the Supreme Court, where costs are higher, but the informality of the proceedings due to the plaintiff being self-represented and the failure of the second defendant to take any active part should have reduced those costs. As is set out in that judgment, those costs were a very significant burden for a charity providing help to marginalised, homeless and disadvantaged persons. Even ordinary working families in Australia cannot afford legal fees of this magnitude. In the present case, the lack of income and assets of all of the parties to meet legal costs is of particular concern.

(c)As to success at the hearing, the case against the first defendant (which is conceded to have an obligation to publish all motions under its Constitution, including the plaintiff's) is submitted to be hopeless, due to the exceptional nature of the content of the matter complained of and the first defendant's obligation to publish motions to its members. The basis upon which the third defendant is sued has never been articulated and the submissions Ms Rao makes (supported by Mr Hogg, for the third defendant) are that this claim should be struck out. These submissions are discussed in more detail below.

(d)As to compensation, the parties want orders in relation to apologies which the court cannot, absent their consent, impose. This court can only award damages, which in the present case might be not merely nominal but derisory, given the nature of the matter complained of, the history of offers of apology and the delay in bringing these proceedings. If the defendants breach their undertaking to apologise, an application for specific performance (albeit in another forum) would have to be made (in Summertime Holdings Pty Ltd v Environmental Defender's Office Ltd (Supreme Court of NSW, Young J, 16 October 1998) the application was refused on discretionary grounds and the defendants instead ordered to pay the plaintiff $10,000), but hopefully the defendants will honour their undertaking. The plaintiff could, of course, make a statement in open court, which Kate Winslet did after settling defamation proceedings for an article criticising her exercise regime: Winslet v Associated Newspapers Inc [2009] EWHC 2735. However, the plaintiff does not need to go to a hearing to do so; she can follow Ms Winslet's example and do so after publication of the apology.

(e)Ms Rao submits that, if an apology is sufficient, the plaintiff already has that remedy. The defendants have undertaken to the court to publish the open apology they have made in the next issue of Pipeline. The plaintiff is satisfied with receipt of an apology as opposed to seeking damages, but insists the apology should be additionally sent to the home addresses of all former members, and wants a relatively minor change of wording. Assuming the court could make such an order, this is not a basis for the continuation of these proceedings to hearing.

(f)As noted above, both sides are seek costs, which are already substantial. Despite her lack of success in the interlocutory proceedings to date, the plaintiff's legal representatives claim their costs are $30,000. The defendants say they have been successful in two costs applications and that they should keep those costs, as they have made a Calderbank offer which was rejected by the plaintiff. Those arguments are set out in more detail below. 

The principle of proportionality

38I do not propose to set out a discussion of the case law considered by McCallum J in Bleyer v Google Inc. Her Honour, applying Jameel, held (at [51]) that disproportionality was a species of abuse of process, and that s 67 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) could properly be exercised to stay or strike out proceedings where the claim involved was vastly disproportionate to the interests at stake and to the resources of the court and the parties. 

39Although Bleyer v Google Inc is the first time a court of record has made such an order on Jameel principles, the defendants draw to my attention the obiter remarks of the High Court in Expense Reduction Analysts Group Pty Ltd v Armstrong Strategic Management and Marketing Pty Ltd at [39]:

""[39] Speaking of what the case management provisions in the CPR might mean for the conduct of litigation, in Jameel (Yousef) v Dow Jones & Co Inc the Court of Appeal explained that:

It is no longer the role of the court simply to provide a level playing field and to referee whatever game the parties choose to play upon it. The court is concerned to ensure that judicial and court resources are appropriately and proportionately used in accordance with the requirements of justice.

Earlier, in Biguzzi v Rank Leisure Plc, Lord Woolf MR had doubted that authorities decided under the old procedure could continue to be binding or even persuasive."" (Footnotes omitted)

40The issue in Expense Reduction Analysts Group Pty Ltd v Armstrong Strategic Management and Marketing Pty Ltd related to inadvertent disclosure of a privileged document, and not to a dismissal application. The defendants submit that these statements amount to a general judicial indication of the importance of the proportionate use of finite judicial resources in accordance with the requirements of justice. 

41Similar principles apply to restrictions imposed by statute on freedom of expression, where a somewhat differently expressed proportionality test may involve consideration of the effects of the purported exercise of that power upon common law rights and freedoms: Tajjour v New South Wales at [29] per French CJ, citing Davis v Commonwealth (1988) 166 CLR 79. However, none of the members of the High Court referred to the particular Jameel proportionality principle and, additionally, care was taken to distinguish Australian tests of legislative proportionality with the categories of scrutiny employed by the Supreme Court in the United States of America (at [131] per Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) and Canada (at [150] per Gageler J). Nevertheless, it is arguable that proportionality issues may be relevant to the exercise of freedom of speech, and thus to the law of defamation generally.

42As the sole issue remaining after the terms of the apology have been agreed would be the appropriate order for legal costs, the defendants also rely upon costs decisions where Jameel principles have been referred to with approval (Grizonic v Suttor [2008] NSWSC 914 and Vizovitis v Ryan [2012] ACTSC 155). The principle of proportionality of costs is set out in s 60 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW): April Fine Paper Macao Commercial Offshore Ltd v Moore Business Systems Australia Ltd (2009) 75 NSWLR 619 at [1]. Proportionality is also relevant to case management of defamation proceedings: Practice Note No SC CL 4, Supreme Court Common Law Division - Defamation List (5 September 2014). However, as I note below, it is hard to see how proportionality of costs can be applied in defamation given the carving out of costs considerations in defamation proceedings in UCPR r 42.34, which appears to be at odds with the Defamation List Practice Note and s 60. Given this apparent conflict, I must be particularly cautious when considering costs issues in relation to a claim of disproportionality in costs for defamation proceedings.

43Most importantly, any application of the principles set out in Jameel to summary judgment applications in Australia is novel. Additionally, for many years prior to Jameel, English courts, including appellate courts, were expressing very different views about proportionality and costs issues (see, for example, Safeway Stores Plc v Tate [2001] QB 1120) and courts in other common law jurisdictions remain reluctant to use summary judgment procedures to strike out defamation actions or defences (see, for example, Casses v Canadian Broadcasting Corp [2012] BCSC 18). Issues of proportionality will inevitably overlap with more traditionally-based reasons for summary dismissal, and where those reasons exist, those reasons for determination should, in my view, be preferred.

44Mr Dilworth submits that these proceedings in no way resemble the facts in Bleyer v Google Inc, as Pipeline has a circulation of several hundred persons in New South Wales, and there is no certainty that any of the proposed defences will succeed. He submitted that proportionality issues could not arise unless the extent of publication was very limited, and referred to Mardas v International Herald Tribune [2008] All ER (D) 184 at [11] - [12], where Eady J noted Gray J's observations that Schellenberg v British Broadcasting Corporation turned on it own ""unusual facts"". In Mardas, there was publication in print and online to several hundred people, but the crucial point was that the facts were contested (the defendant had pleaded justification) and thus unsuitable for summary dismissal. Where there is no evidence at all as to liability for publication (as is the case with the third defendant) or where the unusual nature of the matter complained of shows the first defendant's obligations to publish all the parties' defamatory motions against each other, the issue of the extent of publication has far less relevance to the summary disposal of proceedings.

45However, a different view was taken in Ewing (see also Ewing v Times Newspapers Ltd [2008] CSOH 169). Mr Ewing's proceedings were in fact struck out as an abuse of process notwithstanding the mass media nature of the publication, with the court referring approvingly to the ""robust"" case management approach in Schellenberg, stressing the importance of case management rules as set out in Jameel at [55], and approving Wallis v Valentine, the decision principally relied upon by Ms Rao. 

46The importance of the application of principles of proportionality in Wallis v Valentine lies in its use of proportionality to curb a claim where the damages were extremely modest, the parties were neighbours, and the purpose of the litigation was not vindication of reputation but a vendetta. Ms Rao submits that all these reasons apply here. The undisputed chronology shows that these parties have been in dispute for some years, and that the plaintiff has given as well as taken criticism; in fact, looking at all the motions set out in the matter complained of, the defendants appear to have come off second-best in the matter complained of. 

47Ms Rao also points to the low level of seriousness of imputations relating to the management of a cake-decorating organisation. While the matter complained of may be capable of conveying defamatory imputations, these should be put at the bottom of the range. The imputations are only a little higher, in terms of seriousness, than the imputations of disdaining vegetarianism that were struck out as not being defamatory in Ecclestone v Telegraph Media Group Ltd [2009] EWHC 2779, a decision in part based on observations about the Jameel principle. 

48Ms Rao also submits that there are significant parts of the claim which are hopeless; if these were to be struck out, this should be a factor in the dismissal of the case as a whole, on the basis that to permit the claim to go forward would be to try to unscramble the omelette. These pleadings are:

(a)The true innuendo plea;

(b)The claim for aggravated compensatory damages (with leave to replead); and

(c)The claims against the first and third defendants.


49Finally, if the proceedings (or part thereof) were to survive the proportionality argument, the defendants' alternative application for prospective costs-capping orders arises for consideration.

The true innuendo plea

50A ""true"" innuendo arises solely from facts or circumstances not apparent on the face of the publication, which give the words a special meaning they would not ordinarily have: Yelash v In Print Publishing Co [1972] NZLR 83 at 85 per Richmond J; Grubb v Bristol United Press Ltd [1963] 1 QB 309 at 328 - 9 per Pearce LJ. For example, in Cairns v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd, a newspaper reported that Mr Cairns' ""girlfriend"" informed a third party that Mr Cairns (the Treasurer at the time) could not see him. The matter complained of was not defamatory on its face, but both Mr Cairns and the ""girlfriend"" were married. Those facts supported the innuendo that the plaintiff and the ""girlfriend"" were having an adulterous affair (a jury found the imputation was conveyed but not defamatory).

51The true innuendo pleaded in these proceedings is defective, for a number of reasons:

(a)While a defamatory meaning may be drawn both by way of reliance on the natural and ordinary meaning of the words and by way of innuendo (Random House Australia Pty Ltd v Abbott (1999) 167 ALR 224 at 232), if the words complained of are defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning, no innuendo is necessary. In those circumstances, no innuendo should be pleaded, as ""what the ordinary man will infer from those words ...does not require the addition...of an innuendo"" (Dougherty v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [1969] 1 NSWR 189 at 192 per Asprey JA).

(b)An innuendo is a defamatory meaning arising by inference or implication, and its office is not to add a meaning that is not otherwise there. In particular, the fact that the same publication has been made more than once, with the same imputations pleaded as arising in each, cannot be relied upon to give rise to an imputation which would not otherwise arise. The meanings asserted to arise from the true innuendo pleaded here are exactly the same meanings as already pleaded, on the global basis that any reader who had also read the August 2012 publication would, somehow be more likely to accept that the imputations were all conveyed. Other than in special circumstances (such as book serialisations), imputations may not be pleaded as arising from more than one publication.

(c)The plaintiff's claim for defamation arising out of the August 2012 publication was struck out as time-barred, and the true innuendo plea appears to be a way of circumventing this ruling to create a new cause of action; a true innuendo, if established, may give rise to a separate cause of action: Marley's Transport Pty Ltd v West Australian Newspapers Ltd [2001] WASC 31 at [18].

(d)The basis upon which any person who read the same publication in the August 2012 issue would be likely to consider, for some unexplained reason, that the publication in the November 2012 issue therefore conveyed the imputations, is both unparticularised and unexplained.

(e)If what is intended is a false innuendo plea, a false innuendo cannot introduce new matter to render certain words which would otherwise have been uncertain (Readers Digest Services Pty ltd v Lamb (1982) 56 ALJR 214 at 216). In Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd [1964] AC 234 at 274 Lord Hodson explained:

""There is one cause of action based on the words in their natural and ordinary meaning and another based on the words in such meaning as may be alleged in a true innuendo, but not a third cause of action based on the false innuendo.""

52Mr Dilworth did not identify the facts, matters and circumstances which could give rise to the true innuendo plea, beyond making the observation that the ordinary reasonable reader would be more likely to believe the imputations were, as a group, conveyed if the matter complained of had been published before. 

53The true innuendo plea is misconceived and should be struck out on traditional principles of law. 

54Ms Rao further submitted that such a plea should be struck out on proportionality principles, in that the complexity of the plea would add considerable complexity to the trial. It is not necessary for me to do so. The true innuendo plea is hopeless and should be struck out for the reasons set out above. It does not, however, augur well for the cost and duration of the trial that such unnecessarily complicated, and baseless, pleas are included in the statement of claim.

The claims against the first and third defendants

55Paragraph 17 of the first defendant's Constitution requires it to publish all motions. The feature of the matter complained of which is unique to this case is that the first defendant has therefore published everyone's motion about everyone else. The plaintiff's motions call for a ""spill"", call for the first and third defendants and indeed the whole Board to be removed forthwith, complain of mismanagement by them, refer to the defendants as being under investigation by the Department of Fair Trading, and make a wide range of claims of their having acted ultra vires and irresponsibly. Motions by the third defendant and others call for the second defendant to be removed from office. On what basis could the second defendant's motion not also have been published?

56The real issue, in relation to the first defendant, is whether malice can be sheeted home in relation to qualified privilege at common law and, in relation to s 30 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW), whether publication fulfils some or all of the items in the s 30(3) checklist for reasonableness. Given the obligation of the first defendant to publish all motions, and the content of the matter complained of (in particular the motions of the plaintiff and the third defendant about the first defendant) this must be that rare and exceptional case where the prospects of the plaintiff's success in relation to those defences is very small indeed. The question is whether the smallness of those prospects of success is, on principles of proportionality, so slight that the proceedings are ""simply not worth the court time and costs which they entail"" (Ewing at [37]).

57On the exceptional facts in this case, it is my view that the claim brought by the plaintiff against the first defendant is not worth the court time and effort, taking into account the factors set out above. Publication in Pipeline of all the motions - not just the plaintiff's motions - was required. Mr Dilworth's submission that this motion should not have been published because it was ""more serious"" is misconceived.

58As to the second defendant, while I accept Ms Rao's submission that she may have a strong case in terms of reply to attack, disputed issues of fact about malice are not appropriate for summary dismissal, in much the same way that disputed issues of fact about justification should not be determined on such applications other than in exceptional circumstances of the kind that occurred in Schellenberg (Mardas, supra, at [11] - [12]). There is no proportionality basis for striking out the claim brought against the second defendant, although the reduction of the litigation to a claim by the plaintiff against the second defendant only may give rise to other proportionality issues, discussed below.

59This brings me to the third defendant. There is nothing in the statement of claim identifying with precision how she is liable for the publication of the matter complained of, beyond a reference to her being a member of the Board of the first defendant (indeed, paragraph 6 of the current pleading refers only to publication by ""the defendant"" [sic]).

60The plaintiff has been on notice for some time as to the absence of particulars of publication by the third defendant. No particulars have been forthcoming and the claim against the third defendant should accordingly be struck out.

61If these proceedings go ahead in some revised form, against the second defendant only, what should the position be in relation to costs? 

Proportionality and costs-capping orders

62At first blush, an application by a party at the early stages of the litigation to cap or deny an opponent costs may seem precipitate. However, such applications should be brought at an early stage: see the cases discussed in G E Dal Pont, ""Law of Costs"", (3rd ed., LexisNexis, Australia) at [7.42] - [7.49], although retrospective applications in relation to defamation claims have been successful: Jones v Sutton (No 2) [2005] NSWCA 203.

63The first case to consider an application to cap costs was Re Sherborne Estate (No 2); Vanvalen v Neaves (2005) 65 NSWLR 268, where Palmer J explained the operation of UCPR 42.4 as follows:

""[26] I conclude that the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules, r 42.4, is intended as a means whereby the Court may, if the need arises, curb the tendency of one or all parties to engage in disproportionate expenditure on legal costs by making it clear, at an early stage of the proceedings, that beyond a certain limit theparties will have to bear their own costs - win or lose.

[27] Parties to disputes which are fuelled by personal animosity - Family Provision Act applications are a prime example - are sometimes carried away by the desire to vindicate their positions publicly in a court of justice. Such parties insist on marshalling every conceivable issue in support of their case and on rebutting with unnecessary particularity every passing suggestion madeby the other side. Unfortunately, legal practitioners are not always resolute enough to rein in those desires on the part of their clients.""

64Palmer J went on to note that proportionality of costs was ""central to the just and efficient conduct of civil proceedings"". His Honour considered earlier decisions apparently to the contrary, such as Jvancich v Kennedy (No 2) [2004] NSWCA 397 (at [6]), were in fact merely underscoring the undesirability of such orders being made at the end of the proceedings; the time for making such orders was ""early in case management, whenever it appears that the parties' litigious fervour may be leading them to excessive expenditure of costs"", a view endorsed by Sackville A-JA in Nicholls v Michael Wilson & Partners Ltd (No 2) [2013] NSWCA 141 at [24].

65The balancing process to be undertaken by the court is a difficult one. I note the conflicting views in Delta Electricity v Blue Mountains Conservation Society Inc [2010] NSWCA 263 by Beazley JA at [134] - [168] and by Basten JA at [216] - [219] (with whom Macfarlan JA concurred, dismissing the appeal from a costs cap of $20,000).

66Other than in Family Provision Act proceedings (see Tchadovitch v Tchadovitch (2010) 79 NSWLR 491 at [88]), such orders are rarely made. Ms Rao referred to Jones v Sutton (No 2), where orders were made retrospectively due to the massive disproportion between the cost (over $1 million) and the remedy ($5,000), and to the denial of trial or appeal costs to a successful plaintiff in Bristow v Adams [2012] NSWCA 166 at [16] - [18]. However, these decisions essentially turn on their own facts, as Dal Pont notes at [17.81]. 

67Additionally, proportionality as a basis for costs issues in defamation proceedings may be contrary to UCPR r 42.34, given the carving out of defamation actions from its provisions as long ago as 2003: see Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc v McGuire [2014] NSWSC 1370 at [15]. Nor can the provisions of UCPR r 42.35 apply, as the Local Court has no jurisdiction to hear defamation proceedings.

68The principal difficulty with a cap on costs is that, as Ms Rao points out, it will not benefit anybody. No cap will help, whether for zero costs or the sum the plaintiff's legal advisers were asking for in earlier negotiations ($30,000); the defendants would have to pay two sets of lawyers for a hearing which Ms Rao estimates at up to four weeks and, even if successful, their chances of recovering any money from the plaintiff are unknown, and would involve a lengthy costs assessment. All that is certain, if costs are capped, is that all parties to the proceedings would be worse off. Accordingly, I do consider an order for the capping of costs should be made.

The balancing exercise

69I am satisfied that there is no evidence of the basis upon which the third defendant is the publisher of the matter complained of, and that the case against the first plaintiff (which is obliged by its Constitution to publish all members' motions) is close to hopeless. The plaintiff's current statement of claim is deficient and the true innuendo claim must be struck out.

70Additionally, in relation to all defendants, these are proceedings where the unusual nature of the matter complained of and the history between the parties fall squarely within the confines of the principles discussed in Wallis v Valentine. The costs of these proceedings, even if only one defendant remains, is grossly disproportionate to the issue of vindication of the plaintiff's reputation. The plaintiff is already at risk as to the two costs orders against her in relation to the statement of claim. 

71This brings me to the issue of the costs consequences that will flow from my orders. Whether or not proportionality issues arise, the plaintiff's claims against the first and third defendants must be struck out. It seems likely, given the resourcefulness of the defendants, that their next step will be to seek orders under s 67 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) for the staying of these proceedings until such time as interlocutory costs (if payable forthwith, as discussed in Ritchie's Uniform Civil Procedure (NSW) (LexisNexis) at [s.67.40]) and/or costs for dismissed proceedings (see [s 67.35]) are paid. Those costs could outweigh damages to be awarded to the plaintiff, and the modest nature of those damages may also put her at risk as to costs of these proceedings, if successful in achieving a damages award. 

72These proceedings would also be a burden upon the court. Mr Dilworth has already asked me to make orders for a second court-facilitated mediation, but the free mediation services of this court cannot be burdened by repeat requests of this nature. Nor should other litigants be obliged to wait while these proceedings take valuable court resources and time to deal with issues arising from a dispute which, on the plaintiff's own uncontradicted evidence, demonstrates a vendetta rather than a vindication of reputation.

73What all these parties need is finality of the dispute between them, upon suitable acknowledgments being made by the defendants, and in an atmosphere of compromise. On the one hand, the plaintiff may have a claim of modest proportions against the second defendant (although what that may be in damages terms, after the apology is published, is uncertain); on the other hand, the defendants have obtained some substantial costs orders and may continue to obtain more. 

74The simple step to take is to dismiss the claim summarily on the basis that there will be no order as to costs other than the two costs orders made to date to the first and second defendants, on the basis that the defendants will honour the undertaking given to the court on 17 October 2014 to publish the proffered apology at their own expense. No costs would be awarded to any party for the commencement of these proceedings, or for this application. 

75If such orders are made, no doubt each party will consider this a defeat; however, each party may also, in time, come to consider that, having regard to Allsop ACJ's carefully explained warning about the dangers of this kind of litigation (see Cush at [3]), they may all in fact have won. 

Orders

(1)Proceedings dismissed.

(2)Save for the costs orders in favour of the first and second defendants of 4 July and 15 August 2014, each party pay its own costs of the proceedings.

2765102,R v Dacey [2014] NSWSC 1452,"Judgment
1R A HULME J:  On 29 August 2014, the offender, Ian Dacey, was acquitted of a charge of murder but found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.  His brother, Lee Dacey, was acquitted of both charges.  At the election of the offender and his brother the trial was by judge alone: R v Dacey, Ian; R v Dacey, Lee [2014] NSWSC 1201.
2Causing grievous bodily harm with intent is an offence contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years.  There is also prescribed under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) a standard non-parole period of 7 years. 
Facts
3The offender and his brother were in the company of the victim, Mr Peter Dent, at his home at Hamilton South on the afternoon of 9 August 2011.  They consumed drugs together.  They travelled with him in a taxi to the home of the offender's mother at Newcastle East in the early evening.  The offender and his brother were described by the taxi driver as appearing to be under the influence of something. 
4Mr Dent returned to his home at some stage during the evening.  The offender and his brother returned there at about 2.30am.  Mr Dent had acquired the drugs they had consumed the previous afternoon and they wanted him to get some more.  However, Mr Dent told them that his supplier would not be available at such an early hour of the morning and they would have to wait.
5Mr Dent eventually left to get the drugs at about 5.30am and returned at about 6.00am.  An argument developed; apparently Mr Dent refused to hand over the drugs until he was given the money.  Lee Dacey claimed that he had already given him the money. (The amount involved was $350.)  The offender was asleep but was woken by the argument and intervened.   Mr Dent probably produced a knife and the offender suffered a cut to a hand.  But Mr Dent was not winning the fight and he quickly fled to the lower level of his unit block where he called out to neighbours but to no avail.  The offender and his brother pursued him and further assaulted him.  The offender drew his knife and stabbed Mr Dent with the intention of causing him really serious bodily harm.  There were six stab wounds in all (one may have been defensive) but only one, to the left side of the chest, was serious.  
6The two brothers quickly left the scene.  An ambulance was called and Mr Dent was taken to hospital where he received emergency treatment.  
7It was ascertained that Mr Dent had suffered a left hemopneumothorax as a result of the stab wound to the left side of the chest.  An intercostal catheter was inserted and about 400ml of blood was drained.  Investigations were carried out to identify whether any further harm had been caused by the stabbing but the results were negative.  
8Mr Dent was initially treated in the Emergency Department, then transferred to the High Dependency Unit and then, on the following day, transferred to a General Ward.  He was making what appeared to be a relatively good recovery and was looking forward to being discharged to go home when he suddenly collapsed and died in the mid-afternoon of 14 August 2011.  An issue in the trial was whether the Crown was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the stabbing had made a substantial or significant contribution to death occurring.  There was competing expert medical opinion as to this and in the end I had a reasonable doubt; hence the acquittal of both men on the charge of murder.  One matter that was not in dispute was that the offender's knife had done more than penetrate Mr Dent's left lung but had continued through into the pericardial sac and cut a small artery on the surface of his heart; a matter only detected upon autopsy examination.
9The offender was intoxicated to some extent at the time of the stabbing.  He certainly was intoxicated by the manner in which he was staggering and stumbling about as captured on CCTV footage in the vicinity of Newcastle railway station at about 2.25am.  He was still affected by drugs by about 7.00am when he and his brother arrived at the home of Rachel Caldwell in a nearby suburb after having left Mr Dent's home. But I concluded in my judgment at the trial that at the time of the stabbing he was unlikely to be experiencing any significant alteration of his faculties of perception and judgment at the relevant time and I had no doubt about his capacity to form an intention to achieve a desired result.
10I rejected the offender's claim to have acted in self-defence. He made such a claim in conversations with Corrective Services officers about 2 months after the event when he was on remand.  There was no suggestion of it in various statements he made to others much closer in time to the event.  He did not give evidence.
Seriousness of the offence
11A significant, but not the only, factor in assessing the seriousness of an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent is the degree of harm caused.  It can range from something serious but from which a victim recovers to something that might leave a victim permanently disabled or disfigured.  In this case a potentially lethal weapon which was carried by the offender was used by him to inflict a number of wounds, one of which could very well have been fatal.  However, the deceased was making a relatively good recovery in the days following the incident.  
12The reason for the stabbing was trivial: there was an intense argument about a small quantity of drugs and a small amount of money.  The intention to inflict serious harm upon the deceased was formed spontaneously and likely when the offender perceived that the deceased had a knife and was involved in a physical struggle with his brother.  There was no pre-existing animosity between the offender and the deceased; indeed, the offender hardly knew Mr Dent.  The use of a weapon is not a necessary aspect of this type of offence and so the fact that a weapon was used elevates the level of seriousness.
13The fact that the offender was affected by drugs is not a mitigating factor: s 21A(5AA) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
14Having regard to all aspects relating to the objective seriousness of the offence I would assess it as falling slightly below the mid-range.
Personal circumstances of the offender
15The offender was born in 1983 and so he was aged 27 at the time of the offence.  
16He has a criminal record dating back to a drug possession offence in the Children's Court in 1999 when he was aged 15.  He has been imprisoned on quite a number of occasions.  His offences include car theft; driving whilst disqualified; stealing, including from people's houses; possessing illegal drugs; possessing a knife in public; stopping mail while armed with a dangerous weapon with intent to rob; assault; not stopping and driving recklessly during a police pursuit; and hindering the investigation of a serious offence.  There have been good behaviour bonds with conditions designed to address his drug abuse issues which he has breached. 
17The present offence was committed within 24 hours of the offender being released from gaol on parole.  This presents a serious aggravating feature.  It is notable as well that he has a history of breaching parole; in fact it seems that he has never completed a period of parole without breaching it. 
18It is rather depressing to observe that the offender's custodial history shows that he has spent about two-thirds of the past 12 years or so in gaol.  He has an internal disciplinary record that indicates he has remained involved with drugs; that record includes matters of failing urine testing and possessing drugs.
19The offender's criminal history not only denies to him the leniency that would otherwise be extended to a person without such a history but it also demonstrates that by committing the present offence he has a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law.  This is so notwithstanding that the history includes only two prior offences involving violence.  But the fact remains that the history is one of persistent offending.  For this reason, considerations of personal deterrence and retribution warrant greater emphasis in the assessment of sentence. 
20A report by Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, was tendered.  He had carried out a psychiatric evaluation of the offender by way of audio-visual link on 8 October 2014.
21The offender is now aged 31 and is the second of his parents' two sons.  He was born and raised in Newcastle.  His parents separated some years ago and he had not had contact with his father since he was aged 13.  His mother had another partner at one stage but this man was physically violent, as his father had been as well.  He told Dr Westmore that he was unhappy as a child.  He left school in Year 6 and is semi-literate.
22The only work he has ever done was for about 4 or 5 months in 2007 when he was on work release.  He said he did not know how to obtain a job.
23He started using illicit drugs at age 13 and has an extensive history of using cannabis, heroin, amphetamines and ice.  He has used drugs intravenously.  He attempted a residential rehabilitation program once in 2009 but was discharged for fighting.  
24The offender's social network in the community includes people who continue to use drugs.  He has very few stable social supports.  He is not in a relationship, his mother is ill and his older brother is her carer.
25The offender reported having used a range of illicit drugs during the last three years whilst he has been in custody.  He claims that he wants to stop using such drugs because he understands that if he continues to do so when next released he will not be able to stay with his mother.  He did, however, speak about wanting to start using steroids to build himself up physically and made unrealistic claims about how he might go about getting a prescription from a doctor or a veterinarian surgeon.
26He also reported not having any support or assistance on previous occasions when released from prison and he spoke about the difficulties he has experienced in that regard. 
27Dr Westmore was ""almost certain"" that the offender has become institutionalised.  He told the doctor that he does not mind being in custody and that if he finds it too difficult or stressful out in the community, then he will simply return to prison.
28Dr Westmore made the clinical diagnoses of ""probable specific learning disorder"", ""probable conduct disorder arising in adolescence"", ""substance use disorder (multiple substances)"", and noted that the offender has likely suffered periods of depression in the past.  He also considered him to have other issues including an intellectual disability in the mild to moderate range and a personality disorder.  
29Dr Westmore concluded his report as follows:
""There are clearly very significant concerns about Mr Dacey and his prognosis, both from a psychiatric and forensic perspective.  I have grave concerns for him and his safety and if this young man is not provided with considerable extensive support and supervision on his release, then it is inevitable, in my view, that the will eventually return to using illicit drugs and once again come to the attention of law enforcement agencies.""
30I will be asking that a copy of Dr Westmore's report accompany the papers.  What he raises is highly relevant to the question of releasing the offender on parole after the non-parole period I will be imposing has expired.
Other matters relevant to the assessment of sentence
31It was submitted, and I accept, that the offender has shown signs of remorse in statements he had made to others; in his offer to plead guilty to manslaughter or, later, to the offence for which he presently stands for sentence; and in that he has never sought to deny his responsibility for the injuries sustained by the deceased.  I accept that there was co-operation in the conduct of the trial in that the issues were confined to those that potentially had merit (and one in fact did).
32It was submitted that the delay of three years between being charged and sentenced is a relevant matter.  I have mentioned that the offender was charged on 19 October 2011.  He was committed for trial on 4 October 2012.  A trial commenced in May 2013 but aborted for some reason after about a week.  A second trial was held in November-December 2013 but the jury were discharged without reaching a verdict.  It was only after that trial that the Crown amended the indictment to add the alternative offence for which the offender is now being sentenced. I accept that he has been left in a state of uncertainty as to his fate for longer than is usually the case in defended criminal proceedings.  This is particularly so when during this protracted period he was required to face trial on three occasions.
33The Crown Prosecutor confirmed that the offender had made an offer at the committal proceedings to plead guilty to manslaughter but the offer was rejected.  He also confirmed that at some time after the second trial there was an offer to plead guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent but, again, the offer was rejected.  It is at odds with the previous preparedness to plead guilty to either of those offences that the trial was defended on two bases, causation in relation the homicide and self-defence generally.  Nevertheless, in accordance with established practice, the offender should be given credit in a situation where he is now to be sentenced for an offence to which the Crown has previously rejected an offer to plead guilty.  I do not intend to arithmetically quantify the extent to which I will allow such credit.
34It was submitted that the offender will need to serve the remainder of his sentence in protective custody because of the fear of retribution at the hands of the deceased's brother.  The evidence tendered today confirms that he has been in protective custody (at the lowest of the three levels of such custody) and the situation in relation to the deceased's brother is one of the reasons.  Another reason is that he has been involved in assaults upon other inmates and making threats against other inmates.  The evidence also indicates that following sentence the offender is more than likely to be classified to minimum security.  Given there is no evidence that the offender has experienced, or will experience, more onerous custodial conditions, this aspect has no real relevance to the assessment of sentence.
35Mr Hoyle SC submitted that his client was a person who very much needed assistance with rehabilitation in relation to his entrenched addiction to drugs.  He noted that the offender had a support network of his mother, brother and cousins who would assist him but also referred to Dr Westmore's concerns to which I have previously referred.  I accept the doctor's recommendation that the offender requires extensive support and supervision when he is released from custody but much depends upon his resolve to rehabilitate at that time.  At the moment, his rehabilitation prospects appear quite bleak.  Possibly his mother's current ill health will provide a catalyst for change but that remains to be seen.
Pre Sentence Custody
36The offender returned to custody on 3 October 2011.  He was required to serve the balance of parole in respect of his previous sentences until 4 February 2012.  He was also serving the non-parole period of new sentences that had been imposed on 4 October 2011.  The non-parole component of those new sentences ran from 4 October 2011 until 3 April 2013.  
37He was charged in respect of the present matter on 19 October 2011.
38The question is whether the sentence I impose today should be backdated to the date of arrest or be accumulated, partially or wholly, upon the non-parole period of those other sentences. 
39The offences for which the offender was sentenced on 4 October 2011 must have been quite serious examples of their type, having regard to the length of the sentences imposed in the Local Court.  They cannot be completely subsumed by the sentence I impose today.  However, I must have regard to the principle of totality.  I propose to partially accumulate, and will backdate the sentence to 4 October 2012.
40It was not submitted that I should make a finding of special circumstances and thereby reduce the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period.  I will, however, make such a finding.  Nothing in the offender's subjective case calls for it but the accumulation by a year upon his other sentences warrants a reduction so that the usually proportions are maintained in the overall result. 
Family Victim Impact
41Ms Vicky Telfer provided a victim impact statement on behalf of her late brother.  At a personal level it is the most important document I received in the proceedings.  It provides a moving and eloquent account of the unimaginable despair and grief that has been suffered as a result of the tragedy that befell her family in August 2011.  Given the constraints under which I am imposing sentence there are limits to the regard I may have to this in the assessment of sentence.  But I wish to again publicly acknowledge what Ms Telfer has said and confirm that she, and all those who shared her loss, have my sincere condolences.
Sentence
42Convicted.
43Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 5 years with a balance of the term of the sentence of 2 years.
44The sentence will date from 4 October 2012 and the offender will become eligible for release on parole when the non-parole period expires on 3 October 2017.
45I direct that a copy of the report of Dr Bruce Westmore dated 10 October 2014 accompany the warrant.

2765107,R v Hunter (No 15) [2014] NSWSC 1456,"remarks on sentence 

1On 8 July 2014, Paul Andrew Hunter (the offender) was arraigned before a jury panel and me. The indictment contained a single count alleging that on 20 June 2011 at Dharruk he murdered Jason Dixon (the deceased). The offender pleaded not guilty to murder, and entered no plea with regard to the lesser form of homicide, manslaughter. On 4 August 2014, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The offender comes before the Court today to be sentenced for the offence of manslaughter.

2The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 25 years. Parliament has created no standard non-parole period. I regard the maximum penalty of imprisonment as an important guidepost in my exercise of sentencing discretion.

3My approach to the determination of any disputed facts is as follows. Any fact that is adverse to the offender, above and beyond the elements of the offence, must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. A fact that is in his favour need be proven on the balance of probabilities only: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270. It may be that the evidence will not permit me to determine some facts with complete clarity. It is not my role to try to construe the findings of fact that may have underpinned the verdict of the jury. Rather, I must make my own findings, consistent with that verdict: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374; (1997) 90 A Crim R 587.

4In the circumstances of this verdict, I have also borne firmly in mind the legal principle that an offender is not to be punished for an offence greater than the offence of which he or she has been found guilty: The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383.

Undisputed facts

5Although the offender did not give evidence in the trial, by the conclusion of the final addresses of counsel, the following facts were not in dispute.

6On the afternoon of 20 June 2011, the son of the deceased, Mr Tory Gardner, was sleeping on a couch at his father's home in Dharruk, a western suburb of Sydney. He was woken by his father, a middle-aged man, who told him that someone outside wanted to fight Mr Gardner. The two men went outside. As they did so, Mr Gardner thought he saw his father hide something in the sleeve of his jacket. The time could not have been later than 5:25 PM.

7Outside on the street were the offender and a number of other people. They had been at the home of Mr Bernie Douglas, a neighbour. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that many of the people in that group were intoxicated to some degree by alcohol, prohibited drugs, or prescription drugs. I include the offender in that description.

8Words were exchanged about whether there was indeed to be a fight. Without warning, the deceased produced an iron bar about 50 cm long, and forcefully hit the offender to the head with it at least three times. The offender fell to the ground, stunned. He tried to crawl away. Mr Gardner pulled his father away from the offender.

9The offender recovered his senses, got to his feet, and accused Mr Gardner of being involved in the attack upon him by the deceased. Threats were exchanged between the offender and the deceased. Although the evidence of precisely what the offender said was not entirely clear, it was to the combined effect that he would return and inflict revenge upon the deceased and anyone else in his home in the form of physical harm.

10Mr Gardner went back to the home of his father, and the two of them had an argument. As a result Mr Gardner and his partner left the home, and returned to the premises of Mr Douglas. The deceased was at home alone.

11Meanwhile, at about 5:30 PM the offender walked to the home of Ms Sharon Young, who also lived nearby. She noted that he was shaking, had tears in his eyes, and had a lump on the left side of his head. When she asked him what had happened, the offender replied ""I got hit Aunty Sharon in the head"". The offender asked Ms Young to call a taxi to take him to Mt Druitt to pick up his methadone, and said that thereafter he would travel to Mt Druitt Hospital. Ms Young called a taxi, but by the time it arrived the offender was no longer waiting for it.

12Instead, he walked a short distance to the home of Ms Charmaine Riley. He asked her to drive him to the neighbourhood shops at ""old Mt Druitt"". He also said that he had been hit to the head, and Ms Riley saw the lump to his head. The offender said ""the bloke up the road hit me"" and described the deceased as a ""cocksucker"".

13Ms Riley drove the offender to the shops. The offender entered a pharmacy and was provided with his prescribed dose of methadone. The pharmacist noted that the offender had a lump to his head, and also that ""his movements seemed to be a little slow"", similar to ""that of a person who had just been in a motor vehicle collision"". The pharmacist also noted that the offender had secreted under his jacket a cylindrical object that was roughly the width of his shoulders. That object was in fact a very large and heavy socket wrench that the offender had taken from inside or near the home of Mr Douglas.

14The offender then entered a nearby grocery store, and purchased a can of soft drink. He returned to the car of Ms Riley. At that stage, rather than asking Ms Riley to take him to a hospital, the offender asked her to drive him to the home of his brother, the late Mr Wade Hunter. She did so.

15The offender arrived at that home at about 6 PM. Mr Wade Hunter was present, as was the cousin of the offender, Mr Gary Hunter. The partner of Mr Wade Hunter heard the offender say that he had been hit to the head with a metal pole, and needed to go to the hospital. She formed the opinion that the offender was affected by some sort of drug.

16The offender did not travel to the hospital. Rather, he travelled by car with Mr Wade Hunter and Mr Gary Hunter to the home of the deceased. There a brutal bashing was inflicted upon Mr Dixon. It was effected by the use of at least two weapons. An extremely heavy blow was inflicted to the forehead of the deceased, with the effect that that part of his skull was caved in. 

17After the assault, the three men departed. The deceased was left, very badly injured and bleeding heavily, on the floor of the living room of his own home. Eventually, at about 7 PM, Mr Gardner and his partner came looking for his father, and found him in that state. 

18Meanwhile, at about 6:42 PM, the offender attended Mt Druitt Hospital. A nurse who examined him noted that he smelt of alcohol. Later that evening, another nurse noticed a small lump about the size of a 10 cent piece to the head of the offender. Again, he smelt strongly of alcohol.

19As one would expect, the police commenced an investigation into the assault upon the deceased. On 21 June 2011 a detective informed the offender that he was under arrest for a serious assault. The offender replied ""Yeah, I was at Mt Druitt Hospital, you do the maths"". That was a lie; as I have said, the offender was in fact at the scene of the bashing.

20Mr Jason Dixon passed away on 23 June 2011.

21Some time later, the police located three weapons secreted in two drains in the vicinity of the assault. At various times, Mr Wade Hunter and Mr Gary Hunter asserted that those weapons had been used in the attack upon the deceased.

22Later, the offender took part in a number of conversations about the offence and its investigation that were captured by telephone intercepts and listening devices.

Resolution of disputed facts

23The verdict of the jury that the offender is not guilty of murder means that he did not take part in the fatal assault with an intention to inflict death or really serious physical injury. Nor did he take part in a joint criminal enterprise to assault with either of those intentions. And, although extended joint criminal enterprise murder was not part of the Crown case at trial, I proceed on the basis that he did not engage in such an enterprise foreseeing the possibility that others could form such an intention.

24The Crown case for manslaughter was that the offender was one of those who inflicted the bashing, and that that assault was an unlawful and dangerous act. In the alternative, the Crown case was that the offender was present at the scene and part of a joint criminal enterprise to inflict the bashing.

25On sentence, the learned Crown Prosecutor did not submit that I would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the aggravating feature that the offender was one of those who physically assaulted the deceased. In light of her approach, I put that possibility to one side.

26It follows that I am to sentence the offender on the basis that he was present at the scene and part of a joint criminal enterprise to inflict a bashing on the deceased, but at the time the offender did not intend to kill or inflict really serious physical injury.

27However, the Crown Prosecutor did submit that I would be satisfied as an aggravating feature beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was the moving party in the attack, even though he did not physically participate in it.

28Defence counsel submitted that I would not be so satisfied, and that there was a reasonable possibility that the offender, who actually wished to be taken to hospital, had been talked into involvement in the attack upon the deceased by his brother and his cousin.

29I respectfully reject that submission of defence counsel. I am satisfied to the criminal standard that the offender was indeed the moving party in the attack upon the deceased. In coming to that view, in accordance with the submissions of the parties, I put to one side the undoubted tendency to violence of the offender in the past, as evidenced by his criminal record. I also put to one side the versions of events given by Mr Wade Hunter and Mr Gary Hunter. Each of them gave so many versions of events as to render their credibility negligible. In the case of Mr Gary Hunter, he gave evidence in the witness box that I regret to describe as worthless. Rather, I base my satisfaction about that aggravating feature on the following aspects of the evidence.

30First, the offender was the aggrieved party. There was nothing to suggest that Mr Wade Hunter or Mr Gary Hunter had anything against the deceased. The public attack upon the offender by the deceased, which left the offender injured, humiliated, and upset, provided him with a powerful motive to seek violent revenge.

31Secondly, his return to the scene and the infliction of physical harm upon the deceased was exactly what the offender had said would occur before he left the scene.

32Thirdly, after having left the shops and walked back to the car of Ms Riley, it was quite open to the offender to ask her to take him to the hospital there and then. She had already shown her readiness to take him to the shops. Instead, he asked to be driven to the home of his brother.

33Fourthly, the offender told lies to the police about the evening in question.

34Fifthly, the recorded conversations show that the offender engaged in ongoing efforts to ensure that the truth of the events of the evening would not come out.

35Sixthly, the weapon with which the offender was armed at the time he was in the pharmacy and before he travelled to the home of his brother was, I am satisfied, used as part of the fatal beating of the deceased. Contrary to the submission of defence counsel, I do not consider that the evidence of the forensic pathologist who conducted the autopsy upon the body of the deceased ruled out that possibility.

36Seventhly, I do not believe that the offender was being truthful when he said in the presence of his brother's partner that he wanted to go to the hospital at the stage when the three men left the home. 

37In short, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender attended at the home of his brother rather than being taken to hospital in order to advance an attack upon the deceased. I consider that he was the moving party in persuading his brother and his cousin to take part in that joint criminal enterprise. And I consider that he remained the moving party when the plan was put into effect, with fatal consequence.

Assessment of objective seriousness

38I turn to consider the objective seriousness of this example of manslaughter. Of course manslaughter can be made out in a large number of ways at law. It can also be committed in countless different ways factually. In those circumstances, it is not easy to assess a particular manslaughter within a coherent hierarchy of seriousness.

39Nevertheless, the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years, the greatest maximum penalty known to law short of imprisonment for life, demonstrates the seriousness with which Parliament regards the worst class of case of manslaughter. Here, the offender orchestrated a brutal attack with the use of deadly weapons on a middle-aged man in his own home. The offender was present, and was the moving party. Two confederates were used to put the plan into action. Although the verdict of the jury demonstrates that the offender intended nothing more than the infliction of actual bodily harm, the unintended result of the intended attack was the death of a fellow human being. As I have said, the deceased was left gravely wounded on the floor of his own home to be found by family members. To my mind, this example of the offence of manslaughter cannot be characterised as anything other than very grave.

Subjective features

40I turn from my discussion of the offence to a discussion of the life and character of the offender.

41The offender has maintained his innocence of any criminal involvement in the death of the deceased since the verdict. Although he recently expressed to his brother a generalised regret about what occured, that cannot be regarded as remorse for what he has done, or even an acceptance of responsibility.

42As for the question of motive, I consider that it was to avenge the act of violence that the deceased inflicted upon the offender. To my mind, that is not a matter of mitigation. One may accept that the offender was aggrieved by what he had suffered at the hands of the deceased, but that did not confer on him the slightest entitlement to inflict his version of summary justice in response.

43Defence counsel submitted on sentence that his client was provoked by the deceased. I have approached that submission with caution. The fatal assault took place quite some time after the deceased struck the offender repeatedly with an iron bar. By that stage, the anger of the offender had cooled; for example, it is not as if he was in a rage when he spoke to the pharmacist. As I have said, the assault was planned. It involved a return to the scene, confederates, and the use of weapons. What occurred in the home of the deceased may be sharply contrasted to the situation if, for example, having been hit to the ground, the offender had immediately got up and punched the deceased several times to the head. Nevertheless, having reflected on the matter, I accept that provocation should be taken into account as a mitigating feature, but only to a small degree.

44Defence counsel also submitted that I would accept that the offender was suffering some sort of cognitive deficit at the time of the offence as a result of the combined effect of the blows inflicted to his head and the methadone that he had been prescribed. That submission was founded upon the evidence of the pharmacist, Ms Young, Ms Riley, the partner of Mr Wade Hunter, and the two nurses that attended to the offender at Mt Druitt Hospital.

45It is difficult to disentangle any such effects from the effects of self-induced intoxication by alcohol and non-prescribed medication on the part of the offender at the time. Defence counsel accepted, of course, that those effects could not constitute a matter in mitigation. I also suspect that there was a flavour of dissembling in the presentation of the offender at various stages that evening. Finally, the offender had been on a methadone program for quite some time, and one would not expect it to have affected him unexpectedly. Nevertheless, having reflected on this matter as well, I am prepared to accept on the balance of probabilities that the cognitive functioning of the offender was affected to a limited degree at the time of the offence by the blows to his head.

46Turning to matters of background, the evidence about the life and character of the offender, apart from what one could glean from the evidence in the trial, was based upon two documents: his criminal record, and a psychological report prepared by a highly qualified forensic psychologist. The matters of background contained in the latter document were confirmed by the brother of the offender in the witness box, and I accept them on the balance of probabilities.

47The offender was aged 34 at the time of the offence, and is now aged 37. He is an Aboriginal man, a heritage that he shared with the deceased. 

48The offender is one of eight children. Until the age of four, he lived with his mother. Thereafter he was taken from her care, perhaps on the occasion of her imprisonment. He was fostered to an Aboriginal family in Mt Druitt until he was eight years of age. That was a happy and stable time that he remembers fondly. Unfortunately, he was then placed in the care of an aunt who was an alcoholic, and who was trying to care for eight children. While the offender was a little boy he was exposed to violence, and was also the victim of violence at the hands of his aunt and, on occasion, his biological father. When the offender was 11 he was taken by his mother to Mildura, where he lived in a caravan and later on a mission. His mother was imprisoned and the offender ended up living with relatives. Often there was insufficient food for him to eat, and he had to fend for himself as best he could. By the age of 13 years he was detained in a juvenile detention centre; by the age of 15 he was a father.

49By the age of 21, the offender had been introduced to heroin, and he quickly developed an addiction to it. Years later, he commenced to use methadone to break that addiction. He has also abused amphetamines, including in their crystal form, on occasion. At the time of the offence he was, as I have said, taking part in a methadone program, but was also continuing to abuse prescription drugs and alcohol.

50Tragically, two members of the immediate family of the offender, including Mr Wade Hunter, have lost their lives to prohibited drugs.

51I have no doubt that the grossly deprived and disrupted upbringing of the offender, including his exposure to violence and the abuse of alcohol and drugs by others, damaged him psychologically, and predisposed him to engaging in the same activities as an adult. And I accept that he was still suffering from that damage at the time when he committed this offence.

52For many years the offender has been in a loving and stable relationship with his partner, Ms Deanna Dominey. They have three children whom the offender loves and of whom he is proud. 

53The psychologist assessed the offender as being of very low intelligence. I accept that assessment; still and all, the recorded conversations show that the offender can defend his interests with foresight and a degree of cunning. As a result of his upbringing the offender cannot read or write; his ambition is to learn to do so. The psychologist assessed his risk of reoffending as moderate to high. I accept that assessment as correct, especially when one considers his criminal record, to which I shall turn in a moment.

54The psychologist has suggested that the offender would benefit from a range of psychological interventions to address the link between his abuse of drugs and his criminality. Again, I accept that that would be highly beneficial, not only to the offender but also to the community as a whole.

55Turning to the criminal record of the offender, it is a lengthy one, and it has a distinct flavour of violence. It began with him being placed on a bond by the Children's Court for the offence of assault in 1993, when he was aged 15 years. After that he committed a number of less serious offences as a child, though it is noteworthy that two serious offences of robbery in company in 1993 led to an order that he perform community service. In 1995 he was given a control order for, amongst other things, assault, malicious wounding, breaching an apprehended domestic violence order, and possession of a prohibited drug.

56In 1999, as an adult, the offender was sentenced to imprisonment for violent disorder. In the same year he was placed on a bond for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In 2001, he was imprisoned for intimidation of a police officer. In 2003, he received the same punishment for using a weapon to avoid apprehension. In 2008 he was imprisoned for affray. In early 2011 he was placed on a bond for larceny for two years, and breached that bond by the commission of this offence. I consider that the breach of that bond by an offence of violence is a serious aggravating feature of the matter.

57The longest sentence that has been imposed upon the offender in the past was in 2004, when, for an offence of aggravated robbery, he was sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of two years three months. 

58In short, on the one hand, it could be said perhaps that the offender was free of convictions for violence between late 2008 (the date of the affray) and the commission of this offence in June 2011. On the other hand, the repeated crimes of violence committed by the offender in the past disentitle him to leniency with regard to the sentence to be imposed for this homicide. They also cause one to be very cautious about the ability of the offender to refrain from violence in the future.

Prospects of rehabilitation

59Speaking more generally about the future, it is true that the offender has the benefit of a stable and loving relationship and a supportive family. It is to be hoped that the offender will seek the psychological help that he undoubtedly requires to undo the damage that has been done to him. But in light of his criminal record, the fact that he has been repeatedly imprisoned in the past, and his attitude to this latest example of violent criminality, I think that one can only have, at the most, a very guarded optimism about the prospects of rehabilitation of Mr Hunter.

Comparable cases

60The parties helpfully provided me with examples of other sentences previously imposed for the offence of manslaughter by judges of this Court at first instance and on appeal. In accordance with recent authority of the Court of Criminal Appeal, I was not provided with any sentencing statistics for the offence of manslaughter: see R v Wood [2014] NSWCCA 184 at [56]-[59]; Abbas v R [2014] NSWCCA 188 at [41]. I have taken into account all of the materials with which I was provided. Of course, they do not constitute a range that binds me in any sense. Still and all, they do represent the accumulated wisdom of many judges over many years.

61As I have said, manslaughter is well-known to be a highly variable offence. In this case, the offence was committed by a mature man, who has an extensive record for violence, and who has neither pleaded guilty nor expressed any remorse. The attack was planned, involved weapons, featured confederates, and constituted an invasion of the security of the home of a defenceless victim. Many of the cases to which I was referred do not share those characteristics.

Various Matters

62I turn to deal with a number of separate aspects of my task.

63First, shortly after the jury delivered its verdict and was discharged, a letter was received in my Chambers that seemingly had been sent by one of the jurors. I provided a copy of it to both counsel, shorn of any identifying features. The letter requested that I approach the sentencing of the offender leniently. Defence counsel submitted that, in an informal way, I could take that request into account as being roughly analogous to a recommendation for leniency made by a jury at the time of delivery of verdict; he invited my attention to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Whittaker v The King (1928) 41 CLR 230.

64Assuming that the letter does indeed come from a juror in the trial, I accept that it was well intentioned. But it was an inappropriate communication, and similar actions in the future are to be firmly discouraged.

65In any event, at best the letter sets out the opinion of one juror. I know nothing of what the remainder of the jury may have felt about what approach to sentencing I should adopt. In the circumstances, I put that letter completely to one side.

66Secondly, I do not propose mechanistically to state the aggravating and mitigating features that I have taken into account for the purposes of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). These remarks on sentence fulfil that role. I have referred to the section, and taken care to avoid double counting.

67Thirdly, the parties were in agreement that any sentence that I impose should commence upon the day upon which the offender came into custody; namely, 22 June 2011. I accept that joint submission.

68Fourthly, defence counsel did not submit that there were special circumstances that would justify a reduction in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and head sentence. Nevertheless, I have considered that question for myself. The offender has been in custody on many occasions in the past. He is not a young man. The sentence I impose will feature a period on parole that is not insubstantial. In those circumstances, I do not consider that there are special circumstances that should lead to a variation in the statutory ratio.

69Fifthly, I am required by s 25C of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) to inform the offender that he may be detained even after the complete expiry of his head sentence, if it is considered that his rehabilitation is insufficient and he is a danger to the community.

Victim impact statements

70I was provided with victim impact statements prepared by Ms Angela Weldon, the sister of the deceased; Ms Kellyanne Stanford, the eldest daughter of the deceased; Ms Terrie Sheargold, the second eldest daughter of the deceased; and Mr Jamie Gardner, a son of the deceased. In accordance with the recently amended s 28(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I consider it appropriate to take those statements into account in determining my sentence for this offence.

71I shall not repeat the searingly painful details of those statements. It is enough to say that the family of Mr Jason Dixon has been grievously harmed, very likely irreparably, by his violent death. Many are haunted by his appearance, grossly battered and bruised, in the hours before he passed away. Some feel a wholly misplaced guilt for the decision to turn off his life support. Others have sought relief from their ordeal in prohibited drugs that will themselves be the source of further damage.

72On behalf of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, I extend my condolences to all of those who have suffered, and will continue to do so, as a result of what the offender has done. It could be that the conclusion of the proceedings today will provide some closure; some wounds will never fully heal.

Conclusion

73Defence counsel submitted that the offender could receive a sentence that includes a non-parole period of ""time served""; that is, a minimum period in custody of about three years four months. I respectfully reject that submission. To my mind, such a minimum term of imprisonment would fail to reflect adequately the objective seriousness of the offence, and the moral culpability of the offender. 

74In short, I have taken into account the deprivation suffered by the offender in his early years, and the effect that it has had on the whole of his life, in the ways recently discussed by the High Court of Australia in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 and Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 249 CLR 600. I have sought to balance those matters against the fatal gravity of what the offender has done. Having said that, I have also held steadily in mind the warning of the High Court that, in doing so, the lives of Aboriginal victims damaged or destroyed by the violence of Aboriginal offenders must never be devalued: see Munda v Western Australia at 619.

Imposition of sentence

75Paul Andrew Hunter, you are convicted of the offence of manslaughter. I sentence you to a non-parole period of 6 years, to date from 22 June 2011. There will be a parole period of 2 years that expires on 21 June 2019. The first date upon which you will be eligible for release to parole is 21 June 2017.

76To express my order another way, the offender is sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.

2765148,State of New South Wales v Boatswain [2014] NSWSC 1446,"Judgment

1On 18 December 1992 the Defendant was sentenced for a number of offences. Seven of those offences were serious sex offences within the meaning of s 5(1) Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW).

2The Defendant was sentenced at the same time for a number of other offences, some of which were offences related to those committed against the two victims of the sexual offences.

3The sentences imposed by Judge Urquhart QC were as follows:

(a) Three counts of sexual intercourse in circumstances of aggravation - a sentence of penal servitude for a minimum of nine years with an additional term of three years for each offence. Each such sentence commenced on 30 July 1991 with the minimum term expiring on 29 July 2000 and the additional term expiring on 29 July 2003;

(b) One count of robbery of the first victim - penal servitude for a minimum term of three years and an additional term of one year commencing 30 July 1991, with the minimum term expiring on 29 July 1994 and the additional term expiring on 29 July 1995;

(c) Four counts of sexual intercourse in circumstances of aggravation - penal servitude for a minimum term of six years with an additional term of eight years. The minimum term commenced on 30 July 2000 and expired 29 July 2006 with the additional term expiring on 29 July 2014;

(d) One count of robbery against the second victim - penal servitude for a minimum term of three years with an additional term of one year. The minimum term commenced on 30 July 2000 and expired 29 July 2003 with the additional term expiring on 29 July 2004;

e) One count of possessing a shortened firearm - a fixed term of 12 months from 30 July 2000 to 29 July 2001.

4The total aggregate sentence was 23 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 15 years. It may be noted that the sentences for each of the nonsexual offences were made wholly concurrent with the sentences for the sexual offences. Accordingly, the whole of the time served has, in a practical sense, been in respect of the sexual offences.

5An appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed: R v Warwick Antony Boatswain (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 15 December 1993, Unrep).

6The Defendant was not released from custody until 23 June 2014 and then only because he was successful in showing that the Parole Authority had made errors in relation to his application for parole: Boatswain v State Parole Authority [2014] NSWSC 501. However, the principal reason for his not being released to parole at an earlier time was repeated infractions of prison discipline which also involved his failing to complete in due time appropriate courses as a convicted sex offender.

7The interim supervision order made by Fullerton J on 2 July 2014 included conditions which the Defendant was prepared to accept on an interim basis. However, he reserved his right to argue for their non-inclusion in a final order.

Legal principles

8Section 5B provides that if and only if the offender is a high risk sex offender can an extended supervision order be made. Section 5B(2) says:

An offender is a high risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

9In Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v Williams [2007] WASC 206; 176 A Crim R 110 Wheeler JA (with whom Le Miere AJA agreed) said at [63]:

In my view, an ""unacceptable risk"" in the context of s 7(1) is a risk which is unacceptable having regard to a variety of considerations which may include the likelihood of the person offending, the type of sexual offence which the person is likely to commit (if that can be predicted) and the consequences of making a finding that an unacceptable risk exists. That is, the judge is required to consider whether, having regard to the likelihood of the person offending and the offence likely to be committed, the risk of that offending is so unacceptable that, notwithstanding that the person has already been punished for whatever offence they may have actually committed, it is necessary in the interests of the community to ensure that the person is subject to further control or detention.

10In Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v GTR [2008] WASCA 187; 198 A Crim R 149 Steytler P and Buss JA said at [27]:

The word 'unacceptable' necessarily connotes a balancing exercise, requiring the court to have regard, amongst other things, for the nature of the risk (the commission of a serious sexual offence, with serious consequences for the victim) and the likelihood of the risk coming to fruition, on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the offender, on the other, if an order is made (either detention, without having committed an unpunished offence, or being required to undergo what might be an onerous supervision order). As John Fogarty points out, albeit in a rather different context (Unacceptable risk - A return to basics (2006) 20 AJFL 249, 252), the advantage of the phrase 'unacceptable risk' is that 'it is calibrated to the nature and degree of the risk, so that it can be adapted to the particular case ...'.

11In State of New South Wales v Richardson (No. 2) [2011] NSWSC 276; (2011) 210 A Crim R 220 I said at [90]:

Two things seem to me significant when assessing the evidence and the likelihood of re-offending. The first is the higher standard of proof imposed by the words ""a high degree of probability"". The second is the notion that ""unacceptable risk"" involves a balancing exercise between the commission of a serious sexual offence and the likelihood of that risk coming to fruition on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the Defendant either because he will be detained beyond the period of his sentence although he has not committed any further offence or he will be subject to an onerous supervision order, on the other hand. It is because of that balancing exercise that it is open to the Court to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that there is an unacceptable risk but that the result of that finding (either a continuing detention order or a supervision order) may vary in a given situation. ...

The Defendant's background

12The Defendant was born on 26 July 1964. Accordingly, he is now aged 50 years. His criminal offending commenced when he was 13 years of age where he was charged with attempting to steal. On 23 January 1978 he was committed to an institution but that order was suspended on the entry into recognisance. However, further offences were committed and on 29 May 1978 he was committed to an institution. Since that time he has spent most of his life, including his teenage years, in custody. His criminal convictions up to the time of the index offences include but are not limited to: take and drive motor vehicle without consent, stealing, abscond custody, goods in custody, possession of car breaking implements, robbery being armed, malicious injury, assault, make false instrument, larceny of motor vehicle and breach of parole.

13The Defendant told the psychologist, Katherine Sahm, that he had had a number of short term relationships, about five or six, prior to being arrested on the Index Offences. One of these was a de facto relationship for approximately two years where they had lived together for approximately eight months. He said he intended to marry her but the relationship ended as a result of his incarceration for the index offences.

The index offences 

14The first set of offences was committed on 4 July 1991. The victim was a woman who had arrived home from work. She parked her car in the garage and walked into the storeroom where she saw the Defendant pointing a gun at her. He forced her to lie down and he tied her hands behind her back. He demanded to know where her money was.

15He tied her to the bedhead and blindfolded her with a leather belt. She felt a knife flicking her wrist. He engaged in oral and vaginal intercourse with her. He subjected her to degrading and humiliating remarks and threats of violence. He ransacked her house and found a Visa Card and obtained the PIN by threats of violence. He continued with his sexual abuse. He left her bound with rope and masking tape tied to the bedhead. She was only freed at 7:30am the following morning when a neighbour heard cries for her help. The Defendant went with his girlfriend to a bank at Kings Cross where he attempted to use her Visa Card. They were photographed by a security camera.

16The second set of offences took place on 30 July 1991. The Defendant broke into the home of a woman who was home alone. He physically assaulted her when she screamed and bit one of his fingers that he had put inside her mouth. He has a six inch bladed knife and threatened to kill her with it.

17He demanded to know where her money was. He bound her hands with masking tape behind her back and placed a scarf over her eyes so that she could not see.

18He then commenced a series of sexual assaults upon her which involved digital and penile penetration of her vagina as well as penile penetration of her mouth and her anus. These sexual assaults occurred more than once during the night. He also searched her house and found an Advance Bank key card. He demanded the PIN but she gave him an incorrect one. He travelled to Five Dock and attempted to use it. Subsequently he returned to the area of her house. The Sentencing Judge said that the overwhelming inference was that he did so because he had been unsuccessful in using the key card. He was arrested shortly afterwards.

Expert assessments of risk of re-offending

Katherine Sahm

19Ms Sahm is a forensic psychologist and is the Chief Psychologist North for Corrective Services NSW. She prepared a lengthy report from 24 March 2014 based on an interview with the Defendant on 5 March 2014 and an examination of all of the Defendant's case files within Corrective Services. Significant matters referred to in this report are as follows.

20Whilst in custody the Defendant had approximately 81 institutional punishments although there had been none since 22 February 2012. Twenty five of them were drug related and 22 of them involved behaviour or language which was insulting, threatening or intimidating with one charge of fighting.

21His criminal history showed that the Defendant had committed offences while on probation and parole before the index offences. These offences committed whilst on parole included armed robberies. He had also been charged with escaping lawful custody.

22Ms Sahm's assessment was that the Defendant had demonstrated a progressive but gradual positive change over time while in custody and had become less adversarial in his behaviour culminating in his last two years of incarceration with no internal punishments. She noted, however, that non-compliance with supervision was yet to be tested in a less restrictive environment.

23She noted that he had completed approximately 18 months cumulatively of intensive treatment with CUBIT comprising three group sessions per week and a further 21 months of individual preparatory treatment with Ms Young (a psychologist) ending in 1999. He had also participated in other programs to address his criminogenic needs including drug and alcohol programs.

24Ms Sahm assessed him for his further risk of offending using the STATIC 99R, the ACUTE 2007 and the STABLE-2007 protocols. The STABLE-2007 is concerned with dynamic risk factors. She concluded that when the three protocols were combined his scores placed the Defendant as moderate current risk priority for sexual and violent recidivism and general recidivism. In relation to the dynamic risks, the areas which she identified as clinically significant areas of concern were: 

(a) capacity for relationship stability;

(b) negative emotionality;

(c) cooperation with supervision;

(d) sexual preoccupations sex drive, sex as coping, deviant sexual preference.

Dr Andrew Ellis

25Dr Ellis, a forensic psychiatrist, interviewed the Defendant for a period of two hours on 14 July 2014. As is usual in these matters he had available to him a large number of documents related to the Defendant's history including reports from psychologists and psychiatrists and various material from Corrective Services.

26Dr Ellis took a detailed history from the Plaintiff concerning his background, his development and his criminal history.

27In the course of describing his reasons for committing the serious sex offences the Defendant said that he formed a revenge fantasy for what he thought was mistreatment by the police in relation to a robbery he did not commit but in respect of which he was arrested. The revenge fantasy involved a need to control and humiliate a female victim. It involved tying up a victim, blindfolding her to avoid detection, wearing a mask to avoid detection and frightening the victim with a gun. He claimed that revenge fantasy was his motivation for the two offences.

28He said that after he had committed the first series of offences what he experienced did not conform completely to his fantasy material and that led him to commit the second series of offences ""to get it right"". Of some concern is that he reported that he was not satisfied with the sexual experience involving the second victim and thought that he may have gone on to commit more offences in order to perfect the experience.

29Dr Ellis diagnosed him as having a Paraphilic Disorder and said that he potentially met criteria for Sexual Sadism Disorder. Paraphilic disorders are chronic relapsing conditions. Dr Ellis also thought that he met the criteria for Anti-Social Personality Disorder and Substance Use Disorder.

30Dr Ellis had read the report of Ms Sahm and concurred with her score of 5 for the Defendant on the STATIC 99R.

31The limitations of the STATIC 99R are referred to by Dr Ellis. These limitations are well known to and understood by judges who hear these cases on any regular basis. However, the assessment using that protocol is one factor to be taken into account when assessing the risk of reoffending. Dr Ellis thought that it may be that the Defendant was closer in characteristics to the high risk group under the STATIC 99R.

32Dr Ellis also made reference to the RSVP protocol in his evaluation of the risk of the Defendant's re-offending. He drew attention to the significance of his antisocial personality orientation as being a factor consistently identified with sexual re-offence.

33Dr Ellis's conclusion on re-offending was as follows:

A consideration of the type of possible sexual offence should be considered in an estimation of risk. In the case of Mr Boatswain, given the particular pattern of sexual arousal, the likely type of victim would be a woman in a situation where they were alone or in a position of vulnerability. A likely offence would be without warning. The associated intimidation and loss of a sense of bodily integrity would be of the type where physical and psychological injuryare foreseeable. He was embarking on a pattern of escalating behaviour which may have led to more risk of physical injury.

In considering actuarial, structured professional and clinical parameters in the absence of any treatment or supervision, Mr Boatswain would fall into a group of persons with a risk for serious sexual offending, offending that is statistically moderate to high in frequency but of a type with catastrophic consequence, and greater than a theoretical average offender. Specific treatment and supervision would likely reduce this risk.
34Dr Ellis said also that paraphilic disorders, as considered by group expert authority, are not deemed in remission until five years from release from a controlled environment with noted impairment in social (including sexual) and other areas of function.

35In terms of ongoing needs and treatment Dr Ellis said this:

Negative emotions and supervision cooperation are considered in the report of Ms Sahm [scil concerning his] ongoing needs. I agree with this opinion, based on his self report at interview of long term issues with control of anger, statements indicating a sense of injustice, statements attributing blame externally and the history of poor emotional control evidence by multiple institutional infractions. This area does appear to have matured over time, but requires continued attention from Mr. Boatswain, treatment and supervisory staff.

36Dr Ellis recommended that the Defendant be referred to a forensic psychiatrist for assessment for anti-libidinal medication. He recommended restrictions on internet and pornography and restrictions on weapon carrying.

37From a psychiatric perspective he said a period of five years was considered reasonable in order to improve functions in the community and refine the appraisal of risk. A period of 24 months would be required to secure stable, independent accommodation, maintain a stable mental state and regular meaningful activity both occupational and social in the community, given the restrictions on persons subject to extended supervision orders. He thought a further 36 months of regular treatment in a psychological program, coupled with regular review of medication, both opioid substitution and anti-libidinals should they be prescribed, would be necessary. Dr Ellis said his psychiatric disorders were chronic and likely to persist beyond any period of supervision but might be better internally controlled at the end of the five year period.

Dr Jeremy O'Dea

38Dr O'Dea, another forensic psychiatrist, interviewed the Defendant on 4 August 2014 for approximately two hours. Dr O'Dea had available to him the same material provided to Dr Ellis.

39Dr O'Dea described the interview in this way:

He initially sat quietly in the chair and was settled, interactive and superficially cooperative, but as the interview progressed he became increasingly angry, surly, dismissive, and controlling of the interview at times, in an apparently overbearing manner. He appeared of adequate intelligence and spoke at length of his predicament, but with limited remorse or contrition evident, and gave an inconsistent and contradictory account of his history at times.

40A reading of Dr O'Dea's report with that of Dr Ellis shows inconsistent reporting on behalf of the Defendant. The following might be thought to be significant.

(a) Dr Ellis reported that he began drinking alcohol at the age of 14 and before he went into custody he consumed two or three standard drinks each night on a less than fortnightly basis. He reported to Dr O'Dea that he had not drunk alcohol on a regular basis in the past and said ""I don't drink ... I never have drunk ... I got drunk once ... when I was 13 or 14.""

(b) When Dr Ellis asked him about his current sexual function he said that he masturbated one to two times each week. He said that his erections were less potent than in the past but he experienced no significant dysfunction and was able to ejaculate and orgasm without difficulty. On the other hand, he told Dr O'Dea that his sex drive was non-existent and he was like a monk. Later in the interview with Dr O'Dea when asked about medications to lower his sex drive he reiterated that he did not have any sex drive.

(c) He denied to Dr Ellis any fantasy, urges or behaviour consistent with exhibitionism, voyeurism, frotteurism, fetishism, transvestism, auto-erotic asphyxia, masochism, paedophilia or bestiality. On the other hand, Dr O'Dea noted in the report of Ms Sahm that the Defendant had described that from about the age of 22 he had sexual fantasies about ""breaking into a woman's home and tying her up so I could have whatever sex act with her"".

41Dr O'Dea diagnosed him as satisfying the categories of Substance Use Disorder, Anti-Social Personality Disorder and Paraphilic Disorder, in particular Sexual Sadism Disorder. Dr O'Dea said it was reasonable to assume that he had a significant risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community in the long term including a significant risk of committing a further serious sex offence as defined in the Act. Dr O'Dea said that although the Defendant had participated in psychological sex offender programs in custody, Dr O'Dea was not aware that there was any good evidence that psychological treatment programs alone, and in custody, have a significant impact on reducing the risk of sex offenders, particularly those with identified sexual deviance or Paraphilic Disorders committing further sex offences, including further serious sex offences as defined in the Act. 

42Dr O'Dea said that he would consider that the Defendant's history of sexual deviance, his history of personal, interpersonal and social functioning, and his history of Substance Use Disorder, despite recent progress before he left custody, remained significant risk factors that would benefit from ongoing attempts at management in the community. Dr O'Dea acknowledged the limitations of the STATIC 99R but concluded:

[90 ...from a full clinical psychiatric risk management perspective, and as judged by various actuarial and more so called dynamic risk assessment instruments, Mr Boatswain's risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community in the long term would be considered significantly high and appropriate for specific psychiatric treatment as outlined above.

[91] More specifically, it would seem reasonable to consider that there would be a significantly high degree of probability that Mr Boatswain would be likely to commit a further serious sex offence"" (as defined in Section 5(1) of the New South Wales Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006) in the community in the long term, if these above outlined treatment interventions above were not successfully implemented in the context of community supervision and monitoring. Whilst it is not possible, or clinically appropriate from a psychiatric perspective, to place a percentage likelihood of Mr Boatswain committing a further ""serious sex offence"", the significance of this risk from a clinical perspective may be considered commensurate to the likelihood as I understand is referred to in legal terms in ""Tillman v Attorney General for New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 327"".

43Finally, Dr O'Dea said that the Defendant's risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community and of committing a further serious sex offence in the community was likely to be a longer term and potentially of at least five years duration.

Should an order be made?

44I am satisfied to a high degree of probability based on the evidence of Ms Sahm, Dr Ellis and Dr O'Dea that the Defendant poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. The Defendant has spent most of his life since he was a young teenager in custody as a result of offending. It is difficult to think that he is not institutionalised. His compliance with conditional liberty in the past has been poor. He was only released to parole in relation to the index offences five weeks before the expiry of his head sentence. Although he has completed courses in custody as a sex offender there has been no opportunity to this point, apart from the few months since he was released to the present time, for him to demonstrate that he is able to live outside prison and not pose a risk of committing further serious sex offences. 

45The Defendant does not contest that he comes within the definition of high risk sex offender"" in s 5B(2) of the Act and does not oppose the making of an Extended Supervision Order against him under s 9(1)(b) of the Act.

46The result is that the Defendant is a high risk sex offender. I consider that an Extended Supervision Order should be made.

Conditions

47The dispute in this matter involved the inclusion of particular conditions and the length of the Extended Supervision Order.

48In State of NSW v Green (Final) [2013] NSWSC 1003 RA Hulme J accepted at [36]-[38] that conditions:

(a) ought to address specifically issues relevant to currently identified risk factors in relation to future offending;

(b) should be limited to addressing conduct regarding the risk of future serious sex offenders as opposed to criminal offending generally;

(c) should not be unjustifiably onerous or simply punitive.

49In State of NSW v Fisk [2013] NSWSC 364 Beech-Jones J said at [99]:

The imposition of ""appropriate"" conditions under s 11 is governed by the overriding purpose of mitigating the identified risk of the high risk sex offender committing either serious sex offences, or at least offences of a sexual nature.

50Further, as is made clear in Green at [39] and in Attorney-General for the State of NSW v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340 at [21] the discretion in s 11 to impose conditions must be exercised in conformity with the legislative purpose of the Act, being the safety and protection of the community and the rehabilitation of the offender.

51Evidence was given by Ms Vicki McCarthy, a Community Corrections Officer within the Extended Supervision Orders Team. She has had some responsibility for the Defendant since his release on 23 June 2014. Her affidavit demonstrated some difficulties in persuading the Defendant to comply with the conditions of the interim order, particularly in relation to the requirement for him to notify in advance where he would be going, issues involving counselling and his general attitude to direction and supervision. Nothing that was put to her in cross-examination diminished the validity of that evidence. 

52However, in paragraph 70 of her affidavit of 10 October 2014 she said this:

Since meeting with Mr Boatswain on 1 August 2014 there has been a significant improvement in his response to supervision and his attitude towards the DSO. 

53Bearing those legal principles in mind, and having regard to Ms McCarthy's evidence, I deal now with the conditions which were disputed.

Part A: Reporting and Monitoring 
Condition 4

54This condition required the Defendant to report to the police station nearest to his approved address within three days of the order of the Court and to notify a police officer at the station that he was subject to the order and its terms. The Defendant submitted that the condition was not within the spirit of the Act which by s 11 clearly intends supervision to be done by Corrective Services NSW through its staff. In that way the introduction of police risks confusion in the lines of supervision.

55The Plaintiff accepted that the Department was in any event likely to notify the police station nearest to the Defendant's address. It was submitted by the Plaintiff, however, that there would be an advantage if the police were able to sight the Defendant in person.

56The condition requires only one reporting at any time the Defendant moves his residence. It is not suggested there be any regular reporting as might be contained in bail conditions. It does not seem unreasonable to me that the Defendant should be required to report to any police station near his home so that they are aware of who he is and that he is under an ESO.

Conditions 5, 6 and 7

57The Defendant did not oppose these conditions which deal with wearing electronic monitoring equipment provided that condition 6 required him only to comply with ""technical"" instructions given by the Departmental Supervising Officer. The Defendant's objection was that he was required by the condition to comply with all instructions which he said might involve a prescription or proscription of where the equipment was to be worn.

58I can see no basis for inserting the word ""technical"" in condition 6. It is appropriate that the Defendant comply with all instructions in relation to the operation of such equipment.

Conditions 8, 9 and 10

59These conditions require the Defendant to inform the Departmental supervising officer of his movements in advance and prescribed periods in which this can be done. There is an exception in the case of the Defendant requiring urgent medical attention or other emergency.

60The Defendant opposes these conditions because of his experience in the manner in which they were administered, pursuant to the interim order. The Defendant said it was unreasonable and an invasion of his privacy to require him to notify up to ten days in advance all his movements. He also pointed to the difficulty of doing so. The Defendant, as with most people, it was submitted, would not know precisely what they were doing and where they were going a week or more ahead of time.

61The Defendant also pointed to some difficulties already experienced contained in the case notes that were Exhibit VM1. In short, it was said that on occasions the Defendant has been given the run around when trying to notify changes to his schedule brought about, perhaps, by matters beyond his control.

62Ms McCarthy gave evidence that, because of the difficulties the Defendant has had, the Team has been prepared to be more flexible than has been the case with other persons in a similar position. There was some evidence of changes that had been permitted to the schedules submitted by the Defendant.

63It may be accepted that orders 8, 9 and 10 involve a considerable invasion of privacy and would involve some difficulty in compliance for the Defendant. However, part of the case management plan involves bringing some structure into the Defendant's life. As noted earlier, he has spent the majority of his life from the age of 13 in some form of custody including custody for the last 23 years. He is likely to be institutionalised to a significant extent.

64It is necessary for him to attend regular appointments, to receive his daily medication of methadone or its equivalent, to attend counselling, to attend the centre responsible for endeavouring to obtain employment for him and for other appointments. In addition, at this early stage of his release the ESO Team is obviously concerned with ensuring that they know where the Defendant is at any given time and what his particular purpose is for being at that location, including who he might be having contact with.

65These conditions are not unusual conditions in ESOs. Given the risk of re-offending that I have discussed, and which has been identified by the psychiatrists, these conditions do not appear to be unreasonable or unduly onerous.

Part B: Accommodation
Condition 2

66This condition as originally drafted required the Defendant to obey all reasonable instructions given by the residential facility staff where he resides. The argument about this condition identified some ambiguity and confusion about its application given that the Defendant now resides in privately rented accommodation. The Plaintiff accepts that the condition needs redrafting and the Defendant accepts the redrafted condition.

Part C: Place and Travel Restrictions
Condition 1

67This prevents the Defendant frequenting or visiting any place or areas specified by the Departmental supervising officer. The Defendant says that this is too wide and is open to administration in a manner that could be unduly onerous and oppressive. The Defendant further submitted that if conditions A 8-10 were included, and given that the Defendant agrees to condition E1, this condition is unnecessary.

68It seems to me that for effective supervision of the Defendant the DSO must have a discretion to determine if some place or area is unsuitable bearing in mind the Defendant's psychiatric conditions as well as his further risk of offending.

Condition 4

69This condition prevents the Defendant from entering licensed premises but excluding restaurants, cafes, cinemas and theatres, without the prior approval of the Departmental supervising officer. The Defendant submits that this is too wide and is unduly onerous and oppressive. The Defendant says that he has skills in cooking and hospitality and seeks employment in that industry. The prohibition upon entering defined licensed premises would impede his integration into employment and would prevent him from socialising with future work colleagues after work.

70The Defendant further submitted that all of the reports by the psychiatrists and others demonstrate that the Defendant has never had a problem with alcohol. It was not related to his offending. The condition is therefore unreasonable.

71It may be accepted that all of the evidence tends to suggest the Defendant has never had a problem with alcohol. I have noted, however, the inconsistent information provided by the Defendant to Drs Ellis and O'Dea regarding his drinking. I accept, however, what Dr O'Dea said in his report at [83]:

[83] In specific reference to the conditions set out in the Summons filed on 2 June 2014 regarding Mr Boatswain's attendance at a licensed premises and his prohibition from alcohol, although I am not aware that he has had a specific problems with alcohol abuse, it would be prudent that he remain abstinent from alcohol use in the long term in order to better manage his Sexual Sadism and his risk of relapse of his other substance use disorders. Similarly, attendance at licensed premises may not only make it harder to control his alcohol use, but due to the potential clientele and milieu of at least some licensed premises, it may increase the risk of illicit substance use.

Condition 5

72This requires the Defendant to comply with any direction made by the Departmental supervising officer regarding the possession, storage and use of vehicles, including the requirement to keep a driving log. The Defendant submits that this too wide and unduly onerous and oppressive. He says that the possession, storage and use of motor vehicle is unconnected to his status as a high risk sex offender and that it is not necessary for the safety and protection of the community nor for the encouragement of his rehabilitation.

73The Plaintiff points to the fact that a motor vehicle was used in the commission of the second set of index offences. The fear is expressed, therefore, that the Defendant may use a motor vehicle to commit further offences.

74In my opinion, the link is far too tenuous. The Defendant is required, in any event, to provide a schedule of where he will be going and by what mode of transport he will be going there. The Department has been made aware, in any event, that the Defendant has bought a motor car and a motor bike and uses them in accordance with what appears in his schedule. The proposed condition is unreasonable and does not address a risk factor in relation to future offending.

Part D: Employment, Finance and Education
Condition 1

75This requires the Defendant, if he is unemployed, to enter employment arranged or agreed on by the DSO or make himself available for employment, education, training or participation in a personal development program as reasonably directed by the DSO. 

76The Defendant says that the condition is too wide and is open to administration in a manner that could be unduly onerous and oppressive. The Defendant says that he is ready, willing and able to secure employment as soon as possible and wishes to do so in the hospitality industry. It is said not to be necessary for the safety and protection of the community nor for the encouragement of his rehabilitation.

77In my opinion, this is an important condition to aid the rehabilitation of the Defendant. It is also an important condition, indirectly, for the avoidance of the risk of re-offending. Whilst the Defendant may wish to work in the hospitality industry because of his training and experience in prison, such a position may not be available at any given time. The DSO must have the right to direct the Defendant into some other employment or into some training or education for employment even if such direction is only for the short term. The proposed condition is not unduly onerous nor oppressive. 

Conditions 3f and 3g

78Condition 3f requires the Defendant to provide details of his income and expenditure if reasonably directed by the DSO and condition 3g requires the Defendant to notify the DSO of the details of any trust in which the Defendant is a beneficiary or any other property in which the Defendant has a beneficial interest. The Defendant says that this is not necessary for the safety and protection of the community nor for the encouragement of his rehabilitation and is open to administration in a manner that could be unduly onerous and oppressive.

79The Plaintiff says that these conditions are justified so that the Defendant knows the purposes and objects of the Defendant's spending. It is difficult to see why this is necessary. The Defendant has recently come into an inheritance of $150,000 and the Department is aware of that money and how it is held. It does not seem to me that these conditions address risk factors nor rehabilitation.

Conditions 5 and 6

80Condition 5 provides:
The Defendant must not execute any legal instrument that confers upon the Defendant control of any money or assets of another person or organisation without the prior approval of the Departmental Supervising Officer.

The Defendant would accept the original form of this condition which provides:

The Defendant must advise the Departmental Supervising Officer should he execute any legal instrument that confers upon the Defendant control of any money or assets of another person or organisation.

81Similarly, condition 6 provides:

The Defendant must not execute any lease, mortgage, contract for sale (over the value of $1000), power of attorney, instrument relating to obtaining any credit, opening of any account held at a bank, credit union, building society or similar institution, or deed without the prior approval of the Departmental Supervising Officer.

Again, the Defendant would accept the condition as originally drafted that provided that he was to advise the Departmental Supervising Officer should he execute any such document or instrument.

82As with conditions 3f and 3g the Plaintiff supports its form of these conditions as a way of ensuring the DSO has some prior control over what money or assets the Defendant might have and how he would be using money and assets he owns or might come to own. In circumstances where he has already received $150,000 to the knowledge of the Department, I can see no basis for requiring him to seek approval before legal instruments are executed in relation to these matters. It is sufficient that he advise the DSO if he does any of these things.

Part E: Non-association
Conditions 4 and 5

83These conditions require the Defendant to notify the DSO as soon as possible of any relationship he proposes to enter with another person involving sexual or intimate contact. He must consent to the DSO disclosing the Defendant's offence history and that the Defendant is subject to this order with its details to the other person if the DSO is satisfied that it is necessary or desirable in the interests of the safety of the other person.

84The Defendant says that these conditions are open to administration in a manner that could be unduly onerous and oppressive and they are not necessary for the safety and protection of the community nor for the encouragement of his rehabilitation. He notes that his offences in July 1991 were against two strangers and not the woman with whom he was in a relationship with at the time.

85The Plaintiff says that the concern with Condition 4 is that the Department should know who the person is he is having a relationship with. It may be that the person has drug connections or criminal connections or is another person that is considered undesirable by the Department. Condition 5 is slightly different in that it is concerned with a person who might be a vulnerable person and whose safety might be at risk.

86As I noted earlier, Dr Ellis said in his report (at p. 15):

A consideration of the type of possible sexual offence should be considered in an estimation of risk. In the case of Mr. Boatswain, given the particular pattern of sexual arousal, the likely type of victim would be a woman in a situation where they were alone or in a position of vulnerability. A likely offence would be without warning. The associated intimidation and loss of a sense of bodily integrity would be of the type where physical and psychological injury are foreseeable. He was embarking on a pattern of escalating behaviour which may have led to more risk of physical injury.

87Ms Sahm reported that the Defendant had had a number of short term relationships, about five or six, before he was last incarcerated and had been in a two year de facto relationship up to the time of the incarceration. There is no suggestion of any sexual violence involving the women with whom he was involved. The psychological and psychiatric evidence pointed only to strangers.

88Conditions imposed should be limited to addressing conduct regarding the risk of future serious sex offences as opposed to criminal offences generally. In the particular circumstances of this case I do not consider that either of those conditions ought to be imposed.

Part F: Access to the internet

89It is necessary to set out these terms in their entirety so that my reasons can be understood:

PART F. ACCESS TO THE INTERNET
Internet use

1. The defendant must comply with any reasonable direction given by the Departmental Supervising Officer regarding access to the internet by the defendant on any computer or other device (including mobile phone or tablet computer), including but not limited to:

a. the use of parental lock or other device or software
that may restrict access to or permit access only to certain web sites;

b. the times and places that the defendant is permitted
to access the internet;

c. accepting the presence of an appropriate person,
being a person previously approved in writing by the Departmental supervising officer for the purpose of this condition;

d. restricting the use of the internet for specified
purposes; and

e. the use of Skype or any Voice over Internet
Protocol (VoIP) or other similar services without the prior approval of the Departmental supervising officer.

2. The defendant must provide the Departmental supervising officer with details of the type of any internet connection used, or intended to be used, by the defendant, including whether the connection is a wireless, broadband, ADSL or dial-up connection.

3. The defendant must provide the Departmental supervising officer with details of any email addresses, internet user names, instant messaging user names, chat room user names or any other user name or identity used, or intended to be used, by the defendant through the internet.

4. The defendant must provide an inventory of any communication devices and data storage devices in the defendant's possession and advise the Departmental supervising officer of any change to the inventory immediately.

Social networking services

5. The defendant must not intentionally access, join and / or connect to any internet based social networking service, including web-based, e-mail, instant messaging services and on-line community services (""internet based social networking services""), without the prior approval of the Departmental Supervising Officer and such approval should not be unreasonably withheld.

6. In circumstances where the defendant, joins and / or connects to any internet based social networking service, the defendant must inform the Departmental Supervising Officer of any login identification name and password for any internet based social networking service the defendant joins and / or connects to.

90The Defendant says that these conditions are too wide and are open to administration in a manner that could be unduly onerous and oppressive. The Defendant notes that he is agreeable to condition 1 of Part G which prevents him accessing or viewing any X-rated material.

91The use of the internet is not a straight forward consideration in respect of this Defendant. He entered custody at a time when social networking on the internet was unknown. It was relatively early days for the use that could be made of the internet and even of emails. Since the Defendant entered custody in 1991 methods of socialisation have shifted considerably, and social networking is a significant method of socialisation for people across most generations.

92The Defendant was not a sex offender who used the internet in any way to achieve his wrongful purposes. He is not a paedophile and did not seek out his victims through the internet.

93Nevertheless, the Defendant accepts condition G1 which prevents his accessing pornographic material by whatever means. The internet is now the largest repository of pornographic material. In addition, it cannot be assumed that there is no risk from the Defendant using the internet to seek out further victims. In other words, if he is determined to re-offend, it cannot be assumed that he will use the same methods that he used in 1991. 

94In addition, it is important for the Department to know the persons with whom the Defendant is fraternising. Ordinarily, a sex offender is not permitted to have contact with other sex offenders. I note in that regard that an exception has been made for the Defendant in relation to one particular person whom he is entitled to contact by telephone. Ms McCarthy, who gave evidence about that matter, was not able to explain adequately, in my opinion, why the Defendant should not be permitted to contact this person by the use of the internet.

95The Plaintiff was not able to point to any particular basis for requiring condition F2. The justification for the inclusion of condition F5 was the fear that the Defendant may use social networking to seek out other victims or vulnerable persons.

96In my opinion, condition F1 is appropriate, if for no other reason because of the ability to access pornography on the internet.

97I do not consider there is any basis for requiring condition F2. The basis for condition F4 is said to be the availability of Wi-Fi for various devices such as laptops or even mobile phones. What is available through an internet connection is also available through Wi-Fi. That seems to me a sufficient justification for the inclusion of condition F4.

98I do not consider it is reasonable to require prior approval for the Defendant to join or connect to any internet based social networking service. He already has a Facebook account which is known to the Department. It seems to me sufficient if the Department is able to access any social networking account the Defendant has. Accordingly, condition F3 is reasonable. Condition 6 should be amended to omit the words ""is approved under condition 5 to access,"" the word ""join"" should be ""joins"", and the word ""connect"" should be ""connects"". 

Part H: Alcohol and drugs

99Condition 2 prevents the Defendant possessing any prescription medication other than that which is prescribed to him by a medical practitioner. Condition 4 says that he must not possess or consume any alcohol without prior approval of the Departmental supervising officer. Condition 5 says that the Defendant must submit to drug and alcohol testing as directed by the Departmental supervising. The Defendant opposes all of these conditions on the basis that they are open to administration in a manner that could be unduly onerous and oppressive. In addition, the Defendant repeats his submissions in relation to alcohol that were made in relation to condition C4. He does not oppose drug testing but opposes testing for alcohol.

100In relation to condition H2 the condition seems to me to be reasonable. The Defendant says that difficulties may arise if he is caring for his mother and it is asserted that he has in his possession her prescription medication. That does not seem to me to be a reasonable fear. In circumstances where the Defendant suffers from a Substance Abuse Disorder which relates to opioids it is important that the Defendant not have in his possession any prescription medication other than that which is being prescribed to him.

101I have already given reasons for my view that the Defendant should not drink alcohol. Conditions 4 and 5 are reasonable.

Part K: Medical intervention and treatment obligations
Condition 6

102This condition reads:

The defendant must attend regular medical consultations, physical examinations, pathology testing, and medical imaging as reasonably directed by a treating clinician.

The Defendant accepts the condition if the words ""and agreed by the Defendant"" are added.

103For clarity, the Plaintiff suggests a modified version of the note at the conclusion of Part K which reads as follows:

NOTE: The requirement in Part A that the defendant comply with any reasonable direction, and the requirements that the defendant participate in treatment under this Part, do not require the defendant's participating in treatment, or taking of any medication that may be prescribed, without his informed consent.

In the earlier form of that Note the Defendant had asked for the insertion of the words ""and voluntarily given"" before the word ""consent"". The Defendant maintains that position with regard to the modified form of the Note. The Defendant is concerned that consent may be given but under duress. The Defendant says further that the Note is concerned only with participation in treatment and the taking of medication.

104It does not seem to me that either of the words that the Defendant wishes to be inserted are necessary. As a matter of law, if the consent is informed it would be voluntarily given. Agreement obtained by duress would not be informed consent. The note itself makes it clear that the Defendant needs to consent to treatment and to the taking of medication. The conditions are otherwise necessary to further both objects of the legislation. In those circumstances I decline to insert the additional words in the Note. 


The term of any ESO

105The Defendant opposes the Court making an Extended Supervision Order for a period of five years but will not oppose a period of three years. He does not oppose a three year supervision period because he accepts that he was only recently admitted to parole even though the delay in releasing him was found to be an error by the Parole Board. 

106The Defendant says that researches show that the State of NSW always seeks a maximum period of five years. He points to other judgments where three years have been ordered including State of NSW v Scerri [2011] NSWSC 683, Attorney-General for the State of NSW v Steadman [2013] NSWSC 170 at [82]-[83], State of NSW v Mintern [2014] NSWSC 1304 and State of NSW v Wilde [2014] NSWSC 305.

107The Defendant particularly draws attention to State of NSW v Conway [2011] NSWSC 925 at [28] where Hidden J said:

[28] Nevertheless, as Dr Allnutt properly observed, this decision is a legal one, not a clinical one. After careful consideration, I am persuaded by Mr Johnson's submission that 3 years is a significant period in which to monitor the defendant in the community, and provide significant scope for professional intervention. That lesser period, in my view, would provide a greater incentive to the defendant to pursue his rehabilitation and, in particular, to commit himself genuinely to treatment. It should be borne in mind that, by s 10(3) of the Act, this Court could make a further extended supervision order, and s 13 provides for the revocation or variation of an order on the application of the State or the defendant. That being so, the position can effectively be reviewed at the end of the 3 year period.

108It may be accepted that five years is a lengthy period particularly given the extent of the conditions which are to be imposed. The Plaintiff says that whilst the conditions might all be employed at the outset, as time goes on, and as the Defendant shows improvement, some of these conditions will be relaxed. The Defendant accepts that such an intention is stated in good faith but says that, nevertheless, the order will remain in place for five years with all those conditions which are enforced at the discretion of the DSO. He says that some of the conditions are onerous and the overall regime for such a long period does not give the Defendant the incentive that is spoken of by Hidden J.

109In my opinion, the ESO should be in place for a period of five years. I have made reference earlier in this judgment to the views of Dr Ellis and Dr O'Dea. Neither was required for cross-examination and their opinion concerning the time that will be needed for the Defendant's rehabilitation is amply justified in the evidence. The psychiatric conditions diagnosed are entrenched conditions where there is always a risk of relapse. I have regard, particularly, to Dr Ellis's opinion (at [35] above) that paraphilic disorders are not deemed in remission until five years from a controlled environment such as prison.

110As mentioned earlier, the Defendant has spent the vast majority of his life from the age of 13 in custody. The Sentencing Judge was of the view that upon the Defendant's release he would require supervision for a long period and in that sense he found special circumstances and provided for an eight year parole period. For reasons earlier given the Defendant was not released to parole.

111Those matters all point strongly in the Defendant's case to a term of five years for the ESO.

112Without diminishing the importance of the point made by Hidden J in Conway concerning the incentive for a defendant to perform, each case must turn on its own facts. I have read each of the other cases to which the Defendant has referred. It does not seem to me that anything is demonstrated other than in the particular case, and for varying reasons, three years was considered appropriate.

113Additionally, it is always open to the Defendant to make application under s 13 of the Act to vary the conditions or the length of the ESO. A defendant who shows a significant change in circumstances and good progress towards rehabilitation may persuade a court that the ESO be varied in some way. Although the Defendant submitted that such a situation placed the onus on the Defendant rather than a shorter ESO requiring the Plaintiff to prove that another one was needed after three years, it seems to me that an onus on the Defendant is precisely what is appropriate in all the circumstances.

Conclusion 

114I make the following orders:

1. Order that pursuant to s 9(1)(a) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (""The Act"") the Defendant be subject to an Extended Supervision Order for a period of five years from the date of the order.

2. Order that pursuant to s 11 of the Act, for the period of the Extended Supervision Order, the Defendant is directed to comply with the conditions set out in the Schedule to this Order. 

3. I note that:

(a) Pursuant to s 10(2) of the Act, the Defendant's obligations under the Extended Supervision Order are suspended while the Defendant is in lawful custody whether under this or any other Act or law;

(b) Lawful custody for the purposes of s 10(2) of the Act may include detention as an involuntary patient in a mental health facility under the Mental Health Act 2007, or escorted leave from any such facility, at least in circumstances where the Defendant's freedom is directly controlled and limited;

4. I direct that access to the court file in respect of any document will not be granted without leave of a judge of the Court. If any application is made by a non-party in respect of any document, the parties are to be notified by the Registrar so as to enable them to be heard.

5. I grant liberty to apply on 2 days' notice.

		28 October 2014",2014-10-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765162,PFC v R (No.2) [2014] NSWCCA 241,"Judgment

1THE COURT: On 19 June 2009, after a trial before Norrish DCJ and a jury, on an indictment containing 29 counts, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on 23 counts. One count on the indictment was the subject of a verdict of not guilty by direction. The jury returned verdicts of not guilty on the remaining 5 counts. 

2On 21 December 2009, PFC was sentenced to an effective term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole of 10 years and 9 months, with a balance of term of 3 years and 8 months. This term of imprisonment was imposed with respect to 17 counts of sexual assault or acts of indecency involving different complainants and 6 counts of acting with intention to pervert the course of justice. 

3On 25 May 2011, for the reasons which were then expressed, the Court comprising Allsop P, Hoeben and Hall JJ, dismissed a Crown appeal against sentence: Regina v PFC [2011] NSWCCA 117. 

4An appeal against conviction was heard by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 14 and 24 October 2011. For the reasons which it published, the Court comprising Giles JA, Hoeben and Hall JJ, dismissed that appeal in a judgment delivered on 15 December 2011: see PFC v R [2011] NSWCCA 275.

5On that day, PFC informed the Court of Criminal Appeal that he wished to apply to reopen his appeal. On 7 March 2012, PFC filed an application pursuant to Rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules. This judgment deals with the application by PFC pursuant to r 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules to set aside or vary the order of the Court of Criminal Appeal made on 15 December 2011, which was ""Appeal dismissed"". 

6It will be convenient to refer to the judgment of 15 December 2011 as the first judgment, and the Court which heard the appeal as the first Court. 

Constitution of the Court

7For the hearing of this application, the Chief Justice directed that the Court be constituted by Fullerton, RA Hulme and Garling JJ: s 3 Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

8Prior to the commencement of the hearing, the Court was notified that the applicant objected to Garling J being a member of the Court, and hence objected to the composition of the Court. Accordingly, at the commencement of the application, PFC was invited to inform the Court of the basis of that application, and to put such submissions as he wished in support of the application.

9Having considered those submissions, the Court refused the application of PFC that it be reconstituted and indicated that it would deliver its reasons with this judgment on the principal application. What follows are the Court's reasons for declining to accede to PFC's application for the Court to be reconstituted.

10By letter dated 20 September 2014, PFC notified an objection to Garling J being a member of the Court to hear the principal application. He drew attention to s 110 of the Supreme Court Act 1970. He then said this:

""The main reason and my submission is possible bias as GARLING J, along with MCLELLAN CJ at CL, MCCALLUM J on 4 September 2012 heard and dismissed my application to re-open my previous criminal appeal ... The facts in that application are similar and included that the complainants in that trial were the same complainants that gave evidence in this trial."" (sic.)

11However, PFC abandoned this ground when he made oral submissions. Instead, he submitted that Garling J should not sit because of a reasonable apprehension of bias arising from a remark made by Garling J in the course of a case management hearing on 19 September 2014, in preparation for the hearing of the principal application. 

12Notwithstanding earlier written submissions indicating that he did not rely on Garling J's role as being the case manager of the proceedings, PFC submitted that during a case management hearing on 19 September 2014, Garling J, in the course of discussing with the Crown the content of the submissions which were still outstanding, had drawn the Crown's attention to a decision of the High Court of Australia in Achurch v The Queen [2014] HCA 10, (2014) 88 ALJR 490. PFC submitted that as Garling J's remark was addressed only to the Crown and not to him, it demonstrated a reasonable basis for an apprehension of bias.

13We have carefully examined the whole of the transcript of the case management hearing of 19 September 2014. It is clear that Garling J was in the process of ensuring that the Crown understood the Court's requirements that its written submissions sufficiently addressed the issues which were to be determined by the Court. In so doing, Garling J referred to arguments of statutory interpretation which had been advanced in Achurch by way of an analogy, to demonstrate what issues the Court required the Crown's submissions to cover.

14Further discussions between Garling J and PFC about the content of the Crown's submissions, concluded with Garling J saying to PFC in the clearest of terms that he was not telling the Crown what the contents of their submissions should be. PFC accepted that. He made no complaint during that hearing about the reference to Achurch by Garling J.

15It is clear that PFC puts his application to this Court on the basis of possible bias arising out of a remark during a case management hearing. We would take this expression to be an assertion of what legally would be called ""apprehended bias"".

16The test for disqualification is to be found in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63; (2000) 205 CLR 337 at [6] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. Their Honours said:

""Where, in the absence of any suggestion of actual bias, a question arises as to the independence or impartiality of a judge ..., the governing principle is that, subject to qualifications relating to waiver ... or necessity ..., a judge is disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide.""

17Their Honours went on to say that the principle which they enunciated gave effect to the requirement that justice should be both done and be seen to be done, itself a reflection of the fundamental importance of the principle that the Tribunal be independent and impartial. See also Michael Wilson & Partners Ltd v Nicholls [2011] HCA 48; (2011) 244 CLR 427 at [31] per Gummow A-CJ, Hayne, Crennan and Bell JJ.

18In Michael Wilson at [67], the plurality judgment said:

""... an allegation of apprehended bias requires an objective assessment of the connection between the facts and circumstances said to give rise to the apprehension and the asserted conclusion that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to bear upon the issues that are to be decided.""

19PFC relies on part of the content of a discussion between Garling J and counsel for the Crown in the course of a case management hearing. The remark was one in which Garling J referred, by way of analogy, to a principle enunciated in a case which was potentially relevant to these proceedings, and sought to ensure that the Court received submissions from the Crown which touched upon all relevant principles.

20The remark indicated no concluded view of Garling J about whether the principle in that case related to, let alone that it was determinative of, this application. The further remarks made to PFC also made it plain that his Honour was not engaged in the process of dictating to the Crown the contents of its submissions. 

21Such a remark (or a remark of similar kind) is typically made in case management hearings to ensure that submissions which the Court is to receive are relevant and comprehensive. The remark was made in open Court, PFC heard it: if he wished to respond to the Crown's submissions, he had the opportunity to do so, orally, at the hearing of the application.

22There is no reason to suppose that any fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that Garling J might not bring an impartial mind to the determination of this proceeding. 

23Accordingly, for these reasons, the Court declined PFC's application that it should be reconstituted.

Criminal Appeal Rules

24This application is brought in reliance on Rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules which is in the following form:

""50C Power to set aside or vary order 

(1) The Court may set aside or vary an order if an application for the setting aside or variation is made before entry of the order.
(2) If an application for the setting aside or variation of an order is made within 14 days after the order is entered, the Court may determine the matter, and (if appropriate) set aside or vary the order under subrule (1), as if the order had not been entered.
(3) Within 14 days after an order is entered, the Court may of its own motion set aside or vary the order as if the order had not been entered.
(4) The Court may not extend the time limited by subrule (2) or (3).
(5) Nothing in this rule affects any other power of the Court to set aside or vary an order.""

Legal Principles and Authorities

25Rule 50C commenced on 7 September 2007. It was first considered by this Court in Alramadan v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (No.2) [2008] NSWCCA 69. 

26The Court noted in Alramadan that in applying Rule 50C in its terms, the Court: 

""... will have the same powers under the Criminal Appeal Act, taking into account relevant principles under the general law, as it has always had in relation to orders which have not been entered.""

27The Court then proceeded to consider the proper application of Rule 50C. It said this:

""6 Where judgment has been given but the order has not been entered, the power to reconsider an appeal is not precluded. Nevertheless, the circumstances in which the Court will be persuaded to entertain further argument (and possibly further evidence) are quite limited. In Elliott and Blessington at [31]-[32], the High Court held that the criteria by which this Court should determine an application to re-open a proceeding, prior to judgment being entered, were those stated by Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No. 2) [1993] HCA 6; 176 CLR 300 at 303: 

'What must emerge, in order to enliven the exercise of the jurisdiction, is that the Court has apparently proceeded according to some misapprehension of the facts or the relevant law and that this misapprehension cannot be attributed solely to the neglect or default of the party seeking the rehearing. The purpose of the jurisdiction is not to provide a backdoor method by which unsuccessful litigants can seek to reargue their cases.' ""

28The Court went on to say this:

""7. Applying those principles in the present case, it is necessary to identify some misapprehension of fact or law, not solely attributable to the applicant, which materially affected this Court's judgment in the appeal.""

29The Court again considered the application of Rule 50C in Kauwenberghs v R [2009] NSWCCA 201. The Court, in applying Alramadan, held that there were three questions which required an affirmative answer before the Court would be entitled to consider varying the original set of orders. It expressed those questions in this way:

""10. The first question is whether, in considering the application for leave to appeal against sentence, the Court proceeded (or apparently proceeded) according to some misapprehension of fact or law. Unless that has occurred the application to vary the ... order must be dismissed. If it is established that the Court proceeded according to some misapprehension of fact or law, the Court must then be satisfied that the matter complained of affected its consideration of the merits of the appeal in some material way. That is, the misapprehension must be a material one. Again, unless that matter is established, the application to vary the ... order must fail. Assuming the materiality of the misapprehension of fact or law, the final question is whether it was due to the applicant's neglect or default.""

30The Court went on to say that it was essential that on an application under Rule 50C that the Court resolve the application in accordance with the principles enunciated:

""... since to do otherwise is to run the risk that the application takes on the character of an appeal or a re-hearing of the original appeal"".

31In a number of judgments since, the Court has applied this approach to applications made pursuant to Rule 50C: see R v AB (No.2) [2011] NSWCCA 256; Baghdadi v R (No. 2) [2012] NSWCCA 77; Akkawi v R (No.2) [2013] NSWCCA 72. 

32Accordingly, in considering the submissions, both written and oral, of PFC, together with the additional documentation identified, this Court will need to consider first, whether the first Court in its first judgment proceeded, or apparently proceeded, on a misapprehension of fact, or of law, and if it do so, whether any such misapprehension was material?

33If either of these questions are not answered affirmatively, then the application must be dismissed. If ultimately satisfied of each of those matters, the Court will need to consider the question of neglect or default, on the part of the applicant, before considering whether the orders should be varied.

Case Management of this Application

34As is apparent from our reasons above, it was determined that judicial case management of this application was appropriate. 

35During the course of the case management, the applicant was required to specify with precision the material upon which he relied for the purposes of this application. In seeking such specification, the Court reminded the applicant that an application under Rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules was not a ""backdoor"" pathway to re-litigate his appeal. 

36By letter dated 20 September 2014, in response to the Court's requirement that the applicant specify what he wished to rely upon for the purpose of this application, the applicant, in writing, said:

""To what I rely on for my application to re-open the appeal;

FIRST: These two pages;

SECOND: My affidavit / submissions dated 10 July 2014 which details inter alia; my grounds why my appeal was not heard on the merits of my case through no fault of my own including the fact that further exculpatory evidence has now been found and/or finally given to me by Corrective Services.

THIRD: My affidavit / submissions PART ""A"" which detail and particularise that my appeal was not heard on the merits of my case through no fault of my own, that this Court the proceeded on a misapprehension of the facts detailed and particularised in my appeal submissions filed before the hearing 11 & 24 October 2011, that this Court then misapplied the law relating to an appeal such as mine.

FOURTH: My affidavit / submissions PART ""B"" which detail and particularise inter alia; my responses to the instructing solicitor and trial counsel's affidavits and evidence to this Court which flow back into my PART ""A"".

FIFTH: My ""TENDER DOCUMENTS"".

SIXTH: Oral argument at the hearing 23 October 2014.

Note: I fully understand that an application to reopen an appeal is not a ""back door"" for me to re litigate my appeal. I submit that my appeal ""Proper"" has not been heard for the reasons detailed in the submissions referred to above!"" (sic.)

37At the commencement of the hearing, the applicant, PFC, confirmed that this document correctly set out the materials upon which he wished to rely for the purpose of the application.

38It is convenient to examine those documents to identify the basis of this application to vary the orders made in December 2011, and in particular, to identify whether the documents and PFC's oral submissions demonstrate that the Court should answer affirmatively all of the three questions which we have set out in [32] - [33] above. 

Two Page Summary of Argument

39In a two page 'Summary of Argument' forwarded to the Court on 20 September 2014, PFC submitted that his convictions were obtained by fraud. He introduced that submission in the following way:

""I, the appellant gave my instructing solicitors and my trial counsel very, very clear and precise written and verbal instructions along with exculpatory evidence under the hand of the complainants to support the fact that the complainants had conspired in a ""FRAUD"" to set me up to police with false sexual and/or indecent allegations so ""they"" could then make ""FRAUDULENT"" claims on Victim's Services for substantial gain.""

40He then asserts that the evidence before the first Court was that his trial counsel knew of these matters, and that he and his solicitor failed to put that material to the complainants in cross-examination at his trial or to lead evidence at trial. 

41PFC then put this submission:

""4. The result I submit meant that the ""FRAUD"" instigated by the complainants was allowed to transpire and continue in the trial. And that the instructing solicitors and counsel in not exposing and/or running the ""FRAUD"" as a defence and/or putting to the complainants that their allegations were in fact ""FRAUDULENT"" allowed the ""FRAUD"" to be perpetuated leading to a miscarriage of justice!

5. I submit that the clear result was that the instructing solicitors and trial counsel then became part of the ""FRAUD"", albeit through ""Flagrant Incompetence"". As detailed in my submissions Part A and Part B which include trial counsel lying to the trial Judge and not reading the exculpatory evidence that he was provided with by me and/or the instructing solicitors before and/or during the trial."" (sic.)

42PFC then goes on to submit that:

""... my case is the very rare exception in that the convictions in my case were brought about by ""FRAUD"" and that this Court has a duty to see that this injustice occasioned to me is rectified."" (sic.)

43In support of this submission, PFC draws attention to a statement of the plurality in Burrell v The Queen [2008] HCA 34; (2008) 238 CLR 218 at [15]. The extract quoted describes the principal of finality in litigation and then says:

""That fundamental tenet finds reflection in rules concerning the bringing of an action to set aside a final judgment on the ground that it was procured by fraud ... .""

There follows a reference to an earlier decision of the High Court of Australia, DJL v The Central Authority [2000] HCA 17; (2000) 201 CLR 226 at 244-245. 

44Although not specifically referred to by PFC, the balance of the paragraph in Burrell is worth setting out so as to see the real context and meaning of the judgment of the plurality. Their Honours said in[15]:

""That fundamental tenet finds reflection in rules concerning the bringing of an action to set aside a final judgment on the ground that it was procured by fraud, and in doctrines of res judicata and issue estoppel. The principal qualification to the general principle of finality is provided by the appellate system. But in courts other than the Court of final resort, the tenet also finds reflection in the restrictions upon reopening final orders after they have been formally recorded.""

45DJL was a decision with respect to a civil claim, and not a criminal matter. It was a case about orders made in the Full Court of the Family Court with respect to the application of regulations made under the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth). The High Court held by a majority that the Full Court of the Family Court did not have power to reopen final orders after their entry.

46DJL is not authority which supports the proposition contended for by PFC. The ""fraud exception"" of which it speaks is not applicable to the principle of finality as it applies in criminal cases, let alone to proceedings in the Court of Criminal Appeal. The extract from the judgment in Burrell does not support the submissions made by PFC. 

47There is nothing in this two page submission which would enable this Court to conclude that the first Court in December 2011 proceeded on any misapprehension of fact or law, sufficient to engage the jurisdiction under Rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules. 

Affidavit of 10 July 2014

48This affidavit consists of 38 pages and 15 annexures, some of which consist of multiple pages. The contents of the affidavit commence with the following statement:

""1. That I am the appellant and this affidavit relates to why my conditions of custody have affected my abilities to properly prepare grounds and, submissions, the appeal proper and this application to reopen the appeal. That I strongly believe that I have been denied procedural fairness and natural justice that led to a serious miscarriage of justice as detailed below. In particular I strongly believe that my appeal miscarried long before the judgment was delivered on 15 December 2011 and long before the need to apply under Rule 50C as detailed below!"" (sic)

49The affidavit then commences with a review of certain legal authorities and quotations, references to the rights of other inmates and then commences with a chronological description from early 2007 of attempts made, whether successful or unsuccessful, by PFC to access a computer and all of his tubs of legal documents whilst in custody at various locations. 

50Paragraph 3 of the affidavit is in the following form:

""3. I rely on two grounds to reopen the appeal: 

3.1 I was obstructed and/or prevented:

(a) from being able to properly prepare my grounds and submissions leading up to the appeal by some Correctional Officers which denied me, the appellant natural justice and procedural fairness &

(b) then from being able to conduct my appeal proper before the Court of Criminal Appeal by some Correctional Officers which again denied me, the appellant natural justice and procedural fairness.

3.2 As a consequence of a. and b. above my appeal, through no fault of my own was not able to put forward on the merits of my case and that this led to the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal misconceiving and / or misunderstanding my grounds and submissions and that this led to a serious miscarriage of justice.""

51It can be observed that the first of the bases upon which PFC puts this application is that the conditions of his custody were such as prevented him from putting all of the relevant material and submissions before the Court on the hearing of his appeal. He submits that this has resulted in a serious miscarriage of justice because the Court could not consider the material.

52As his submissions make clear, all of the events which gave rise to this submission occurred before the commencement of the hearing of his appeal in October 2011.

53If such events occurred, about which we do not need to make any findings, then the proper course was to raise the position when the hearing of the appeal commenced, so that the first Court which was hearing the appeal could make the appropriate determination about whether, and if so how, it might proceed to hear the appeal. An examination of the transcript demonstrates that, with one exception, PFC made no complaint of the kind which he now seeks to adumbrate on this application. In fact, the only reference to access to computers was at the conclusion of his oral submissions when he informed the Court, almost as an aside, that:

""... it would help if inmates had access to computers in their cells because this would not be as complicated as it is.""

54The exception to which we referred above was a specific issue which arose with respect to the conduct of the appeal surrounding a delay in access to a tub of documents on the second day of the hearing of the appeal. The transcript indicates that this issue was resolved satisfactorily by the Court adjourning until the tub of documents arrived. 

55There was no generalised complaint or submission by PFC to the first Court that he was not properly prepared for the hearing or that during the hearing he could not put all of the submissions which he wished to. 

56The submission about a miscarriage of justice on either of the two ""grounds"" nominated, does not fall within the circumstance contemplated by Rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules. The submissions do not suggest any misapprehension of fact or law in the first judgment. No passage in the first judgment is identified or even referred to. Rather, there is a generalised complaint which is unrelated to the contents of the judgment. Principle does not permit a complaint of this kind as a basis for the application of Rule 50C. 

57The balance of the affidavit deals with events which have occurred since the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal was delivered in December 2011. PFC gives evidence in this affidavit that, prior to the commencement of the argument on that day, his ""main notes and questions"" for the cross-examination of a witness, Dr Webb, were missing from his tub of documents. He says that that document became available one week later in circumstances unassociated with the hearing of his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.

58In conclusion, his affidavit states, by reference to all of the facts and circumstances set out in it, that:

""... I have not only been denied procedural fairness and natural justice. That I have been persecuted, intimidated, obstructed and discriminated against by numerous Correctional Officers intent on perverting the true course of justice.

Just as I could not prosecute this (my) appeal properly without all my legal files the same can be said for my trial counsel .... In that my trial instructing solicitor ... failed to provide [trial counsel] with; inter alia;

(a)my specific and detailed defences to each count and/or each of the allegations;

(b)my detailed responses to not only all the complainant's allegations and their police statements but also each and every Crown witnesses police statement;

(c)and the vast majority of exculpatory witness statements that I had taken, not only from the complainants over many years but also the father of the three brothers [B], Mr SB Senior and Ms Marie MINNS 

and

(d)other exculpatory evidence."" (sic)

59Attached to and forming part of the affidavit is a short submission in the following form:

""All the above I submit and strongly believe denied me natural justice and procedural fairness by preventing me from preparing proper documents to brief counsel for my appeal and/or prepare my own appeal document properly. Which I believe and I submit all led to a serious miscarriage of justice.""

60It will be observed that nowhere in the balance of the affidavit, in either the submissions which were incorporated within it or the documents annexed to it, is there any specific reference to any part of the judgment of the first Court which it is sought to ""reopen"". Nowhere does PFC identify any misapprehension of fact or misapprehension of the law in that first judgment. 

61The substance of the complaint made, and the claimed support for it in the affidavit, is that PFC did not have an adequate opportunity to properly prepare his appeal prior to the hearing of it, and in particular, on the second day of the hearing, and that his claimed limited access to computers and documents was part of an ongoing ""campaign"" against him by correctional services officers.

62He claims in the result that there has been a ""miscarriage of justice"". 

63A perusal of the transcript of the hearing of the appeal, including the transcript of the events of the morning of 24 October 2011, indicates that when the Court assembled, PFC drew the Court's attention to the missing tub of documents and the fact that he had ""missed out on about three hours of finalising my cross-examination of [trial counsel] and tidying up the paperwork this morning"". He was asked whether there would be a problem with recommencing his cross-examination of the witness who was part heard, namely his trial counsel, and he responded to the Court that there was no problem with him resuming that cross-examination as soon as his papers arrived. 

64Accordingly, the Court adjourned the commencement of the proceedings until the documents arrived and then reassembled. Upon reassembly the witness was called and re-sworn. PFC raised no complaint with the Court about any missing document, or other incapacity in asking questions. 

65The cross-examination concluded by PFC announcing that he had asked all of the questions he wished. The Court took a short break before the submissions from PFC were taken.

66When the Court resumed, the fresh evidence upon which PFC wished to rely was provided to the Court and identified by the presiding Judge. PFC then made submissions orally in addition to his written submissions. 

67At the conclusion of submissions, PFC informed the Court that he had concluded his submissions and said this:

""Well I might leave it at that and thank you for your time and it would help if inmates had access to computers in their cells because this would not be as complicated as it is. It's just so hard trying to get an hour's worth on a computer and not be repetitious, cause just trying to read the document it takes hours. Thank you your Honour, thank you gentlemen.""

68Insofar as PFC relies upon anything contained in this affidavit as forming a basis to support an application under Rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules to this Court to vary the orders of the first Court, there is simply no basis disclosed in this affidavit for that. 

69In short, PFC wishes to complain that there has been a miscarriage of justice because he says, now, that he did not have adequate access to documents to enable him to adequately argue his case.

70There is some reason to doubt that this is so, having regard to the fact that no such assertion was made to the Court at the time, and as the transcript clearly discloses, every opportunity was given to PFC to cross-examine the witnesses which he wished to, and to put all submissions upon which he wished to rely. It is clear that he did not perceive at the time, and prior to the judgment being delivered, any difficulty with respect to the process which was being followed.

71The second fundamental difficulty is a complaint which in substance amounts to a miscarriage of justice based upon the process that was followed, including PFC's ability to put all his arguments before the Court, does not fall within Rule 50C. 

72As is clear from the authorities to which we have earlier referred, the Court cannot act under Rule 50C unless it is first satisfied that in the original judgment, upon the basis of which the orders have been made, there has been some misapprehension of fact or law. 

73PFC in this affidavit asserts no misapprehension of fact or law, he gives no evidence which would allow such a conclusion to be drawn and in fact makes a complaint of a kind which is wholly irrelevant to an application under Rule 50C.

74We would not uphold this application on the basis of anything contained in this affidavit.

Part A Submissions 

75PFC's Part A submissions were filed on 25 August 2014. 

76The submissions were filed, apparently, in response to a direction that PFC file all submissions upon which he proposed to rely with respect to the application to vary orders pursuant to Rule 50C. The submissions consist of 140 pages. 

77At the commencement of the submissions, PFC sets out his three arguments with respect to the application. They are as follows:

""2. My first argument is that my appeal was not heard on the merits of my case through no fault of my own as detailed in my affidavit dated 10 July 2014 and below.

3. My second argument is that this Court then proceeded on a misapprehension of the facts detailed in my appeal submissions and now on the relevant material/documents detailed below.

4. My third argument is that this Court then misapplied the law relating to an appeal such as mine.""

78PFC points out that all of his three arguments overlap to some degree. The first argument has already been addressed and nothing further arises in this document. As we have said, it does not succeed.

79In addressing his third argument, in his submissions, PFC submits that the first Court was in error and misapprehended the law in the way in which it dealt with its obligations when considering his submission that the convictions were unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence. Alternatively expressed, his complaint is that in considering his ground of appeal that his convictions were unsafe and/or unsatisfactory, the first Court misapprehended the law. 

80The first Court dealt with this matter at [349]-[373] of the judgment.

81The judgment commences by identifying the relevant statutory provision and the legal test to be applied by a Court as set out in the decision of the High Court of Australia in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400, in the joint judgment of French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ. 

82The applicant complains that the first Court misapprehended the relevant law because it stated in [351], in reference to the judgment of the High Court of Australia in SKA, that ""the appeal was dismissed"" whereas in fact the appeal to the High Court in SKA was allowed.

83Although it is clear that the appeal to the High Court was upheld in SKA, it was upheld on a ground different from the ground argued about the relevance and availability of the trial Judge's sentencing remarks on an appeal. The passage in [351] of the first judgment refers specifically to this ground and is therefore correct. To the extent that in SKA the issue turned on the obligation of the Court of Criminal Appeal to adopt the remarks of the trial Judge about a complainant's veracity, that part of the appeal was dismissed. There is no misapprehension of the law in [351] of the first judgment. 

84Even if there was a misapprehension of the law, it was not a material one. That is because, ultimately, in the part of the first judgment to which I have referred, the first Court went through each of the offences and examined the evidence in respect to them and considered whether it was satisfied, that, in accordance with the test set forth in SKA, the appeal by PFC on the basis of an unreasonable conviction, should be upheld. It is clear that in so doing, because the evidence had previously been extensively canvassed, it was only necessary for the first Court to express its conclusions concisely. 

85In [371] the first Court noted the extent of the evidence and said that it had had regard to the evidence as a whole. It concluded its review of the material and submissions with respect to this ground by saying this:

""372. It was starkly a matter for the jury whether they found the complainants' evidence credible and reliable, to the point of satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. They saw and heard the complainants give their evidence. In our opinion it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty on each of the counts on which he was found guilty.""

86Earlier in the judgment, the Court had said that the trial Judge's views with respect to the witnesses did not weigh heavily in the task they had to perform. 

87It had also said when identifying the approach to the determination of the appeal:

""360. Although without more focussed submissions from the appellant, we must make our independent assessment of the evidence. Having in mind the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence, we must ask ourselves whether upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty, and we must ask ourselves that question in relation to each of the counts on which a verdict of guilty was returned. We have undertaken that task.""

88There is no basis for a contention that on the material before them, the Court misapprehended as a matter of law, the task upon which it was engaged in dealing with the submission of PFC that his conviction was unsafe or unsatisfactory

89The substance of the submissions by PFC in this Part A document with respect to the erroneous application of the principles set out in SKA, largely refer to other parts of the judgment in which the Court was considering other grounds of appeal. The reference in the Part A submissions to those parts of the judgment do not persuade us that there was a misapprehension of the law with respect to the task which the Court was undertaking. When the Court came to consider the ground of appeal with respect to unreasonable conviction, it set out the basis of its consideration and did so entirely correctly.

90We are wholly unpersuaded that there has been in any misapprehension of the law of any kind in the first judgment. 

91With respect to PFC's second argument, namely that there had been a misapprehension of fact in the first judgment, it must be said that the submissions in Part A are somewhat unfocussed and discursive. The submissions move readily, and without clear delineation, between the evidence adduced at the trial before Norrish DCJ and the jury, the evidence adduced as fresh evidence before the first Court, and further evidence placed before this Court which PFC contends would amount to fresh evidence if his application to reopen the appeal were allowed, and he was entitled to lead that fresh evidence. 

92The difficulty with this approach is that in an application under Rule 50C, the Court is asked to consider whether the original judgment proceeded upon a misapprehension of fact or law. That exercise necessarily is limited to the material which was before the first Court at the time it made its judgment. Leaving aside a case in which it may be possible to establish a misapprehension of fact because the record or a part of it before the Court was erroneous in a factual respect, there is no cause for this Court, when considering an application under Rule 50C, to examine documents which were not before the Court when it heard the appeal and delivered its first judgment. 

93This issue was addressed by the Court in Alramadan at [12], where it said:

""Accepting that it was necessary to reopen the appeal to call further evidence, the applicant assayed that task, but without providing any explanation as to why such further, and arguably more persuasive, material had not been presented on the appeal. Senior counsel for the applicant properly accepted that his application must be confined to material relevant to the existing grounds of appeal. In substance, the applicant has sought to reopen the appeal so as to remedy a deficiency in the material presented at the hearing. That approach would appear to fall squarely within the impermissible purpose of seeking 'by a backdoor method' to reargue an unsuccessful appeal. It cannot be justified on the criteria explained by Mason CJ in Autodesk (No.2).""

94An example in the Part A submissions of the contentions of PFC about misapprehension of fact will be sufficient to demonstrate the exercise which PFC wrongly asks this Court to engage in. 

95At paragraph 45 in the Part A document, he says:

""It is very important that this Court does its duty this time and properly scrutinises not only the above documents but also ALL that evidence referred to herein! And that all that evidence has so much probative force and weight, and that had that evidence been put to SB [a witness at the trial], the other complainants, Crown witnesses and properly before the trial Court it would have raised more than a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury and that I would have been totally acquitted by the jury.""

96This extract demonstrates that the exercise upon which PFC is engaged in the Part A submissions, with respect to questions of fact, is simply an attempt to re-argue his unsuccessful appeal by reference to documents which were not tendered at trial, nor adduced by way of fresh evidence on the appeal. 

97Nothing has been demonstrated in the Part A submissions that would indicate that the first Court misapprehended any fact on the material before it.

98The Part A submissions conclude with this statement:

""435. SUMMARY: My trial miscarried simply because:

a.No draft proof of evidence was prepared before the trial;
b.That it was then too late to prepare draft proofs after all the complainants had given evidence and the Crown case was about to close;
c.That both the instructing solicitor and trial counsel failed to read my responses and defences to the complainant's allegations set out in their police statements;

And that all these failures could not be attributed to any fault of the appellant more over the appellant did everything humanly possible to see that he received a fair trial. By providing all the material well in advance of the trial to his lawyers, namely ""Due Diligence""!"" (sic)

99The issue of whether, having regard to all of the circumstances, PFC was properly represented at the trial, and to the extent, if any, that he was not, whether a miscarriage of justice thereby occurred, was one dealt with at very great length by the first Court during its hearing including by allowing lengthy cross-examination by PFC of both his former solicitor and former counsel, and then in the first judgment. 

100There was no suggestion that PFC did not have a fair opportunity to cross-examine each of the witnesses during his appeal, coming from PFC during the course of the appeal. The transcript demonstrates that in fact he had an entirely satisfactory opportunity in this respect. 

101The arguments which are now contained within the Part A submissions, particularly with respect to the issue of the competence of solicitor and counsel, clearly represent an attempt by PFC to reargue his appeal by reference to, not just the documents which were before the Court on that appeal, but by reference to other documents, the existence of which pre-dated the appeal, and copies of which PFC had in his possession prior to the appeal, interspersed with additional evidence inserted into the submissions as though it were commentary.

102This approach is entirely impermissible on an application under Rule 50C and cannot be used in an attempt to demonstrate that the first Court misapprehended the facts or the law.

103We would not be prepared to uphold this application on the basis of anything written in the Part A submissions.

Part B Submissions

104The Part B submissions comprise 53 pages. 

105They commence with the following:

""First I remind this Court of these serious allegations against my trial counsel (a) that he lied to the trial Judge, (b) that he lied to this Court and (c) further that then conspired with the trial instructing solicitor to lie and/or deliberately mislead this Court. And that my allegations are not mere assertions from a disgruntled client. That the incriminating evidence comes from both trial counsel and the instructing solicitor's own evidence to this Court detailed in Part A and in Part B below!"" (sic.)

106The substance of the submissions in Part B is that PFC sets out in detail reference to additional material which was not before the first Court by reference to each relevant paragraph of the affidavit of his trial counsel dated 14 June 2011. That affidavit was obtained by the Crown prior to the hearing of the appeal in 2011, and formed the evidence in chief of his trial counsel to the first Court. It was on the basis of that affidavit and other material in the possession of PFC, that PFC conducted a cross-examination of his trial counsel during the hearing of the appeal.

107As we have said, there is no reason to doubt, from a careful reading of that cross-examination, that PFC had every opportunity to ask all relevant questions which he wished to raise. 

108In respect of a number of paragraphs of trial counsel's affidavit, the Part B submissions contain assertions of fact as to whether the contents of that affidavit are factually true and factually correct. For example, where trial counsel has given a factual account of what transpired between he and PFC in the course of one or another conference, in these Part B submissions, PFC gives a contrary account or else a supplementary account of material that was also disclosed, and invites this Court to conclude that there was a misapprehension of fact in the first judgment. 

109It cannot be doubted that this material could have been, and if relevant, should have been, put before the first Court . If, having cross-examined his trial solicitor and trial counsel, PFC asserted that there were factual errors, he was at liberty to apply to the Court then hearing the matter to take his evidence orally setting out what those factual inconsistencies were. He made no such application.

110It is simply not open to this Court to take assertions of fact of this kind into account in determining an application under Rule 50C to vary the order which was made. 

111The Part B submissions conclude with these paragraphs:

""275. That finalises my responses to [trial counsel] and [trial solicitor]'s affidavits and their evidence.

276. Two final matters the first I submit that this Court must under it's mandate scrutinise my responses and/or defences that I provided to [both trial lawyers] to the complainants and Crown witnesses police statements that both [trial lawyers] failed to read and/or examine and put before the trial Court!

277. The second that this Court must according to Law also scrutinise all the documents and/or exculpatory statements that are now included in my folder marked ""TENDER DOCUMENTS""! "" (sic)

112It is abundantly clear from reading the Part B submissions that they are in substance directed to rearguing the appeal which has already been heard and determined. 

113There is simply nothing in these submissions addressing the question of how the first Court in its judgment so misapprehended the facts or the law as to mean that the orders dismissing the appeal ought be reopened and varied. We are not persuaded that PFC has demonstrated any misapprehension of fact or law in the first judgment.

114There is simply nothing in the Part B submissions that would enable this Court to exercise its jurisdiction to vary the order of the first Court.

Bundle of Tender Documents

115PFC has provided to the Court a bundle of tender documents. It is 452 pages in length. It includes many documents that were tendered at the trial or else relied upon in the first Court, and documents which were not. All of the documents, according to the dates contained in the index prepared by PFC, came into existence prior to April 2009, and certainly before the commencement of the trial before Norrish DCJ and the jury. 

116Many of the documents are specific responses prepared by the appellant to the police statements of various witnesses, copies of various police statements taken at different times in respect of the same witnesses and in respect of different witnesses, statements apparently taken by or prepared on behalf of PFC from various of the witnesses, and extensive copies of correspondence between the appellant and his trial lawyers, both solicitor and counsel. 

117As all of these documents were created by PFC, or else pre-existed the trial of PFC and were available to him, prior to that time, it follows that if he regarded any of them as being relevant to the hearing of the appeal in 2011, then he was obliged to seek to put them before the first Court. If he did not do so, then that is not a reason why he can apply on the basis of further documents to vary the order of the first Court pursuant to Rule 50C. 

118The substance of the documents appear to go to the issue which was before the Court on the appeal, namely, whether the conduct of his defence by his trial lawyers, solicitor and counsel, was competent and appropriate in the circumstances. That issue was fully ventilated and determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal. What occurs in submissions by reference to these documents is plainly an attempt by PFC to re-argue his appeal.

119There is nothing revealed in the additional 450 pages of documents in the tender bundle which, of itself, would occasion this Court to conclude that the first Court in its judgment misapprehended the facts. 

120We would not accede to PFC's application under Rule 50C based upon this material.

Oral Submissions

121The final material to which it is necessary to refer are the oral submissions to this Court on the hearing of this application.

122In fact, and helpfully so, PFC reduced those submissions to 36 pages of writing in one set of submissions, and 5 pages in another set of submissions, and provided copies to the Court. He had some short supplementary oral submissions.

123In the longer of the two sets of submissions, PFC concentrates on two principal issues. The first deals with the competence of his trial lawyers. The second deals with a discrete question with respect to the offence constituted by Count 12 on the Indictment.

124Insofar as the submission referred to the conduct of his trial before Norrish DCJ and the jury by his trial lawyers, PFC by reference to material not before the trial Court or the first Court , repeats, perhaps rather more stridently than earlier, his submissions that his trial miscarried because of their incompetence. Because the additional material was integral to, and the basis of, these submissions, which were put to and determined by the first Court, it is plain that this Court cannot accede to them. They do not show that the Court in its first judgment misapprehended the facts or the law.

125Insofar as Count 12 is concerned, PFC submits that his conviction was erroneous because an essential element, namely that the complainant SB was under his authority in 2003 when he is alleged to have had sexual intercourse with him, was not proved because SB only came under his authority in 2004. The Court of Criminal Appeal specifically considered this issue. In [200] and [201], it referred to the evidence, concisely, that was before the jury on this issue. It concluded that there was no misdirection of law about that evidence, and that the conviction was not unreasonable. We detect no misapprehension of fact or law in the first judgment on these issues. In so doing, we do not accede to the invitation of PFC to undertake this exercise by reference to the further material which he placed before this Court.

126In our view, the substance of the oral submissions (including those referred to in writing) of PFC was an attempt to re-argue his appeal. They do not demonstrate any misapprehension of fact or law in the first judgment. 

Conclusion

127We have earlier referred to the three questions of which it is necessary for an applicant to persuade this Court, before an order under Rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules can be made. 

128The applicant, PFC, has, for the reasons which have been outlined, wholly failed to persuade the Court that his application should succeed. He has demonstrated no misapprehension of fact or law in the first judgment. 

Orders

129The Court makes the following order:

(2)Application pursuant to Rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules to vary the orders entered by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 15 December 2011 dismissed.

		30 October 2014",2014-10-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765163,Clark v R [2014] NSWCCA 236,"Judgment

1LEEMING JA: The appellant, Mr Peter Frederick Clark, applies for leave to appeal from his conviction on 31 August 2011 following a trial over 14 days before a judge and jury of twelve of the single charge on which he was indicted: 

""Between the 11th and the 13th day of October 2004 at Sydney and other places in the State of New South Wales, did engage in conduct that had a tendency to pervert the course of justice, namely, being required to present a mini-cassette recording and a CD that were in his possession for such examination as may be directed by Court, did take steps to make such documents unavailable for suitable directions by the Court, with the intention that engaging in such conduct would pervert the course of justice.""

2On 15 September 2011, Freeman DCJ imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 2 years and 8 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years. That sentence was to commence from 7 June 2020, in consequence of the fact that Mr Clark was already serving sentences imposed following his convictions for offences largely unrelated to that the subject of this appeal. It is not presently necessary to set out the details of those offences or their procedural history. Nor is it necessary to summarise in full the history of the various civil proceedings instituted by Mr Clark (much of which may be found in Clark v State of New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 673; 66 NSWLR 640 and Clark v State of New South Wales; Clark v Robards [2014] NSWSC 742), although it will be necessary to address aspects of them briefly, because it was the conduct of Mr Clark in his own civil proceedings that gave rise to the charge on which he was indicted and convicted and which is the subject of this appeal. 

Mr Clark's civil proceedings in 2004

3Mr Clark was arrested by Detective Senior Constable Cusack on 11 June 1997 and charged with aggravated indecent assault pursuant to s 61A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). A trial took place in the Burwood Local Court on 23 October 1997, where the charge of aggravated indecent assault was withdrawn and Mr Clark was charged with and pleaded not guilty to a count of aggravated sexual assault pursuant to s 61M of the Crimes Act 1900. He was convicted and ordered to perform 200 hours community service. The conviction was set aside on appeal to the District Court. The indictment which gave rise to Mr Clark's conviction in 2011 arose out of the trial of civil proceedings brought by Mr Clark against the State of New South Wales following his successful appeal.

4Mr Clark then commenced proceedings in the District Court in 1998 by ordinary statement of claim. He commenced separate proceedings in the Supreme Court in 2001 by summons. The District Court proceedings had joined Senior Constable Thomas Cusack as a defendant but the sole defendant in the Supreme Court proceedings was the State of New South Wales. The statement of claim in the Supreme Court refers to other occasions (on 21 February 2000 and 29 February 2000) when Mr Clark was arrested and charged, but for present purposes what matters is the conduct of Detective Senior Constable Cusack. The pleading alleged malicious prosecution, false arrest, false imprisonment and abuse of process arising, inter alia, from the allegation that Detective Senior Constable Cusack had sought to solicit a bribe from Mr Clark. Mr Clark sought damages, including aggravated and exemplary damages. The pleading was verified by Mr Clark and filed by his then solicitor. 

5Mr Clark's civil proceeding came on for hearing before Wood CJ at CL on Monday 11 October 2004. Mr Clark was represented by senior and junior counsel. Senior counsel (Mr Steirn SC) had only recently been retained following the return of the brief by his predecessor (Mr Graham Ellis SC). On 12 October 2004, Mr Steirn stated that in his submission the matter was not ready to proceed, although his instructions were to proceed. He elaborated by reference to what he described as ""the main plank of the plaintiff's case"", a tape recording of what Detective Senior Constable Cusack had said to Mr Clark upon his arrest on 11 June 1997, in these terms: 

""CUSACK: Are you a player?

PLAINTIFF: Pardon?

CUSACK: Are you a player?

PLAINTIFF: I don't understand.

CUSACK: Once we go through that door you will be charged. For 50 grand you could walk.

PLAINTIFF: I haven't done anything.

CUSACK: I know the kid is full of shit. 

...

For 50 grand you walk. No charge, no publicity.

PLAINTIFF: You do what you want to do but I won't pay anything.

CUSACK: Well, I'll burn you and Chris Murphy.""

6Mr Steirn added that ""Mr Murphy, of course, is the solicitor who was to be instructed at the time"". 

7Mr Steirn said that on his instructions, Mr Clark had recorded the conversation on a pocket recorder, kept the cassette, and had transferred it to a CD. He said:

""When I came into the matter I took the view that Mr Clark, as a matter of law, was entitled to record that conversation pursuant to s 5(3)(1) of the Listening Devices Act on the basis that he had a legitimate right to protect and consequently the matter would come before you, before this court at least, as original evidence pursuant to s 5 of the Act. Not unnaturally I required the original tape and the enhanced version relied upon to be played in my presence. 

The consequence was that I was unable to hear that tape and, at least as far as I'm concerned, I could not hear what was supposed to be on the enhanced version. As a consequence of that I listened to what I was told was the original tape and I share the same views as those others who listened to it. You cannot intelligently decipher what was said on the original tape.""

8After some discussion, there was a short adjournment following which there was this exchange:

""HIS HONOUR: Let me get it clear. Mr Steirn, your client wants to proceed, does he not, and your advice is he should seek an adjournment.

STEIRN: Precisely.

KOSTOPOULOS: It has just changed. He wants an adjournment.""


9(Mr Clark told the Court from the dock in the course of the hearing of his appeal that he had given those altered instructions to his solicitor, who relayed them to Mr Kostopoulos, the junior retained to appear for him.) 

10Counsel appearing for the State consented to the adjournment, and asked for costs to be reserved. He then asked for a direction that an affidavit be filed and served in relation to the original and enhanced copies of the tape recording, which was not opposed by Mr Steirn. Thereupon, his Honour made this direction: 

""I will direct that the plaintiff file and serve upon the defendant by 5.00pm on Monday next an affidavit identifying the original tape and all enhancements which have been made thereof, together with a list of the persons who have been involved in undertaking enhancements and of the date of those enhancements. I note that the parties will bring in some short minutes to establish a joint regime for the further testing and possible enhancement of the original tape.""

11The consent to an adjournment advised by Mr Kostopoulos appears on p 8 of the transcript of the hearing of that day, and the direction to produce an affidavit on p 9. There was a live question whether Mr Clark was in court when the direction was made, although there is no doubt that his lawyers were.

12The matter was relisted before his Honour on 25 October 2004. However, there was no production of the original tape and any enhancements to it by Mr Clark. The judge was told that it had been destroyed. Mr Clark's lawyers applied, and were granted leave, to cease to act for him. Mr Clark was told by the judge that he would ""well be advised to seek some legal advice, because what occurs from here on in may be highly relevant as to whether you have committed a criminal offence and also as to whether you are guilty of contempt of court in destroying what was to be a potential exhibit in the proceedings"".

13That warning from the judge, and his former lawyers ceasing to act for him, was a consequence not merely of the non-compliance with the Court's direction, but also of a series of letters written by Mr Clark on the afternoon of 11 October 2004. They were prominent in his subsequent trial, where they were tendered. One was to his solicitor, Mr Walsh, and junior and senior counsel which included the following: 

""You only had to get me in the witness box I would have produced the original and the CD both crystal clear. 

How many times did I say that I wanted to get the tapes before a Judge then it would be in his hands, over and over I have stated this?

That's all you have to do get me in the witness box, the court was the only entity that I would trust with the original tape and copy. 

...

If only you had put me on the stand, well on the way back to Taree I destroyed the original crystal clear tape and CD. They are scattered from Sydney to my home.""

14Mr Clark also wrote directly to the judge, on the same day, but in different terms:

""Your Honour Justice Wood

Dear sir

My Name is Peter Clark and you may recall seeing me in the Public Gallery of Court 11E today, I am the plaintiff in Clark Vs The State of NSW.

Late this afternoon I received a telephone call from my solicitor Greg Walsh in response to a facsimile I sent to my senior counsel (copy page two).

Mr Walsh said that I might have contravened orders that you made after I had left the court. I became extremely upset that the matter was going to be adjourned again and that I might never get to cross-examine Police Officer Cusack.

Annoyed, frustrated at both parties senior counsel I destroyed the original tape and CD copy in the elevator as I left the building.

If I did contravene your orders it was not my intention to do so and it was done in the heat of the moment. This matter has been dragging on since 1997 finally when I could see the finish line it was swept away from me again.""

15Ultimately, the civil proceedings were dismissed as an abuse of process: Clark v State of New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 673; 66 NSWLR 640. However, an appeal was allowed in part: Clark v State of New South Wales [2012] NSWCA 139. Aspects of those proceedings continue in the Common Law Division: see Clark v State of New South Wales; Clark v Robards [2014] NSWSC 742. Nothing in these reasons should be read as bearing upon those civil proceedings, which are not before this Court.

Mr Clark's criminal trial in 2008

16Mr Clark was not prosecuted for contempt, but he was charged, in 2008, with attempting to pervert the course of justice. The subject of the indictment was the destruction or making unavailable of the original tape and CD recording of the conversation with Senior Constable Cusack. The original indictment was amended at the commencement of the criminal trial, in August 2011, and the difference is the subject of one of Mr Clark's supplementary grounds of appeal. The trial took place over 14 days, at which Mr Clark's former counsel Mr Ellis SC, Mr Steirn SC and Mr Kostopoulos, and former solicitor and paralegal Mr Walsh and Ms Mileski gave evidence and were cross-examined, as were various police officers, excluding Senior Constable Cusack (his absence features prominently in Mr Clark's grounds of appeal and submissions). Mr Clark also gave evidence and was cross-examined. Some delays were caused by the sickness of two jurors. On 25 August 2011, Mr Clark advised that he wished to call his previous barrister, Mr Robert Webb, and two other witnesses, and needed an adjournment; that application was refused and forms one of the grounds of the appeal.

17In issue at his trial was whether Mr Clark had been present in court when the judge directed the production of the affidavit concerning the tape and enhancements of it. Mr Clark gave evidence and was cross-examined, and maintained that he was not aware of the orders because he had left the courtroom. He was cross-examined about the discrepancy in his letters between the tape being destroyed in the Supreme Court building inside the elevator, and on his way back to Taree. He maintained that he destroyed the mini-cassette by crushing it in his hand in the elevator. He said that he also crushed the CD. It was suggested to him that his testimony was absolutely false, which he denied. 

18Mr Clark was also cross-examined about a letter written to him by Mr Walsh dated 14 October 2004, which included the following:

""I further note that when I spoke to you on the afternoon of 12th October 2004, you informed me that you did not know of the Orders made by His Honour Justice Wood. I have spoken to my employed Solicitor, Pamela Mileski, and she has made it very clear to me that she spoke to you after you had left the Court and explained carefully to you the subject Orders. In this regard, I also wish to place on the record that you had specifically provided the instructions to seek the adjournment after initially wanting the matter to proceed. 

I note that I expressed my grave concerns about your conduct and that I indicated I could no longer act on your behalf and that I was bitterly disappointed as to your conduct in the matter.""

Procedural history of the appeal

19Mr Clark's appeal from his conviction has had an unfortunate procedural history, which must be mentioned in order to explain the grounds presently being raised, and an application made by him after judgment was reserved.

20Mr Clark's appeal has been adjourned on four occasions when it was listed for hearing (on 25 February 2013, 15 March 2013, 30 April 2013 and 12 June 2013). His grounds of appeal have been formulated apparently without the assistance of a lawyer. They have been substantially amended from time to time. In their final form, they constituted nine grounds (see ""Final Grounds of Appeal"" dated 4 October 2013, with the note ""this document supersedes all previous submissions"") and a further three supplementary grounds provided on the morning the appeal was heard (marked MFI ""A""). Mr Clark confirmed when the appeal was heard that those 12 grounds were the grounds on which he now relied.

21Mr Clark also provided, on the day the appeal was listed for hearing, an affidavit of 224 paragraphs and thirteen annexures and further submissions. Most of the affidavit addressed matters which took place years before, although some addressed Mr Clark's current conditions in prison. It was regrettable that it was provided to the Crown and the Court on the day the matter was heard (there having been an exchange of written submissions, including those of 219 paragraphs from Mr Clark filed on 15 October 2013). It may also be noted that aspects of the affidavit make serious allegations of misconduct against lawyers who formerly represented Mr Clark, police officers and officers of various correctional centres. However, rather than having the appeal adjourned for a fourth time, the parties acceded, pragmatically, to the course of determining whether the appeal could be heard notwithstanding the service of that affidavit. As will be seen below, I have formed the view that Mr Clark's appeal, as ultimately formulated, can be determined on its merits without the need to say anything more about that affidavit. 

22Finally, three days after judgment was reserved, Mr Clark filed a motion seeking to re-open his appeal to introduce new evidence explaining the events the subject of his conviction. By a written submission in response, the Crown resisted that evidence being received. This falls into a different category from the foregoing, and is addressed separately below.

23In what follows, I address each of Mr Clark's grounds and supplementary grounds of appeal, and his application made after judgment was reserved to reopen the appeal. I have reproduced Mr Clark's grounds verbatim as they appear in his written document. It must be said that as well as an unusual written style, Mr Clark shows a capacity to produce very long, sometimes repetitive, sometimes rambling, submissions. It would be unhelpful to reproduce the written submissions in their entirety or to summarise them in these reasons; instead, I have sought to capture their essence, insofar as they relate to each particular ground of appeal. 

Ground 1

""'The Missing Witness': The appellant's defences were inter alia; that the recording of the 'Bribe' was genuine and that he needed to examine and/or cross examine former Police Officer Thomas CUSACK on the authenticity of the 'Bribe' recording. The said CUSACK refused to answer the Crown's subpoena to give evidence this led to a serious Miscarriage of Justice!""

24During the course of the trial, the Crown advised the Court that the former police officer Thomas Cusack had not been served with a subpoena to attend. On 16 August 2011 (the fifth day of the trial) the Crown advised that Mr Cusack had told another police officer that ""This thing has ruined my life. I don't want to have anything more to do with this case"". On 18 August 2011, evidence was tendered that Thomas Cusack had been medically discharged from the NSW Police Force on 10 August 2007 as a result of a workplace injury (exhibit M). The officer through whom the certificate was tendered was cross-examined, briefly, by Mr Clark. 

25During the cross-examination of the appellant, the Crown tendered a statement of Thomas Cusack prepared on 12 June 1997. It was tendered without any objection from Mr Clark. 

26Mr Clark advanced written submissions of 83 paragraphs in support of this ground. His essential point was that part of the Crown case was that the recording of the bribe conversation was not authentic, and that his defence ""was and is simple"". As it was put in writing: 

""he had to prove to the Jury; 
that the recording was genuine and true, 
that the appellant did destroy the mini cassette tape because it was 'useless and undecipherable' in 'Self-Defence' and/or out of 'Necessity'...""

27The appellant said that an inference should be drawn from the absence of Mr Cusack that the recording was genuine; he went further and ""also submits that 'inference' is not warranted in this matter that it is a conclusion far beyond reasonable doubt that the recording was genuine and that is why Cusack refused to set foot in the witness box let alone inside the courtroom"". 

28The written submissions continue, at some length, to maintain that Mr Clark would have been able to confront Mr Cusack with his voice on the recording at the trial. He concluded that ""the main point"" of this ground was that:

""the jury were denied the opportunity of comparing Cusack's voice to what was on the CD's the appellant still had in his possession and that he wanted to tender when cross-examining Cusack.

The appellant was denied due process, natural justice, procedural fairness and unable to put his defences to the jury. Without Cusack in the witness box and the jury hearing the CD of the bribe and able to compare Cusack's voice to what was on the CD the trial miscarried!""

29It will be seen that Mr Clark maintained, even in 2011, that he retained possession of copies of the bribe conversation. Indeed, during his sentencing remarks, the trial judge said: 

""Mr Clark, of course, somewhat surprisingly claims to still have a number of copies of the CD. It was always his intention he says to somehow surprise Officer Cusack with this recording when the Officer was giving evidence in whatever forum could be arranged. Quite how he could manage to do this I do not understand and it has never been satisfactorily explained. Mr Clark's knowledge of the law is patchy and appears, in any event, to be subject to his belief in what he ought to be allowed to do rather than what he would be allowed to do. In any event it is not clear to me how he was going to surprise Officer Cusack in a broader sense since knowledge of the alleged existence of a recording had been, on his own case, an open secret for years. 

Police knowledge of the so-called recording was the motivation, he claimed, for the various attacks and false accusations from which he has suffered over the years since 1998.""

30The short answer to this ground is that, as the primary judge said in his summing up to the jury, the authenticity of the tape was not necessary to establish the appellant's guilt of the offence. The purpose of the order made on 11 October 2004, was to determine whether the recording was genuine; Mr Clark's non-production has meant that its authenticity or otherwise remains unknown. Further, for reasons addressed in response to ground 4.3 below, the course which Mr Clark wished to adopt would not have occurred on any view of events. 

31Another complaint made by Mr Clark is that there are references in the written submissions of the Crown to a ""medical certificate"" from Mr Cusack. Those references are less than perfectly accurate, but nothing turns on that.

32It is also convenient here to deal with a related submission made by Mr Clark, that there was error in permitting Mr Cusack's statement to be put into evidence. This occurred during the cross-examination of Mr Clark. Within the Crown case, there was evidence that Mr Cusack had left the police force and did not wish to come to Court. He was not called. The statement was put to Mr Clark during cross-examination, without objection. In the circumstances of this trial, no error is thereby shown.

Ground 2

""FRESH and/or NEW EVIDENCE: The Crown (Police) failed in their 'Duty of Disclosure' concealing exculpatory evidence. Namely the appellant's statement dated 20 October 2004 to Justice Wood relating to the 'Chain of Evidence' re the bribe recording and copies thereof this led to a Miscarriage of Justice!""

33Mr Clark's submissions incorporate what he says was a six page letter of 53 single spaced paragraphs dated 20 October 2004 sent by him directly to Justice Wood. It commences ""Dear Sir, I claim privileged and/or request this document be withheld from the Defendant pending a formal enquiry into Mr Steirn's conduct..."". The letter recorded Mr Clark's belief that his barrister had ""tipped off"" Mr Cusack that he had told the defendants about the mini tape and that Cusack, on the morning of 12 October 2004 in court, had looked at him ""with a big grin as if he knows the mini-tape and the other copies of the bribe are useless"". The letter continued: 

""Why would or could Steirn tip Cusack off against written instructions that I had recorded him soliciting the bribe? Nothing made any sense, only that I was being screwed by my lawyers. I was terrified that if Cusack caught me with the tape he would murder me just like in the Rogerson matters or hurt my family especially my grandson ... I had to escape I walked out the courtroom and ran to the elevator as I did I crushed the mini tape and CD in my pocket.

I put the first spool of the mini tape in my mouth and chewed it up. I ran back to chambers to collect my bag as it had my car keys in. As I was leaving Ms Mileski came out the elevator stating, 'I wondered where you went, Clive wants to see you at 2 o'clock, the matter's been adjourned, his Honour also wants a chain of evidence'. I said, 'Okay' and left. I was not going to meet Steirn he had to go.""

34The Crown does not, for the purpose of this appeal, accept that any such letter was sent to Justice Wood. It is not established that such a letter was written. The transcript of 25 October 2004 records his Honour stating that ""a letter has been sent to me personally from the plaintiff of 2 October"". That letter is reproduced above. There is no mention in the transcript of a second letter. Even if there was a second letter, it is not established that there was any breach of the Crown's duty of disclosure; on its face, the letter was not sent to the Crown, and was the subject of a claim of ""privilege"". There is nothing to indicate that it ever came into the possession of the Crown. Even if the letter existed and came into the possession of the Crown, it is not established that it was unavailable to Mr Clark in 2011 (it is on its face a letter from him, and it is not shown that it was unavailable to him in the preparation of this appeal). Moreover, and fundamentally, it is not shown that any failure by Mr Clark to have such letter if it existed would have had any material impact on the trial. 

Ground 3

""FRESH and/or NEW EVIDENCE: Corrective Services New South Wales denied the appellant access to the same statement referred to above during the trial. Namely the appellant's statement dated 20 October 2004 to Justice Wood relating to the Chain of Evidence re the bribe recording and copies thereof this led to a Miscarriage of Justice!""

35This ground is related to the second. The appellant claims that he had made, before and during the trial, written and verbal applications to officers at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre to have access to all his legal files. He asserts that this did not occur, that one officer demanded a covert corrupt payment of $1000 to allow Mr Clark access to a computer and that, as a result of the State's breach of duty of care, he was assaulted by another inmate and threatened and assaulted by another officer. True it is that in the lengthy affidavit served when the appeal was heard, Mr Clark gives some evidence supporting of this (serious) claim. In the particular circumstances of this appeal, and despite the seriousness of the allegations, it is not necessary to take that matter any further. For the reasons given in relation to ground 2, the non-production of the letter of 20 October 2004 (assuming it existed) is not shown to have been a consequence of those matters, and in any event, would not materially have altered the course of the trial. 

Ground 4

36This ground comprises a series of seven complaints relating to the way in which the trial was conducted. Some complaints are specific, others are general. 

37The first complaint in this ground is specific: that ""his Honour failed to follow up on the appellant's application for a laptop computer to be made available to the Court to demonstrate to the Court how CDs are activated by the Windows operating system"" and ""to demonstrate, play and compare"" copies of the conversations and put the same to various Crown witnesses. There was a debate, on the first day of the trial, which concluded inconclusively, directed to the availability of a computer. His Honour said ""I'm going to make inquiry about whether we have a suitable cleansed machine. I don't know, however, how much that demonstration will really convey because I dare say - "". At that point, Mr Clark interrupted his Honour and maintained that some members of the jury were not computer literate. The exchange ended inconclusively. The question appears not subsequently to have been reagitated. It is not established by Mr Clark that in any respect was he denied a fair trial by the course taken subsequently. 

38The second element of this ground (ground 4.2) is that it is said that the trial judge erred in allowing Mr Clark's later convictions in 2006 and 2009 to be put before the jury: 

""which included;

a. multiple aggravated sexual assaults,
b. multiple aggravated indecent assaults,
c. multiple pervert the course of justice,
d. possession of child pornography &
e. procurement for child pornography.""

39Mr Clark's point is that the jury should not have been exposed to convictions which occurred after he destroyed the tape. Illustrative of his submission is paragraph 135 (emphasis in original): 

""The Crown then put before the jury inter alia; the appellant's conviction in 2009, five years after the appellant destroyed the tape, this allowed material that was at the highest end of prejudicial material to be misused by the jury obtained at the trial.""

40There is nothing in this element of this ground of appeal. First, once character is put in issue, there is no rule preventing convictions occurring after the events giving rise to the charge from being put to the jury. The contrary is the case.

41Secondly, Mr Clark was advised, in the strongest terms, against the course he proposed. That came about in this way.

42At the commencement of the trial (and in the absence of the jury) Mr Clark handed a written outline of his defence to the Court. His Honour immediately asked: 

""Well as to Mr Clark's intention to adduce evidence of his character and his antecedents does he run any risk by doing so Mr Crown? Does Mr Clark run any risk by his intended course of adducing evidence as to his character and antecedents?""

43The Crown indicated that if general good character was asserted, there would be an application by the Crown for evidence in rebuttal. Mr Clark confirmed that that was his case, leading to this exchange: 

""ACCUSED: Yes I understand what you're saying your Honour yes. And it is my intention to raise my character and the antecedents your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: I see alright well as long as you understand that you thereby run some risk. 

ACCUSED: I understand that I run a great risk.""

44On 18 August 2011, the matter was debated. His Honour said that ""you can't imagine more prejudicial material"" and ""it seems to me to serve absolutely no purpose except one adverse to your interest in letting this material be read by the jury"". Mr Clark said: 

""I understand what you're saying, your Honour, but it is my intention to raise my character and put before the jury these false allegations that have been made and take the jury through what's happened to me since I took on this Mr Cusack.""

His Honour continued: 

""Well, you see, you want to let in all this extremely damaging material, and the only thing you can say against it is that some jury wasn't convinced beyond reasonable doubt. That leaves you in an indefensible position.""

The Crown placed it on the record that if Mr Clark did lead evidence of himself having been falsely accused of impropriety with young boys, he would be compelled to lead evidence of his being convicted in respect of about 20 matters. Mr Clark then said: 

""I'll put those convictions before the jury. 

HIS HONOUR: Why on earth would you do that?

ACCUSED: Your Honour, it is my defence and my character that I'm putting before the jury. Now I have a fundamental right to put my character, good or bad, before the jury and let the jury decide what happened. 

HIS HONOUR: How can the jury decide otherwise than that you are a person of bad character if you've been convicted of paedophilic activities? 

ACCUSED: Well, that is still subject to the appeal, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: At the moment you are convicted.

ACCUSED: I understand that and that's what I will put to the jury.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, what concerns me is whether Mr Clark is laying a foundation for a mistrial on the basis of his own incompetence.""

45Mr Clark denied that. The exchange concluded: 

""HIS HONOUR: Well, Mr Clark, look, in the strongest terms I suggest to you that you do not do this. The one thing that an accused does not want a jury to know is that he's a convicted paedophile.

ACCUSED: Well, I understand what you're saying, your Honour, but it is my intention to raise these convictions and put the evidence before the jury. Put the character before the jury, put the facts before the jury. The jury are the finders of fact. 

HIS HONOUR: The facts are that you're a convicted sexual criminal. 

ACCUSED: Yes, your Honour, I agree, at the moment those facts still stand.

HIS HONOUR: Oh dear, Mr Clark. Do think about this between now and 2 o'clock because it seems to me that this is almost incomprehensible that you would want the jury to know that.

ACCUSED: Well, I understand what you're saying your Honour, but I believe the jury are twelve reasonable people who will come to the right conclusion. The only way to do that is to put all of Peter Clark before the jury and the facts. 

HIS HONOUR: Well, I've given you such a caution as I can. I'll resume at 2 o'clock.""

46The numerous convictions of Mr Clark were put into evidence, substantially in the way which had been contemplated in the exchange reproduced above. The trial judge gave a direction to the jury designed to ensure that the jury did not use the evidence impermissibly, about which no complaint is made. 

47The Crown submits that rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules has particular application here, where the course taken occurred in an informed way, following warnings given by the trial judge which were entirely appropriate and as strong as possible, consistent with his Honour's position presiding over the trial. 

48I agree. Leave should not be granted to permit this ground to be raised. Lest it be thought that this be unduly harsh in respect of an unrepresented litigant, who might not be thought to be aware of the rules, it should be added that Mr Clark was an experienced litigant, and was plainly aware of the fact that rule 4 stood in the way of taking a point on appeal that had not been made at trial. When for example the primary judge refused Mr Clark's application to supply a written submission to the jury, there was this exchange:

""HIS HONOUR: You've pressed for it, but I reject it.

ACCUSED: That's okay, your Honour. That covers me with rule 4, I think.""

49That said, it is clear that leave should be granted if there is an error which has led to a miscarriage of justice: see Carney v R; Cambey v R [2011] NSWCCA 223; 217 A Crim R 201 at [67]. However, there was no miscarriage of justice when Mr Clark, even allowing for the fact that he was representing himself, chose to take a course which turned out to be ill-advised, well knowing the risks he was running. 

50Ground 4.3 is that:

""The appellant could not properly cross-examine Crown witnesses as His Honour denied the appellant's request to obtain the CD attached to solicitor Gregory WALSH's affidavit on file in the Supreme Court.""

51The Crown's written submissions claimed (paragraph 99) that none of Mr Clark's written submissions addressed this aspect of ground 4. In fact it is mentioned, but only briefly, in paragraph 167 of Mr Clark's written submissions (which do not precisely follow the order of the grounds). Mr Clark's oral submissions on ground 4 did not address it. It is not shown that the two CDs of sound recordings annexed to Mr Walsh's affidavit had any bearing on the trial. 

52This is related to a point which Mr Clark plainly regarded both at the time, and in 2014, as important, namely, his idea that it would be possible if only Mr Cusack entered the witness box, to cross-examine him with devastating effect by playing the recording. Indeed, Mr Clark's submissions stated that he was mentored by a barrister when he was a teenager, and continued (para 178):

""[The barrister] also taught me one other very important thing when it comes to trials you get the witness to confirm the lie under oath 'that it didn't happen'. Then you confront them with the truth namely the appellant would have pulled a copy of the CD out of his pocket and CUSACK would have been exposed in front of the jury! I submit that 1 single deliberate lie exposed would have had an overwhelming effect on the jury!""

53This was plainly an issue at the trial. It led to this statement in the trial judge's summing up to the jury:

""The scenario which Mr Clark has built up in his mind of having Cusack in the box, and Mr Clark being able to produce triumphantly the tape, and so, 'Gotcha, you're a liar', was never going to come to pass. He would have had to give evidence first of the existence of the tape otherwise he could not have used it in cross-examination. And as soon as the tape was mentioned any court would direct that it be tested, because the question of whether it was true or not is absolutely central to its value.""

54Mr Clark submits, repeatedly, that that statement and others to the same effect by the judge and the Crown, caused error. That is not so.

55Accepting that on occasion it is possible in a civil trial to cross-examine a witness on a document not previously produced, it is quite plain that where as here there had been a direction to produce the sound recordings, which had not been complied with, and which founded the charge, as soon as any such attempt was made, the course explained by the trial judge would have taken place. Mr Clark's belief in the feasibility of the course he wished to follow is misplaced. So are his complaints when the trial judge pointed out as much to him. That suffices to address a substantial aspect of Mr Clark's grounds of appeal, and the same reasoning addresses ground 4.3 to the extent (if at all) it is pressed.

56Ground 4.4 is that:

""His Honour denied the appellant's application to have SB called to give evidence to rebut the Crown's allegation that 3,000 child pornographic images had been found on the appellant's computer.""

57This overlaps with ground 6 and is addressed below.

58Ground 4.5 is in general terms:

""The learned trial Judge failed to keep proper control of the proceedings.""

59This ground is developed at paragraphs 132-167 of the written submissions. Those paragraphs focus on the placing of convictions before the jury, and Mr Clark's wish to have SB give evidence. All aspects of those paragraphs are addressed under other grounds, especially ground 6 below.

60The sixth element of this ground is:

""4.6 The learned trial Judge misdirected the Jury.""

61This is addressed in paragraphs 168-178 of Mr Clark's submissions. Those submissions are directed to Mr Clark's complaint that the judge erred in instructing the jury that Mr Clark's preferred course of confronting Mr Cusack with the sound recording was not feasible. It has already been addressed.

62Ground 4 concludes with:

""4.7 The appellant submits that all the above led to a miscarriage of justice!""

63That does not advance Mr Clark's position on the appeal.

Ground 5

""The trial miscarried in that the verdict of the jury was perverse, unsafe and/or unreasonable and/or unsatisfactory having regard to the whole of the evidence, in the trial and here in these submissions.""

64This proposed ground invited the Court to review the whole of the evidence and conclude that the guilty verdict was not supported. It was not otherwise elaborated (see paragraph 189 of Mr Clark's written submissions). It is clear from what has already been said that the evidence was capable of sustaining the jury's verdict. The fact of non-production was not in dispute. There was ample evidence on which a jury could conclude beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Clark knew of the order, and intended by not-producing the sound recordings to frustrate its evident purpose. Whether or not his defences at trial of ""self-defence"" or ""necessity"" were established turned principally on an assessment by the jury of him giving evidence.

65Given that this proposed ground was not otherwise elaborated, save by reference to submissions advanced in relation to other grounds of appeal, it is best treated as dependent upon the matters raised in those other grounds. To that extent, it is addressed elsewhere in these reasons. Otherwise, leave should not be granted in respect of this proposed ground, in circumstances where (despite the length of the appellant's written and oral submissions) no attempt has been made to expand upon it.

Ground 6
""6. Miscarriage of Justice, the missing witness; the appellant submits that the learned trial Judge erred in denying the appellant's application to call [SB] to give evidence this led to a miscarriage of justice. Note this submission overlaps with the above.""

66A major theme in Mr Clark's submissions concerns ""the missing witness"", SB, who cannot be named. Attached to Mr Clark's submissions is a copy of a statement, purporting to have been signed by SB, claiming that evidence he had given against Mr Clark in other criminal proceedings in 2006 was false. SB was a complainant in a trial at which Mr Clark was convicted of offences of aggravated sexual intercourse, using a child for pornographic purposes, and intending to pervert the course of justice. Mr Clark's appeal from those convictions was pending when the trial took place. It was subsequently heard and dismissed. 

67It is not necessary for present purposes to set out the details of what was established by the guilty verdict in the other prosecution. It suffices to record that on the morning of 25 August 2011, the 13th day of the trial and the day on which evidence closed and the Crown addressed, Mr Clark handed what purported to be a subpoena and a retraction statement from SB to the judge in support of an application for an adjournment to call SB (""I would like [SB] here on Monday if possible""). SB had been named by Mr Clark when he was cross-examined, in the course of answers which appear to have been non-responsive, and some of which were struck out. One instance is as follows: 

""CROWN: You are aware that the search was being conducted to establish - to find whether there was evidence that you were using children for pornographic purposes?

ACCUSED: That's the reason the police put forward, yes.

CROWN: You are aware that they were searching for such images as would constitute the offence of possessing child pornography.

ACCUSED: Yes. That's the story - that's what I was told, yes.

CROWN: You were convicted of that offence but you appealed the conviction.

ACCUSED: That's correct.

CROWN: The conviction was set aside on the basis that the child - 3,000 photographs were in deleted folders?

ACCUSED: That's correct, yes. 

CROWN: So that it was a technical point which allowed you to have that conviction overturned?

ACCUSED: I'm not sure. I haven't read the judgment, but--

CROWN: I have.

ACCUSED: --but when the matter went before Judge Garling, Judge Garling said to me halfway through the trial, 'Mr Clark' - because of the other outstanding charges in relation to [three males including SB], Judge Garling said, 'Mr Clark, it's a matter of commonsense that one would normally keep their powder dry.' So I had three charges in relation - two in relation to [another complainant] and one in relation to possession of child pornography. Now, Judge Garling told me to keep my powder dry because I had far more serious charges coming up that the Crown refused to add together in the [case of the other complainant], so then I didn't put - I never gave evidence in that trial, Mr Crown.""

68The primary judge dealt with the application immediately, together with another application to call a witness, as follows:

""HIS HONOUR: You can't re-litigate the trial involving [SB].

ACCUSED: I understand that and that's not what I had intended to do. But I had intended to do the - my instructions to Mr Webb about those statements and to cross-examine [SB] and the other boys knowing each other, it never happened.

HIS HONOUR: No. Look, I decline to allow you to call Mr Webb because he has nothing to contribute in a positive way to the conduct of this trial. He doesn't reflect upon your instructions to Murphy. His evidence is likely to be extremely destructive to you with no gain, and besides, it's not relevant. And the same is true of [SB]. He just doesn't have anything to contribute to the issues in this trial.""

69That ruling reflected in part the fact that Mr Clark's conviction for intending to pervert the course of justice, by causing SB to make a video recording for use in court containing a false statement, had not been placed before the jury. It also reflected his Honour's with respect correct acceptance that the convictions in respect of SB could not be relitigated in the current prosecution. 

70No error is established in his Honour's decision.

Ground 7 
""7. Miscarriage of Justice, the Crown put false and highly prejudicial evidence before the jury inter alia; alleging 3,000 images of child pornography were found on the appellant's computer. This allegation is not supported by the truth and overlaps the other grounds as stated herein.""

71As Mr Clark observes, this ground overlaps with others, notably ground 4.2. It suffices to say that, Mr Clark's good character having been put in issue, the Crown cross-examined about the execution of a search warrant in the manner set out above. There was no miscarriage of justice in that course occurring.

Ground 8

""8. The delay in prosecuting the appellant led to a miscarriage of justice. The offence occurred on 11 October 2004, WOOD CJ CL cautioned the appellant, the Defendant's Barrister ... was in court when the possibility of an offence was canvassed, yet it takes over 5 (?) years for the matter to be brought to trial.""

72Mr Clark's complaint is that ""the offence occurred on 11 October 2004 ... yet it takes over 5 (?) years for the matter to be brought to trial"" [sic] (written submissions, para 215). He submitted that some Crown witnesses had forgotten what had taken place. For example when cross-examining his former counsel, Mr Steirn said ""I have absolutely no recollection of you, Mr Clark, other than what is in the transcript"". 

73Substantially the same complaint was made at trial, and the trial judge directed the jury accordingly:

""The appellant told you that the delay in prosecution has been unfair, and it is fair that I give you these directions, that when the hearing of a charge is long delayed it does have a deleterious effect on the position of an accused person because people's memories fade, documents get lost, and so on, so there can be - in this case probably are - some forensic disadvantages to Mr Clark because people's recollection is not as sharp now as it would have been had the proceedings taken place sooner after the events in 2004.""

74Mr Clark made (and makes) no complaint as to that direction. In the (unusual) circumstances of this trial, on some critical questions (did Mr Clark originally make the recording, did it continue to be in his possession, did he fail to make them available following the direction) there was no dispute. On others (was Mr Clark in court, was he aware of the direction, what was his purpose) there was the evidence of Mr Clark's own letters to his lawyers and to the judge written on the day. The unusual nature of what occurred is apt to have left an actual recollection in the minds of the witnesses, whose evidence the jury were entitled to assess. It is impossible to conclude that this is a case where delay has led to a miscarriage of justice.

Ground 9

""The trial miscarried in general; the appellant relies globally on ALL the grounds and submissions referred to herein for this ground stating that he lost a significant chance of acquittal but for what took place! The appellant is a litigant in person which requires the Court of Criminal Appeal to scrutinize the WHOLE of the evidence and the appellant's appeal documents with great care.""

75This ground does not advance Mr Clark's case any further. Although I have sought to construe Mr Clark's very lengthy documents generously to him, making allowance for their having been drafted by him, I have failed to identify any material error. 

Supplementary Ground A

76Mr Clark relies here upon an exchange on day 13 of the trial concerning a note from the jury which read ""Mr Clark stated that he still has copies of the CD in question. Can he be requested to produce this now for us all to hear?"". The note was debated in the absence of the jury, and it became common ground that the Court could request, but could not order, Mr Clark to produce the CD. A statement to that effect was then made in the presence of the jury. 

77Mr Clark submits that it followed that the original indictment was bad in law. As originally formulated, the indictment asserted that the production of the mini audio cassette was ""in breach of an order of the Supreme Court"". Mr Clark also maintained that the indictment as amended, which referred to Mr Clark ""being required to present"" the cassette recording and CD ""for such examination as may be directed by the Court"", is bad in law. Both in its original form and as amended, according to Mr Clark, the indictment was bad because there was power only to request production. 

78Basal to the adversarial system of criminal justice is the inability to compel an accused to produce evidence. However, in the civil proceedings in which Mr Clark was the plaintiff and in which Wood CJ at CL made the order, there is ample power to compel production. This occurs on a daily basis, through discovery, subpoenas, notices to produce and orders for specific production. The power exists even if (as Mr Clark maintains) he might assert a privilege against self-incrimination as an answer to the production (for Mr Clark contends that his junior counsel gave him ""very strong legal advice"" that his recording contravened the Listening Devices Act 1984 (NSW); it is not necessary to express a view one way or the other as to whether a privilege against self-incrimination would have been available, and indeed on the material available to this Court it is not possible to do so). There is nothing in this ground.

Supplementary Ground B

79This ground is that the trial judge erred in denying the appellant a reasonable amount of time to prepare his closing address, leading to a miscarriage of justice. The Crown closing address occurred immediately after the conclusion of the evidence, and was very brief, occupying seven pages of transcript. 

80So far as may be seen from the record of the trial, Mr Clark made no application for any adjournment. His closing address took place the following morning. The primary judge was well placed to determine whether it was necessary or appropriate for any further time to be given, even though none was sought. Indeed, Mr Clark indicated, in the absence of the jury, that he had a written document which he wanted to provide to the jury. His Honour ruled that it could be read, but not given to the jury. This was the occasion (referred to above) when Mr Clark responded, ""That's okay, your Honour. That covers me with rule 4, I think"". 

81Mr Clark claims that he was, at the time, ""suffering a degree of 'cognitive impediment' that led to a miscarriage of justice"", and refers to assaults which had occurred some years previously. However, the submission and evidence fall far short of establishing that there was a miscarriage of justice occasioned by the failure to grant an unsought adjournment before Mr Clark made his closing address. 

82It will have been seen that there were a number of unusual aspects to the criminal trial. One is that despite the charge being the making unavailable of the various recordings of the conversations in 2004, Mr Clark claimed, repeatedly, to have copies of those recordings available to play to the jury in 2011. (Indeed, many of his grounds of appeal seem to turn on his disappointment in finding himself unable to do so.) 

83Another, which is related, is that Mr Clark contends that his recordings are genuine, and some of the grounds of appeal are directed to a complaint that the course taken by the trial prevented their genuineness from being determined by the jury. That contention is unsound. The genuineness or otherwise of the recordings was not in issue in his prosecution. The point of the order made by Wood CJ at CL for production was to permit the recording to be tested, something which, of course, has not occurred.

84A third, indeed perhaps the most striking feature of the trial, is that Mr Clark contended before the jury that he was a person of good character. He was told, by the Crown and the judge (in the absence of the jury and before he had put his character in issue) that that would have the consequence of his prior convictions (including for attempting to pervert the course of justice, and for a series of sexual offences) would go before the jury. He nevertheless maintained that course (and indeed, now seeks to rely on what happened as a miscarriage of justice).

85In those unusual circumstances, the distinction drawn by Hunt J in R v Gidley (1984) 3 NSWLR 168 at 181 and by Beazley P, Barrett and Emmett JJA in Ekermawi v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 54 at [12]-[15] is to the point. The judge may advise the unrepresented accused of the likely prejudicial consequences of a course which he is proposing to take, but the choice must remain that of the accused. There is no unfairness or miscarriage of justice when an accused, properly informed of the position, takes a course which turns out not to be to his advantage. 

86Further, it is plain from the transcript in 2011 (and confirmed by the conduct of the appeal in 2014) that Mr Clark is able to articulate arguments, including technical legal arguments, and that he claims some knowledge of legal principle. It may be said immediately that his knowledge is imperfect, and that there are some matters in respect of which he feels he has been treated very harshly. However, there was no reason to think in 2011 that the judge who saw Mr Clark conduct his defence over 14 days had any doubts that Mr Clark was unfit to be tried such that the procedures of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) in particular s 8 applied.

Supplementary Ground C

87Mr Clark submits that: 

""The unsafe verdict GROUND, the CROWN case is again reflected at T342.7:

CROWN: The only question is whether Mr Clark was aware that the Court wanted to examine those documents.""

88Mr Clark asserts that fact ""as Mr Walsh states in his letter"". The gravamen of this ground appears to be a challenge to the jury's conclusion that Mr Clark knew of the judge's order. It is quite plain (not least from the contemporaneous correspondence) that it was open to the jury so to find.

Application to re-open

89Mr Clark applied, after judgment was reserved, and without leave, to reopen in order ""to admit one tiny piece of further evidence"" and to rely on a further written submission. The further evidence is an affidavit of 6 paragraphs directed to the events of July 2004. It is directed to explaining the letters he wrote in 2004. He now asserts that:

""on my way back to Taree on 12 October 2004 I feared that I would be intercepted by corrupt police. Or that I would again be woken in the middle of the night with a gun to my head by corrupt police threatening my children or grandchildren. So I had to do something that would help negate and/or help neutralise my fears. And the best and only way to do that was, I believed, to write and fax that letter!""

90The gravamen of the submission seems to be that the letter was intended to find its way to the Crown and the police officers:

""But the target for that letter was never my lawyers ... they were secondary. The main and intended target was police officers ... I knew that I could not sent a letter to [those officers]. They would never have believed that I would have destroyed the original tape and ALL COPIES. So in fear that is why I drafted my letter in that format and sent it too?""

91Applications should not be made without leave after judgment is reserved. Accepting that Mr Clark is an unrepresented litigant, he is an experienced litigant, and ought to be taken to know as much. But even if the application to reopen and to adduce further evidence be treated on its merits, it is plain that it must be refused. The evidence sought to be adduced by Mr Clark in 2014 is as to his own state of mind a decade earlier on a matter central to his criminal trial, as to which he gave evidence and was cross-examined. It is not possible to take that radically different course on appeal.

Orders

92Leave should not be granted to permit Mr Clark to challenge, by proposed ground 4.2 of his appeal, the admission into evidence of his convictions, in circumstances where it was plain that that course was taken by him in full knowledge of its risks. Nor should leave be granted in respect of proposed ground 5, which was undeveloped in Mr Clark's written and oral submissions. Otherwise, making allowance for Mr Clark being an unrepresented litigant, and having dealt with his grounds on their merits, there should be a grant of leave to appeal, but the appeal should be dismissed. Mr Clark's application to reopen should also be dismissed. 

93PRICE J: I agree with Leeming JA. 

94McCALLUM J: I agree with Leeming JA.

2765164,Born Brands Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 369,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The first applicant sells an infant sleep positioner, ""Babywedge"", which was created by the second and third applicants. A television news broadcast by the respondents suggested that infant sleep positioners increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome and were being withdrawn from sale overseas. Pictures accompanying the news item showed (without naming) a Babywedge. The applicants alleged the broadcast conveyed four defamatory imputations that they had sold and offered to sell a product that: (a) had been subject to recall; (b) could harm or even kill babies; (c) had been linked to 12 deaths in the United States; and (d) was being pulled from shelves because it could cause a child to suffocate. The applicants also alleged injurious falsehood as the failure of the respondents to contact the applicants for comment was so reckless as to warrant an inference of malice.

The respondents defended imputations (b), (c) and (d) as substantially true if conveyed; they contended imputation (a) could do no further harm to the applicant's reputation because of contextual imputations in the broadcast which were substantially true. The respondents tendered a report by an expert on childhood deaths of the risks associated with infant sleep positioners. The report was admitted over objections that the expert was not qualified to give an opinion about Babywedge specifically and was predisposed against the use of infant sleep positioners generally. Evidence of the applicants to prove the falsity of imputations that Babywedge was unsafe were held to be inadmissible. An application was later made that the trial judge disqualify herself for apprehended bias because her ruling that the expert report was admissible suggested she had already accepted its conclusions.

The trial judge held that the first applicant (a corporation) could not claim in defamation because it ""employs"" more than 10 persons and was therefore not an excluded corporation under Defamation Act 2005 (NSW), s 9(2)(b). As for the claim of the two individual applicants, the trial judge held none of the imputations pleaded were either conveyed or were defamatory. If the imputations were conveyed and were defamatory, however, the trial judge held the defences pleaded by the respondent would have been successful. The claim of injurious falsehood was dismissed. 

The applicants sought leave to appeal.

The Court (Basten JA, Meagher JA and Tobias AJA), granted leave from the findings on whether defamatory imputations were conveyed, the admissibility of the expert evidence, the defences of substantial truth and contextual truth, and the standing of the first applicant to sue in defamation. Leave was otherwise refused. 

Imputations: whether conveyed and whether defamatory
1. The imputations (b), (c) and (d) were conveyed as the broadcast expressly linked the Babywedge with risks identified with respect to sleep positioners generally overseas. So long as imputation (a) referred to recall of the product in the United States and Britain (but not Australia) it was conveyed: [24]-[26].

2. The subject of the broadcast was the product, not the applicants. Nevertheless, the suggestion the applicants would have designed and sold a product that could harm or even kill babies would have diminished their standing amongst ordinary members of the community. The trial judge erred in finding the imputations (if conveyed) were not defamatory because they only concerned the product: [29]-[31], [34]-[37]

Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton [2009] HCA 16; 238 CLR 460 applied.
John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Gacic [2007] HCA 28; 230 CLR 291 considered.

Expert evidence 
3. The evidence of the expert was admissible and the trial judge was entitled to accept it as going to the dangerous qualities of infant sleep positioners: [47]-[49].

Defence of justification and contextual truth
4. Based on the expert evidence, imputations (b), (c) and (d) were substantially true insofar as they referred to the dangers of the type of product that included Babywedge: [57], [65], [67].

5. No error was disclosed in the trial judge's finding that the contextual implications pleaded by the respondent were substantially true. There was no basis for rejecting the defence of contextual truth to imputation (a) once the expert evidence was accepted: [72], [74], [89]

Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Kermode [2011] NSWCA 174; 81 NSWLR 157; McMahon v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd (No 6) [2012] NSWSC 224; Mizikovsky v Queensland Television Ltd [2013] QCA 68; [2014] 1 Qd R 197 considered. 

Injurious falsehood
6. The failure to obtain a comment from the applicants was not so reckless as to warrant an inference of malice on the part of the respondents. The claim for injurious falsehood was without merit: [90]-[94]

Spring v Guardian Assurance Plc [1993] 2 All ER 273; Palmer Bruyn & Parker Pty Ltd v Parsons [2001] HCA 69; 208 CLR 388; Roberts v Bass [2002] HCA 57; 212 CLR 1 applied.

Evidence of applicants as to falsity of imputations
7. The evidence of the individual applicants was not relevant to an issue at trial and could not be given by way of an exception to the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Evidence cannot be adduced simply to establish the falsity of an imputation said to be substantially true on the basis that a plaintiff may always ""nail the matter complained of as a lie"": [97]-[99]

Ainsworth v Burden [2005] NSWCA 174 considered

Standing for a corporate plaintiff to sue in defamation
8. The only relevant persons for the purposes of determining whether a corporation is an ""excluded corporation"" under s 9(2)(b) of the Defamation Act are ""employees"". The evidence indicated that the corporate applicant had standing to sue as it had fewer than 10 employees: [104]-[105]

Reedemer Baptist School Ltd v Glossop [2006] NSWSC 1201 not followed.

Disqualification for bias
9. The allegation of apprehended bias was without substance - no reasonable fair-minded observer would have concluded that admitting the expert's report constituted its acceptance by the trial judge: [110]-[112].




			Judgment

1BASTEN JA: The death of an otherwise healthy infant in a crib during the early months of life is an emotive issue. Uncertainty as to the causes of such events gave rise to the label ""sudden infant death syndrome"", or more commonly ""SIDS"". One obvious response is to limit the risks of suffocation.

2On 29 September 2010 two United States government agencies - the Consumer Products Safety Commission and the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) - issued a warning to consumers not to use infant sleep positioners because of risks of suffocation associated with the products. An information sheet issued by the FDA, referring to the warning, included the following highlighted box headed ""Advice for consumers"". Apart from requesting reports of any incident or injury from use of an infant sleep positioner, the advice raised three points:

""â STOP using infant sleep positioning products. Using this type of product to hold an infant on his or her side or back is dangerous and unnecessary.

â NEVER put pillows, infant sleep positioners, comforters, or quilts under a baby or in a crib.

â ALWAYS place an infant on his or her back at night and during nap time. To reduce the risk of SIDS, the American Academy of Paediatrics recommends placing infants to sleep on their backs and not their sides.""

3The text of the information sheet stated, in part:

""In the last 13 years, the federal government has received 12 reports of babies known to have died from suffocation associated with their sleep positioners. Most of the babies suffocated after rolling from the side to the stomach.

In addition to the deaths, the commission has received dozens of reports of babies who were placed on their back or side in the positioners only to be found later in hazardous positions within or next to the product.""

4The information sheet also referred to claims by some manufacturers that such products prevent SIDS, reflux and flat head syndrome. It noted that the FDA had approved a number of such products in the past but that ""new information suggests the positioners pose a risk of suffocation."" It said the FDA was asking the makers of sleep positioners to provide ""data showing the products' benefits outweigh the risks"" and ""requesting that these manufacturers stop marketing their devices while FDA reviews the data.""

The litigation
5The first applicant, Born Brands Pty Ltd, is an Australian designer and distributor of one such product, using the brand name ""Babywedge"". (There was confusion even within the applicants' documents as to the precise form of the trade name.) It was created by two sisters, Hayley Birtles-Eades and Sally Birtles, who are the second and third applicants.

6On 1 October 2010 the first respondent, Nine Network Australia, broadcast a short news item based on the warning published by the US government agencies and referring to the fact that such devices were available in Australia. The broadcast included pictures of a sleep positioner which was clearly recognisable to those who knew the product as a Babywedge. It involved a sloping foam base (mattress) approximately rectangular in shape with two small bolsters, also made of foam, the base and the bolsters being covered in a bright orange material. The bolsters were attached to the base by Velcro strips.

7On 8 April 2011 the applicants commenced proceedings in the Common Law Division seeking damages in defamation and injurious falsehood. They were unsuccessful, Adamson J giving judgment for the defendants, (being the broadcaster and two presenters who appeared on the program): Born Brands Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (No 6) [2013] NSWSC 1651. The applicants appealed from each of a number of findings made by the trial judge adverse to their claims. They also sought to challenge the refusal of the trial judge to disqualify herself on the grounds of apprehended bias. Because the basis of that application was a judgment with respect to the admissibility of expert evidence, given late in the trial, it is convenient to defer consideration of that ground until the underlying interlocutory judgment has been addressed.

8The matter came before the Court by way of an application for leave to appeal heard concurrently with the substance of the appeal. Although the trial judge dismissed each of the claims, she assessed damages against the possibility of error with respect to her findings on liability. The provisional assessments were in amounts of $15,000 for each of the individual applicants and $10,000 for the company. Although the applicants challenged the inadequacy of these amounts, they did not seek to demonstrate that their respective appeals involved amounts in excess of $100,000. Accordingly, each applicant required leave to appeal: Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), s 101(2)(r). As there were aspects of the reasoning and the findings of the trial judge which were reasonably open to challenge, and as, with respect to the corporate applicant, the judge followed a decision on a point of statutory construction which was not self-evidently correct, each applicant should have leave to appeal, although not with respect to all the grounds raised in the notice of appeal. However, for the reasons explained below, each appeal should be dismissed.

9Counsel for the applicants argued the appeal on the basis that the primary focus of the appeal was a series of challenges to the findings at trial with respect to the imputations upon which the claims in defamation were based. It is convenient to deal with the issues broadly in the order in which they were addressed by counsel.

The publication and the imputations pleaded
(a) the publication
10The subject of the proceedings was a broadcast on television news which ran for 96 seconds. The full text of the broadcast, together with a description of the visual imagery, was set out by the trial judge at [15]. The key passages, with numbered paragraphs, omitting comments by unidentified members of the public and identifying the presenters as GG and GR, are as follows:

""1. GG: A baby product said to reduce the threat of sudden infant death syndrome is being withdrawn from sale in the United States and Britain but is still available here in Australia. It's feared the sleeping aid may be doing more harm than good.

2. GR: This is the type of product [accompanied by picture of woman placing baby in a Babywedge] that's being used in Australia and raising alarm bells overseas. It's supposed to promote safe sleeping but in the US, it's been linked to 12 deaths since 1997.
...

6. GR: The sleep aid is commonly used for babies under six months to stop them rolling on to their stomach but US Government agencies say the product can cause a child to suffocate. Australia's consumer watchdog, the ACCC say it's not aware of any deaths from these devices locally, but discussions are underway with US authorities before any action is considered here. While the products are being pulled from shelves overseas, major Australian retailers say they haven't received any complaints.

...

8. GR: Ros Richardson [RR] from SIDS and KIDS says parents don't need gimmicks to promote safe sleeping, just keep it simple.

9. RR: There's no bumpers, there's no soft and puffy bedding and there is nothing other than the essential items that need to be in your cot. And that's the best way of reducing SIDS for your baby.""

11Each plaintiff pleaded that the publication conveyed four imputations which, with respect to the company, were as follows:

""(a) The First Plaintiff, sold and offered for sale a baby product known as ""Baby Wedge"" which had been subject to recall.

(b) The First Plaintiff, sold and offered for sale a potentially dangerous product, known as Baby Wedge which could harm or even kill babies.

(c) The First Plaintiff sold and offered for sale a baby product, known as Baby Wedge which is supposed to promote safe sleeping but has been linked to 12 deaths in the United States.

(d) The First Plaintiff sold and offered for sale a baby product, known as Baby Wedge which should be pulled from shelves because they could cause a child to suffocate.""

12The trial judge concluded that none of the imputations pleaded was conveyed by the news broadcast: at [61]. The trial judge also concluded that, if conveyed, the imputations were not defamatory: at [70]. The applicants challenged each of these findings: accordingly, it will be necessary to consider more closely the nature of the imputations. At this stage it is convenient to note that the imputations may loosely be grouped in two categories. Thus, imputations (a) and (d) stated that Babywedge ""had been subject to recall"" and ""should be pulled from the shelves"". Secondly, imputations (b), (c) and one aspect of (d) identified Babywedge as ""a potentially dangerous product"" which ""could harm or even kill babies"", which had been linked to the deaths of babies in the United States and could cause a child to suffocate.

13The first limb of each imputation identified the applicants as persons who ""sold and offered for sale"" the product, Babywedge. This statement required identification by members of the public of the applicants in circumstances where none of them was identified by name in the program, nor was the brand name of the product used. However, identification was not an issue at trial: the bright orange product shown on screen was readily identifiable to someone who knew the Babywedge and there was evidence that some who saw the program identified the product and its association with the applicants. 

14In an important respect imputation (a) differed from each of the other imputations. The broadcast expressly stated that such products were available in Australia, were ""raising alarm bells overseas"" and were ""being withdrawn from sale in the United States and Britain"". There was no evidence that Babywedge was offered for sale in the United States or Britain; nor was it accurate to suggest that similar products had been withdrawn from sale in the United States and Britain. There was, thus, a real question as to whether imputation (a) was conveyed by the program, but if conveyed, the respondents did not seek to justify it as true.

15The respondents did, however, seek to defend the other three imputations as substantially true, if conveyed, pursuant to s 25 of the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW). They also relied upon the defence of contextual truth, pursuant to s 26. To that end they pleaded (relevantly for present purposes) two contextual imputations, being imputations other than those relied on by the applicants, which the respondents said were substantially true, with the result that the applicants' imputations did not further harm their reputations. The contextual implications were in substantially similar terms with respect to each of the applicants. It is sufficient to note those relating to the first applicant which were as follows (as found in paragraph 8(a) of the defence):

""(i) The First Plaintiff sold and offered for sale a baby product known as 'Baby Wedge' which should be subject to recall because it was a type of product that could harm or even kill babies.

...

(iv) The First Plaintiff sold or offered for sale a baby product known as 'Baby Wedge' which falsely promoted safe sleeping for babies but in fact could harm or kill babies.""

(b) were the imputations conveyed?
16It was not in dispute that Babywedge, as offered for sale by the applicants, was aptly described as a sleep positioner and was a product of the kind which was the subject of the United States report. (There was a dispute as to whether Babywedge was relevantly indistinguishable from products marketed in the US, but that related to the truth of the imputations, rather than whether they were conveyed.) The approach to be adopted by the Court in considering whether an imputation is conveyed requires that the Court place itself in the shoes of the ordinary reasonable viewer of the program, giving the words used their natural and ordinary meaning, taking into account the visual context of a television broadcast: see generally Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 52; 79 ALJR 1716 at [9]-[12] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Heydon JJ). The issue in the present case was the factual issue determined by the judge sitting without a jury, and not, as in many cases, the capacity of words to convey a specific imputation where the factual issue is to be decided by a jury.

17The trial judge stated at [56]:

""The defendants accepted that [the] message carried by the Broadcast was that baby devices such as the ones depicted are potentially dangerous and US agencies have recommended that they be withdrawn because of the risk of suffocation. Those ordinary reasonable viewers who identified the Babywedge depicted in the programme would, accordingly, have at least received the message that Babywedge was potentially dangerous and that US agencies have recommended that similar devices have been withdrawn because of the risk of suffocation.""

18The last proposition in this statement should be noted, namely that an ordinary reasonable viewer would infer that such devices ""have been withdrawn"" because of the risk of suffocation. The first statement on the program said that the product ""is being withdrawn from sale""; however, the statement at paragraph 6 of the broadcast said that the products ""are being pulled from shelves overseas"". There was a clear elision in the course of the broadcast between identification of a problem, a recommendation for action and action. If withdrawal of a product or ""recall"" of a product implies action by government agency or a manufacturer or retailer, then it was wrong to say that such action had been taken. Nevertheless, the loose wording in the program warranted a finding that the ordinary reasonable viewer might have inferred that action was already being taken.

19The next steps in the reasoning of the trial judge diverted from the question of whether the imputations were conveyed to whether they reflected personally on the applicants: at [57]. Because identification had been accepted, that was to ask a different question, namely about the defamatory content of the imputations. The judge then stated that matters indicating ""why the imputations are not defamatory also explain why the imputations linking the plaintiffs with the Babywedges are not carried"": at [59].

20Further, and with specific reference to imputation (a), the trial judge rejected the proposition that any such imputation was conveyed because ""the recall of a product [is] fundamentally different from its withdrawal from sale"": at [60].

21The language of defamatory publications is often imprecise and capable of a range of meaning. One important purpose of pleading imputations is for the plaintiff to identify that meaning which is said to be conveyed and is defamatory. An imputation which is imprecise, unclear or ambiguous is an inadequate pleading. Imputation (a) suffers from this vice in two respects. The first is that identified by the trial judge, namely the use of the phrase ""subject to recall."" Some might associate ""recall"" with the direction of a regulatory authority; others might take it to refer to the action of a supplier or manufacturer, whether undertaken voluntarily or mandatorily. To describe a product as being ""withdrawn from sale"" would fit comfortably within the latter, broader understanding. Thus, because the broadcast used the language of withdrawal from sale, the use of the phrase ""subject to recall"" in the imputation is not a sound basis for concluding that imputation (a) was not conveyed. A second reason for rejecting imputation (a) might be the use of the past tense, ""had been"", but for reasons already given, the language used in the broadcast was imprecise as to what action had been recommended and what had been taken. 

22There is, however, a separate difficulty with imputation (a): the broadcast did not in terms suggest that the unidentified baby product shown on screen as one of those available in Australia had been the subject of any complaint or action in the US. On the other hand, there was nothing said on the program to distinguish products available in Australia from those the subject of complaint and concern overseas.

23This awkwardness in the pleading of the imputation caused a difficulty for the applicants, both at trial and in this Court. If the imputation were to be read as referring to the specific device distributed by the applicants, the imputation was not conveyed; if the imputation were intended to refer to the class of product, of which Babywedge was one, imputation (a) added little if anything to the combined effect of imputations (c) and (d). The preferable conclusion in the present case is to treat the imputation as subject to a degree of imprecision and accept that it referred to Babywedge as an example of products which had been subject to recall. As such it was likely conveyed and had useful work to do in the claim.

24There is another element of imprecision in imputation (a). It is not explicit as to where recalls had occurred. The thrust of the broadcast was that concerns had been raised and action was at least being recommended overseas, but not in Australia. Accordingly, if it were assumed that Babywedge was available only in Australia and was subject to recall here, that imputation was not conveyed. For present purposes it is sufficient to read the imputation as if it referred to recall in the United States and Britain, but not Australia.

25Although this exercise requires some implicit redrafting of the pleading, the preferable conclusion is that, in light of the statement of the trial judge at [56] (set out at [17] above) it should be accepted that imputation (a) was conveyed.

26The finding of the trial judge at [56] is almost sufficient in itself to lead to the conclusion that each of imputations (b), (c) and (d) were conveyed. Thus there was no doubt that the broadcast expressly linked the Babywedge with the risks identified with respect to sleep positioners generally in the United States. It was therefore a potentially dangerous product in the sense that it could lead to suffocation and death of babies. The clear inference was that the alarm bells which were ringing overseas should also ring in Australia. The brief comments of members of the public (not set out above because the language used is of little consequence) demonstrated that the Australian public assumed that if there were problems which had been demonstrated in the US, that fact should cause alarm bells to ring in Australia. Similarly, if such products were being ""pulled from shelves overseas"" then Babywedge should be pulled from shelves in Australia. That reasoning is sufficient to demonstrate that imputations (b) and (d) were conveyed.

27There is an additional issue with respect to imputation (c). It is related to the geographical issue identified above in relation to imputation (a). If imputation (c) was designed to suggest that Babywedge itself had been ""linked to 12 deaths in the United States"", then it is difficult to conclude that such an imputation was conveyed. One reason for rejecting that approach is that the theme of the broadcast was that harm had been reported overseas, but not in Australia. It referred to the ""product"" and ""type of product""; no specific product was named and the visual imagery was not limited to the Babywedge. A reading of imputation (c) as stating that Babywedge itself had caused deaths would not have been conveyed to the hypothetical viewer. However, if the imputation were read as stating that Babywedge was a member of a class of potentially dangerous products, namely sleep positioners, then the linkage is understood to exist between members of that class and the deaths. So understood, imputation (c) was also conveyed.

(c) were the imputations defamatory?
28Speaking generally, the test of whether a publication is defamatory is ""whether the published matter is likely to lead an ordinary reasonable person to think the less of a plaintiff"": Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton [2009] HCA 16; 238 CLR 460 at [5] and [6] (French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ).

29In Chesterton the High Court also identified the correct approach to determining whether publications which reflect on individuals through their conduct of a business are defamatory and also identified the point of distinction between defamation and injurious falsehood, in the following passages:

""[10] It is not in dispute that persons may be defamed in their business reputation. The common law has for some time recognised that words may not only reflect adversely upon a person's private character, but may injure a person in his or her office, profession, business or trade. This may be so where the words reflect upon the person's fitness or ability to undertake what is necessary to that business, profession or trade. But in each case the injury spoken of is that to the person's reputation.

[11] The remedy which the law provides for injury to a person's business or professional reputation must be distinguished from that for malicious statements which result in damage not to the reputation but to the business or goods of a person. The former is provided by an action for defamation, the latter by that for injurious falsehood. Lord Esher MR explained the distinction in South Hetton Coal Co Ltd v North-Eastern News Association Ltd. A false statement that a wine merchant's wine is not good, which is intended to and does cause loss to the wine merchant's business, is an injurious (or 'malicious') falsehood. A statement reflecting upon that person's judgment about the selection of wine, and therefore upon the conduct of his business, may be defamatory of him. Gummow J observed in Palmer Bruyn & Parker Pty Ltd v Parsons that the action for injurious falsehood is more closely allied to an action for deceit."" [Footnotes omitted.]

30The different elements of defamation and injurious falsehood (both causes of action being raised in the present case) constitute a firm basis for distinguishing between injury to a person's business and injury to his or her reputation: Chesterton at [32]. Further, reputation is not to be viewed in this context as having separate aspects subject to distinct and differing standards: at [35]. Although clearly the consequences of defamatory statements will vary depending upon the nature of the disparagement, the Court is to approach the question as to whether a statement is defamatory simply by considering whether, in the eyes of the ordinary reasonable person, the plaintiffs' standing or reputation or character is diminished. For that purpose, it may not be necessary to impute fault. As Gleeson CJ and Crennan J said in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Gacic [2007] HCA 28; 230 CLR 291 at [6]:

""To say that a restaurant sells unpalatable food or provides bad service does not necessarily reflect badly on the owners personally. They might be worthy people who are themselves victims of circumstances, or incompetent staff. However, it has a tendency to damage their business reputation.""

31This passage, read in the light of the further elucidation in Chesterton, is not to be understood as creating a dichotomy between personal and business reputations; on the other hand, it makes clear that a person's reputation may be damaged if a business he or she runs is subject to criticism, even though he or she is personally without blame.

32The approach of the trial judge to this question, which largely reflected the submissions of the respondents and was supported by them in this Court, was reflected in the following passage explaining that the imputations did not reflect personally on the applicants. 

""[58] ... That several examples of the type of product that the research has revealed to be dangerous were displayed on the Broadcast is a powerful indication that the focus of the segment was on the danger of the type of products, and their common features, rather than their individual features or brands, of which there was no mention. 

[59] In my view, the reason there was no mention of the makers and sellers of the sleeping devices in the context of the Broadcast was that no criticism was made of them, either individually or collectively. Their identity was effectively irrelevant to the message conveyed. In my view, the matters referred to below as to why the imputations are not defamatory also explain why the imputations linking the plaintiffs with the Babywedges are not carried.""

33The last reference appears to pick up the following further reasoning which the trial judge upheld:

""[65] The defendants relied on the substantial and important distinction between a statement about a person's business or goods on the one hand and a defamatory statement that reflected poorly on the person's reputation on the other: Radio 2UE v Chesterton at [11]. The law provides a remedy for the former in the tort of injurious falsehood and for the latter in an action for defamation. In order to be defamatory, the statement must reflect adversely on the plaintiffs' business reputation and not merely on the business: Radio 2UE v Chesterton at [32].

[66] The defendants submitted that the fundamental impression created by the programme was that the danger posed by the product had only recently been identified and that the issue of the warning that they not be used as sleeping devices amounted to 'news' because it represented new, that is, previously unknown, information. They relied on the use of the present tense in the Broadcast in such phrases as:

'raising alarm bells overseas'
'being withdrawn from sale in the United States and Britain'
'discussions are underway with the US authorities before any action is considered here' [Emphasis added]""

34There are difficulties in knowing precisely where to place the emphasis in the different passages in Chesterton. The exegesis referred to by the trial judge related both to the facts of Chesterton itself and to those which arose in Gacic. Although expressed at a higher level of generality, context was important. The Court was seeking to identify and expunge a particular erroneous approach. The plaintiffs in Gacic were restaurateurs; the plaintiff in Chesterton was a journalist. Each involved a publication which was claimed to harm the plaintiff(s) through an attack on their or his business operations. The present case was different in three significant respects. First, one of the applicants is a corporation: assuming, correctly as will be explained below, that the corporation is entitled to sue in defamation, the point of distinction between business and reputation is less clear than with an individual unless harm to business is treated as a reference purely to economic loss. Secondly, in each of Gacic and Chesterton there was an individual business or person who was the subject of the publication. In the present case, that is not so. The subject matter of the broadcast was not Babywedge as a specific product, but rather the category of sleep positioners for babies. The fact that it was possible to identify the applicants' product as an example of the class did not mean that the focus of the broadcast was the individual product. Thirdly, the focus of the broadcast was not particular conduct or behaviour of the applicants, but information concerning the safety of products which they (amongst others) offered for sale.

35An example at the other end of the spectrum from a challenge directed to specific individuals might be the release of new information as to the dangers of cigarettes, combined with a recommendation that they not be available through newsagencies. A television news item reporting on the new findings and the recommendation using as a backdrop shots taken of and inside a specific newsagency would be unlikely to be found to have defamed the proprietor of the newsagency in question. That is at least in part because the ordinary reasonable viewer would know that there were thousands of newsagencies in Australia and that no criticism was intended of the individuals who ran those newsagencies in a manner which was not only lawful but socially acceptable.

36The last example is, however, not closely correlated with the present case for the following reasons. First, although the evidence does not reveal the numbers, one may assume that there are a relatively small number of sleep positioners available for sale in Australia. Secondly, although the Court was not taken to the identification material, given that it was accepted, it must have identified the particular involvement of the applicants with the product. That conclusion is also implicit in the imputations themselves, which do not identify the applicants with the retail sale of baby products (or any other generic category of goods) but with the sale and offering for sale of this particular product. The references to ""sold or offered for sale"" in the imputations was treated as including design, manufacture and distribution. It was common ground that the applicants were not the retailers of Babywedge, but rather that this was ""the plaintiffs' product"", to adopt the language of the respondents' outline of submissions at trial, par 41.

37When the imputations are so understood, it is difficult to accept that an allegation that the plaintiffs were involved with a product designed for use with young babies, but which had the potential to harm or even kill babies would not diminish their standing amongst ordinary members of the community. Each of the imputations identified the same action or conduct of the applicants; with the exception of imputation (a), each identified the product as potentially dangerous in broadly the same ways. With respect to imputation (a), read in context, the inference was that the recall of the product was due to it being potentially dangerous. In these circumstances, each of the imputations was defamatory.

Justification
38The respondents pleaded that the imputations (b), (c) and (d) were substantially true. In addition they pleaded the two contextual imputations noted above, which were also said to be substantially true. To the extent that the applicants' imputations were not found to be substantially true, they were said to do no further harm to the reputations of the applicants than was caused by the contextual implications. In relation to imputation (a), it was thus the relevant contextual implication alone which was relied upon by way of defence.

(a) expert evidence
39In support of those defences, the respondents relied upon an expert report prepared by Professor Roger Byard, the holder of the Marks Chair of Pathology at the University of Adelaide. The applicants challenged the admissibility of the report and Professor Byard's oral evidence, but it was admitted, a ruling challenged on appeal.

40Professor Byard was asked whether the Babywedge product was ""a potentially dangerous product which could harm or even kill babies""; whether sleep positioners had been linked to deaths of 12 (or more) infants in the United States, and whether Babywedge was relevantly similar to the products linked to such deaths, so that it could be said that the Babywedge product is of a type that has been linked to such deaths. He answered those questions affirmatively in a report dated 5 January 2013.

41There was (and could have been) no challenge to Professor Byard's qualifications as a forensic pathologist with a special expertise in sudden infant and childhood death. He stated in his report that he had ""a particular interest in accidental infant/childhood suffocation and [had] conducted research in this area for over two decades"". That research had ""involved the assessment of many hundreds of infant death scenes and the identification of previously unrecognised hazards such as U-shaped pillows and mesh-sided cots"": Report, p 3. By way of general comment, Professor Byard noted (p 4):

""The exact contribution of soft bedding to an increased risk of infant death from SIDS or from accidental asphyxia may never be precisely determined, however it is well recognized that soft material that can press against an infant's face and nose is potentially dangerous. Lethal effects may include simply smothering or blockage of the external air passages, accumulation and rebreathing of carbon dioxide, and overheating (by interfering with heat exchange by the face). ...

We have investigated many cases of SIDS and accidental asphyxia in infants in South Australia and have found that any sleeping arrangement that creates a trough that an infant can roll or slip into may present a problem, as this may predispose to death from possible suffocation.""

42With respect to the Babywedge being a potentially dangerous product, Professor Byard stated (p 5):

""The Babywedge device consists of a soft sloping mattress with a bolster on each side. Unfortunately this creates several problems. If an infant has rolled into a position where the faced was pressed into the trough between the bolster and the mattress it is possible that asphyxial episode could occur from external airway obstruction due to cover of the mouth and face (ie smothering). In addition there could be rebreathing of exhaled air, a problem that has been demonstrated in infants sleeping on polystyrene cushions. Another problem may occur if an infant has rolled into a face-down position (prone), as this has a well-established increased risk of death due to SIDS. It may be that once in a prone position in this device that an infant would not be able to self-extricate. Very young infants tire very quickly when they are trying to lift their heads free of soft surfaces. Fabric also becomes much less permeable to air if an infant has vomited or regurgitated fluid on to it.""

43This key passage in the report was criticised by the applicants on a number of grounds. First, it was pointed out that the Babywedge did not have a ""soft"" sloping mattress but rather a firm mattress. Secondly, it was said that the bolster being removable and attached by way of Velcro strips which were positioned perpendicularly to the bolsters, allowed a gap between the bolster and the mattress, rather than a ""trough"". Thirdly, unlike polystyrene, the Babywedge was manufactured from open textured foam which allowed for breathing. These elements, which were said to render the Babywedge different from other sleep positioners for babies, had not, the applicants noted, been tested by Professor Byard with respect to the applicants' product. On that basis they submitted that his report could not constitute an admissible expert opinion about the Babywedge; that is, although Professor Byard undoubtedly had specialised knowledge relevant to the general topic of SIDS and risks of suffocation, that knowledge did not qualify him in accordance with s 79 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) to give an opinion on the risks associated specifically with the Babywedge.

44Because virtually the whole of Professor Byard's evidence, other than his written report, was elicited on the voir dire, it is convenient to refer to that evidence before dealing with its admissibility and the inferences which were properly to be drawn from it.

45So far as the first complaint noted above was concerned, Professor Byard accepted that the mat was firm not soft and was a suitable sleeping surface for a baby: Tcpt, p 239(38). With respect to the fact that the bolsters were detachable and that they did not create a continuous ""trough"" along the sides of the mattress, Professor Byard did not concede that the Babywedge was satisfactory. The cross-examination extended over several pages, particularly at Tcpt, pp 252-254:

""Q. ... I take it you didn't make any tests on Babywedge as to the likelihood or unlikelihood of a trough which could lead to suffocation?
A. The reason I didn't is it was an observation, I could see the trough and I know that troughs are dangerous.

Q. Yes, but surely an attached trough, sorry an attached bolster causing a trough would not be the same as an unattached bolster?
A. As I said I think we can't say that because when I look at the attachment, if a baby is in the trough and pushes this to one side because their face is there, it actually seals off on the other side, so I think that would need to be looked at.

Q. Need to be looked at, how do you mean?
A. I think if you were going to make an assertion that there is no - there is an airspace under it, you'll have to test it.
...

Q. ... [T]here are no measurements or detailed descriptions of the Babywedge in the report?
A. Well, the reason for that is I was really trying to go back to first principles because there are so many different devices. The first principles are that when you have bolsters and you have troughs and you have soft surfaces and you have cloth over foam these are all potential problems that can cause accidents and deaths. I didn't need the dimensions to actually make that statement.
...

Q. What I'm suggesting is that the bolsters on Babywedge do not cause a trough? ...
A. Well (indicated) yes, it does. It's in front of me; (indicated) there's a trough with the bolster.

Q. But a trough means, does it not, an unbroken U-shape or V-shape? If there's a gap that wouldn't be a trough. If there's a gap between the bolsters [and] the Babywedge mattress that would not be a tough?
A. I probably created this problem, your Honour, by using the term 'trough'. What I mean is somewhere a baby can be trapped where there can be [sic] an air accumulation, carbon dioxide accumulation, overheating, or pressure against the nose and mouth. And it doesn't take much pressure for some babies, for them to suffocate.

Q. There would no chance of suffocation if the baby could breathe between the bottom of the bolster and the top of the mattress?
A. Well, depends. I'm not convinced that that is actually a very good air passage. Also, the baby could easily be up against the bolster and bring up stomach contents because these kids do have reflux and that would make it really quite nasty, even if the baby's nose was stuck into this gap I still [think] it seals off because it presses down on the outside. 

Q. But you've done no test to confirm that, have you?
A. Just purely observation of hundreds of death [scenes] and looking at this.

Q. The bolsters are to go under the arms, aren't they?
A. Yes they are. Well, that's my impression from the picture.

Q. Well then the head wouldn't be between the bolsters?
A. One of the interesting things about babies, your Honour, I've seen videos at meetings that paediatricians have taken and they move around in their beds more than I move around during the day. They're incredibly, particularly when they're five or six months, they are very able to actually move from one end of the cot to another. They're like possums going down small holes.""

46The thrust of the cross-examination was not to demonstrate that the Babywedge was not a product within the class of sleep positioners said to have caused problems in the United States. Rather, the classification was accepted, but specific characteristics of the Babywedge were suggested as a basis for not considering it to be a potentially dangerous product. To the extent that the foam used in the product was said to be different from other similar devices and was permeable for a baby seeking to breathe through the material and the foam with its nose and mouth against them, the assertion was unsupported by admissible evidence. (Evidence sought to be led from the individual applicants to this effect was rejected.) So far as the means of affixing the bolsters was a point of difference from other products, Professor Byard explicitly did not accept the proposition. He noted that if the baby's face pressed against one side of the cylindrical bolster, it would tend to press the other side against the mattress, thus sealing the space which might otherwise be found between bolster and mattress. In the end, it was specifically put to Professor Byard that there was some baby products, including Babywedge, ""that would not be potentially dangerous or the potential danger would be so minimal that they could be used with expectancy of safety by babies"": Tcpt, p 260(25). Professor Byard responded that he could not say that the risk was ""minimal"" as he did not have the data. ""All I can do"", he continued, ""is look at the device and say that there are structural problems with this that could result in infant death.""

(b) admissibility
47The challenge to the admissibility of Professor Byard's report was dealt with by the trial judge in an interlocutory judgment, Born Brands Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 1646. As the judge noted, the grounds of objection were formulated after counsel for the applicants had cross-examined Professor Byard on a voir dire. 

48Professor Byard's expertise to give such an opinion was unshaken in cross-examination. He did not concede that forms of testing were either available or necessary in order to express such an opinion. There was no other evidence to contradict that view. In the circumstances, it was open to the trial judge to accept Professor Byard's evidence as to the dangerous qualities of the product. The evidence was admissible for that purpose.

49One other ground of objection, expressly put to Professor Byard and relied upon as a basis for rejection of the report, was that the witness was ""not open minded, but had a preconceived opposition to the Babywedge product which tainted his report"": Tcpt, p 264. This objection was correctly rejected by the trial judge. On the basis of vast experience with infant death scenes and with the literature, to which Professor Byard himself had contributed over 500 papers, he was able to identify characteristics of a product which correlated with a risk of death by suffocation. His opposition to the product was based on ""preconceived"" principles, but the principles were scientifically based. His ""opposition"" to the product arose because it fell within the risk categories which experience and scientific research had identified.

(c) inferences from expert evidence
50With respect to the relevant characteristics of sleep positioners generally, the trial judge held at [84]:

""I accept Professor Byard's opinion that babies and infants are susceptible to suffocation when there is pressure against their noses or mouths. I also accept Professor Byard's opinion that fabrics and other materials that may be permeable when dry tend to become impermeable when wet. This is of particular significance for babies and infants who may be inclined to dribble or vomit or otherwise exude moisture through their mouths or noses and thereby moisten the fabric in the vicinity of these orifices, thereby rendering otherwise permeable fabric impermeable.""

51In considering whether Babywedge could be distinguished from other dangerous products, the trial judge noted at [85] the following points of distinction relied upon by the applicants, namely ""first, that the mat and bolsters are made of open cell foam; secondly, that the bolsters on Babywedge are not fixed; thirdly, that the Velcro that attaches the bolster to the mat is perpendicular to the bolster; and fourthly, that there is a space between the bolster and the mat, at least at points where it is not attached to the Velcro which means that the 'trough' is not sealed.""

52As has been noted, there was no evidence as to the permeability to air of ""open cell foam"" when covered by fabric. The other points of distinction all related to the ability for air to pass between the bolster and the mattress when the infant was pressing against the bolster. As noted above, that matter was directly addressed by Professor Byard and rejected as a point of distinction. The trial judge was satisfied, ""for the reasons given by Professor Byard, that Babywedge is relevantly indistinguishable from the sleeping devices the subject of the US warning."" She rejected the ""so-called points of distinction"" as immaterial: at [103]. The judge therefore concluded that imputations (b), (c) and (d) had been proved to be substantially true: at [108].

53The applicants' submissions on appeal reagitated each of the arguments put to the trial judge. In their terms, they were properly rejected, for the reasons noted above. As counsel for the applicants seemed to accept at trial, once Professor Byard's evidence was accepted, the general statements in the imputations (b), (c) and (d) were justified.

54One further submission raised on appeal, though apparently given little attention at trial, was that in expressing a view that the Babywedge was a potentially dangerous product, Professor Byard did not carry out ""calculations to assess the percentage of risk"": written submissions, par 51. Professor Byard agreed that no calculation of risk had been undertaken, ""because we have no idea of how these devices are being used, how many there are, whether they're used all night or part of the night"": Tcpt, p 259(10). He suggested that would require ""a very detailed epidemiological study."" The proposition was put to him that ""4,700 have been sold to date without any complaint of accident or injury let alone death"": Tcpt, p 259(28). 

55There are two reasons for rejecting this basis of challenge to Professor Byard's opinion. The first is that, being provided with the sales figures for Babywedge did not cause him to vary his opinion: Professor Byard repeated his statement set out above that to carry out a useful study he would need further information. Secondly, the complaint had little traction in the context of the publication. The concept of a ""potentially dangerous product"" is not defined by reference to an actuarial calculation of risk. That was not the function carried out by the FDA in the United States. That was not the basis of the concern reported in the news item.

56As little weight was placed on this contention in the course of the appeal, it need not be addressed further as a ground for rejecting Professor Byard's opinion. The challenge to the admissibility of his evidence should be dismissed. In these circumstances the trial judge was entitled to accept it as establishing the defence of substantial truth

(d) variation of imputation (c)
57The applicants' written submissions stated (at par 53) that even if Professor Byard's opinions and report were accepted, ""they only went to imputations (b) and (d)."" The complaint was that Professor Byard's evidence did not establish that Babywedge itself was one of the devices that had been linked to deaths in the United States, and that the truth of imputation (c) could only be established on the basis that it was to be understood as ""a device of the kind that had been linked"" to such deaths.

58The applicants had two complaints in respect of the manner in which the trial judge dealt with imputation (c) and its substantial truth. First, they objected to the effective amendment of their imputation in the course of the trial. They said the form of the imputation sought to be justified was different from that pleaded and one which should have been pleaded by the respondents, presumably as a contextual imputation. Secondly, they complained that there was a lack of support for the conclusion that Babywedge was a device of the same kind as those which had caused deaths in the United States. They noted that Professor Byard had not identified relevant US products. 

59The second (factual) objection was properly rejected by the trial judge. The evidence of Professor Byard discussed above did not permit distinctions to be drawn between kinds of sleep positioners, in the absence of expert evidence as to material differences in their construction or design. The first (procedural) objection requires separate consideration.

60The passage in the broadcast which formed the basis of this imputation was paragraph 2, which may conveniently be repeated:

""This is the type of product that's being used in Australia and raising alarm bells overseas. It's supposed to promote safe sleeping but in the US, it's been linked to 12 deaths since 1997.""

61This passage was undoubtedly capable of more than one meaning. While that statement was being made, the visual imagery showed a mother placing a baby in a Babywedge. On the reading accepted above, what was linked to deaths in the US was not the Babywedge but the type of product. On that reading, the imputation was clearly conveyed but was substantially true. An alternative reading was that the reference to ""it"" being linked to 12 deaths was a reference to the specific product shown on screen, namely the Babywedge, which was untrue. 

62A third meaning was that ""it"" did refer to the Babywedge, but the link to the deaths in the US was because the Babywedge was the same type of product. On that reading, the imputation, on the evidence of Professor Byard, was substantially true.

63The issue thus raised did not involve some variation or nuance arising from the imputation as pleaded, but from a patent ambiguity in the pleading which reflected an ambiguity in the publication. However, imputation (c) was accepted as being conveyed on the basis that it referred to the type of product, rather than Babywedge itself. 

64If the imputation were conveyed on the basis that it was specific to an allegation against Babywedge, two further points should be made. First, the unqualified statement that the product ""has been linked to 12 deaths"" is more emphatic and more damning than the statements in the other imputations that the product ""could"" harm or even kill babies. Secondly, and consequential upon the first point, the contextual imputations pleaded by the respondents, did not cover the additional adverse impact to be found in imputation (c). 

65Accepting that there was an additional sting in imputation (c), if the imputation were limited to sleep positioners as a type of product, the substantial truth of the statement was supported by Professor Byard's evidence which, in this respect, was unchallenged.

66Against this background, it is necessary to return to the reasoning of the trial judge. Although the judge had held that imputation (c) was not conveyed, she nevertheless dealt with the additional issues. That meant, however, that she was not troubled by the alternative readings of imputation (c) discussed above. Nevertheless, accepting that imputation (c) referred to Babywedge itself as the device which was linked to 12 deaths in the US, the trial judge concluded there was no material difference between ""imputation (c) as pleaded and an imputation that Babywedge is a device of the kind linked to such deaths"": at [107]. That conclusion was reached in response to the respondents' submission at trial that they were ""entitled to justify imputation (c) although the Babywedge itself is not one of the devices that has been linked to 12 deaths in the United States, on the basis that it is a device of the kind or kinds of devices that have been linked to such deaths."" The respondents further contended at trial that there was ""no difference in substance between those two statements since the pejorative nature of the sting was substantially the same"": at [105]. 

67That submission is unpersuasive. There is something far more immediate and visceral about a claim that a particular product has been linked to 12 deaths, as compared with the statement that the product is one of a class of products which have been linked to 12 deaths. If the imputation conveyed was that the Babywedge had been linked to 12 deaths, the substantial truth of the imputation was not made good. However, that was not the basis upon which the imputation was conveyed and accordingly it is not necessary to address the issue further. The defence succeeds because the imputation related to the type of product linked to deaths in the US and there is no factual basis for not treating Babywedge as a member of that class.

68In addressing the justification of imputation (c), the submissions at trial appear to have diverted attention to what may best be described as a false issue. The trial judge noted that the ""tribunal of fact"" may find for the plaintiff ""on a nuance or variation of the imputation, or an imputation not substantially different, or one of lesser seriousness"" to that pleaded: at [104], referring to Chakravarti v Advertiser Newspapers Limited [1998] HCA 37; 193 CLR 519 at [22]-[24] (Brennan CJ and McHugh J); [51]-[60] (Gaudron and Gummow JJ); [139] (Kirby J). The trial judge continued:

""The same principle applies to defendants in that a defendant is entitled to justify a nuance or variation of the plaintiff's defamatory meaning, or one less serious than the plaintiff's meaning, subject to the requirements of fairness.""

69The reference to the ""tribunal of fact"" reflects the use of juries and the consequence that the court may not know precisely what imputation has been accepted by a jury, especially where an imputation is not itself a separate cause of action and is not separately particularised and pleaded to. In the present case it was for the judge to determine what imputation was conveyed and, if considering justification (on the hypothetical basis that some such imputation had been conveyed, having found that it had not) it became necessary to identify with sufficient particularity the imputation accepted for the purpose of considering the defence. 

70Further, the critical point of distinction between an acceptable variation on an imputation as pleaded and an imputation which should be separately pleaded in order to be relied upon is whether a plea of justification can be made out in relation to one but not the other: Chakravarti [52]. Where (as in this case) there is an ambiguous imputation and the respondents expressly undertook the task of justification on both meanings, there will be no unfairness to either party in allowing the matter to be determined on that basis and without further pleading. Whether the respondents were entitled (under s 26) to plead a contextual implication would have depended on a finding as to the meaning of the applicants' imputation, which was not resolved before the final judgment. As the defence succeeds in relation to the imputation conveyed, the issue falls away. 

(e) allegation that Babywedge ""falsely"" promoted safe sleeping
71The contextual implication in par 8(a)(iv) of the defence alleged that Babywedge ""falsely promoted safe sleeping for babies"". The trial judge recorded a submission by the applicants that the word ""falsely"" meant ""knowingly falsely"": at [114]. (That was not a factual proposition which the respondents could make good.) The judge noted a further submission, namely that ""falsely"" meant ""wrongfully"" and that that language was unacceptable because it invoked ""an unspecified degree of culpability of an undefined character, ranging ... from mere carelessness to fraud or dishonesty"": see McCormick v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (1989) 16 NSWLR 485 at 494 (Hunt J). According to the applicants, the contextual imputation pleaded by the respondents should have been struck out. The trial judge rejected both these submissions, concluding that ""falsely"" was a synonym for ""incorrectly""; it implied neither knowledge nor culpability: at [116]. 

72This was an entirely arid debate. The judge was correct to say that ""falsely"" meant ""incorrectly"". Further, the contextual imputation adopted similar language to the applicants' imputation (c) which referred to Babywedge being a product ""which is supposed to promote safe sleeping but has been linked to 12 deaths in the United States"". The insertion of the word ""falsely"" by the respondents was both grammatically confusing and unnecessary. The imputation was that the product promoted safe sleeping: the term ""supposed"" cast doubt upon that, a doubt which was referrable to the link to deaths. The insertion of the word ""falsely"" suggested that the product was promoted by the applicants as helping a baby to sleep safely, when in fact it did not. In other words, the word ""promoted"" was being used in a different sense. Ultimately, the issue went nowhere.

(f) comparing facts and imputations
73A further matter relied upon by the applicants was the proposition that, contrary to the approach required by John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Blake [2001] NSWCA 434; 53 NSWLR 541 at [5], the trial judge had declined to compare the ""facts, matters and circumstances"" relied upon to establish the truth of the contextual implications with the applicants' imputations, but rather had weighed contextual imputation against the applicants' imputations.

74This, too, was a false issue. Although it is not entirely clear why the trial judge said at [123] that the statement of Spigelman CJ was ""apposite only where the matter for determination ... is to be determined in advance of the evidence"", the exercise she accepted was not that of comparing imputation with imputation. Rather, the judge accepted the submission of the respondents that the relevant comparison is to be made with ""the evidence in support of the truth of the contextual imputations"". Strictly speaking, even that submission was inaccurate. The comparison required was between the facts as found, based on the evidence at trial, and the imputations relied on by the applicants. Nothing turned on this point because the judge accepted the evidence of Professor Byard and made the necessary comparison on that basis.

(g) justification of imputation (a)
75The trial judge found that the evidence that ""proved the truth of the contextual imputations is the same as the evidence that I found proved the truth of plaintiffs' imputations (b), (c) and (d)"": at [127]. That finding might have given rise to a question as to whether the imputations pleaded by the respondents were in fact materially different from those pleaded by the plaintiffs as imputations (b), (c) and (d). That would have been a matter of some importance: if they were not materially different, they would not have been ""other imputations"" for the purposes of s 26(a) and could not have been pleaded by the respondents. Accordingly, on the construction of the Act which appeared to be accepted by the trial judge, they could not have been relied upon in response to imputation (a). As that imputation was not itself substantially true, if conveyed and found to be defamatory, the cause of action would have been made out. On the other hand, if the contextual imputations were conveyed and were substantially true, the respondents could rely upon them as a full defence if, because of the truth of the contextual imputations, imputation (a) did not further harm the reputation of the applicants.

76There is something curious about the proposition that the respondents could succeed only if the imputations they relied upon differed from those which the applicants relied upon. The issue arises from the meaning and structure of ss 25 and 26 of the Defamation Act, understood in their statutory context.

Division 2 Defences

24 Scope of defences under general law and other law not limited

(1) A defence under this Division is additional to any other defence or exclusion of liability available to the defendant apart from this Act (including under the general law) and does not of itself vitiate, limit or abrogate any other defence or exclusion of liability.

(2) If a defence under this Division to the publication of defamatory matter may be defeated by proof that the publication was actuated by malice, the general law applies in defamation proceedings in which the defence is raised to determine whether a particular publication of matter was actuated by malice.

25 Defence of justification

It is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter if the defendant proves that the defamatory imputations carried by the matter of which the plaintiff complains are substantially true.

26 Defence of contextual truth

It is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter if the defendant proves that:

(a) the matter carried, in addition to the defamatory imputations of which the plaintiff complains, one or more other imputations (contextual imputations) that are substantially true, and
(b) the defamatory imputations do not further harm the reputation of the plaintiff because of the substantial truth of the contextual imputations

77After accepting that what needed to be weighed against the defamatory imputations was the effect of the evidence in support of the truth of the contextual imputations, the trial judge proceeded at [124]:

""I was not, however, persuaded that, in the event that I had to carry out the comparative task required, the evidence in support of the contextual imputations ought be weighed against the plaintiffs' imputations taken individually, rather than taken collectively. I consider that what Hunt J said in Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited [1984] 1 NSWLR 386 at 397 was a necessary corollary of the 1974 Act which provided that each imputation was a separate cause of action. In these circumstances it would not be correct to collate all the separate causes of action and consider them together. However, under the present 2005 Act the cause of action is the matter complained of even if more than one defamatory imputation is carried by the matter: s 8. There does not, accordingly, seem to be any reason why the evidence of all of the contextual imputations ought be weighed separately against those of the imputations not proved to be true.""

78No doubt it is open to a court in New South Wales to refer to cases determined under the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW) (or even the Defamation Act 1958 (NSW)) in order to dismiss the case law as inapplicable. However, there are dangers in going further. Section 6 of the Defamation Act now provides:

6 Tort of defamation

(1) This Act relates to the tort of defamation at general law.

(2) This Act does not affect the operation of the general law in relation to the tort of defamation except to the extent that this Act provides otherwise (whether expressly or by necessary implication).

(3) Without limiting subsection (2), the general law as it is from time to time applies for the purposes of this Act as if the following legislation had never been enacted:

(a) the Defamation Act 1958,
(b) the Defamation Act 1974.

79Two things may be said about s 6. First, the exercise required is not as difficult as it may appear: it is not necessary for this Court to reconstruct the general law by seeking to remove the effect of almost 50 years of legislative change and case-law: the general law has continued to apply in a number of Australian jurisdictions and has been considered from time to time by the High Court. Disregarding statute, the High Court has held that there is only one general law in Australia: Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25; 189 CLR 520 at 563. Secondly, although the earlier legislation in this State is to be ignored in identifying the general law, it is not necessarily to be ignored in construing the Defamation Act 2005. Nevertheless, it should be accepted that the construction of (largely) uniform national legislation will not generally be affected by earlier legislation operating only in one State. Were that not so, the construction of national uniform legislation would become significantly more complex than it already is.

80There is also something curious about the approach adopted by the trial judge with respect to authority as to the operation of s 26, although there appears to be confusion within the cases. Thus, the trial judge preferred the construction of s 26 adopted by McCallum J in McMahon v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd (No 6) [2012) NSWSC 224 to that of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Mizikovsky v Queensland Television Ltd [2013] QCA 68; [2014] 1 Qd R 197: at [120]. That was not a course which would normally be available to a trial judge dealing with national uniform legislation. (McMahon was decided after Mizikovsky at first instance (by Dalton J), but before the appeal.)

81In Besser v Kermode [2011] NSWCA 174; 81 NSWLR 157 (reported as Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Kermode) (""Kermode"") this Court (McColl JA, Beazley and Giles JJA agreeing) addressed the following issue identified at [15]:

""The principal question raised by the strike-out application was whether the defence of contextual truth for which s 26 of the 2005 Act provides permits a defendant to 'plead-back' any or all of a plaintiff's imputations. The primary judge concluded it did not.""

82The Court upheld that conclusion and dismissed the appeal. On one view, the judgment was confined to a pleading point and did not need to answer the separate question as to whether a defendant could nevertheless rely upon imputations which it had proved to be substantially true as overwhelming the defamatory effect of an imputation to which it had not pleaded or established a defence of substantial truth. Nevertheless, the Court outlined at [86] a number of courses which were open to a defendant:

""In summary, a defendant seeking to justify the defamatory matter under the 2005 Act may take the following courses of action, some statutory, some based on the common law: 

(a) prove that the defamatory imputations carried by the defamatory matter of which the plaintiff complains are substantially true: s 25; 

(b) prove that rather than the defamatory imputations pleaded by the plaintiff, the defamatory matter carries nuance imputations which are substantially true; 

(c) to the extent that the defendant fails to establish all the defamatory imputations carried by the defamatory matter of which the plaintiff complains are substantially true, rely on those proved to be true in mitigation of the plaintiff's damages: partial justification; and 

(d) to the extent the defendant can not prove that the defamatory imputations carried by the defamatory matter of which the plaintiff complains are substantially true, prove that it carries contextual imputations that are substantially true, by reason of which the defamatory imputations do not further harm the reputation of the plaintiff: s 26.""

83There is some uncertainty about the precise inter-relationship of the courses of action identified at (c) and (d). It is clear, however, that the propositions set out in this paragraph were not intended to be an exhaustive statement of the courses available to a defendant. Other defences are available in appropriate cases.

84In Mizikovsky the Queensland Court of Appeal (Fraser JA, Holmes JA and Fryberg J agreeing) identified the following issue at [11]:

""In addressing the jury, senior counsel for the appellant submitted that in answering question 6 the jury were to compare the contextual imputations with such of the defamatory imputations which were not proved to be substantially true. In ruling 3, the trial judge gave reasons for her Honour's directions to the jury that the submission to the jury was incorrect, and that the question for the jury's determination was whether, having regard to the substantial truth of all the contextual imputations, there was any further harm done to the appellant's reputation in publishing all the imputations alleged by the respondents which the jury found were conveyed and were defamatory, regardless of whether or not the jury found that some of them were true.""

85In Mizikovsky, the appellant was the plaintiff at trial and sought to exclude from the jury's consideration of the contextual imputations all of the defamatory imputations which he had pleaded but which had been proved to be substantially true. The trial judge did not accept that proposition, nor did the Court of Appeal. Fraser JA stated at [14]:

""The trial judge's construction adopts the literal meaning of s 26. Section 25 allows the defence of justification only 'if the defendant proves that the defamatory imputations carried by the matter of which the plaintiff complains are substantially true'. That reflects the fact that the cause of action under the Act is for publication of defamatory matter, rather than for publication of a severable defamatory imputation. It requires proof of the substantial truth of every defamatory imputation of which the plaintiff complains. In the absence of such proof, s 25 does not provide a defence. Section 26 then requires the defendant to prove that 'the defamatory imputations' - meaning all of the defamatory imputations of which the plaintiff complains - do not further harm the reputation of the plaintiff because of the substantial truth of the contextual imputations.""

86The reasoning in Kermode and Mizikovsky (which may not be entirely consistent with each other) appears to assume that the defences in ss 25 and 26 are to be applied sequentially and (at least in the case of Besser) in the order in which they appear in the Act. However, there is an alternative reading of the legislation, namely that the tribunal of fact must consider holistically the effect of the defamatory matter on the reputation of the plaintiff, deciding at the end of the day whether, by reference to the imputations pleaded by both plaintiff and defendant, any imputations which have not been shown to be substantially true cause any further harm to the reputation of the plaintiff once the effect of the substantially accurate imputations has been assessed.

87As noted by McCallum J in McMahon, in different cases the positions of the respective parties may differ: at [74]. The position adopted by each party is likely to depend upon the relative seriousness of the imputations pleaded by each. That is illustrated by the claims of absurd results which might flow from the adoption of one course or the other: McMahon at [67]; Mizikovsky at [16].

88It is not appropriate to say more about these issues in the present case as neither party sought to expose any inconsistency in the authorities, although the issue was raised in written submissions before the trial judge. The trial judge stated at [126]:

""In my view, imputation (a) cannot further injure the plaintiffs' reputations. Whether a product has been subject to recall is inconsequential if the evidence establishes that it should be subject to recall because it represents a risk of harm or death to babies or infants and is incorrectly promoted as conducive to safe sleeping.""

89On the basis that Professor Byard's evidence was admissible and was accepted, the applicants did not present any significant basis for rejecting this conclusion. Accordingly, the appeal with respect to the claim in defamation must be dismissed.

Injurious falsehood
90The applicants pleaded an alternative case claiming damages for the tort of injurious falsehood. It was necessary for them to establish that the respondents had maliciously published a false statement about them, their property or business and that actual damage resulted from such publication: Palmer Bruyn & Parker Pty Ltd v Parsons [2001] HCA 69; 208 CLR 388 at [1] (Gleeson CJ). The critical element in the present case was to establish malice. The English Court of Appeal has held that the same principles apply with respect to malice in defamation and in injurious falsehood: Spring v Guardian Assurance Plc [1993] 2 All ER 273 at 288. The concept of malice in relation to defamation has been explained by the High Court in Roberts v Bass [2002] HCA 57; 212 CLR 1, where the concept was discussed in reference to a defence of qualified privilege, which is destroyed by malice. In that context, the question is whether the publisher's state of mind was actuated by an improper purpose or motive: at [76] (Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ). 

91In the present case, the applicants did not rely upon actual knowledge of the falsity of any statement made about the applicants' product, but rather relied upon a failure to make proper inquiries and reckless indifference as to the truth or falsity of the allegations, amounting to wilful blindness. The trial judge dealt with the question of malice in relation to injurious falsehood in the following passage:

""[189] ... I am not satisfied that the defendants were careless in failing to contact the plaintiffs before televising the Broadcast since I consider that the terms of the FDA warning were sufficient to apply [to] the Babywedge and the potentially fatal consequences of using such a product warranted the urgency with which the Broadcast followed the issue of the FDA warning. However, even had I considered the defendants' omission to contact the plaintiffs to request comment on the FDA warning before the Broadcast went to air to be careless, this would not have amounted to malice ....""

92The applicants challenged the reference to ""carelessness"" as irrelevant, there being no pleading that the respondents had been merely careless. The complaint was meritless. If the respondents were not careless, they were not reckless and hence could not have been malicious. As the joint reasons in Roberts v Bass noted at [84]:

""In exceptional cases, the sheer recklessness of the defendant in making the defamatory statement, may justify a finding of malice. In other cases, recklessness in combination with other factors may persuade the court that the publication was actuated by malice. In the law of qualified privilege, as in other areas of the law, the defendant's recklessness may be so gross as to constitute wilful blindness, which the law will treat as equivalent to knowledge.""

93So far as urgency was concerned, the applicants noted that the respondents appeared to have time to obtain a Babywedge, visit a shop in which it was offered for sale and obtain comments from customers and from the representative of an organisation concerned with SIDS. That was not the degree of urgency, the applicants contended, which would warrant publishing the material without seeking a comment from the applicants.

94As has been noted above, the publication was focused upon two matters. The first was the warning from the FDA in the US linking sleep positioners with baby deaths; the second was the fact that the same ""type of product"" was available in Australia. The circumstances of the news broadcast were not such as to demand a comment from the manufacturer or distributor of similar devices in Australia. Even if such a step had been desirable, failure to take that step did not constitute recklessness as to the truth or falsity of the statements made and certainly did not constitute recklessness of a kind warranting an inference of malice on the part of the respondents. There was no error in rejecting the claim in injurious falsehood.

Other grounds
95Although extensive written submissions were made in this Court with respect to damages, little time was spent in the course of oral argument upon the assessment of provisional damages by the trial judge. As the applicants have failed to establish their challenge to the findings on liability, there is no need to consider whether it would have been appropriate to grant leave to appeal with respect to those assessments.

96There are, however, three other matters which should be addressed because they raise questions relevant to liability. 

(a) evidence of applicants as to falsity of imputations
97The individual applicants, Ms Birtles-Eades and Ms Birtles, sought to give evidence as to whether the dangers identified in other sleep positioners applied to their product, and as to the design, composition and quality of the material used in Babywedges. The evidence was rejected on the basis that these were matters for expert opinion and the applicants did not have relevant expertise. The applicants did not claim such expertise, nor was there any suggestion that s 78 of the Evidence Act (relating to the admissibility of lay opinion) was engaged. Rather, the applicants relied upon a bald proposition, expressed in the conventionally colourful language of defamation law (with the usual risk of imprecision) that ""[a] plaintiff is nevertheless always permitted to nail the matter complained of as a lie"": Ainsworth v Burden [2005] NSWCA 174 at [89] (Hunt AJA, Handley and McColl JJA agreeing).

98In this sentence, the word ""nevertheless"" indicated that the sentence was a qualification of an earlier statement, namely that ""[t]he objective truth or falsity of the matter complained is irrelevant to its defamatory nature"": at [88]. The authorities referred to in Ainsworth used such language, but did so in a particular context. In Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Uren [1966] HCA 37; 117 CLR 185 Windeyer J had stated (at 205) that while the truth or falsity of the words was irrelevant as to whether they were actionable or not, they were relevant if the words were defamatory to the amount of damages recoverable.

99Further, once one reads beyond the aphorism, it is clear that a plaintiff's evidence in that regard is not necessarily relevant to an issue in the trial and is not given by way of an exception to the Evidence Act. In other words, if there is an issue in the trial requiring proof or disproof, the evidence relevant to it must be admissible evidence. That was the approach adopted by the trial judge: she was clearly correct in that regard. The challenge to her ruling set out in Born Brands Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (No 4) [2013] NSWSC 1649 at [9] should be rejected.

(b) whether corporate applicant entitled to sue
100Although it is a matter of no consequence in circumstances where the applicants have failed to establish a claim, it is desirable to deal with the question whether the corporate applicant was entitled to sue as it raises a point of law of potential relevance in other cases.

101The Defamation Act 2005 now provides a general rule that corporations cannot sue in defamation, unless they fall within the terms of an exception. Section 9 relevantly states:

9 Certain corporations do not have cause of action for defamation

(1) A corporation has no cause of action for defamation in relation to the publication of defamatory matter about the corporation unless it was an excluded corporation at the time of the publication.

(2) A corporation is an excluded corporation if:
(a) the objects for which it is formed do not include obtaining financial gain for its members or corporators, or
(b) it employs fewer than 10 persons and is not related to another corporation,
and the corporation is not a public body.

(3) In counting employees for the purposes of subsection (2)(b), part-time employees are to be taken into account as an appropriate fraction of a full-time equivalent.

102The application of this particular provision to the first applicant arose on the appeal as a challenge to the refusal of the trial judge to allow the first applicant to reopen its case to prove that it was an excluded corporation and therefore had standing to sue. However, the need for the first applicant to reopen its case depended upon a particular construction of s 9(2) which should not be accepted: see Born Brands Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (No 5) [2013] NSWSC 1650. 

103The trial judge accepted the approach adopted by Nicholas J in Redeemer Baptist School Ltd v Glossop [2006] NSWSC 1201 in relation to the predecessor to s 9(2)(b), namely s 8A of the 1974 Act. That statute also referred to a corporation which ""employs fewer than 10 persons"": s 8A(3)(a). Nicholas J concluded, giving the words in s 8A their natural and ordinary meaning:

""[21] ... Absent qualification, the meaning of the word 'persons' in sub-para (a) includes individuals who are employees and those who are not. There is no justification for confining its meaning to individuals under a contract of employment with the corporation. Had it been intended by the legislature that its meaning should be so construed it may be assumed that the word 'employee' would have been used instead.

[22] The construction of the verb 'employs' should be approached in the same way. The use of the word 'persons' indicates that it was not intended that 'employs' be understood in an industrial sense referable to a relationship of master and servant under a contract of service.""

104It is not necessary to consider whether this construction was correct with respect to s 8A of the 1974 Act. Further, it may be conceded that the verb ""employs"" has a range of meanings. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that, read in context, the language in s 9(2)(b) is not uncertain or ambiguous. That is because sub-s (3) explicitly refers to counting ""employees for the purposes of subsection (2)(b)"". It does not refer to counting ""persons"" for the purposes of s 9(2)(b); rather, it assumes that those persons are employees, an assumption which is consistent only with the use of the verb ""employs"" as referring to a person having contract of employment.

105The evidence before the Court indicated that the second and third applicants were not merely directors of the first applicant, but employees. Given that part-time employees were to be taken into account as an appropriate fraction of a fulltime employee, the proper inference, on the balance of probabilities, is that, at the relevant time, there were no other employees. Thus, in the year ending June 2011, the total wages identified in the company accounts amounted to $2,311. Even the amount listed under ""Consultants fees"" was only $13,412. An amount of $208 was accounted for under the heading ""Superannuation"". These figures indicate, on the probabilities, that the company had fewer than 10 employees. The claim against it should not have been dismissed on the basis that it was not an excluded corporation. It had standing to sue.

106In further submissions with respect to this issue (filed after the hearing) the respondent broadly accepted the construction set out above, but submitted that the term ""employees"" should not be limited to what were described as ""employees at common law"" (including executive directors or principals of a business engaged in its ongoing operations). Rather the section should extend to individuals engaged in the day-to-day operations of the corporation and subject to its direction and control. This category was intended to include persons supplied by labour hire firms. However, because no such issue arises in the present case, it is not necessary to resolve the limits of the section.

(c) apprehended bias
107The application for disqualification was based on an allegation of apprehended bias, of which some five particulars were given. The draft notice of appeal was silent as to the basis on which the trial judge erred in dismissing the application. The written submissions in support of the leave application did not address the question of apprehended bias. The further written submissions filed for the applicants dealt with the ground in four paragraphs. The first two paragraphs identified the allegations, the submissions and the judgment. The second two paragraphs contained three sentences, of which the last was conclusory. The other two sentences indicated that the applicants relied upon the judgment allowing the report of Professor Byard and ""the various rulings and findings as to the admissibility of evidence and other rulings referred to in their submissions including findings that the imputations were not defamatory and that there was no loss of custom after the broadcast.""

108These submissions were so perfunctory as to be dismissive of the application they sought to support. An allegation of apprehended bias against a superior court judge should not be made lightly. If upheld, it invalidates the whole of the proceedings at trial.

109In oral argument, senior counsel submitted that the judgment ""admitting the report [of Professor Byard] into evidence indicated that her Honour had made up her mind to uphold the report, which seems to be strongly upholding the report and that led to the application to probable bias, apprehended bias. If that does not disclose sufficient grounds to make such an application then the apprehended bias ground will be withdrawn."" In some further clarification, counsel indicated that the judgment on admissibility ""reads like a final judgment"": CA Tcpt, 22/08/14, pp 42(45)-43(9).

110It will be necessary to refer briefly to the terms of the judgment (which counsel did not do) but it is convenient to note first that immediately following delivery of the interlocutory judgment admitting the expert report the following exchange took place (Tcpt, pp 264-265):

""EVATT: Is that the end of the case, your Honour?

HER HONOUR: I think that will be for you to judge, it is not for me to judge Mr Evatt. Because I have not heard the rest of your evidence or the defendant's submissions .... I just dealt with your five objections to Professor Byard's report. As I understand it you still have a number of witnesses to call. 

...

So in terms of where we are up to at the moment I am just allowing Professor Byard to be interposed which is why he has been called although the plaintiffs' case is not closed.

EVATT: [It's] not just a case of admitting the report, your Honour. Your Honour has just given a judgment upholding the report.

HER HONOUR: Not at all. I have dealt with your objections, Mr Evatt. That does not mean you can't persuade me that I won't accept what Professor Byard said in his report. I have just dealt with your five objections. 

EVATT: So it is still open.

HER HONOUR: Of course it is open. You say he does not have the expertise to express conclusions and opinions. I say he does. That does not mean I say I accept his opinions, that is a matter for another day.

EVATT: I misunderstood.""

111To make sense of the discussion, it is necessary to impute to the reasonable fair-minded observer a degree of understanding as to the exercise which had been undertaken with respect to Professor Byard.

112The bases of objection to Professor Byard's report have been discussed above. The trial judge rejected each of the objections and gave reasons for doing so. The fifth objection was that Professor Byard had made ""assumptions, including about Babywedge and other products, without sufficient basis"": Judgment on expert evidence, at [13]. In dealing with that objection, the trial judge noted the assumptions and said that she considered them to be ""reasonable assumptions and reasonable inferences that could be drawn by an expert, such as Professor Byard, having regard to the information he had as to these products"": at [14]. It is not necessary to set out the other objections and the judge's responses: they are publicly available.

113Assuming that the reasonable bystander understood the distinction between a ruling on admissibility and acceptance of a witness' evidence, he or she would not have been left in any doubt that it was the former, not the latter, exercise which the judge was undertaking in delivering the judgment with respect to Professor Byard's evidence. Even if the judge had fallen into ambiguous language (which she did not) the exchange which followed the delivery of the judgment, which would also have been heard by the hypothetical bystander, would have cured any misapprehension. The ground is without substance and there is no basis for granting leave with respect to that ground.

Costs
114The result of this judgment is that the applicants will be refused leave to appeal with respect to some grounds and otherwise there will be a grant of leave to appeal but the appeal will be dismissed. Nevertheless, the applicants have had a degree of success in respect of particular grounds. In short, contrary to the views of the trial judge, particular imputations were conveyed and were defamatory. Further, the claims of the first applicant in defamation should not have been dismissed on the ground that it did not establish it was an excluded corporation for the purposes of s 9 of the Defamation Act 2005. Nevertheless, none of these findings has translated into a judgment in favour of the applicants on liability. The respondents have maintained the judgment in the Court below and should have their costs in this Court. This is not a matter in which it is appropriate to reduce those costs because the applicants had a measure of success on specific issues.

Conclusions
115The Court should make the following orders:

(1) Grant the applicants leave to appeal from the judgments, both interlocutory and final in the Common Law Division, excluding the grounds relating to damages (grounds 8-10); the admissibility of evidence of the second and third applicants as to the falsity of imputations (b), (c) and (d) and as to the design, composition and quality of the material used in Babywedge (grounds 12 and 13); the alleged amendment to the defence after the close of evidence (ground 14); the refusal to recuse on the ground of apprehended bias (ground 19).

(2) Direct that the applicants file the notice of appeal in the form of the draft contained in the White Folder.

(3) Dismiss the appeal.

(4) Order that the applicants pay the respondents' costs in this Court.

116MEAGHER JA: I agree with Basten JA.

117TOBIAS AJA: I agree with Basten JA.

2765170,Ghosh v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd & Ors (No. 2); Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors (No. 5) [2014] NSWDC 215,"Judgment

1On 17 September 2014, I made orders as follows (see Ghosh v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd & Ors; Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors (No 4) [2014] NSWDC 151):

(1)Proceedings dismissed.

(2)Plaintiff pay defendants' costs of these proceedings.

(3)Liberty to apply in relation to costs.

(4)In proceedings 2013/88183, the plaintiff is to file a notice of appearance in 7 days.

(5)In proceedings 2013/88183, direct the plaintiff to approach the Registry to update the second and third defendants' details on JusticeLink in 7 days.

2These proceedings were commenced by the plaintiff in the Newcastle Registry of the District Court on 22 March 2013. As is set out in my judgment at [2014] NSWDC 151, from that date until the date onwards the plaintiff failed, in the 11 statements of claim successively put before the court, to plead and particularise her claim for defamation against a number of defendants in accordance with the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules, and the proceedings were struck out as an abuse of process (see [94] - [98]). While an alternative finding in relation to the proportionality principle was made, this failure to comply was the principle reason for these proceedings being struck out.

3The plaintiff brings an application pursuant to r 36.15 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR""), as well as an application for summary judgment against all defendants, as follows:

""(1) The plaintiff requests the defendants to consent to set aside the judgment by ucpr 36.15 Subrule (2), failing which she requests the Court to set aside the judgment by ucpr 36.15 Subrule (1) for the reasons set out in the Affidavit 

(2) Stay the execution of her Honour Judge Gibson's costs orders of 17 September 2014 

(3) The plaintiff seeks Summary judgment by ucpr 13.1 (1) against all defendants to expedite the case, if this motion is successful, and a Stay of the execution of her Honour Judge Gibson's costs orders of 17 September 2014 by ucpr 13.2, pending determination of a cross - claim 

(4) Reinstate the case or at least allow re-hearing of the strike out application with new Counsel representing Dr Ghosh and fresh evidence not presented by Counsel Christopher Dibb as he failed to follow instructions from Dr Ghosh""

4The plaintiff initially sought orders pursuant to UCPR r 36.16 in a notice of motion filed on 25 September 2014 but, at the last moment, sought an adjournment until today, to enable her to reframe the relief sought. The current notice of motion has not been filed but was emailed to my associate.

5The plaintiff now seeks relief under UCPR r 36.15, which provides:

""36.15 General power to set aside judgment or order 

(1) A judgment or order of the court in any proceedings may, on sufficient cause being shown, be set aside by order of the court if the judgment was given or entered, or the order was made, irregularly, illegally or against good faith.

(2) A judgment or order of the court in any proceedings may be set aside by order of the court if the parties to the proceedings consent.""

6The plaintiff relied upon her affidavits of 22 September and 23 October 2014. I shall not set out the grounds or the contents of these affidavits (which I have read as submissions only) as I have accepted the submissions of the defendants that the serious allegations warrant the making of an order under Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), s 8(1)(e).

7The plaintiff commenced her argument by asking the defendants to consent to the setting aside of judgment against her, and to the entering of judgment against them, on the basis that they had never filed a defence. The defendants have never been ordered to file a defence because the irregularities in the plaintiff's pleadings have resulted in the proceedings never proceeding further than rulings concerning the statement of claim. They are not prepared to consent to the setting aside of my orders, and that means that the plaintiff must proceed to the other basis under UCPR r 36.15, and establish that the judgment was obtained irregularly, illegally or against good faith (UCPR r 36.15(1)). The plaintiff submits, in relation to this formula, that judgment had been entered against her ""illegally"" and makes allegations about the conduct of the defendants which I shall not repeat, but which are clear on their face to be unsupported by any factual evidence.

8The principal basis for the claim is submitted to be the incompetence (or worse) of her legal representatives, in relation to their conduct of these proceedings since February 2014 and the defence of the summary judgment application. Professional negligence by a legal representative in terms of preparation and presentation for court proceedings is not a basis for the setting aside of orders under UCPR r 36.15. I generally note, as to competence, that Mrs Barnett has submitted, and I similarly agree, that Mr Dibb of Counsel prepared and presented his arguments and supporting documentation concerning the summary judgment application in an exemplary manner, given the circumstances. Similarly, I reject the aspersions cast by the plaintiff on the defendants' solicitors in these proceedings.

9Nor is judicial error a basis for setting aside a judgment on the basis that it was entered irregularly, illegally or contrary to good faith: Zakaria v Dr Noyce [2012] NSWSC 981 at [22]. As I have previously indicated to Dr Ghosh, when she brought this notice of motion under UCPR r 36.16, the appropriate forum for complaints about judicial error is the New South Wales Court of Appeal: Coren v Master Builders Association of New South Wales Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 244. The conduct of these proceedings in the Court of Appeal will involve case management issues, and in my view it is appropriate that any order for a stay should be made by that Court, if considered appropriate, as such an application can be made on the appropriate terms, for example in relation to the expedition of the hearing.

10I should give brief reasons for the making of the suppression order. The scandalous nature of the allegations (unsupported by evidence and consisting of the plaintiff's opinion) is self-evident, and no purpose can be served by making their contents public. The fact that similar allegations were made in the defamation pleadings was a factor (although a small one) in my striking out these proceedings pursuant to UCPR r 12.7. 

11I have made an order for costs of the motion to be paid on an indemnity basis. I note that I made a similar order in relation to the costs of the motion seeking relief pursuant to UCPR r 36.16.

2765172,Parhizkar v R [2014] NSWCCA 240,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

In 2011, the applicant was a detainee at Villawood Immigration Detention Centre. On 20 April 2011, the applicant joined a protest with other detainees on the roof of a building. Some of the detainees (including the applicant) removed tiles from the roof and threw them in the direction of security officers trying to control the protest; others on the roof simply protested without threatening or committing any unlawful violence. Those on the roof were given encouragement and supplies by detainees on the ground, some of whom also used or threatened unlawful violence. The situation eventually escalated to the point where security evacuated the immediate. 

The applicant was charged with riot and affray: Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), ss 93B and 93C. He pleaded guilty only to affray. At trial, the applicant argued that, for the purposes of s 93B(1), he was not ""present together"" with 11 other persons using or threatening unlawful violence: there were not 12 detainees behaving violently on the roof and those on the ground were too distant to be considered. The trial judge gave a direction that ""present together"" meant persons being in the same place, offering as an example persons behaving violently in different grandstands of a stadium as being ""present together"". The applicant argued ""present together"" required close proximity between the persons. The trial judge rejected the submission. The applicant was convicted of riot.

The applicant sought leave to appeal his conviction on the basis the trial judge had misdirected the jury. A related complaint was that the prosecution should not have been allowed to rely on persons found not guilty of riot but guilty of affray in establishing there were 12 persons who had used or threatened unlawful violence. The applicant also alleged error in: not allowing cross-examination of a witness as to whether he had viewed footage of the disturbance on the internet; not discharging the jury following a published article asserting what occurred was a ""riot"", and not providing the jury with access to transcripts of counsels' addresses and the judge's summing up. 

The applicant also sought leave to appeal his sentence, arguing his time in immigration detention was more restrictive when awaiting trial and this should have been considered in sentencing.

The Court held, granting leave to appeal against conviction but dismissing the appeal and refusing leave to appeal against sentence:

""Present together"" in s 93B
(Price J, McCallum J agreeing)
1. The trial judge's directions adequately identified the principles to be applied and made it plain that ""present together"" was an issue. The phrase ""present together"" is intended to have its ordinary meaning and it does not need to be established that persons are in close proximity to be considered ""present together"": [84], [86], [88], [89]-[90], [97]

Regina v W(N) [2010] 1 WLR 1426 followed.
Anderson v Attorney General of New South Wales (1987) 10 NSWLR 198 not followed.

(Basten JA; McCallum J) 
2. The example of violence erupting in different grandstands of a stadium as constituting ""present together"" had the potential of misleading the jury from considering whether there was a ""common purpose"" and that their conduct taken together would cause a person of reasonable firmness to fear for their personal safety. Notwithstanding (per McCallum J) the use of the example did not produce a miscarriage of justice: [36], [49], [97]

(Price J)
3. The example was not troubling. Members of a jury (using their common sense) could readily envisage situations where persons behaving violently in different parts of a stadium were doing so with a ""common purpose"": [91]

(Basten JA dissenting)
4. The element of ""present together"" must be addressed coherently and harmoniously with the other elements of s 93B. The jury should have been directed that they needed to consider whether those on the ground were in sufficiently close proximity to those on the roof to determine whether they were ""present together"" and that not all conduct furthering the protest was necessarily threatening or using unlawful violence: [47], [48]-[49], [66]

Anderson v Attorney General of New South Wales (1987) 10 NSWLR 198 considered.
Woodrow (1959) 43 Cr App R 105; Jones (1974) 59 Cr App R referred to.

(Basten JA, Price and McCallum JJ agreeing)
5. Only a person who has used unlawful violence can be found guilty of riot but that person must be one of 12 using or threatening unlawful violence. No inconsistency arose in prosecuting the applicant for riot by relying on persons guilty only of affray to establish there were 12 persons involved, as affray may be satisfied where a person threatens unlawful violence: [51]-[55].

Other grounds
(Basten JA, Price and McCallum JJ agreeing)
6. The cross-examination of the witness as to whether they had viewed footage of the disturbance on the internet was a matter of no consequence: [56]

7. Considering the clear and repeated directions that reliance should only be had on the evidence before them, the trial judge was correct in not discharging the jury following the publication of the article: [57]-[58]

8. No miscarriage of justice arose in the trial judge failing to inform the jury they could request transcripts of addresses and the summing up. Nothing from the circumstances of the trial suggested the jury would have made such a request if informed they could: [64]

R v Taousanis [1999] NSWSC 197; 146 A Crim R 303; R v Bartle [2003] NSWCCA 329; 181 FLR 1; Regina v Sukkar [2005] NSWCCA 54 referred to. 

Sentencing
(Basten JA, Price and McCallum JJ agreeing)
9. The trial judge was unaware of the circumstances under which the applicant was detained while awaiting trial. In those circumstances, it cannot be said that the trial judge erred in the approach he took: [68]-[70]



			Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: On 20Â April 2011 a major disturbance broke out at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre in Sydney involving a number of asylum seekers detained by the Commonwealth under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). Some had been there for a considerable period of time.
	
	
	There were several âcompoundsâ in the detention centre. One, named Fowler, contained more than 150 detainees. The protest which escalated over the course of the day, commenced with two men, Mehdi Darabi and Morad Mansoor, climbing onto the roof of a building known as Macquarie. They were observed by security officers sometime after 7am. They removed tiles from the roof and, at various times, threatened to throw tiles towards those on the ground below and, on occasion, did throw tiles onto the ground. The protest proceeded in a fairly desultory manner until after lunch. At about 2pm an activities officer tried to commence a game of soccer on the soccer field at the centre of the compound, one side of which was bounded by the Macquarie Building. The men on the roof demanded that there be âno footballâ, a chant which was picked up and repeated by a large gathering of detainees on the ground. The soccer game was abandoned.
	
	
	During the course of the afternoon, there were more threats by the two men on the roof of the Macquarie Building and further tiles were thrown on occasion. At about 4 or 4.30pm, detainees on the ground threw bedding and bottled water to the two men on the roof. At around 6pm further items were thrown up to the men on the roof. From about 7.15pm, more detainees joined the men on the roof. The security staff then formed a cordon to prevent further detainees approaching an internal fence, from which they could climb onto the roof. After 8pm there were 10 detainees on the roof. One of them was the present applicant. There was undoubtedly communication between those on the roof and those on the ground in the immediate vicinity. Those on the roof were encouraging others to join them; those on the ground were providing a degree of support and encouragement, verbally and by throwing up bedding and water.
	
	
	At some stage, apparently around 11pm, some of those on the ground in the compound took fire extinguishers and sprayed their contents around, including in the direction of security staff. At least one fire extinguisher was thrown towards a security officer. At around that time, all security officers left the Fowler compound for their own safety. So far as the prosecution case alleged a âriotâ, it concluded at that stage.
	


Statutory offence and defences


	
	The applicant was charged with two statutory offences of riot and affray. The offence of riot, contained in sÂ 93B of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) is identified in the following terms:
	


93BÂ Â Â Riot

(1)Â Â Â Where 12 or more persons who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose and the conduct of them (taken together) is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety, each of the persons using unlawful violence for the common purpose is guilty of riot and liable to imprisonment for 15 years.

(2)Â Â Â It is immaterial whether or not the 12 or more persons use or threaten unlawful violence simultaneously.

(3)Â Â Â The common purpose may be inferred from conduct.

(4)Â Â Â No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene.

(5)Â Â Â Riot may be committed in private as well as in public places.


	
	The offence of affray is identified in sÂ 93C in the following terms:
	


93CÂ Â Â Affray

(1)Â Â Â A person who uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another and whose conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety is guilty of affray and liable to imprisonment for 10 years.

(2)Â Â Â If 2 or more persons use or threaten the unlawful violence, it is the conduct of them taken together that must be considered for the purposes of subsection (1).

(3)Â Â Â For the purposes of this section, a threat cannot be made by the use of words alone.

(4)Â Â Â No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene.

(5)Â Â Â Affray may be committed in private as well as in public places.


	
	There are two further provisions which bear upon the meaning and practical effect of these offences. First, sÂ 93A provides a definition of âviolenceâ in the following terms:
	


93AÂ Â Â Definition

In this Division:

violence means any violent conduct, so that:

(a)Â Â Â except for the purposes of section 93C, it includes violent conduct towards property as well as violent conduct towards persons, and

(b)Â Â Â it is not restricted to conduct causing or intended to cause injury or damage but includes any other violent conduct (for example, throwing at or towards a person a missile of a kind capable of causing injury which does not hit or falls short).

The mental element is identified in the following terms:

93DÂ Â Â Mental element under sections 93B and 93C

(1)Â Â Â A person is guilty of riot only if the person intends to use violence or is aware that his or her conduct may be violent.

(2)Â Â Â A person is guilty of affray only if the person intends to use or threaten violence or is aware that his or her conduct may be violent or threaten violence.

(3)Â Â Â Subsection (1) does not affect the determination for the purposes of riot of the number of persons who use or threaten violence.


	
	There are four elements of the offence of riot which differ from that of affray. First, a person can be guilty of affray when acting alone: there is no requirement for 12 or more persons to act together for a common purpose. Secondly, while both offences require that the conduct of the person charged must cause a person of reasonable firmness to fear for his or her personal safety, for affray that must be achieved by the conduct of the accused alone, whereas riot requires the composite effect of the conduct of 12 or more persons. Thirdly, for an affray, the unlawful violence must be directed towards another person; with respect to riot, violence includes violent conduct towards property as well as towards persons: sÂ 93A(a). Fourthly, riot requires that the accused use unlawful violence; for affray, a threat of violence is sufficient.
	


Issues on appeal


	
	The points of distinction between the offences of riot and affray are significant in the present case. The applicant was charged with both offences but pleaded guilty to affray. That plea was not accepted in full discharge of the indictment, but would have provided the basis for a conviction of that offence, if he had not been convicted of riot. The significance of the plea for present purposes is that the issues in dispute before the jury were limited to (1) whether there were 12 or more persons, present together, using or threatening to use unlawful violence, for a common purpose, and (2) whether the applicant used unlawful violence. (Although one accused sought a direction as to self-defence, to the extent there was violence, it was not to be doubted that it was unlawful.)
	
	
	The common purpose itself was not the subject of any particular challenge relevant to the applicant. The broad purpose was to express frustration at the long and continuing periods of detention suffered by asylum seekers awaiting initial decisions on their visa applications or decisions of a tribunal or court challenging initial adverse decisions. The protestors sought to have senior officers of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship attend, no doubt so that they could express their frustration directly to them, with the expectation or hope of obtaining some relief. Nor was it in dispute that there were others present who, like the applicant, used and threatened unlawful violence. The central question was whether there were â12 or more personsâ engaged in that common purpose and using or at least threatening unlawful violence who were âpresent togetherâ.
	
	
	The written submissions for the applicant contended that there were âthirteen people identified as being on the roof during the protestâ, but not all were alleged to have engaged in acts of violence or to have threatened violence. That proposition appeared to be accepted by counsel for the Director and also by the trial judge in his summing up, to which reference will be made below. On that basis, it was necessary for the jury to decide whether there were others on the ground who used or threatened violence for the same purpose as those on the roof and, if so, whether they could properly be included with those on the roof as being âpresent togetherâ. The primary ground of appeal challenged the adequacy of the direction given to the jury in this regard: notice of appeal, ground 1.
	
	
	There were two subsidiary grounds, one of which asserted that the prosecution should not have been permitted to rely upon, as part of the 12 persons, those accused who had entered pleas (accepted by the Director of Public Prosecutions) of not guilty of riot, but guilty of affray (ground 2). In support of that ground, it was further submitted that the pleas were admissible in evidence (ground 3). For reasons which will be noted briefly below, ground 2 should not be upheld: ground 3, in those circumstances, does not require separate consideration.
	
	
	Ground 4 was somewhat curious. It complained that the trial judge had not permitted cross-examination of a particular witness as to whether he had viewed video footage of the events of the evening on the internet, or discussed what happened with others, before giving evidence. The purpose of the challenge appears to have been to cast doubt on specific evidence about the conduct of the applicant in throwing tiles off the roof at or in the direction of security staff. That conduct was not seriously in dispute. Although he did not get up on the roof until around 9pm, the applicant was an active participant thereafter.
	
	
	Ground 5 complained of a failure to discharge the jury after publication of a potentially prejudicial article concerning the sentencing of co-offenders. Ground 6 complained that the trial judge had not permitted the jury access to the transcript of counselsâ addresses or the judgeâs summing up. For reasons which will be dealt with below, none of grounds 4, 5 or 6 had merit. Accordingly, ground 7, alleging a miscarriage due to the cumulative effect of various errors alleged, does not require consideration.
	
	
	Ground 8 alleged an error in sentencing in failing to take into account time spent in immigration custody, when backdating the sentence.
	


Directions as to 12 persons being âpresent togetherâ


	
	The applicant stood trial with eight co-accused. Each was charged with one or both of the offences of riot and affray. The fact that each played a different role in the events at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre on 20Â April required significant care to be taken in addressing the jury with respect to each charge. In a carefully structured summing up which was, generally, a model of clarity, the only passages which need to be addressed are those relating to this element of a riot. The trial judge dealt with this element in five separate passages. The first appeared as part of his overarching discussion of the elements of the offence; the second in a passage dealing with the relevant involvement of those not standing trial; the third dealt with the prosecution case; the fourth with the defence case, and the fifth with counselâs request for further directions on this element.
	


(a)Â Â Â the general directions as to elements of the offence


	
	The judge commenced by noting that the prosecution case alleged a riot which was âan ongoing event from the time that there was the so-called rush of detainees towards to the cordon on the top side of the Macquarie Building through until the Serco [security] staff evacuatedâ: Summing up, pÂ 26(15). The evidence was not precise as to the timing of particular events and the judge was careful not to be more precise in his directions. On the brief summary given above, it appears that the surge towards to the security cordon occurred around 7.15pm and that the security officers evacuated the compound about four hours later. (Most of the extensive damage to property occurred later and, indeed, in other compounds.)
	
	
	Secondly, the trial judge noted that there was evidence from security staff that they were fearful for their safety and that no submission had been made that others of reasonable firmness in their circumstances would not have been. In any event, the element was satisfied with respect to the applicant by his plea of guilty to the charge of affray. The judge continued at pÂ 27(17):
	


âThere is a requirement that the persons alleged to have participated in the riot, that is, the 12 or more persons, used or threatened unlawful violence for a common purpose. There is also the requirement that for an accused to be guilty, he not only must have been one of the 12 or more, he must also be shown to have actually used unlawful violence for the common purpose.â


	
	The judge further noted that there was a temporal element involved and the actual use of violence must have occurred during the period when they considered that the riot was occurring, and not before or afterwards. After dealing with the common purpose and the concept of violence, the judge continued in the following passage, which was the subject of express challenge by the applicant (ppÂ 30(17)-31(20)):
	


âI want to say something about the words âpresent togetherâ as well. I do not think there is a note about this with your document but there is something I want to say about that term âpresent togetherâ.

The words do not have any different meaning in law than they do in the ordinary English language. There is no requirement that for persons to be present together, that they have to be within a certain distance of each other. The concept is really directed to people being in the same place as each other. That could be a small place or it could be a large place.

Let me give you an example. I just made this one up. Say you have a riot at an English Premier League soccer game. The fans of the losing team start committing various acts of violence towards the fans of the winning team. In such a situation, it would be open to a jury to conclude that those who were behaving violently within the stadium were present together, even though they might well have been located in different grandstands. But it might be an entirely different matter if there were some fans behaving violently in the stadium and some more being violent at the tube station a kilometre away from the stadium.

I suggest you take a practical approach to this question. The main factor appears to be if you find that there were 12 or more detainees using or threatening unlawful violence, whether they were do[ing] so for a common purpose. If you do, does it really matter if some were near the laundry, others were on the soccer field and others were on the roof?

Assume you found that there were 12 or more using or threatening unlawful violence in order to protest against their detention in, for example, those three locations, would it be sensible and practical to regard them as not being present together? It is a matter for you to decide. You are the judges of the facts. You have heard some submissions of counsel, which I will remind you of later in my summing-up, but the essential point is that they are ordinary words, apply your commonsense to them, ladies and gentlemen.â

(b)Â Â Â other participants


	
	The trial judge gave directions with respect to other participants, by reference to three categories. The first were two âformer accusedâ, MrÂ Kamali and MrÂ Mosawi, who had obtained verdicts of not guilty by direction: pÂ 42(23). There were two who had pleaded guilty to affray and whose pleas had been accepted in full discharge of the indictment with respect to each, namely MrÂ Mansoor and MrÂ Chenarjaafarizad: pÂ 43(2). Thirdly, there were other persons named in the course of the prosecution case, who included MessrsÂ Razai, Dadash, Darabi and Jafari, as well as some who had not been identified. Having warned against speculation as to what may have happened to those persons, the judge continued at pÂ 43(16):
	


âYou may take into account â¦ any activity of these other people, any activity that they may have been involved in. That includes MrÂ Mansoor and MrÂ Chenarjaafarizad, notwithstanding they pleaded guilty to affray.

It remains open to you, and entirely up to you, to consider whether they were part of the group of 12 or more persons who the Crown alleges were using or threatening unlawful violence for the common purpose.â

(c)Â Â Â prosecution case


	
	Almost immediately following the directions set out above, the judge turned to the prosecution case. Although it covers a number of aspects of the offending, it is necessary to set out the whole of the direction with respect to the prosecution case, at ppÂ 44(9)-45(21).
	


âThe Crown case is that a riot commenced from the time of the so-called rush of detainees towards the cordon on the top side of the Macquarie building. There were initially two on the roof, MrÂ Mansoor and Mr Darabi. They were joined later by MrÂ Amiri and Mr Razai. Then 20 or 30 more went towards the cordon.

Those on the roof threw tiles at Serco officers to deter them from preventing others from getting on to the roof; this is the Crown's case to you on riot. The riot continued from the time of that event, whatever time it occurred, until buildings were set fire.

There was an ongoing increasingly violent disturbance. It was not a spate of unrelated events engaged in by people willy-nilly. This ongoing disturbance was interspersed with periods of relative quiet, but that did not mean that the riot had stopped. There was ebb and flow, the Crown Prosecutor submitted, but it was building up and conduct was becoming more violent until ultimately the Serco staff evacuated.

The Crown contends that participants in the riot comprised each of the nine accused as well as others. Not all of those who were engaged in acting or threatening to act violently could be identified.

The Crown Prosecutor submitted that there was no doubt that what went on in this period caused people to fear for their personal safety and you would conclude that any person of reasonable firmness would have felt the same.

The violent acts that were committed in the course of the riot included, in the Crown submission, throwing roof tiles at specific items of property, for example, phone booths, at staff, or at no particular target at all. Pulling bins that were chained to the walls; setting fires. Putting mattresses, pillows, bed sheets, bins, rubbish from bins, soccer posts on to the soccer field and setting them on fire or adding them to the fire, and breaking the window of the office building and setting fire to it. Acts of personal violence, aside from throwing tiles at people, included grabbing people and spraying and throwing fire extinguishers at people.

The Crown Prosecutor submitted to you that this all occurred in the context of detainees yelling, chanting and abusing staff, coming together in groups of 15 or 20 and at times 20 or 30. There was communication between groups who were on the roof and groups who were at the Clarence building or otherwise generally on the ground. The common purpose alleged by the Crown to have been in existence amongst those involved in violence towards people and property was to protest against their detention and to do so in a way that involved acting violently.â

(d)Â Â Â defence submissions


	
	Having completed general directions and directions as to the elements of the offence and dealt with the common elements of the prosecution case, the judge turned to the specific allegations against each accused. He then dealt with the key elements of the applicantâs defence in the following passage (MrÂ Marr being counsel for the applicant), at ppÂ 57(13)-58(4).
	


âMr Marr submitted, on behalf of Mr Parhizkar, that you would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there were 12 or more persons present together who were using unlawful violence for the common purpose.

He suggested that you would find that the persons on the roof who were involved in violent conduct, and there were not 12 of them on roof who did so, were not present together with any of the detainees on the ground. Those on the roof were isolated and separated. He accepted that MrÂ Parhizkar was involved in using or threatening violence but he was not present together with at least 11 others who were doing so.

Mr Marr argued that you only have four people on the roof who are alleged to have been using or threatening unlawful violence, they being Mr Parhizkar, Mr Haidari, Mr Amiri and Mr Abdollahi.

That is not the Crown case, as I understand it, ladies and gentlemen.

The Crown case is that there were more than four on the roof, such as, for example, Mr Mansoor and Mr Darabi. The fact that MrÂ Mansoor has pleaded guilty to affray does not exclude him as a person who may be considered by you as one of 12 are [sic] more.â

(e)Â Â Â redirection


	
	Finally, there was the redirection sought by counsel for the applicant, which appears in the following terms at pÂ 93:
	


âMARR: It's in relation to âpresent togetherâ, â12 or more persons who are present togetherâ, and I'd ask that your Honour say four things that they could take into account, or consider. The first being that they should be in close proximity to each other.

HIS HONOUR: How close?

MARR: Your Honour, that's all I ask for, that they would consider that they be in close proximity to each other.

HIS HONOUR: What does it mean?

MARR: It's derived from Anderson. Anderson refers to the element at common law of what can be termed âmutual assistanceâ, but I don't submit that that common law element is part of the statutory offence, and I understand that it was considered it was unnecessary or didn't add anything to it if they were present together. But if they're not required to - the Crown doesn't have to prove an intent to assist - nonetheless, they would have to be close enough to assist each other by force, if necessary. That proximity, close enough to - because the second matter that I submit should be said to them is that they be within sight and sound of each other. But they wouldn't necessarily have to hear and see everything that the others did, but within sight and sound. And also I submit it would be of assistance to say that they be part of the same group or assembly. And the fourth thing is that they not be separated by any barrier or physical impediments. And finally, if your Honour would say to the jury that it is a question for them to decide whether, in fact, the roof-top protesters were present together with the people on the ground in the Fowler compound. Thatâs my application, your Honour.â


	
	The application for a redirection was refused, primarily on the basis that the particular elements which were required to be covered had been covered: pÂ 109. Although no further reasons were given for the rejection, it may be noted that the tenor of the request was inconsistent with a direction which had already been given with respect to the accused Bejoushin, for whom MrÂ Jankowski appeared. The judge said at pÂ 71(5):
	


âIt seems to me, ladies and gentlemen, to have been suggested that there was a requirement for the other persons using or threatening to use unlawful violence to have been in the immediate presence of the accused at the time the accused is alleged to have used unlawful violence. If that is the impression you got from what MrÂ Jankowski said, I remind you that there is no requirement for such proximity. It very much depends on the circumstances. I spoke earlier today about persons being present together and you will need to take a commonsense approach to that sort of issue.â

âPresent togetherâ â legal context


	
	In considering whether the directions given with respect to the concept of 12 persons being âpresent togetherâ were accurate and sufficient, it is necessary to recognise that much will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case, as revealed in the evidence before the jury. Nevertheless, ordinary English words obtain their meaning from their statutory context, which can only be explained to the jury by the judge: unlike the exercise about to be undertaken, the jury does not, and should not, identify and analyse that context.
	
	
	In order to evaluate the rejection by the judge of the proposed further directions sought by counsel, it is necessary to consider to what extent the statutory language is to be understood by reference to the common law, on which counsel relied. Clearly common law principles do not govern the statutory language because the old common law offences of riot, rout and affray were abolished, by s 93E, now Sch 3 cl 3, when the new provisions of riot and affray were introduced by the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1988 (NSW). Nevertheless, it is necessary in order to assess counselâs request to consider the extent to which the statutory language reflected the common law and the extent to which it introduced new concepts. Ultimately, of course, the statutory language prescribes the relevant elements of the offence.
	
	
	Subject to one major qualification, the statutory provisions were expressly modelled on the equivalent statutory offences in the Public Order Act 1986 (UK): explanatory note to the Crimes (Amendment) Bill 1988, SchÂ 1(2). The major qualification was that the UK provisions contained three graduated offences, the most serious of which was riot (carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment), the second most serious was violent disorder (carrying a maximum term of five years imprisonment) and then affray (having a maximum term of three years): Public Order Act 1986, ssÂ 1, 2 and 3. The intermediate offence of violent disorder is similar to that of riot, except that only three persons need be present together and the offence is committed by each person âusing or threateningâ unlawful violence. This offence was picked up in New South Wales in sÂ 11A of the Summary Offences Act 1988 (NSW), but carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for six months. (While the UK offence carried a greater penalty, it is able to be prosecuted on indictment or summarily, and in the latter case carries a six month penalty.) None of this bears upon the extent to which it is permissible to look to the UK precedent to indicate the purposes underlying the abolition of the common law offences and the extent to which the statutory offences used different language. (The statutory history is helpfully referred to by Johnson J in Colosimo v Director of Public Prosecutions [2005] NSWSC 854; 64 NSWLR 645 at [10]-[30], albeit primarily in relation to affray, not riot.)
	


(a)Â Â Â statutory context


	
	Before considering the historical background provided by the common law, it is appropriate to note aspects of the statutory context in which the present issues arise. Given the way in which the case was left with the jury, it seems unlikely that the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there were 12 persons on the roof of the Macquarie building sharing the common purpose and using or threatening unlawful violence. Indeed, the prosecution appears to have accepted expressly that that was not the case. Accordingly, it was necessary for the jury to find, beyond reasonable doubt, that there were a number of others on the ground who satisfied the criteria for membership of the group. The next question was whether they were âpresent togetherâ with those on the roof. That question is, of course, not one for this Court to decide; rather, the analysis is relevant in order to consider whether the judgeâs directions were sufficient to identify the principles to be applied.
	
	
	Given that the issue was one of spatial proximity, it is important to note that the target of the protest was not present. (The target may be identified as the Department of Immigration and Citizenship responsible for the continuing detention of the detainees; at least those on the roof were demanding the attendance of one or more senior officers from the Department.) The circumstances therefore differed markedly from those considered by R A Hulme J in R v Kisacanin [2012] NSWSC 91. The accused in that case, Zoran Kisacanin, was a member of a motorcycle gang, the Comancheros. He and 11 other members of the gang were involved in a confrontation at the domestic terminal at Sydney Airport with a number of members of a rival Hells Angels gang. The judgment involved the sentencing of the offender and is not presently relevant: the question of the members of the Comancheros being âpresent togetherâ cannot have been a significant issue at the trial in circumstances where they were moving as a group out of the terminal when they saw and immediately confronted their antagonists, towards whom they directed physical violence. The present case was different: the identified purpose was not directed towards the security officers, for example, because of their repressive conduct. Rather, the protest was directed to the absent members of the government department processing visa claims. However, for the purposes of sÂ 93A, to the extent that there was âviolent conduct towards personsâ, that conduct was directed towards the security officers. To the extent that the violence was directed towards property (and there is no doubt that much property was destroyed), it was through the acts of numerous individuals smashing or setting fire to whatever was close at hand.
	
	
	It was possible (as in fact appears to have happened, though only after the security officers had evacuated the Fowler compound) that similar destruction might occur elsewhere in the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre, by detainees separated by security fences from those in the Fowler compound. Had there been another detention centre nearby, violent protests may have erupted there too. Although all may have shared a common purpose, at the high level of generality at which the purpose was defined, the protests in a neighbouring centre would not have been undertaken by persons who were âpresent togetherâ with those at Villawood. That would seem analogous to the distinction drawn by the trial judge between a disruption in a football stadium and one occurring at the local railway station after the match.
	
	
	That, however, was not the issue for the jury. Nor does it appear to have been in issue that persons in a compound on the other side of a security fence would not have been present together with the protestors in the Fowler compound. The question was whether the persons in the Fowler compound, but separated by the height of the building and, apparently, a climbable fence from those on the roof, were âpresent togetherâ with the persons on the roof.
	
	
	The element of spatial proximity is also reflected in the element concerning the effect of the conduct on a person of reasonable firmness, as it refers to such a person âpresent at the sceneâ. In this context, âthe sceneâ may be taken to be the place where the violent conduct was being used or threatened. The spatial extent of the scene will depend upon the nature of the violence. The evidence did not suggest any actual or threatened breach of the security perimeter of the Fowler compound. Accordingly it may be inferred that the person of reasonable firmness had to be present within the compound.
	
	
	Further, apart from the persons who grabbed fire extinguishers, the only weapons were missiles in the form of tiles taken from the roof of the Macquarie Building. Anyone within range of a thrown tile would have feared for their personal safety. The critical question was whether the persons with fire extinguishers constituted a sufficient threat to the personal safety of persons on the ground. There is no doubt that, as the prosecution suggested, it was open to the jury to find that such activities would have put a person in fear. If so satisfied, the next question for the jury was whether those acting violently on the ground were present together with those on the roof.
	
	
	The prosecution case was said to rely on there being communication between the group on the roof and the persons on the ground. That communication was relied upon to establish a common purpose.
	
	
	It was not disputed that such circumstances might satisfy the statutory test of being present together; however, as the request for further directions suggested, the jury might have been given more specific directions in that regard. It was not sufficient that there were more than 12 persons threatening or using violence, and with a common purpose; it was necessary that they be undertaking those activities whilst âpresent togetherâ.
	
	
	The judgeâs direction that the people were to be âin the same place as each otherâ was not open to challenge. His further comment that it could be âa small place or it could be a large placeâ did not take the matter much further. However, the illustration is troubling. It had two elements: first, it said that it would be open to a jury to conclude that all those within the football stadium were present together, âeven though they might well have been located in different grandstands.â The point of distinction was with those being violent at the tube station a kilometre away from the stadium. No doubt these were entirely separate places and the inference that persons at each were not âpresent togetherâ was possibly so clear as to be unhelpful. The other suggestion, however, was that all those in the stadium were âpresent togetherâ. Of course, saying that in such a situation it would be âopenâ to a jury to hold that they were all âpresent togetherâ would indicate to a lawyer that it would all depend upon the circumstances, which had not been fully fleshed out. For example, absent some premeditated plan, it is by no means clear why groups of fans of a losing football team would start attacking fans of the winning team in different parts of a stadium with a âcommon purposeâ. If the grandstands were separated from each other by security barriers, would it be appropriate to ignore that fact? In short, the illustration reduced the concept of a common purpose to something possibly trivial; it also suggested that physical distance or barriers may be irrelevant. Finally, it allowed an inference that the hypothetical person of reasonable firmness might fear for his or her safety wherever he or she might be in the stadium, whether in the immediate proximity of brawlers or a reasonable distance away. That would not be consistent with the statutory language.
	


(b)Â Â Â common law principles


	
	Counsel sought to derive assistance for his proposed further directions from the judgment of McHugh JA (with whom Kirby P and Samuels JA relevantly agreed, the former with additional reasons of his own) in Anderson v Attorney General for New South Wales (1987) 10 NSWLR 198. Both Kirby P (at 203) and McHugh JA at (209C) accepted that an essential element of the common law offence of riot was that there be a number of persons âassembling together of their Authority, with an Intent mutually to assist one another, against any who shall oppose themâ, a statement taken from W Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown (1st ed, 1716, Book 1, atÂ 155). McHugh JA also extracted the following definition from Halsburyâs Laws of England (4th ed, 1976), Vol 11, atÂ 506-7, par 861:
	


âA riot is a tumultuous disturbance of the peace by three or more persons assembled together with an intent mutually to assist one another by force if necessary against anyone who opposes them in the execution of a common purpose and who execute or begin to execute that purpose in a violent manner so as to alarm at least one person of reasonable firmness and courage. Such an assembly becomes riotous at the latest when alarming force or violence begins to be used.â


	
	McHugh JA was doubtful that there must be an actual person who was alarmed, preferring the view (in conformity with the current legislation) that âthe violence must be such that a hypothetical bystander of reasonable firmness and courage would be put in fear by the displayâ: at 115. McHugh JA further noted doubts which had been expressed by one commentator as to whether it was necessary to prove a separate element of intention to help one another, in addition to the element of execution of a common purpose. McHugh JA thought it inappropriate to omit such an element but said that while none can be guilty âunless each of them had the intent to help each other, by force if necessary, against any person who might oppose them in the execution of their common purposeâ, that merely meant that âall accused must have been present togetherâ: at 211F. (That language also conformed to the current statute.)
	
	
	The riot in question in that case was alleged to have occurred at Bathurst in 1985. (The matter came before the Court of Appeal at an interlocutory stage.) McHugh JA was of the view that if any of the persons charged had been placed in custody at a point in time, his participation in any riotous assembly would have come to an end: at 212B.
	
	
	It may be seen that the concept of being âpresent togetherâ was, at least on the view accepted by this Court in Anderson, part of the common law. Persons would not be present together if they were separated by a physical barrier. What might constitute a sufficient barrier would be a question of fact in each case. However, the mere fact that people could communicate with each other might allow the establishment of a common purpose, but would not render such persons present together in all circumstances.
	
	
	The report of the Law Commission (UK), which led to the adoption of the Public Order Act 1986 in language adopted in this State, revealed limited intentions with respect to variation of the common law offence. Some changes were significant but presently inconsequential, including the need for â12 or more personsâ and the penalty, no longer being life imprisonment as under the common law.
	
	
	The standard English text, Thornton et al, The Law of Public Order and Protest (2010, Oxford UP), discusses the term âpresent togetherâ by reference to common law cases of Woodrow (1959) 43 Cr App R 105 and Jones (1974) 59 Cr App R 120: at [1.23]. Another early text, ATH Smith, Offences against Public Order â including the Public Order Act 1986 (1987, Sweet & Maxwell), referred to the pre-Act decision in Summers (1972) 56 Cr App R 604 for the proposition that a group of three men who went to the victimsâ house, two of whom entered and attacked the victims, whilst the third remained in the car, did not involve three persons present together: at [3-04]; see also [4-08].
	
	
	These considerations lead one to doubt whether (1) the football stadium analogy was apposite or, rather, misleading, (2) the judge was correct to refuse a direction that members of the group of 12 not be separated by any barriers or physical impediments, (3) it was correct not to direct the jury that the various persons using or threatening violence should have been âin the immediate presence of the accused at the time the accused is alleged to have used unlawful violenceâ and (4) there was not a specific question to be determined, namely that the rooftop protestors were present together with the people on the ground in the Fowler compound, which was not expressly identified. That is not to say that the directions given were, in their terms, wrong, but rather that, without some further directions, the jury may have not focused on, or indeed may have been distracted from, a legitimate aspect of the defence case. Although it might have been open to the jury to be satisfied that those on the roof and those elsewhere in the compound were present together, that needed to be identified as an issue. Further, an appropriate direction might have resulted in some area less than the whole compound being treated as âthe sceneâ at which the hypothetical person of reasonable firmness was to be present.
	
	
	The Director referred to the direction sought that the 12 or more persons should be in close enough proximity to each other to assist each other by force if necessary. The submissions noted the reliance by the applicant on the following passage in the report of the UK Law Commission, at par 6.29:
	


âAlthough the element of common purpose has been retained, unlike the common law the new offence of riot does not contain the element of âan intention to help one another by force if necessary against any person who may oppose them in the execution of their common purposeâ. We think this adds nothing essential to the proper delimitation of the offence; its exclusion in our Working Paper proposals was approved by virtually all our commentators.â


	
	The Director submitted that the applicantâs reliance on that passage was âmisplacedâ, but why that was so was not entirely clear. Like McHugh JA in Anderson, the Law Commission appears to have treated the element of being present together as indicative of the need for a degree of joint action, or at least the capacity for joint action, together with actual use of force by the accused. However, the Directorâs submissions (at par 18) made much of the proposition that the evidence demonstrated that:
	


âthe appellant was close enough to assist with force, if necessary â and that he did. â¦ The evidence in this case was that the rioters were in different parts of the compound. Their proximity to each of the others was different.â


	
	Later the submission stated:
	


âThere was clear evidence that: the appellant was close enough to assist with force (and that he did so); that the rioters could see and hear each other; that they were in a group and assembled together and that the roof was not a physical barrier between the rioters. Indeed, it became a position of advantage for some of the violence that ensued.â


	
	These submissions raised legitimate points, but they were points for consideration by the jury. The troubling features of the directions given (and not given) were that the jury may have inferred that there was no real issue to be addressed.
	


(c)Â Â Â conclusions as to ground 1


	
	There are three elements of the offence of riot which must be addressed coherently and harmoniously in any directions given to a jury. They are that the offenders (a) be present together, (b) have a common purpose and (c) act in such a way as would cause fear in a person of reasonable firmness at the scene. Each element complements the other. Pursuit of a common purpose adds to the requirement of physical proximity a degree of understanding between those participating (or taking part) in the violence or threatened conduct. The offenders are to be present together, acting for a common purpose; their conduct sets the âsceneâ at which the hypothetical bystander is present and in fear. Such fear is the consequence of unlawful violence which includes violent conduct âtowardsâ persons and throwing a missile âat or towardsâ a person where the missile is of a kind capable of causing injury: sÂ 93A.
	
	
	Of course, a fracas at a railway station a kilometre away from a stadium fails to satisfy these elements. But the analogy is not only a distraction, it is positively misleading. Violence erupting in different parts of a football stadium may well not satisfy these elements. The implication that it may (or even will), without explaining why it may well not, obscured the proper consideration of the elements of the offence. Thus, the direction set out at [19] above is likely to have misled the jury. That consequence is likely to have been reinforced by the directions set out at [24], rejecting the proposition that those using unlawful violence should be âin the immediate presence of the accused at the time the accused is alleged to have used unlawful violence.â The rejection of the temporal element was consistent with sÂ 93B(2). However, the direction could reasonably be understood (and may well have been intended) to be a rejection of the element of physical proximity. That conclusion flows from the refusal to direct that the 12 or more persons who are present together should be âin close proximity to each otherâ: at [23] above.
	
	
	For these reasons, the challenge to the jury directions based on ground 1 should be upheld. The nature of an appropriate direction will be considered further below.
	


Presence of those found not guilty of riot


	
	The second aspect of the applicantâs complaint with respect to the directions to the jury asserted that persons found not guilty of riot could not be amongst the 12 persons who were present together for the common purpose.
	
	
	This ground should not be accepted. First, the underlying proposition was unsound. As has been pointed out by Thornton et al, where 12 persons are together, of whom 11 threaten unlawful violence and only one uses unlawful violence, only one will be guilty of the offence. Thus two persons who were acquitted of the offence, possibly because they did not use unlawful violence, could still be guilty of threatening unlawful violence. That conclusion would not be inconsistent with their pleas of guilty to affray, an offence which may be satisfied where a person uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another.
	
	
	Secondly, the prosecution was entitled to rely upon those two persons as being guilty of threatening or using violence for a common purpose when prosecuting the applicant, even though they have been acquitted of the charges brought against them individually involving that element. This was not a case requiring consideration of the principle in Likiardopoulos v The Queen [2012] HCA 37; 247 CLR 265 at [30]: if the presence of those guilty only of affray were to be included within the 12 persons present together, there would not be inconsistent verdicts.
	
	
	It might have been said that, with respect to those convicted of affray, it was necessary for the judge to give some further direction to the effect that the jury must be satisfied of an additional element, namely that they used or threatened unlawful violence for a common purpose with other members of the group. A further direction in those terms was not sought and, in the circumstances, that was understandable, the jury having received more than adequate instruction as to the difference between affray and riot. Further, the jury was directed that those who had pleaded guilty to affray might be part of the group of 12 or more persons alleged to be using or threatening unlawful violence âfor the common purposeâ: Summing up, pÂ 43(22).
	
	
	The purpose of ground 3, alleging that the pleas were admissible evidence, was obscure. The jury were aware of the pleas and were directed as to how they might deal with them. It should be rejected.
	


Other grounds


	
	Ground 4, concerning the cross-examination of the witness Orlando Papa about viewing a video of the disturbance on YouTube and discussing the nature of the disturbance with others, related to a matter of no consequence. MrÂ Papaâs evidence concerned the presence of the applicant on the roof and his conduct. None of that was in dispute. Why the ground was pressed is a mystery.
	
	
	Ground 5 alleged error in failing to discharge the jury following the publication, during the summing up, of an article in the Sun Herald headed âThree jailed over riot at Villawoodâ. Most of the article was concerned with the circumstances of three men sentenced for their part in the disturbance, not being co-offenders with the applicant. The complaint of prejudice was twofold. First, they were said to have been sentenced âfor their part in a fire and riotâ at the detention centre and, secondly, the fire and riot were said to have caused $9 million of damage. The article was apparently published in the Sun Herald on Sunday, 7Â April 2013. The summing up commenced on Monday, 8 April, but no application was made until Thursday, 11Â April, although that was the second day of the summing up, there having been an adjournment in between.
	
	
	The judge rejected the application on the basis that he had already directed the jury with respect to witnesses who used the term âriotâ in a colloquial sense and not a legally technically correct sense: Summing up, pÂ 58(5). He had also given a standard direction that the jury were to reach their verdicts based on the evidence before them and not on speculation or matters they had read in the media: Summing up, ppÂ 6(20)-7(10). There being no reason to suppose that the jury would disregard such clear and repeated directions, he dismissed the application, summarily. He was correct to do so. No further direction was sought. Ground 5 must be rejected.
	
	
	Ground 6 alleged that the judge erred in telling the jury that they were ânot entitled to the transcript of counselsâ addresses or his summing up.â This ground was based upon an exchange in the course of the hearing, after the judge had delivered a short interlocutory judgment. The jury sent a note seeking a copy of the judgeâs reasons, which was refused: Tcpt, pÂ 1600. Having explained that the jury would receive a far more detailed analysis of the evidence and issues in due course, the judge added:
	


âJust as a note of caution. You have been receiving the transcript of the evidence just to alert you to the fact that when counsel commence their closing addresses, from that point on the flow of the transcript to you will cease. I can only give you a transcript of evidence. The legislation speaks specifically of that and not of addresses and my summing up to you. So if you want to take a note of things that counsel say to you or I say to you, take a note, because you wonât be getting the transcript.â


	
	The reference to âlegislationâ was a reference to the Jury Act 1977 (NSW), sÂ 55C, which the judge accurately explained. However, there is authority for the proposition that the judge had power to provide transcripts of the addresses and summing up, as a matter falling within the inherent powers of the trial court: R v Taousanis [1999] NSWSC 107; 146 A Crim R 303 (Sperling J, dealing with the transcript of an opening), applied with respect to closing addresses by this Court in R v Bartle [2003] NSWCCA 329; 181 FLR 1 at [661]-[662] (Smart AJ; Mason P and Barr J agreeing at [283]); Regina v Sukkar [2005] NSWCCA 54 at [82]-[84] (Wood CJ at CL, Hidden J and Smart AJ agreeing, at [155] and [207] respectively) (a case in which the power of the trial judge to replay a recording of the summing up was accepted).
	
	
	The jury did not ask for a transcript of addresses or the summing up, no doubt, it was submitted, because they had been told in advance that they would not have them. In the course of addresses, counsel for the applicant, MrÂ Marr, raised the issue with the judge at Tcpt, pÂ 1946(25):
	


âMARR: Thereâs a line of authority that says that generally, although [itâs] discretionary, if a jury were to request transcript of addresses of counsel, that they should be provided with them.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. I understand that. Thereâs also authority for the proposition that the summing up can be provided in transcript form. No one has asked for it. Iâm not going to provide it unless they do. Iâm not going to consider providing it unless they do.â


	
	Counsel then sought to refer to the earlier statement in the transcript, but was cut off, as the judge wished to move on to matters which needed to be addressed at that time. Later in the day the judge invited counsel to deal further with the issue he had sought to raise: Tcpt, p 1988(26). Although the judge expressly noted that he had raised âan error that should be correctedâ, counsel merely sought that the jury be informed that they could request transcripts of the addresses and summing up and that consideration would be given to such a request: Tcpt, pÂ 1988(35). The exchange which followed indicated that the judge was reluctant to give such a direction in a matter involving multiple parties, particularly where the request might be for the prosecution closing address, or for every address. The direction was not given.
	
	
	There was no doubt that the judge was fully aware of the existence of a discretionary power. He did not wish to encourage the jury to make a request which would probably be refused. At that stage, there was no real likelihood of a large delay between counsel addressing the jury and the jury retiring. Although in fact there was a two day adjournment, the suggested direction was not sought thereafter and it was not submitted in this Court that such a delay was significant.
	
	
	There was no obligation for the judge to give the information that the jury could request transcripts of addresses and the summing up. The direction in fact given was accompanied by an indication that there would be more frequent breaks during the addresses as listening to a single person speaking required greater concentration than listening to the exchanges when evidence was being given. The suggestion that the jury take notes was no doubt designed to encourage attention to what was said. Advising that they could have access to transcripts would have undermined that message. The circumstances of the present case were quite different from those in Bartle: there was no basis to suggest that the judge would have been wrong to refuse a request had it been made in the present case. It should not be accepted that the jury, if advised as to the courtâs powers, would have requested any transcript: they did not ask any question which inspired counsel to suggest it should be offered. It follows that there can have been no miscarriage of justice in declining to tell the jury that they could make such requests. Ground 6 must be rejected.
	


Conclusions â conviction appeal


	
	The directions as to the elements of the charge of riot raise significant points and warrant a grant of leave to appeal. The next question is whether the directions given and the failure to give at least part of the directions sought deprived the applicant of an opportunity of acquittal which was fairly open to him and therefore constituted a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	In order to deal with the legitimate issues raised by the defence, the jury should have been told that, if they were not satisfied that there were 12 people threatening or using violence who were present together on the roof, but that there were others on the ground, they needed to consider whether those on the ground were in sufficiently close proximity to those on the roof to be in a position to offer physical support in the event of opposition to the protest. Viewed from the position of the applicant, the violent conduct involved in throwing tiles was capable of assisting those on the ground in the immediate proximity to the Macquarie building, but arguably not those further afield. On the other hand, from the position of those on the ground, there was no clear evidence of them being in a position to assist those on the roof, except by climbing up and joining them, which most did not seek to do. Further, they should have been directed, as the prosecutor accepted, there was much shouting and abuse which did not rise to the level of threatening violence; nor did those on the ground who merely threw up bedding or bottles of water to those on the roof, by that conduct, use or threaten unlawful violence.
	
	
	In my view the summing up, otherwise meticulous, did not adequately identify the issues raised by the accused with respect to an essential element of the prosecution case which was in dispute at the trial. Although it is quite possible that, had the issue been squarely addressed, the jury would have come to the same conclusion, it was also open to them on the evidence to have a reasonable doubt with respect to this aspect of the prosecution case. The verdict with respect to the charge of riot must be quashed.
	


Sentence


	
	In the event that the challenge to the verdict failed, the applicant also sought leave to challenge the sentence imposed for the offence of riot. He did so on a limited basis. The applicant was at all stages in detention. However, whilst awaiting trial, he was held for a period in custody in a prison, being a more restrictive form of detention. That pre-trial custody, of one year and 22 days, was taken into account by backdating the sentence: R v Ali; R v Parhizkar [2013] NSWSC 871 at [107]. The judge continued in his judgment on sentence at [108]:
	


âI have also taken into account in favour of each offender, although in an unquantifiable sense, that it is likely that the length of time they have been kept in immigration detention has been exacerbated by the fact that there have been pending criminal proceedings against them.â


	
	The short point on the sentence appeal is that the period from when he was released back into immigration detention (having been held in gaol before being granted bail), until the time of the trial was âlikely referable to the criminal chargesâ. This was a period of some 13 months from May 2012 until June 2013. During that period, he was held in âthe maximum security section at Villawood, Blaxland, which is little different to a gaol.â The submission was that the applicant should have had a quantified allowance with respect to that period of custody, which was not merely an extension of the period of immigration detention, but an extension in circumstances of increased restraint.
	
	
	While the point was made by way of submissions in this Court, it was not expressly relied upon before the sentencing judge. Nor does it appear that evidence of the circumstances of the period in immigration detention was presented to him. In those circumstances, it cannot be said that the judge erred in the approach he took. The appropriate course, given that the verdict should in any event be set aside, is to refuse the application for leave to appeal against sentence.
	


Orders


	
	The Court should make the following orders:
	


(1)Â Â Â Grant the applicant leave to appeal against his conviction for the offence of riot.

(2)Â Â Â Allow the appeal and set aside the conviction.

(3)Â Â Â Refuse leave to appeal against the sentence on the conviction for riot.


	
	As the applicant has served the non-parole period imposed upon him for the offence of riot and as he has pleaded guilty to the offence of affray, for which he has not been convicted and sentenced, it will be a matter for the Director as to whether he is put on trial again with respect to the more serious offence. The alternative course would be to remit the matter for sentence on the offence of affray. No further orders should be made by this Court in those circumstances.
	
	
	PRICE J: I have had the considerable benefit of reading Basten JAâs judgment in draft. The facts of the present case are comprehensively stated in his Honourâs judgment.
	
	
	I agree that Grounds 2 to 7 of the applicantâs appeal against conviction should be dismissed but I do not agree with Basten JAâs conclusion that Ground 1 should be upheld.
	
	
	The question is whether the trial Judge erred in his directions on the element of the offence of riot as to whether there were 12 or more persons âpresent togetherâ, using or threatening to use unlawful violence, for a common purpose.
	
	
	There was ample evidence from which the jury could conclude that after 8pm, the applicant was one of 10 detainees on the roof of the Macquarie Building and was one of the most active tile throwers. Evidence had been given by a Serco Officer that the applicant had thrown at least 30 tiles. However, as it was accepted that not all of the persons who had been on the roof during the protest (there had been 13 identified) had used unlawful violence, it was necessary for the jury to decide whether there were others on the ground who used or threatened violence for the same purpose as the applicant and others on the roof and if so, whether they were âpresent togetherâ with those persons on the roof.
	
	
	Evidence before the jury disclosed that the detainees on the ground within the Fowler compound provided support for those on the roof and engaged in acts of unlawful violence for the purpose that they shared in common with those on the roof of protesting their detention. Those on the roof provided encouragement for those on the ground by yelling encouragement and throwing roof tiles.
	
	
	Some time after 7.15pm, security staff had formed a cordon to prevent detainees approaching an internal fence from which they could climb onto the roof. The critical question for the jury to decide was whether the detainees in the Fowler compound were âpresent togetherâ with the detainees on the roof. The detainees were separated by the height of the building and the internal fence. This was a matter of fact for the jurors to decide. As Basten JA points out in [28] above, the question for this Court is âwhether the judgeâs directions were sufficient to identify the principles to be applied.â
	
	
	I do not propose to repeat the trial Judgeâs directions about the phrase âpresent togetherâ which are fully set out in [19], [20] and [22] above. It appears to be Basten JAâs view that the trial Judgeâs directions were not âin their terms wrong, but rather that, without some further directions, the jury may not have focused on, or indeed may have been distracted from, a legitimate aspect of the defence case.â Basten JA considers that the element of âpresent togetherâ needed to be identified as an issue by the trial Judge (see [43] above).
	
	
	Basten JA expresses the opinion in [66] above that âthe jury should have been told that, if they were not satisfied that there were 12 people threatening or using violence who were present together on the roof, but that there were others on the ground, they needed to consider whether those on the ground were in sufficiently close proximity to those on the roof to be in a position to offer physical support in the event of opposition to the protest.â Another direction that his Honour considers should have been made is that âthere was much shouting and abuse which did not rise to the level of threatening violence, nor did those on the ground who merely threw up bedding or bottles of water to those on the roof, by that conduct, use or threaten unlawful violenceâ (see [66] above).
	
	
	These additional directions find their origin in the applicantâs counselâs request during the trial Judgeâs summing up that in relation to the phrase âpresent togetherâ his Honour should say to the jury:
	


(i)Â Â Â that they [the 12 or more persons] should be in close proximity to each other, close enough to assist each other by force if necessary;

(ii)Â Â Â that they were in sight and sound of each other (but not necessarily hear or see everything the other did);

(iii)Â Â Â that they had to be part of the same group or assembly; and

(iv)Â Â Â that they are not separated by any physical barriers.


	
	The applicantâs counsel told the trial Judge that the directions sought were derived from Anderson.
	
	
	The trial Judge rejected the applicantâs request on the basis that âthe substance of the matters raisedâ¦has either already been covered by what I have said or is not necessary to be part of the directionâ (SU 109).
	
	
	In my respectful opinion, the trial Judgeâs directions made it plain to the members of the jury that the element of âpresent togetherâ was an issue. He reminded the jury of the argument advanced by counsel for the applicant that they âwould find that the persons on the roof who were involved in violent conduct, and there were not 12 of them on the roof who did so, were not present together with any of the detainees on the ground. Those on the roof were isolated and separated.â (SU 57 16-19).
	
	
	In the written directions provided to the jury, which his Honour went through orally, the trial Judge emphasised that an essential element of the offence that the Crown was obliged to prove beyond reasonable doubt was the presence together of 12 or more persons. His Honour dealt separately with the phrase âpresent togetherâ by directing the jury that the words were to be given their ordinary meaning, that there was no requirement for persons to be within a certain distance of one another and the concept was really directed to people being in the same place as each other. His Honour suggested that they take a practical approach to the problem and it was a matter for them to decide.
	
	
	Anderson concerned the common law offence of riot. McHugh JA (with whom Kirby P and Samuels JA relevantly agreed) said at 114-115:
	


âAccordingly, the authorities strongly support the proposition that it is an essential element in the offence of riot that each of the participants had the intention to help each other, by force if necessary, against any person who might oppose them in the execution of their common purpose. It necessarily follows that, if a number of persons are charged with the one offence of riot, they must have each had both a common purpose and an intention to help each other, by force if necessary, against any person who might oppose them in the execution of that common purpose.â


	
	The statutory offence of riot under s 93B Crimes Act does not include as an essential element of the offence âan intention to help each other, by force if necessary against any person who might oppose them in the execution of that common purpose.â Although counsel for the applicant recognised that âmutual assistanceâ was not part of the statutory offence, the directions he sought as to âproximityâ appear to be founded upon an essential element of the common law offence that does not apply to the statutory offence. In my view, in establishing an offence under s 93B, the Crown is not obliged to prove beyond reasonable doubt that âthe 12 or more persons were in close proximity to each other, close enough to assist each other by force if necessary.â Nor is the Crown required to establish any of the other three matters that the applicant sought further directions upon.
	
	
	In my respectful opinion, Anderson is not authority for the general proposition that persons would not be present together if any physical barrier separated them. Anderson concerned the riot at Bathurst in 1985. It is a matter of common sense that when an accused person was placed in custody, his participation in that riotous assembly came to an end. The facts in Anderson are very different to the present case where there were detainees on the roof and on the ground.
	
	
	The directions on the phrase âpresent togetherâ given by the trial Judge find support in Regina v W(N) [2010] 1 WLR 1426, a judgment of the English Court of Appeal. When considering the phrase âpresent togetherâ in s 2 of the Public Order Act 1986, the Court (Lord Justice Moore-Bick, Mr Justice Silber and Mr Justice Kenneth Parker) said at [23]:
	


âIn our view it is intended to denote nothing more than being present in the same place. It is unnecessary in this case to attempt to define it with any greater precision, since it was undoubtedly open to the jury on the evidence before them to find that there was a time when the appellant and at least two members of the crowd were in the same place using or threatening violence. In any event, however, we think that it would be undesirable to attempt to do so. The phrase consists of ordinary words which must be given their ordinary meaning. If a question arises whether the defendant and others who are said to have used or threatened violence were present together (which we think is unlikely to arise in many cases) the jury should be told that the question is one of fact and that they should give the words their ordinary meaning: see Brutus v Cozens [1973] A.C 854.â


	
	Although the facts in NW were more straightforward than in the present case, it appears to me that the phrase âpresent togetherâ in s 93B was intended to have its ordinary meaning. There is nothing to suggest that these words are intended to be used in any unusual sense. In my respectful opinion, the trial Judgeâs directions adequately identified the principles to be applied.
	
	
	Basten JA finds at [36] above that the example provided by the trial Judge to the members of the jury to be troubling. I do not find it to be so. In my opinion the members of the jury, by using their common sense, could readily envisage situations where groups of fans of a losing team would start attacking fans of the winning team in different parts of a stadium with a âcommon purposeâ.
	
	
	I conclude that ground 1 of the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	For the reasons given by Basten JA, I agree that the trial Judge did not err in the approach that he took to the applicantâs sentence. I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but would dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	Accordingly, the orders that I propose are as follows:
	


(a)Â Â Â Leave granted to the applicant to appeal against his conviction for the offence of riot;

(b)Â Â Â The appeal is dismissed;

(c)Â Â Â Leave granted to the applicant to appeal against the sentence on the conviction for riot;

(d)Â Â Â The appeal is dismissed.


	
	McCALLUM J: I have had the benefit of reading the judgments of Basten JA and Price J in draft. I agree that grounds 2 to 7 of the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.
	
	
	After some equivocation, I have concluded that ground 1 should also be dismissed. Subject to one qualification, I agree with the reasons stated by Price J on that issue. The qualification is that I would respectfully not embrace the details of the example given by the learned trial judge of a riot at an English Premier League soccer match, particularly the inclusion of the statement that it would be open to a jury to conclude that persons behaving violently in different grandstands were âpresent togetherâ. There is much force in Basten JAâs analysis of the difficulty with that example, in my respectful opinion.
	
	
	Notwithstanding that reservation, however, I have concluded that the use of that example did not spoil the clarity of his Honourâs directions so as to produce a miscarriage of justice. I agree with Price J that those directions adequately identified the principles to be applied. I do not think they were required to be expanded upon in the manner proposed by Basten JA. Accordingly, I agree with Price J that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.
	
	
	I agree with Basten JA and Price J that the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.

		13 October 2015",2014-10-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765176,R v Rice & ors (No 5) [2014] NSWSC 1526,"Judgment (EX TEMPORE - REVISED) 
1The Crown has indicated that he is about to close the Crown case. Yesterday afternoon, in the course of another argument, Mr Pickin, who appears for the accused Vukovic, informed me that he would make an application at the close of the Crown case for a verdict by direction on behalf of his client. That application has now been made and will be determined on the basis that the Crown is about to close his case.

2For the purposes of determining the application it is necessary for me to refer briefly to the nature of the Crown case and some of the evidence called in support of it. 

3The Crown case, is that the four accused conspired to murder Dusan Krstic (""Krstic""). That conspiracy is said to have evolved partly in the following way. The accused Popovic approached Justin Irwin (""Irwin"") and put a proposal to him that Krstic be killed. Irwin was promised $250,000.00 in return and, in the event that he was apprehended as a consequence of carrying out the request, he was promised a sum of $150,000 for each year that he spent in custody as a result.

4Irwin gave evidence that he then contacted the co-accused, Koloamatangi, and put the proposal to him. Irwin also said that in the course of his discussions with the accused Popovic he was informed by Popovic that he (Irwin) would be introduced to another person. On the Crown case that other person is the accused Vukovic. The accused Rice is said to have joined the conspiracy as a consequence of his association with Koloamatangi.

5On the Crown case Irwin and the accused Vukovic did meet. Irwin gave evidence that a person called ""Rashko"" (who on the Crown case is the accused Vukovic) drove with him to a number of places, including to Western Sydney where Kristic was said to be residing at the time. It is also part of the Crown case that the accused Vukovic provided a pistol to Irwin which was to be used in the murder. 

6Irwin has given lengthy evidence for the Crown. No identification evidence was led in his examination in chief, although in re-examination the Crown elicited the following: 

"" ... male and in his 40s. He is Serbian or Yugoslavian. He is between five and six feet tall. He has a medium build and short grey hair. He speaks with a strong accent. He lived near Kiama. I don't think I ever rang Rasko. I did the gyprocking at Pop's mum's house at some time later. He did the plastering and I was his labourer.""

7Part of the evidence of Irwin was that he was driven to relevant locations by Rasco in a particular vehicle. He was asked (T286 L28 and following):

""Q. Did he have a vehicle?
A. Yeah, a red four-wheel drive.

Q. What sort of four-wheel drive, do you recall?
A. I think it was a RAV 4 or - a small medium type four-wheel drive.

Q. And it was red coloured, did you say?
A. Yes.""

8The Crown tendered, without objection, a document which is now exhibit K2, which establishes that a red Toyota RAV 4 was registered to Nada Vukovic, the accused's wife. The address nominated on exhibit K2 is the same address as that of the accused. 

9In addition, Irwin gave evidence that he had previously worked with Rashko doing gyprocking work at the home of the mother of the accused Popovic. There is uncontested evidence that Vukovic has previously worked as a gyprocker.

10Mr Pickin has submitted that there is no evidence upon which a jury could conclude that the accused Vukovic is Rashko. He pointed out that there is no direct evidence of identification and that there is no evidence of any association between the accused Popovic and his client. 

11In the course of argument Mr Pickin's attention was directed in particular, to:

(i)the evidence of Irwin about the vehicle driven by Rashko;

(ii)the evidence contained in Exhibit K2;

(iii)the evidence of Vukovic's address, and the consistency between that address and that which appears on exhibit K2;

(iv)the evidence given by Irwin as to the gyprocking work he undertook with Rashko; and

(v)the evidence that the accused Vukovic was, at one stage, a gyprocker. 

12Mr Pickin submitted that those factors, be they taken alone or in combination, did not sustain an inference that his client was the person Rashko. He submitted that to so conclude would involve impermissible speculation. 

13The Crown submitted that the evidence was sufficient to sustain an inference that Rashko and the accused Vukovic were one and the same person. The Crown relied upon a number of circumstances in support of his argument. 

14He submitted firstly that on the evidence of Irwin the person Rashko had been introduced to him by Mr Popovic. He pointed to the fact that Irwin had said that he had been driven by Rashko in a red RAV 4. He pointed to the contents of exhibit K2 which established that a red RAV 4 was registered to the wife of Vukovic at the same address. The Crown also relied upon Irwin's evidence as to undertaking gyprocking work with Rashko. He submitted that this was consistent with undisputed evidence that Rashko was a gyprocker or plasterer. 

15The Crown argued strongly against the proposition that this evidence was weak and emphasised that that the circumstances upon which reliance was placed necessarily had to be looked at as a whole. It was submitted that when that approach was taken there was a sufficient basis upon which it would be open to the jury to draw the inference that Rashko was indeed the accused Vukovic. 

16It is open to me to direct a verdict of not guilty only if I come to the view that there is a defect in the evidence such that, when taken at its highest, the evidence will not support a verdict of guilty. In Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207 the High Court stated the principle in this way (at 214):

""It follows that if there is evidence, even if tenuous, or inherently weak or vague, which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations, and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision, or to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.""

17It will be evident from the manner in which the Crown has approached this issue, and his articulation of particular matter upon which he relies, that the Crown case that Rashko is the accused Vukovic is a largely circumstantial one. Even if competing hypotheses or inferences are available to be drawn from the evidence relied upon, that does not mean that I should direct a verdict of not guilty. It is not open to me to direct a verdict of not guilty on the basis that inferences other than those advanced by the Crown might be open: see The Queen v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39. In Saffron v The Director of Public Prosecutions; Allen v The Director of Public Prosecutions (1989) 16 NSWLR 397, Gleeson CJ put the matter in this way (at 401 (citation omitted)):

""It is a corollary of the fundamental principle that the prosecution carries the onus of proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. That a jury cannot convict on the basis of circumstantial evidence unless no other explanation than guilt is reasonably compatible with the circumstances...It does not follow, however, that simply because it is possible looking at the objective circumstances established by the evidence in a case to construct a hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused that the case is not one which is fit to go to a jury. That entirely overlooks the role of a jury in a criminal trial.""

18In making those observations, his Honour referred to such matters having been emphasised in Attorney General's Reference Number 1 of 1983 (1983) 2 VR 410 at 415-416. 

19It follows that if the evidence which is adduced by the Crown is capable of proving that the accused is Rashko, then the case should be left to the jury for its determination. In determining whether this is so, it is important to bear in mind that the evidence must be considered as a whole and not in a piecemeal fashion: The Queen v Hillier (2007) 228 CLR 618. 

20Applying those principles to the present case, I am satisfied that the evidence is capable of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt that Rashko is the accused Vukovic. I have had regard, in reaching that view, to the evidence of Irwin that Rashko drove a red RAV 4 vehicle. This is consistent with the contents of Exhibit K2, which shows a car fitting that description registered to the wife of the accused Vukovic at the same address. I have also had regard to Irwin's references to having done gyprocking work with Rashko at the home of the mother of the co-accused Popovic. This is consistent with uncontested evidence that the accused was in fact a gyprocker at the relevant time. 

21Even if a view were reached that such evidence is not particlarly strong, the decision in Doney makes it clear that even if the evidence is weak or vague, providing it is capable of satisfying a jury beyond reasonable doubt of the offence alleged, then the matter should be left to the jury. 

22For these reasons, the application for a verdict by direction is rejected.

		10 November 2014",2014-10-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765178,R v Rice & ors (No 4) [2014] NSWSC 1525,"Judgment (EX TEMPORE - REVISED) 
1Towards the close of its case the Crown indicated an intention to adduce evidence of the three telephone calls in its case against the accused Vukovic. The details of those calls are contained in Exhibits VD3 and VD4. However, those documents do not replicate the actual form in which the evidence is to be led, but are a prÃ©cis or synopsis of the evidence. 

2The first telephone call occurred on 14 October 2008 and was made by the accused Vukovic to the accused Popovic. The synopsis of the call is as follows:

""Msg left saying that man from IV Plaster? that they will be ready on Thursday. Rashko asking Zlatan if he can find someone to help him on Saturday and Sunday to finish it.""

3I interpolate that on the Crown case, the person described as ""Rashko"", is the accused Vukovic. 

4I have assumed for the purposes of this application that the Crown will be in a position to establish that the call was lawfully recorded. I have also assumed that the Crown will be in a position to lead evidence of some link between the telephone service from which the call was made, and the accused Vukovic. 

5The second and third calls occurred on 21 October 2008. On the Crown case they are conversations between the accused Popovic and his then wife. A synopsis of those conversations is set out in Exhibit VD3. The second call took place at 3:02pm on 21 October and the synopsis reads as follows:

""Zlatan says that he's in Wollongong now and will be going up to Sydney. Zlatan says that if he can't get anyone to help Rashko with the gyprock for his mum's house, he'll have to do it.""

6The third call took place at 5:39pm on the same day. The synopsis reads:

""Tells wife that he has to stay at his mothers. Says Herbie is working at BHP and he will have to help Rashko in the morning. Says he wants him there at 7am. Says when the plastering is done his mother can move in. Tells her he's not answering Pete's number. Tells her to tell Pete he is in Sydney and that she hasn't been able to reach him. Says Pete is going to kill him. Wife asks if it's because of the money. Zlatan says yes. Tells her that he is going to Sydney to know (sic) to see if a bloke can pay him the money that he is owed. Tells her he is not answering private numbers and to send a message if the call is from a private number.""

7The reference to ""Herbie"" in that conversation is, on the Crown case, a reference to Justin Irwin (""Irwin"") the principal witness in the Crown case. I will return to aspects of Irwin's evidence in due course. 

8Objection has been taken by Mr Pickin of counsel, who appears for the accused Vukovic, to the admission of this evidence on a number of bases. Mr Brasch of counsel, who appears for the accused Popovic, has also raised an objection to it although that objection, without intending any disrespect to Mr Brasch, is of less significance than that raised by Mr Pickin. In order to deal with those objections it is necessary for me to outline some matters by way of background. 

9On 20 October, 2014 each of the four accused before the Court pleaded not guilty to an indictment alleging that between 8 September 2007 and 4 October 2007 at Toongabbie, Redfern and other places in the State of New South Wales, they conspired to murder Dusan Krstic (""Krstic""). A Crown case statement filed in the proceedings, which is consistent with the terms in which the Crown opened the case to the jury, alleges that at some stage between 8 September 2007 and 22 September 2007 the accused Popovic asked Irwin if he was interested in killing Krstic. The Crown alleges that Popovic offered Irwin $250,000 to kill Kristic. In the event that Irwin was subsequently apprehended, Popovic offered him a sum of $150,000 for each year that he was required to spend in custody as a result. Following that conversation Irwin contacted the co-accused Koloamatangi and advised him of the conversation that he had had with Popovic. Popovic then organised for Irwin to meet a person to whom Irwin has referred only as ""Rashko"" but who, on the Crown case, is the accused Vukovic. The accused Rice is said to have joined the conspiracy as a consequence of his long standing friendship with Koloamatangi.

10Vukovic and Irwin then met, following which Vukovic drove Irwin to a number of places, including Western Sydney where Kristic was said to be residing at the time. Vukovic did so in a red Toyota RAV 4 motor vehicle. Vukovic later supplied Irwin with a pistol to be used in Krstic's murder. 

11Irwin, who has been indemnified, has given evidence before the jury over a number of days. His evidence has been completed. Unsurprisingly, given that on his own admission he was part of the conspiracy and has received the benefit of an indemnity, Irwin's credit was very much in issue in cross-examination by counsel for the four accused. 

12In the course of his evidence in chief, and particularly at T283 L35 and following, Irwin gave evidence that Popovic had told him that he (Irwin) would meet up with a person named Rashko for the purposes of a particular location being shown to him. Irwin then stated (T284 L16 and following) that he in fact met with the person called Rashko. He gave evidence that they then drove to various places. At T286 L27 Irwin told the Court that Rashko had a red four-wheel drive, which he thought was a ""RAV 4"", or a small to medium type of four-wheel drive. Irwin also said (commencing at T390 L36) that at a later stage he was provided with an antique pistol by Rashko which was to be used in carrying out the conspiracy to kill the target. Irwin also gave evidence (at T293) that he worked with Rashko in late 2007, gyprocking at the premises of the mother of the accused Popovic. 

13In the course of re-examination, but not in the course of evidence-in-chief, a general description of Rashko was elicited from Irwin. There was no other evidence of identification led. I infer in those circumstances that the Crown did not have any evidence of identification which was in an admissible form. 

14Reference is made to gyprocking in the conversations which appear in Exs VD3 and VD4. The Crown seeks to tender evidence of those conversations, to corroborate the evidence of Irwin, and in particular to support the proposition that Rashko is in fact the accused Vukovic. 

15It should also be noted that in the proceedings on 23 October (at T245) the Crown tendered what is now Exhibit K2. That exhibit, which was tendered without objection, establishes that a Red Toyota RAV 4 vehicle was registered to Vukovic's wife, Nada Vukovic. The nominated address is that at which the accused was residing at the time.

16During the course of Irwin's cross-examination (at T392) Mr Pickin asked the Crown to clarify or confirm who was intended to be called in the Crown case prior to the Crown case being closed, and in particular, who the Crown was proposing to call to give evidence in its case against the accused Vukovic. Although not specifically stated, that enquiry was obviously intended to encompass not only notification of the identity of witnesses to be called, but notification of any evidence which was to be called from those witnesses. In response (T392 L10-20) the Crown said amongst other things: 

""There may be some further intercepted telephone calls that I will need to tender."" 

17I then gave the parties an opportunity to discuss the matter. Having done so, I was told that such issue as had arisen had been resolved. 

18Following the completion of Irwin's evidence, and that of another witness, the Crown indicated that he proposed to recall Detective Chambers, the Officer in Charge of the investigation. It was in those circumstances that the Crown indicated an intention to lead evidence of the calls in VD3 and VD4. The transcript of the proceedings of 30 October 2014 reflects the lengthy argument which took place in relation to this issue. I do not propose to set out the entirety of that argument but there are certain matters which warrant emphasis. 

19In the course of argument it became apparent that there had been some correspondence between Mr Pickin and the Crown on the afternoon of Friday 25 October 2014. That correspondence was not tendered, but the Crown submitted that it was as a consequence of that correspondence that he learned, for the first time, that the identification of the accused Vukovic was an issue in these proceedings. On the evidence which has been placed before me, it appears that in response to being made aware, the material in exhibits VD3 and VD4 was produced within one business day. It seems clear that the correspondence of 24 October between the Crown and Mr Pickin was the catalyst for the production of this material. 

20Who requested its production is not clear. I accept, without equivocation, that the material has only just come into the possession of the Crown. The Crown has informed me, and I also accept, that the material was part of the ""holdings"" of the New South Wales Crime Commission. However, the speed with which the material was produced following the Crown's discussions with Mr Pickin on 24 October supports a conclusion that its existence was certainly known by someone, albeit not by the Crown Prosecutor. The strong inference is that someone involved in the investigation was aware of the existence of the material for some time. That begs the obvious question why it was not disclosed to the accused.

21In the course of submissions Mr Pickin raised a number of issues. In terms of the admissibility of the evidence, he submitted that it was hearsay. He pointed out, in particular, that the Crown had not given the notice required by s67 of the Evidence Act 1995 (""the Act""), although he ultimately acknowledged, as I understood it, that I had power to dispense with any notice requirement if I thought it appropriate to do so. 

22Leaving aside questions of admissibility, Mr Pickin's substantive objection was based on the provisions of s137 of the Act. He submitted that in all of the circumstances any probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. 

23In the course of argument (in particular at T549 L20-23) and in answer to a direct query from me, Mr Pickin agreed that the unfairness really arose from the fact that there was now material which, on the face of it, might provide some identification of his client and would thus go some way to establishing the offence alleged against him. In other words Mr Pickin at least at that point, appeared to be acquiescing to the proposition that the unfairness really arose from the fact that there was now evidence which would strengthen the possibility of his client being convicted. If that were the only basis on which unfair prejudice was said to arise then Mr Pickin's objection would fail. Simply because evidence may go to prove that a person is guilty of an offence does not lead to the conclusion that it is, for that reason alone, unfairly prejudicial: Papakosmas v R (1999) 196 CLR 297 at [91]. However, it became apparent that Mr Pickin's objection went beyond that. He pointed out that the material had never been disclosed and that a disc containing the calls (which are partly in Serbian) had been given to him only a matter of hours ago. Consistent with this, the Crown informed me that transcripts of the calls were being prepared as the argument was taking place. 

24Mr Picken pointed out that when he was informed of the Crown's intention, his cross-examination of Irwin had been completed. He submitted that he had cross-examined Irwin in a particular way, in accordance with his instructions and having regard to various forensic decisions that he had made in his capacity as trial counsel. He explained that he made those decisions based, in part, upon what he understood to be the evidence against his client. He submitted that to allow the Crown to tender this evidence at such a late stage, and against a background of the circumstances that I have outlined, would be unfairly and irreparably prejudicial to his client's case. 

25The Crown in his submissions accepted that the service of the material, or its production, was ""late in one sense"". I should say that in my view, it is late in any sense. The Crown submitted that the first time that he became aware that the identification of the person who did work at the house of Popovic's mother, and the person who drove Irwin in the RAV 4, was in issue, was in his correspondence with Mr Pickin on 24 October. Part of the basis for his understanding was said to be something which had apparently been put on the accused's behalf in a bail application some time ago. In particular, the Crown said (at T553 L20 and following) 

""I understood in general terms that there would be an issue about whether Mr Vukovic took part in the conspiracy or did these things that he is said to have done by Mr Irwin, but not that it was disputed that he was the man Rasko who was the driver of a RAV 4 vehicle and who carried out gyprocking work."" 

26In answer to a question from me, the Crown explained that the material which is sought to be tendered had been in the possession of the Crime Commission between 2008 and 2014. He emphasised that he was not previously aware of it. As I have said, I unreservedly accept that is the case. 

27In determining whether the evidence should be excluded the first question is whether or not it is relevant. In my view it is clearly relevant and I did not understand Mr Pickin to argue to the contrary. It is capable of corroborating the evidence of Irwin. It is also capable of going to prove that Rashko is the accused Vukovic. 

28The second question is whether or not the evidence is admissible. In making that determination (at least in respect of the conversation set out in exhibit VD 4) I do so on the basis of the assumptions to which I have previously referred. The conversation in exhibit VD4 is a message left by the accused Vukovic. On the assumptions I have made, that evidence would be admissible. It constitutes an admission within the meaning of s. 81 of the Act.

29The conversations in exhibit VD3 fall into a different category. They are not statements said to be made by the accused Vukovic. They are clearly hearsay but in my view they would be admissible under ss 65(1)(b) or (c) of the Act. I accept Mr Pickin's submission that admissibility under that section would be subject to my exercising a discretion to waive the notice requirements set out in s 67. Whether I would be prepared to do so is inextricably linked to Mr Pickin's primary submission based on s 137. 

30The effect of s. 137 of the Act is to mandate the exclusion of evidence if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. In the present case, the probative value of the evidence is not insignificant for the reasons that I have already articulated. The real issue is whether or not that probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. 

31It would be fair to say that in many, if not the majority, of cases where s.137 is engaged, the danger of unfair prejudice stems from the nature of the evidence and its possible misuse by a jury. In the present case the situation is slightly different. Here, the danger of unfair prejudice is said to arise, to a large extent, from what be described as procedural unfairness. 

32I am satisfied that unfair prejudice for the purposes of s137 can be constituted by unfairness of that kind. In Haoui v R (2008), 188 A Crim R 331; (2008) NSW CCA 209, the Court of Criminal Appeal ordered a re-trial in which late service of the evidence of an expert had been given by the Crown. Although that case did not deal with the provisions of s 137, the approach taken by the Court, and the conclusion reached, provides some support for the proposition that procedural considerations of the kind which arise in the present case are capable, in a given set of circumstances, of giving rise to the kind of unfairness to which s 137 is directed.

33The late stage at which the accused and his counsel in the present case have been confronted with this evidence, although not determinative of the issue, is clearly relevant. In my view it is completely unacceptable, for the reasons that I have already stated, for an accused person to be confronted with such evidence, not only in the midst of a trial but virtually at the close of the Crown case, and in circumstances where the principal Crown witness has completed his evidence. 

34It goes without saying that there are disclosure obligations on the part of the prosecuting authorities. In this case, on the evidence before me, those obligations have not been met. I do not lay the blame for that at the feet of the Crown Prosecutor. He was only provided with the material recently himself, but the timing and the chronology of the events to which I have referred support the conclusion that someone was clearly aware of the existence of this material long before now. No explanation has been provided as to why it was not discovered. 

35I should also add that I have some difficulty accepting the Crown's submission that he only became aware of the fact that identification was in issue on 24 October. The day before, 23 October, the Crown tendered what is now exhibit K2, seemingly to support the evidence of Irwin, and to go some way to establishing that Rashko is in fact the accused Vukovic. Had there been no issue about identification there would have been little or no need to tender that document. 

36It is also relevant that the Crown was on notice from the response to its case statement that the accused Vukovic denied being involved in any conspiracy. It must be said that the response filed on behalf of the accused Vukovic to the Crown's case statement is a poorly drafted document which is nebulous in its expression. If it does meet the purposes of the legislation, it does so only barely. Equally, however, the Crown appears to have accepted its contents. The matter became before me on a number of occasions prior to the trial and no issue was raised by the Crown about the obvious inadequacies in the document. 

37In any event, paragraph (b) of the defence response at least makes it apparent that the case for the accused Vukovic would be that Irwin was not a witness of truth insofar as his evidence implicated the accused. Why no steps were taken to obtain information which was obviously available to support the evidence of Irwin is not explained. 

38I also find it surprising that in circumstances where Irwin is an indemnified co-conspirator whose evidence will attract a warning under s. 165 of the Act, steps were not taken to ensure that every possible aspect of his evidence was corroborated. Although his statements are not in evidence, I was informed in the course of the argument that as long as 2012 Irwin made one or more statements in which he referred to the issue of doing gyprocking with the accused Vukovic. The calls now sought to be tendered support that assertion, and establishes a link between Vukovic and Popovic which is not otherwise established on the evidence.

39It is difficult, in one sense, to determine how Mr Pickin may have cross-examined Irwin differently had he been aware of the material the Crown now seeks to tender. However having considered the matter carefully, I have concluded that I must respect, and give weight to, the fact that I am not privy to Mr Pickin's instructions, nor am I privy to the basis for any forensic decision he has made as trial counsel. The inescapable fact that he is now being confronted with evidence for the first time, and after his cross-examination of Irwin has finished. A combination of those circumstances, in my view, gives rise to unfair prejudice.

40Recalling Irwin, and allowing Mr Pickin to further cross-examine him, does not, in my view, remove the danger of unfair prejudice which has arisen. In fact, it has the capacity highlight, and increase, that danger. Recalling Irwin for further cross-examination would necessarily involve Mr Pickin being required to open up an entirely new area of questioning which, for forensic reasons, he did not embark upon when initially cross-examining Mr Irwin.

41The circumstances which have arisen are, to say the least, lamentable. However I have concluded, for the reasons given, that the danger of unfair prejudice arising from the admission of the evidence is not only significant, but outweighs any probative value that might attach to the evidence. 

42Accordingly, for those reasons, the tender of the evidence is rejected.

2765179,Catley v R [2014] NSWCCA 249,"Judgment
1BATHURST CJ:  I agree with the orders proposed by R A Hulme J and with his Honour's reasons.
2JOHNSON J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
3R A HULME J:  Craig Daniel Catley (the applicant) was found guilty by a jury on 8 November 2011 of the manslaughter of his mother, Rhonda Catley, and of two offences of killing an animal with intent to inflict severe pain (s 530(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) (the animal cruelty offences).
4He was sentenced by Barr AJ on 18 November 2011. For the animal cruelty offences, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years, he received fixed term sentences of 2 years, to be served concurrently and dating from 17 October 2009.  For the offence of manslaughter, for which the maximum penalty is 25 years, he received a sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of 8 years, dating from 17 October 2010. 
5As a result of the 1 year partial accumulation of the manslaughter sentence the total effective sentence was 12 years with a non-parole component of 9 years. 
6The applicant had pleaded not guilty to murder and to the animal cruelty offences on the grounds of mental illness.  The jury was clearly not satisfied that the defence was made out in respect of any of the offences but was satisfied that the applicant's liability for murder should be reduced to manslaughter because of substantial impairment, specifically of his capacity to control himself: s 23A of the Crimes Act.   
Grounds of appeal
7The applicant applies for leave to appeal against the sentences and relies upon five grounds.  Four of the grounds concern the manner in which the sentencing judge had regard, or failed to have regard, to the applicant's mental condition.  The final ground asserts that the sentences, both individually and in their cumulative effect, are manifestly excessive. 
Personal circumstances and background to offences
8The applicant was 27 at the time of the offences. He has a brief criminal history, the most serious offence being assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
9The applicant and his mother (the deceased) had what was described by the sentencing judge as a ""difficult history"". She was unable to properly look after him when he was young and he spent his first years being cared for by the deceased and her mother, Mrs Catley. From the age of 5 or 6 he lived from time to time with Mrs Catley. 
10The deceased was sent to prison when the applicant was 10 years old and he continued living with Mrs Catley or with an aunt throughout this period. The applicant remained in contact with the deceased whilst she was in prison.
11The applicant began using cannabis at about the age of 15.  He began exhibiting signs of depression at that time and is reported to have once attempted to commit suicide. 
12After the deceased was released from custody the applicant would visit her at her home and there were periods when he would stay with his partners in the house. He repeatedly expressed dislike for the deceased's cats. The relationship was strained and they would often fight after the applicant had been drinking to the point of physical violence. On one occasion the deceased expressed concern to a neighbour that the applicant might kill her after he had been drinking.
The offences
13The offences occurred in the early hours of Friday 16 October 2011. The deceased had lunch with her mother the day before and met the applicant at her house later in the afternoon. It is not clear how much alcohol was consumed, but it was described as a substantial amount by the sentencing judge.
14An argument broke out in the early hours.  After physically beating the deceased about the head and various parts of her body the applicant stabbed her a number of times. Two of the wounds were serious enough to be fatal in their own right.  She sustained a multitude of other injuries as well.
15The applicant killed the deceased's cats by slashing their throats with a knife. 
The aftermath
16The applicant alerted his neighbours at about 4am and was arrested shortly thereafter. He insisted that he was drunk and so the police deferred interviewing him. The sentencing judge found that although the applicant was intoxicated ""and had probably had a good deal to drink, he was in control of his faculties. He acted purposefully in raising the neighbours and in dealing with the police"" (R/S [15]).
17The applicant said various things to the police before being taken to the police station. He said that he had killed his mother; that they had had a fight and an argument; that there was no justification for what he had done; that he had even killed her cats; and ""how low can you go"". He also made specific comments about the stabbing. 
18The applicant was received into Cessnock Correctional Centre on 17 October, where he was described as being highly intoxicated, upset and in a state of disbelief. He was interviewed by a psychiatrist from Justice Health on 20 October and claimed to have no memory of the events in question. He said he had been drinking before meeting the deceased and then continued to drink whilst at her house. His next memory was waking up to find the deceased dead and a dead cat on his lap. He could not explain what had happened.
19He gave to the psychiatrist a history of depression and hearing voices. He reported that he had heard voices in his head in the 18 months prior to the offences. The voices argued with each other and he drank to shut them up. He was diagnosed with first onset psychosis and prescribed anti-psychotic medication. 
The medical evidence
20Three forensic psychiatrists gave evidence at the trial. 
21The Crown called Dr Stephen Allnutt. He did not support the defence of mental illness but suggested that on balance ""one could conclude that at the material time, to some degree he was experiencing an underlying condition with an abnormality of mind that could be depression, plus some low grade psychotic symptoms or psychotic like symptoms..."" (T331.47). 
22There was evidence of depression both before and after the offences derived from GP notes and a prescription for Zoloft. The evidence of psychosis was more dependent on self-reporting. 
23The applicant called Dr Richard Furst. He supported the defence of mental illness on the basis that the applicant was suffering from a schizo-affective disorder. He accepted at trial that this also meant that the defence of substantial impairment was available (T356.18). 
24Putting aside the question of psychosis, Dr Furst said the level of distress and depression that the applicant appeared to have would probably support a defence of substantial impairment. But he said this was difficult to say for certain and ""clearly the account was that he was psychotic"" (T356.44). 
25Dr Furst noted that the applicant did not respond adequately to his medication in custody and that this was a mark of the severity of his illness (T350.36).
26The applicant also called Dr Bruce Westmore. He was of the opinion that, on balance, the applicant was psychotic at the time of the homicide. This could have been precipitated or aggravated by drug or alcohol consumption but there was still an underlying psychosis. This opinion was based on the fact that the applicant had psychotic symptoms after being admitted and that he reported drinking in order to supress or repress voices in his head. (T382-383)
27Dr Westmore did not have enough exposure to the applicant in order to make a definitive diagnosis but concluded that he suffered a psychotic illness of some type (T384.9). The predominant symptoms were of a psychotic type rather than of a depressed type. (T386.15).  
Findings on sentence
28The jury was instructed that if there was a reasonable doubt about the specific intent for murder on account of the applicant's intoxication they were to consider manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. They were also instructed that if they had a reasonable doubt about the specific intent (to cause severe pain) in relation to the animal cruelty offences they were to find the applicant not guilty of those charges.
29The sentencing judge reasoned that since the jury found the applicant guilty of the animal cruelty offences, they must have been satisfied of the requisite mental element for murder. That is, the jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant's intoxication did not preclude him forming the intent for the animal cruelty offences and so they must have found likewise in relation to the intent to cause grievous bodily harm in respect of the deceased.
30It followed from this that the jury did not consider manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act but instead found that the offence of murder was reduced to manslaughter because when the applicant committed the act causing death he was suffering from an abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his capacity to understand events, or judge whether his actions were right or wrong, or to control himself. (R/S [17])
31His Honour was wary of the applicant's account of suffering from psychosis, in part due to the fact that a prison informer gave evidence that the applicant expressed an intention to exaggerate when speaking to psychiatrists. This was accepted on sentence. Furthermore, an account emerged from the applicant four months after the events about the deceased having supplied him with ice (methylamphetamine) and injecting him with it. This account subsequently changed to the applicant injecting himself. His Honour doubted the applicant's claim to have taken ice on the night. 
32His Honour accepted the evidence of Dr Allnutt that there was no significant history of psychosis before the events leading to the death of the deceased. 
33His Honour also accepted Dr Allnutt's evidence that the applicant was suffering from an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition due to his depression before and after he killed the deceased, as well as some paranoid-type symptoms and perceptual experiences which could be of a psychotic nature, bearing in mind his family history of mental illness, and possibly the effect on him of drugs. (R/S [31]). He doubted that ""any psychosis the offender has suffered or continues to suffer played a very great part in the commission of the offence"" (R/S [37]).
34Because of the things he said before he was taken to the police station, such as that he had killed his mother and there was no justification for what he had done, the judge did not doubt that the applicant was able to judge the wrongfulness of his acts, or understand what he had done. This led to the conclusion that the applicant suffered from a substantial impairment of his capacity to control himself. 
35His Honour found that the applicant's anger arose after he had had too much to drink, that it arose out of his hatred of the deceased and her cats, and that he intended to kill them all. (R/S [33]). 
36The first three grounds of appeal are concerned, in turn, with paragraphs [37]-[39] of the remarks on sentence.  Before turning to them it is worth observing that they were preceded by his Honour's reference to general principles concerning sentencing of an offender with a mental illness or disability:
""Mental illness suffered by an offender may be taken into account on sentence in a number of ways.  First, where the illness contributes to the offence, the offender may be considered less culpable and the offence may therefore attract a lower sentence than it otherwise would.  It may render the offender inappropriate as a vehicle for general deterrence.  And the fact that the offender will continue to have the illness may make the sentence weigh more heavily.""
Ground 1 - His Honour erred when assessing the applicant's moral culpability for the manslaughter offence by failing to take into account his mental condition on the basis that a reduction of his culpability had already been taken into account in relation to this by reason of him being found guilty of manslaughter rather than murder
37This ground is concerned with the following paragraph from the remarks on sentence:
""[37] ... I do not think that any psychosis the offender has suffered or continues to suffer played a very great part in the commission of the offence.  To the extent that it did, the concomitant reduction in his culpability has already been taken into account, because instead of being found guilty of murder, as he would have been, he has been found guilty of manslaughter, and manslaughter carries a lower range of sentences.""
38The applicant accepted that the offence of murder was reduced to manslaughter because of substantial impairment, but submitted that it was still necessary to have regard to the nature and extent of that impairment when assessing the criminality of the offence of manslaughter. 
39It was conceded that the findings of exaggerated self-reporting relating to hearing voices and doubts about taking ice on the night were open to his Honour. However, it is not apparent that the report the applicant made to the psychiatrist from Justice Health about hearing voices and the subsequent diagnosis of first onset psychosis, prior to any contact with the prison informer, was taken into account. 
40It was submitted that in considering the way in which the applicant was impaired, his Honour appeared to have limited his consideration to psychosis, and disregarded the effect of depression. He did not refer to Dr Furst's evidence that the applicant's impairment based solely on his depression would have been significant or to Dr Allnutt's evidence in relation to his depression. 
41Reliance was placed upon R v Antaky [2007] NSWSC 1047 at [35] where R S Hulme J said in relation to substantial impairment:
""Some impairment may be gross, some may only just fall within the description of 'substantial' so as to warrant the reduction. The presence and relative weight of other factors has also to be taken into account"".
42Reference was also made to R v Keceski (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 10 August 1993, unrep) where there was a verdict of manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment.  Mahoney JA observed that, after it was accepted that the offender's mental responsibility was substantially impaired, ""[t]hat leaves the determination of one of the matters relevant to sentencing, namely, the extent to which what he did was really affected by his mental condition, granted always that one must start from the basis that his mental responsibility was 'substantially impaired'."" 
43In oral submissions, counsel for the applicant conceded that for this ground to succeed it was necessary to make good the contention that the evidence disclosed an impairment significantly beyond what was required to make out the partial defence of substantial impairment.  Counsel went further than this and submitted that it is always relevant to look at the degree of impairment, as it goes both towards objective seriousness of an offence and to the subjective case of an offender. 
44Counsel was pressed repeatedly with the question as to what finding ought to have been made if the judge had given any further consideration to the evidence, particularly in relation to the applicant's depression.  Ultimately it was submitted that ""it should have been reflected more in the sentence"" and ""the failure to consider its significance ... is reflected in an excessive sentence"". (7.5.14 at T6.40)
45The sentencing judge was wary of the applicant's account of suffering from psychosis and this was clearly open to his Honour. It was also open to his Honour to find that, to the extent that the offender did suffer from any psychosis, it played little part in the commission of the offence.  
46The applicant's submission that his Honour disregarded the effect of depression on the applicant's impairment cannot be accepted. His Honour clearly indicated that the verdict followed from an acceptance of the offender's depression, as well as some paranoid-type symptoms and perceptual experiences that could be of a psychotic nature.
47These findings do not disclose an impairment that went significantly beyond what was required for a finding of substantial impairment. This ground fails.  Ground 2 - His Honour erred by failing to take into account the diminished need for general deterrence on the basis that reduction of his culpability had already been taken into account because the offence of manslaughter attracted a lower sentence than murder
48This ground is concerned with the next paragraph from the remarks on sentence:
""[38] To the extent that it is therefore inappropriate to impose a generally deterrent sentence on the offender, that too, has already been taken into account because his offence attracts a lower sentence"".
49The applicant submitted that it was not relevant to the consideration of general deterrence that the applicant was convicted of manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. The central question was whether he was the appropriate vehicle to deter others in the circumstances of this offence. 
50In addition, this was not a case where the applicant's mental illness increased the need for the protection of society. No finding was made to that effect. 
51The Crown submitted that his Honour referred to the fact that mental illness may lessen the need for general deterrence and that this was encapsulated in sentencing for manslaughter instead of murder. 
52The expression of this ground of appeal assumes that the judge was required to take into account ""the diminished need for general deterrence"".  But, a mental illness or disability does not automatically lead to a reduction in the weight to be given to general deterrence.  The Crown submissions included reference to some well-known decisions of this Court but it is convenient to adopt the encapsulation of the principles conveniently provided by Simpson J in Aslan v R [2014] NSWCCA 114:
[33] This Court has frequently had to grapple with the effect on sentencing (especially with respect to serious or violent crimes) of mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental or emotional impairment or disability. The compassion and sympathy that such a condition engenders collide with the need for sentences to reflect the objective gravity of the offence in question, the community's interest in general deterrence, and that criminal conduct must be met with appropriate denunciation and retribution. Over the years, the applicable principles have evolved. They were most recently re-stated by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [177]. They are as follows:
""[Principle 1] Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence ...
[Principle 2] It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed ...
[Principle 3] It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced ...
[Principle 4] It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence ...
[Principle 5] Conversely, it may be that because of a person's mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence ... Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public ..."" (internal citations omitted, italics added)
[34] It will be observed that none of these principles is stated as absolute. What is recognised is the potential effect, in any given case, of a mental disability. It does not follow that, because an offender suffers from some mental impairment or disability, his or her moral culpability is reduced (principle 1); nor that he or she is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence (principle 2); nor that a custodial sentence will weigh more heavily upon him or her (principle 3); nor that the significance of specific deterrence is reduced or eliminated (principle 4). Nor, on the other hand, does it follow that a person with mental impairment is a danger to the community, indicating a need for community protection (principle 5). Too often, the mere fact of mental illness is advanced to this Court as necessarily calling for a more lenient sentence. What the principles spelled out by McClellan CJ at CL do is direct attention to considerations that experience has shown commonly arise in such cases. There is, however, no presumption. It remains necessary for the sentencing court to examine the relevant facts in order to determine whether, in the specific case, the mental condition has the consequence contended for.
[35] A central question (but not the only question) is whether the mental illness or other condition had a causative role to play in the commission of the offence or offences for which the offender is to be sentenced. Counsel who appeared for the applicant accepted that this was the principal issue in this case. If it is concluded that there was a causal connection, then the offender's moral culpability may be reduced (see principle 1). That connection may also warrant lesser attention being paid to the need for the sentence to reflect considerations of general deterrence (principle 2).
53I have reviewed a significant number of cases in this Court over the past 25 years or so that have considered sentencing for substantial impairment manslaughter and it has been consistently held that what Simpson J described as ""principle 2"" applies. See, for example, R v Troja (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 16 July 1991, unrep); R v Chayna (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 8 June 1993, unrep); R v Barton (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 28 July 1995, unrep);  R v Cooper (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 24 February 1998, unrep); Heatley v R [2008] NSWCCA 226; Pitt v R [2014] NSWCCA 70 at [53]-[56] (Simpson J).  It follows that the sentencing judge was in error if what he said at [38] of the remarks on sentence must be interpreted as meaning that the mental ill-health of an offender standing for sentence for substantial impairment manslaughter is never relevant to the weight to be given to general deterrence.
54The better view, in my opinion, is that what his Honour said must be seen in context.  It is a short paragraph (in fact a single sentence) appearing within a fairly extensive survey of the evidence relevant to sentence which was dominated by a consideration of the applicant's mental condition.  His Honour found, in effect, that he could not accept that the applicant's condition was as severe as described by Drs Furst and Westmore. I interpret what his Honour found as being to the effect that the condition was sufficient to persuade the jury that the partial defence was made out and if it was worse than that it was barely so.  In these circumstances, his Honour was not required to find that the applicant was an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and thereby give less weight to it.  I would not uphold this ground.
Ground 3 - His Honour erred by not taking into account on sentence the fact that a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily on the applicant than a normal offender because of his mental illness
55This ground is based upon the following paragraph of the remarks on sentence:
""[39] I accept the possibility that because of his illness the offender may find his life more difficult to manage, whether he is serving a sentence or not.  He will need to subject himself to treatment.  He will need to seek and follow advice.  He will need to take medicine.  But there is no reason to suppose that the advice he needs will not always be available to him or that he will be denied any of the opportunities for work and rehabilitation ordinarily offered to those in custody.""
56The applicant acknowledged this passage but submitted that the fact that advice, treatment and work opportunities would not be denied to the applicant in custody was not determinative of the matter. It was submitted that the fact that he continued to suffer from a psychotic illness, needed treatment and may find life more difficult in custody than an offender who is not mentally ill was a relevant consideration and should have been taken into account.
57The Crown submitted that, despite being in custody for more than two years, no evidence was advanced on behalf of the applicant that he had suffered any particular difficulties arising out of his mental illness. 
58As is apparent from the summary of principles in R v Aslan quoted earlier, a finding that custody will weigh more heavily on an offender does not flow automatically from a finding of mental illness. The judge was clearly aware of the potential significance of this factor, considered it and determined that it did not arise.
59There was nothing in the applicant's submissions that indicated how the applicant's mental condition would make his time in custody more onerous than for an inmate unaffected by such a condition. The absence of evidence on the subject perhaps explains why the experienced counsel who appeared for the applicant in the court below made no mention of this issue.  This ground is not made out.  
Ground 4 - His Honour erred by failing to take into account the applicant's mental condition in relation to the offences of killing an animal with intent of inflicting severe pain. 
60The applicant submitted that his Honour failed to take into account the applicant's mental state in sentencing for these offences. In particular, moderation was called for in respect of the applicant's moral culpability. 
61The Crown submitted that the judge referred generally to principles relating to the sentencing of offenders with a mental condition and then discussed them specifically in relation to the manslaughter offence.  Although he did not relate them specifically to the animal cruelty offences, it was implicit that he took the principles into account in relation to them as well. 
62I am doubtful about the last of those submissions.  In applying the principles in sentencing for the manslaughter offence a relevant factor was the reduction of liability from murder on account of the applicant's mental condition.  But that had no role to play in the application of the principles to the animal cruelty offences.  
63The sentencing remarks do not make any specific mention of the principles in relation to those offences.  There are two possible reasons:  his Honour failed to consider them in that context or he failed to mention that he had considered them.  Because of his Honour's stated awareness of them generally, I think it is most unlikely that the judge simply forget about them in his assessment of the sentences for those offences.  It is, again, notable that counsel who appeared for the applicant made no submission at all about these offences.  In the end, the real question is whether the sentences are manifestly excessive, a matter to be considered under the next ground.  I would not uphold this ground.
Ground 5 -(a) The individual sentences for the manslaughter and the offence of killing an animal with intent of inflicting severe pain are manifestly excessive(b) The extent of accumulation for the offences of killing an animal with intent of inflicting severe pain is manifestly excessive.64The applicant relied on grounds 1-3 in support of the contention that a lesser sentence is warranted for the offence of manslaughter, and that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
65The maximum penalty for manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment. Taking into account the discount awarded for the applicant's late offer to plead guilty to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment, it was submitted that a sentence 11 years with a non-parole component of 8 years was substantial. It was at the top of the range of sentences recorded by the Judicial Commission. 
66The judge found that the offence of manslaughter, and the animal cruelty offences, were ""very serious ones of their kind"".  That was a finding that was well open to him, particularly having regard to his finding that there was an intention to kill (as opposed to inflicting grievous bodily harm) and that the reason for the finding of substantial impairment was the applicant's inability control himself.  In other words, he was possessed of the capacity to understand events and to judge whether his actions were right or wrong.
67The judge found that the applicant was ""very sorry for what he [had] done"" but that the remorse ""may last only until the next time he loses his temper and becomes violent"". His prospects of rehabilitation were judged as ""not high"", given that they were seen to be dependent on his ability to master alcohol and his bad temper. 
68It was submitted by the applicant that his disadvantaged background should be given full weight: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571. It was found that he had a ""modest"" record and that he had been a useful member of society with regular gainful employment.
69Reference was made by the applicant to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics.  The limited use to which statistics can be put has been regularly commented upon: see, for example, Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [48]-[49]. In this case, although the sentence falls towards the upper range of those recorded, it cannot be said to be manifestly excessive. 
70Ground 4 was said to support the contention that lesser sentences were warranted for the offences of killing an animal with intent of inflicting severe pain.  I am not prepared to accept that a sentence of 2 years, against a maximum penalty of 5 years, is manifestly excessive for offences found to be very serious examples of their kind.  This is so even having regard to such subjective matters, including the applicant's mental condition, that he could call in aid in mitigation.  
71In relation to the level of accumulation of the manslaughter sentence upon the sentences for the animal cruelty offences, it cannot be ignored that the judge ordered that the two sentences for the latter be served concurrently.  The practical effect is that the applicant will serve only one year in respect of those two offences.  The Crown's submission that they reflected a separate element of criminality should be accepted. A degree of accumulation was called for and 1 year was not excessive. There is no merit in this point.
Orders
72I propose the following orders:
1.  Leave to appeal against sentence granted.
2.  Appeal dismissed.

		31 October 2014",2014-10-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765185,R v Jones (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 1511,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1On 12 May 2014 at Coffs Harbour, Wayne Edward Jones (the offender) was arraigned before a jury panel and me. The indictment contained a single count alleging that, between 11 December 2012 and 17 December 2012 at Coffs Harbour, he murdered Michelle Jane Reynolds (the deceased). In my summing-up, I left to the consideration of the jury the lesser form of homicide, manslaughter. After a short retirement, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder.
2On 17 October 2014 at Sydney, the offender was arraigned before me on an indictment containing a further count. It alleged that, on 15 December 2012 at Coffs Harbour, the offender had supplied a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, in the amount of 81.9 grams. The offender pleaded guilty to that count. In fact, he had pleaded guilty in the Local Court many months before, and the arraignment was required merely because of a technical defect in the document committing him for sentence.
3The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is imprisonment for life without parole. The learned Crown Prosecutor did not submit that that ultimate sentence would be appropriate. In the circumstances of this case, Parliament has prescribed a standard non-parole period of 20 years. I have regarded both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period for murder as important guideposts in my exercise of sentencing discretion.
4The maximum penalty for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, when dealt with on indictment, is imprisonment for 15 years. There is no standard non-parole period. Again, I regard that maximum penalty as an important guidepost.
5Much of the evidence before the jury with regard to the murder was not in dispute. With regard to the supply offence, agreed facts were tendered. 
6My approach to the determination of any disputed facts is as follows.  Any fact that is adverse to the offender, above and beyond the elements of the offence, must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.  A fact that is in his favour need be proven on the balance of probabilities only: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270.  Some facts may be unable to be determined by me.  It is not my role to attempt to construe the findings of fact that may have underpinned the verdict of the jury.  Rather, I must make my own findings, consistent with that verdict: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374; (1997) 90 A Crim R 587.
7The facts underpinning the two counts are very much bound up with each other, and it is convenient to discuss them together.
Undisputed facts
8The deceased was born in August 1978, and accordingly at the date of her death was aged 34 years. Her family connections were on the Central Coast of New South Wales. Between about 1998 and 2008, she gave birth to four sons. In 2008 or 2009 she separated from the father of her children.
9In early 2011, the deceased began a relationship with Mr Adam Smedley. Although the deceased told Mr Smedley that she was ""against drugs"", he observed aspects of her behaviour during their relationship that suggest that she may well have been involved with prohibited drugs.
10Separately, in the latter half of 2012, the offender, who was himself living on the Central Coast, met a Mr Matthew Hoare. Mr Hoare was the mentor of the offender in his efforts to free himself from a dependence on prohibited drugs. 
11On Sunday 18 November 2012, Mr Smedley suggested that he and the deceased have a break from their relationship because of ongoing arguments between the two of them. The deceased went to live with her mother, Ms Jeanette Reynolds, at her home in Woy Woy. The deceased was ""down"" as a result of the difficulties in her relationship with Mr Smedley. She was not working, but would attend karaoke evenings with her family. A number of people who were close to her saw aspects of her appearance and behaviour that suggested that she was using prohibited drugs.
12On one of the karaoke evenings, the family circle of the deceased was introduced to the offender.  
13On what was in all likelihood 22 November 2012, the offender arrived at the home of Ms Reynolds. The deceased was present. The offender was in possession of cannabis, various pills, and amphetamines. He also possessed a small set of digital scales. In the presence of Ms Cavers, the offender supplied the deceased with $150 worth of amphetamines.  Later that day, the offender travelled to a hospital car park, and obtained some syringes from an automatic vending machine there.  Clearly enough, the offender was both an intravenous user and supplier of prohibited drugs. 
14On Friday 23 November 2012, the deceased saw her estranged husband in order to have an access visit with one of her sons. He formed the opinion that she was affected by a prohibited drug. The deceased introduced the offender, who was with her, as ""Ozzie"". When they returned to her mother's home, she also formed the view that her daughter was affected by some sort of drug.
15On Sunday 25 November 2012, the deceased saw Mr Smedley at a party. She wished to come home with him, but he wanted more time to reflect on the relationship. The deceased began to cry.
16The following day, the deceased left her mother's home with only a bag, her son's phone, and her own mobile phone. She told her mother that she was going to Woy Woy and would not be long. Her mother never saw her daughter again.
17Over the next several days, SMSs passed between Ms Reynolds and the deceased. Their general flavour was that Ms Reynolds feared that her daughter was abusing amphetamines, and urged her to come home. The deceased told her mother to mind her own business.
18On 7 December 2012, Ms Reynolds reported the deceased as a missing person to Woy Woy Police Station.
19At 5:05 PM on Sunday 9 December 2012, CCTV cameras recorded the offender and the deceased present together at a railway station in the Newcastle area. From there they travelled by train to Coffs Harbour, arriving a little after 1 o'clock the following morning. Shortly after that, the two of them checked into the Golden Glow Hotel in Coffs Harbour. The proprietor, Ms Towler, saw the offender and the deceased walk towards room nine.
20On 10 and 11 December, Ms Towler did not see the offender or the deceased leave that room. It will be noted that the commencement date in the indictment for murder is 11 December 2012.
21On that morning, the offender booked the room for another two nights by telephone. He also ordered a very large meal by way of room service. Ms Towler delivered the food to the room. The offender opened the door very slightly, and kept the security chain on. Ms Towler noted that he was shirtless and sweating profusely. He opened the door a little wider so that Ms Towler could lean into the room and place the food on a single bed near the door. Ms Towler did not see the deceased.
22Later, the offender paid in cash for an extra night and the room service. Ms Towler returned to the room with change.  Again, that money was passed through the doorway with the chain still attached.
23At 4:03 PM that day, the offender and the deceased were captured by CCTV at Coffs Harbour Woolworths. There was nothing about their appearance to suggest that anything was amiss.
24On Wednesday 12 December 2012, the offender and the deceased were supposed to vacate room nine at the Golden Glow Motel. They did not do so.  Ms Towler called Coffs Harbour police for assistance. The police arrived at 5:10 PM, and knocked on the door to room nine.  The offender answered, and police noted that he was sweating profusely. Two uniformed officers entered and saw the deceased. She said nothing. The offender departed with a large shopping trolley overflowing with grey plastic shopping bags. The deceased left room nine a very short time later and caught up with him.
25Once it was vacated, Ms Towler went to the room. The room was messy but not damaged. The bedding seemed damp to Ms Towler. She also noticed an odd, overpowering smell in the room.
26The deceased and the offender travelled to another motel some distance south of Coffs Harbour. They arrived at about 7 PM. Mr Shaw, the proprietor, saw the deceased walk into the reception area and commence to fill out a registration form. She appeared to be gaunt, skinny, tired, and stressed. Her pupils were enlarged.  She also smelled as if she had not washed for some time. Her false fingernails were extremely long. 
27The offender stayed outside the reception area, but spoke to Mr Shaw. Mr Shaw saw the two of them walk away together from the reception in the direction of room seven.  That was the last time that any person saw the deceased alive. 
28At about 10:20 the following morning, Thursday 13 December 2012, Mr Shaw went to room seven and knocked on the door. He wished to enquire how long the offender and the deceased intended to stay. The offender opened the door but kept the security chain still attached. Mr Shaw saw that the room was dark, with the lights off, the blinds down, and the air-conditioner on. Mr Shaw heard no other sounds. He asked the offender to take the chain off the door. He did so and opened the door about 30 centimetres. The offender angled his head and torso around the door. Mr Shaw saw that he was shirtless. Mr Shaw did not see or hear anything of the deceased.
29In the vicinity of the light switch near the door to the room, Mr Shaw noted two red marks. Each of them was about 150 centimetres from the floor, and was about the size of a five cent piece. They were later analysed, and one cannot safely infer that they contained the blood of anyone other than the offender. 
30At the request of Mr Shaw, the offender walked from room seven to the reception area, and paid for another night's accommodation with EFTPOS.
31The motel cleaner did not clean room seven that day.  Instead she left towels, toilet paper and a garbage bag outside the door.
32At 9:55 on the morning of Friday 14 December, the offender telephoned Mr Shaw and said that he wished to book another night, and would be over to pay shortly. Again, he attended at reception and paid for another night by EFTPOS.
33On that day, the cleaner adopted the same procedure as the day before. She did not clean the room.
34At some indeterminate time before Christmas 2012, the offender called two friends. He told Mr Eron Fisher that he was in Coffs Harbour and wanted to be picked up. Mr Fisher refused to do so. Ms Debra Pollock also recalled receiving a call at night. She recalled that the offender had told her that he was in Brisbane, and offered to pay her well if she would collect him. Again, Ms Pollock refused to do so.
35At 10:15 AM on Saturday 15 December 2012, Mr Shaw called room seven to remind its occupants to pay for that evening. The offender said that he would come to reception shortly.
36Meanwhile, at 10:20 AM, hundreds of kilometres to the south on the Central Coast, Mr Hoare noted a missed call on his mobile phone from the offender.
37At around the same time, the offender walked to reception and paid for another night's accommodation, again by EFTPOS.  The offender told Mr Shaw that he was ""really hungry"" and wondered whether a pizza could be delivered to his room. Mr Shaw agreed to phone a pizza delivery service for him. He dialled it and handed the telephone to the offender. The offender thanked Mr Shaw, who noted that he appeared to be in a good mood. The offender then walked back to room seven.
38At 11:15 AM, a young pizza delivery man delivered three pizza boxes, garlic bread, and a soft drink to room seven.  The offender opened the door and put his head around it. It was open about 30 centimetres. The offender kept one foot braced against it. He was wearing a T-shirt, and the pizza delivery boy noted that his eyes were darting from side to side. He saw behind the offender that the room was dark and quiet. The items were handed over without the delivery man entering the room.  
39At 1:12 PM, Mr Hoare called the offender back. He asked how the offender was.  He replied ""I'm not travelling well, can you come and get me, I'm in Coffs Harbour"". When Mr Hoare refused, the offender said ""Please, I need you to come and get me"", and offered Mr Hoare several thousand dollars. The offender said ""[S]omeone is after me"". Mr Hoare ended the call by telling the offender to ""[G]et to a meeting"", referring to a meeting for people trying to free themselves from prohibited drugs.
40Shortly before 5 PM, Mr Geoffrey Allen, a Coffs Harbour taxi driver, received a call from the offender, who requested that a taxi pick him up from the Arosa Motel. Mr Allen drove there and met the offender. At 4:59 PM the offender asked Mr Allen to help him move some luggage from the room into the taxi. Mr Allen obliged. At 5:09 PM, the offender asked Mr Allen to help him lift the contents of a white sheet that was bundled up and tied together into the taxi van. Mr Allen did so, and the bundle was placed inside the rear of the taxi. Completely unbeknown to Mr Allen, contained in that bundle was the battered and bloodied body of the deceased.
41Mr Allen and the offender got into the taxi.  The offender told Mr Allen that he was looking to buy real estate in the general vicinity of Coffs Harbour, and wished to be driven around the area for an inspection tour. That was a lie; the offender had no such intention. In truth, he was looking for an isolated spot at which he could dump the body of the deceased.
42The two of them visited a number of locations on the pretext given by the offender. At one point on Butlers Road, near the township of Bonville, the offender asked Mr Allen to stop so that the offender could relieve himself in the bush. Both men alighted from the cab. Mr Allen stood in the centre of the road and smoked a cigarette. He did not take particular notice of what the offender was doing.  By the time Mr Allen had finished his cigarette, the offender was ready to return to the front passenger seat and proceed.
43During the time that Mr Allen had smoked his cigarette, the offender had surreptitiously removed the bundle from the taxi and dragged it a short distance into the bush. 
44The offender told Mr Allen that he had absentmindedly left a bag at the Arosa Motel and needed to return. Mr Allen agreed to drive him back there. On arrival Mr Allen parked outside, and the offender entered room seven again. Mr Shaw, the proprietor, was having a coffee and heard a number of bangs coming from the direction of that room. He walked outside and saw the offender leaving room seven carrying a motel bedspread with things bundled inside it. The proprietor grabbed one side of the bedspread, the offender grabbed the other, and the two men engaged in a tug-of-war over it. When Mr Shaw insisted that the offender would not be permitted to leave with the bedspread, the offender agreed to empty it into the taxi. When he did so, Mr Shaw saw that bundled inside the bedspread had been things such as small items of rubbish, personal effects, and a large number of pieces of yellow foam rubber that were similar to the foam rubber in the motel bed mattress bases.  Mr Shaw also noted that the offender was very agitated, and speaking very quickly in a high-pitched voice.  At that stage, Mr Shaw came to the view that the offender was affected by some sort of drug.
45Mr Shaw walked to room seven. The door was wide open. Mr Shaw entered and immediately saw that the whole of the room had been, to use his word, ""trashed"". Amongst other things, the bathroom was flooded, a picture that had been hanging above the bed was smashed and lying near the fridge, the base of the bed was badly ripped, the carpet was wet and featured some dark patches, and there was general debris and food items all over the floor. Mr Shaw also noted an overpowering, sickly sweet smell that he thought was of semen or menstrual blood.
46Mr Shaw angrily left the room and walked to the taxi.  He accused the offender of trashing room seven. The offender begged Mr Shaw not to call the police, and said that he would be back in 30 minutes to pay for the damage and to clean up. The offender was seen to be highly agitated and in a panic. The taxi drove off. Mr Shaw walked back to reception and called police. That call was logged at 6:25 PM.
47Police were dispatched to the motel. They also became aware that the offender had requested Mr Allen to drive him to Brelsford Park, near the centre of Coffs Harbour. On arrival at the car park near the toilet block in the park, Mr Allen stopped the taxi and told the offender that the fare was over. Mr Allen also activated the emergency alarm in his vehicle. By that stage, Mr Allen noted that the offender had become erratic, anxious, jerky, agitated, and angry.
48Both men alighted from the taxi. The offender ran to an area near the toilet block and commenced digging in the dirt and leaves. Other people noticed the behaviour of the offender, and some of them became afraid and left the area.  The offender was pacing around and throwing items into the bushes.  The offender returned to the taxi and said loudly to Mr Allen ""Where the fuck is it, it was here before"". 
49Meanwhile police had arrived at the Arosa Motel. They noted blood on the walls of room seven.
50Uniformed police arrived at Brelsford Park. They approached the offender, and saw that he was jerky in his movements, walking back and forth, and agitated. He was waving his arms around and rubbing his hands together. Police also noticed that the offender had sores, open wounds, and scabs on his arms. A red substance was on his lips and teeth. His eyes were wide and it seemed that he was having difficulty focusing. His speech was hard to follow. The police formed the opinion that the offender was very much affected by some sort of prohibited drug.
51When the police spoke to the offender at the park, he immediately tried to implicate Mr Allen in the death of the deceased.  That gentleman was, of course, completely innocent of any wrongdoing. The offender emptied his pockets, and it was noted that he was in possession of a wallet and three mobile phones. The offender agreed that he had been staying at the Arosa Motel, with a woman whom he knew only as ""Michelle"". He gave a garbled version that he and the deceased had been attacked by persons with shotguns, and that those persons had disposed of the body of the deceased.  That was, of course, a further lie.
52The offender also informed police that he had taken a ""bad mix"" of cocaine.  One police officer noticed that the offender was literally foaming at the mouth. In due course the offender was arrested and taken by uniformed police to Coffs Harbour Police Station, where he was entered into custody. He has been in custody ever since.
53Examination of the taxi and the scene at Brelsford Park revealed items including food scraps, containers full of some sort of paste, clothes, a backpack, a suitcase, phone chargers, and resealable plastic bags, some of them containing a white powdery residue. In fact, almost 90 grams of methylamphetamine was located in various containers at that scene. Its purity has never been determined. By way of his plea of guilty to the offence of supplying a prohibited drug on that day, the offender has admitted that at least some of that drug was in his possession for the purpose of supply.
54Police spoke to the offender again at the police station. He continued to appear to be badly affected by a stimulant. He repeated his false allegation that the taxi driver was criminally involved in the death of the deceased and the disposal of her body. At 10:30 PM, when spoken to by detectives, the offender was noted to be very animated, scratching at sores on his arms, moving his arms around, and pacing back and forth.  The detectives did not believe that it was appropriate to engage in a formal interview with the offender at that stage, in light of his mental state. 
55Meanwhile, on the outskirts of Coffs Harbour, Mr Allen was being driven around by the police in an effort to find the deceased. They were unable to do so. The investigations of the police also continued at the Arosa Motel and at Brelsford Park.
56At 1:45 PM on Sunday 16 December 2012, police located a cardboard box in a green dumpster at the rear of the Arosa Motel. Two blood stained sheets were found in that box.
57At 4:39 PM, the bundle that had been dumped in the bush by the offender was located by police. Flattened grass showed that it had been dragged from the roadway to the location at which it was found. The layers of wrapping around the body of the deceased were removed. She had been dead for some time.  Her body was surrounded by a white sheet loosely wrapped; a white sheet tied with two knots; sundry items such as foam rubber, newspapers and cloth; and two cream blankets.
58It will be remembered that the last date in the indictment is Monday 17 December 2012.
59At 9:30 AM on 19 December 2012, a forensic pathologist commenced the post mortem examination of the body of the deceased. It was hampered by blood pooling in the lowest points of the body, combined with its decomposition.
60The forensic pathologist found a length of cloth had been ripped and looped around the neck of the deceased three times, with a single knot behind the left side of her head. That length of cloth was not attached to any other binding on the body of the deceased. There was also a length of cloth tied around the wrists and looped three times behind the back of the deceased. There was also a length of cloth around the ankles, looped twice with one knot. Finally, there was a length of cloth in a figure eight that linked the hand tie with the ankle tie.  In other words, the deceased was tied up in such a way that both her wrists and her ankles were bound behind her, and were themselves connected to each other in such a way that, if her arms were moved they would exert pressure on her legs and vice versa.  Tying up a person or animal in such a way renders them immobile and helpless.  It is colloquially referred to as ""hog-tying"". 
61The forensic pathologist noted many lacerations to the head and face of the deceased. Her nose was broken. He came to the opinion that there had been at least four applications of significant blunt force trauma to the head of the deceased. He also came to the opinion that those injuries were not the cause of death. 
62The forensic pathologist also saw a large, generally circular area of abrasion or skin loss to the abdomen of the deceased. He described it as a ""chemical type burn"", as if something corrosive had been poured on to the stomach of the deceased. He regarded it as relatively fresh, and likely to have been inflicted before death. There were also other injuries on the arms of the deceased suggestive of chemical burns. The forensic pathologist formed the opinion that it was impossible to age the injuries to the body of the deceased with any precision, because of the blood pooling and decomposition. 
63Finally, the forensic pathologist formed the opinion that the cause of death was asphyxiation; that is, the cutting off of the oxygen supply to the deceased. Although able to rule out manual strangulation, the forensic pathologist considered that the mechanism of asphyxiation was either forceful suffocation (such as the face of the deceased being forced into a pillow) or ligature strangulation by way of the length of cloth around her neck. As for the latter mechanism, the forensic pathologist noted that there were no injuries to the neck of the deceased, in contrast to her wrists and ankles at the sites of the binding. However, he considered that fatal ligature strangulation could have occurred without a physical injury being caused to the neck of the deceased. 
Resolution of disputed facts
64The verdict of the jury determines that, between the dates in the indictment, the offender voluntarily did an act that caused the death of the deceased and, at the time of doing that act, he intended to kill or inflict really serious physical injury. As I have said, any aggravating feature above and beyond those elements must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.
65I turn to consider whether I am satisfied of any such aggravating feature.
66There was a very small amount of evidence that the offender assaulted or threatened the deceased before he inflicted the injuries to her face. That was based on things heard by the younger sister of the deceased, Ms Cavers, when she got through to her at one stage on her mobile phone.  The other evidence, much of which I have summarised, supported the proposition that the deceased was in the company of the offender from 9 December 2012 freely and without oppression. Because of the limited evidence from Ms Cavers, and a degree of confusion that surrounded it, I am not persuaded to the criminal standard that the offender inflicted violence upon the deceased, or threatened to do so, before the assault in room seven that led to the injuries to her head and face.
67Separately, the parties were in dispute in the proceedings on sentence as to the intention that I would find established, and the related question of the mechanism of death. The learned Crown Prosecutor submitted that I would be satisfied that the offender possessed an intention to kill. That submission was founded in turn upon the proposition that the offender deliberately asphyxiated the deceased, either by strangling her with the ligature, or by forcefully suffocating her.  In support of the former possibility, he noted that the binding around the neck was not connected at all to any of the other bindings to the body of the deceased. In other words, it was not a mechanism of restraint; its only purpose must have been to harm. If I were satisfied that death was inflicted by ligature strangulation or deliberate suffocation, he submitted that I could not, as a matter of common sense, find that there had been anything less than an intention to kill.
68Learned defence counsel submitted that it is reasonably possible that, whilst both the offender and the deceased were grossly intoxicated by amphetamines, the offender punched the deceased several times to the head with significant force, and at the time he intended to inflict really serious physical injury. As a result, the deceased collapsed or fell, perhaps unconscious, and thereafter suffocated face down without further intervention by the offender. Defence counsel submitted that that was a reasonably possible mechanism of death that was consistent with the verdict of the jury and the elements of murder, and that I would not go beyond that with regard to circumstances of aggravation.
69I respectfully reject that submission. As defence counsel accepted in discussion between Bench and Bar table, that hypothesis accepts that the deceased was asphyxiated, but implicitly asserts that the fact that she was found to have a cloth wrapped around her neck had nothing to do with her asphyxiation; to the contrary, the two findings are merely coincidental. 
70But I do not accept that there is any innocent coincidence in the fact that this woman was asphyxiated and that her body was found with a cloth around her neck.
71The unconnected cloth around the neck of the deceased did not form part of her restraint.  And nor could it, of course, have assisted in the transportation of the body of the deceased once it was wrapped inside the sheets and other items. It could only have assisted, at most, in moving the body from a location in the small motel room into the sheets in another part of the room no more than a few metres away. 
72In the circumstances, I am satisfied that that cloth was wrapped around the neck of the deceased in order to asphyxiate her, and had nothing to do with the transport or restraint of the deceased, whether within or outside the room. I also accept the evidence of the forensic pathologist that ligature strangulation could have occurred without leaving any marks around the neck of the deceased. In short, on all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the death of the deceased was caused by the offender strangling her with the piece of cloth that was still around her neck when her body was located.
73As for the intention with which that act occurred, it is to be noted that at some stage reasonably shortly before death, the offender inflicted a brutal bashing to the face of the deceased. Either before or after death by strangulation, the deceased was bound in an extreme position. After the strangulation, the offender did nothing to suggest that her death was unintended, such as seeking urgent medical help or asking Mr Shaw to do so.  I accept that it is possible to envisage circumstances in which one strangles a person with no more than an intention to inflict really serious physical injury, but nevertheless causes the death of that person without intending to do so.  But in all of the circumstances that I have recounted, I am satisfied that the offender did indeed intend to kill when he used a ligature to strangle the deceased.
74In short I am satisfied of the aggravating feature that the offender used ligature strangulation to asphyxiate the deceased. I am also satisfied that he intended to kill her when he did so.
75Separately, it is impossible to determine when the deceased was bound as she was.  If it was before death, that method of restraint must have been painful and terrifying.  Having reflected on the matter, I am not satisfied of that fact beyond reasonable doubt. I proceed on the basis that it is reasonably possible that her body was restrained in that way after her death in order to facilitate her transport. 
76Another objective feature that was in dispute between the parties was with regard to the corrosive substance that injured the abdomen of the deceased. I am well satisfied that the offender applied a corrosive chemical to the deceased at some stage after they checked into the Arosa Motel. I believe that he had such an item in his possession in order to prepare prohibited drugs for use or sale.  The more difficult question is whether he did so when the deceased was alive or dead. 
77The forensic pathologist expressed the opinion, based upon the reaction to the chemical, that it was done shortly before death. To my mind, it is impossible to imagine that that was done to a person who was conscious at the time. If that were the case, the victim would scream and struggle, and the pattern of injury would not be basically circular. To my mind, reconciling these two analyses, it must be the case that the offender applied the chemical to the body of the deceased whilst she was alive but unconscious. It is possible that that was done to torture the deceased.  It is also possible that it was done to dispose of her body, the offender believing her to be dead at that time. However, I am unable to determine the motivation for doing so beyond reasonable doubt. 
78The final aggravating feature requiring resolution is the question of when it was that the offender murdered the deceased. It will be recalled that the last time the deceased was seen alive was about 7 PM on Wednesday 12 December 2012. It will also be recalled that Mr Shaw noted blood near the light switch near the door to room seven on the morning of Thursday 13 December 2012. It could be, perhaps, that fatal violence had already been inflicted upon the deceased at that stage, and the offender had deposited his blood at that location in the process. However, I think that it is reasonably possible that the blood of the offender was at that location at that time as a result of him injecting prohibited drugs, or as a result of his scabs and sores. I think it is also reasonably possible that at that stage the offender refused to open the door to Mr Shaw in order to hide from him the chaotic state of the room and the prohibited drugs and associated paraphernalia that were there. Accordingly, I put any suspicion that the deceased was dead at that time to one side.
79However, it will also be recalled that Mr Hoare saw the missed call from the offender at 10:20 AM on Saturday 15 December 2012. The return telephone call permits one safely to infer that the original call from the offender was an effort on his part to flee the scene with the paid assistance of Mr Hoare. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at that stage, the deceased had been murdered. What is noteworthy is that, after that, the offender was content to order a large amount of takeaway food.  And he was content to consume it in a small motel room in which, no more than a few metres away, was the body of a woman whom he had bashed and thereafter strangled to death. The ghastliness of that image requires no elaboration by me.
Assessments of objective seriousness
80I turn to assess the objective seriousness of these offences. I shall first discuss the offence of possessing methylamphetamine for supply. 
81The offence is by no means trivial. The amount of amphetamines involved is not insubstantial. It must also be the case that the drugs that were to be supplied would be sales, not gifts. Having said that, the purity of the drugs is not known. Nor is it known how much of the drug was actually for supply, and how much of it was intended to be used by the offender and the deceased. In short, I regard the drug offence as below the mid-range of objective seriousness.
82Turning to an assessment of the objective seriousness of this murder, of course all murders are extremely grave, featuring as they do the unlawful taking of the life of another human being in the most serious circumstances known to law. Still and all, it is possible to construct a hierarchy of seriousness depending upon various aspects of the offence. For example, it could generally be said to be the case that a cold-blooded, calculated killing carried out by a contract killer with a silenced pistol will very often be more serious than a spontaneous murder effected by a single punch in a brawl in a hotel, and to which one is an accessory. 
83It was agreed between the parties that I would proceed on the basis that this murder was unplanned. I accept that submission. If it were otherwise, the offender would surely have had a far less chaotic and easily detected plan for the disposal of the body and the other incriminating items. As a result of the effects of prohibited drugs upon him (a topic to which I shall return later), the offender engaged in a spontaneous and unpremeditated act of great violence.
84Having said that, the offender bashed and strangled a young woman who was alone in his company. She was also isolated, in that she was in a small motel room near Coffs Harbour, hundreds of kilometres from those who loved her on the Central Coast. Before death, she was bashed to the face with sufficient force to break her nose. The murder was effected by way of ligature strangulation.  Although that act was spontaneous, being strangled to death must surely be a terrible way to die. Strangling or garrotting is a form of killing for which I consider the community has a particular abhorrence. At the time of the murder the offender intended to kill. Before death the deceased was injured by way of the application of some sort of corrosive chemical to her. After death the body was treated with contempt, in that it was tied as one might tie an animal, and wrapped up with sundry bits of household rubbish. Eventually, the body of the deceased was dumped in the bush, in the same way that some citizens dump their unwanted household refuse.
85Whilst it is true that the murder was spontaneous and not premeditated, in the circumstances that I have described it must be regarded as being of the utmost seriousness.
Subjective features
86I turn from a discussion of the offence to a discussion of the offender.  With regard to the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, the offender pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. I propose to discount that sentence by 25 per cent to reflect the usefulness of that plea. It is also the case that he has accepted responsibility for that crime. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he regrets it.
87As for the murder, the offender pleaded not guilty and stood his trial by jury, as he was perfectly entitled to do. Since that time he has not expressed the slightest remorse for the death of the deceased, or even a grudging acceptance of responsibility.  It is noteworthy that he has said nothing to his father about it, to whose evidence I shall turn in a moment. 
88I have already found that the offender intended to kill the deceased. I have also found that the offence was completely spontaneous and unplanned. Turning to the closely related but separate question of motive, both parties were unable to suggest a motive for this murder. I respectfully agree that one is unable to understand why the offender committed this crime. There is nothing to suggest that the deceased stole his drugs, or anything of that nature. The most one can do is ascribe this senseless tragedy to the abuse of prohibited drugs, a topic to which I now turn. 
89I am quite satisfied that both the offender and the deceased were heavily abusing amphetamines from the time they arrived in Coffs Harbour until her death. Indeed, the offender continued to do so after she died. All of the observations made of the two of them, and the rooms in which they stayed, support that proposition. I am also satisfied that, when he murdered the deceased, the offender was grossly affected by those substances and in some sort of drug-fuelled rage. The Crown Prosecutor did not submit to the contrary. On the other hand, defence counsel accepted that, in accordance with s 21A(5AA) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), the self-induced intoxication of the offender cannot be taken into account as a mitigating feature in his favour. 
90The offender was born on 14 April 1971, and accordingly was aged 41 years as at the date of the offence, and is now aged 43. The evidence about his life and background comes from three sources: his criminal record (as illuminated by the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Jones v R [2005] NSWCCA 443), a psychiatric report, and the oral evidence of his father.
91Mr Allan Jones gave evidence before me on sentence that I accept as truthful. He explained that he was aged 72, and that the offender was one of his three children. Mr Jones senior had worked for many years with Telstra, and there was no suggestion in his evidence that the upbringing of the offender was marred by violence, the abuse of alcohol or prohibited drugs by those around him, or gross disadvantage. Mr Jones explained that he regarded the upbringing of his son as relatively normal. He gave evidence that many years ago the offender developed a relationship with his partner Marie, and they had five children together. Mr Jones described the relationship as ""a bit volatile"". He observed that his son loved his children, and often spoke of his desire to be with them.
92The offender had worked on the Central Coast in various labouring jobs. At one stage he rented a farm on the Central Coast, and was trying to make a success of raising calves. He went into custody in around 2003 or 2004, and was not released until about 2008. His parole was revoked in early 2011, and he was incarcerated again for a few months. As it turned out the breach was ultimately not established, but by the time the offender was released he had ""lost everything"".  His father noticed a change in his mood, and understands that it was at that stage that the offender commenced to abuse prohibited drugs more heavily than he had in the past.
93Turning to the criminal record of the offender, it is noteworthy that it began with him being charged in January 1993 with possession of a prohibited drug when he was aged 21 years, over 20 years ago. In December 1994 he was sentenced for one count of armed robbery (with another charge taken into account on a Form 1) in the District Court of New South Wales at Parramatta. He was placed on a three year good behaviour bond, and it is noteworthy that he was also ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment. In March 1996, he was again convicted of two counts of possessing a prohibited drug and fined. Yet again, in October 1996, he was convicted of possessing a prohibited drug. In May 2001, he was fined for possessing a prohibited drug and cultivating a prohibited plant. On the same occasion, for the offence of possessing a pistol, he received a suspended sentence of 12 months. Again, one of the conditions of that sentence was that he subject himself to drug and alcohol counselling.
94In February 2003, the offender was charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. Although the facts as found by the sentencing judge were not placed before me, I am prepared to infer from the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal with regard to an unsuccessful appeal against conviction that they were as follows. 
95The offender and his partner Marie confronted a woman in a Central Coast car park.  The offender struck the woman to the head with a motor vehicle ""club lock"" a number of times with great force. The background and motivation of that offence is unclear. Nor is it clear whether the offender was intoxicated at the time. As one would expect, the injuries to the victim were severe: according to the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, she described her injuries as being that the whole left side of her face was ""totally smashed in"". 
96For that offence, the offender was sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for seven years six months with a non-parole period of four years six months. No doubt, that reflected the period of incarceration about which his father gave evidence before me. 
97On release, the offender was dealt with for contravening an apprehended violence order in 2010, and fined. In 2011, he was convicted without penalty for possessing prohibited drugs again, and having custody of a knife in a public place. On the same occasion he was sentenced to imprisonment for possessing an offensive implement, though on appeal the sentence was markedly shortened. 
98In November 2011 he was imprisoned again for two charges of having a knife in public. He was also placed on bonds for driving while disqualified, dealing with the proceeds of crime, and possessing identity information in order to commit an indictable offence. Those bonds commenced on 19 November 2011, and the longest of them would have expired on 18 November 2014. It is a matter of serious aggravation that, far from being of good behaviour, the offender breached that bond by committing the most serious offence known to law.
99In short, the criminal record of the offender confirms that he has had a very longstanding problem with prohibited drugs. It also shows that he has previously been imprisoned for a lengthy period for an offence of wanton violence against a defenceless woman.  That must disentitle him to any leniency with regard to this murder of another defenceless woman. It also raises a real question about his prospects of refraining from such behaviour in the future. I shall return to that general topic in more detail shortly.
100The third and final source of evidence about the offender is the report of Dr Antonella Ventura, a psychiatrist, of 16 July 2014. I have borne in mind the respectful reminder of the Crown Prosecutor that matters in mitigation that appear in such reports, unsupported by sworn evidence, should be approached with considerable caution: see R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353. I have approached the document carefully; still and all, I am in the main prepared to accept its contents on the balance of probabilities.
101The offender commenced using cannabis at the age of 12. He quickly went on to abuse alcohol, amphetamines, LSD, and cocaine. By the age of 23 he was using heroin.  Abuse of prohibited drugs has been a constant theme in his life. At time of the offences, his drug of ""choice"" was amphetamines. 
102To his credit, he has tried to do something about his dependence in the past: he has attended at more than one residential rehabilitation centre, and it will be recalled that Mr Hoare had been his mentor at some stage prior to the offences.  Regrettably, those efforts culminated in the complete failure to deal with the issue that led to him committing this murder. 
103The offender experienced learning problems at school and was unable to keep up academically. He left school in year 10, and has worked mostly as a labourer. He was last employed in 2010.
104He reported a childhood marred not only by physical abuse by his brother but also by witnessing the sexual abuse of his sister by the same sibling. I am prepared to accept the former on the balance of probabilities; in light of the absence of any sworn evidence in support of the latter, I do not act upon it.
105As for the offence, the offender told the psychiatrist that he had no memory of it, or of disposing of the body, or of being arrested.  Indeed, his first clear memory is coming to his senses in a prison in Sydney. The last thing he remembers before that is taking some prohibited drugs that he believed to be ""synthetic coke"". After that he suffered some extremely distressing hallucinations, which included believing that he was trapped in a ""pit of snakes"".
106Having reflected on those assertions, in light of the plethora of evidence of the very heavy use of prohibited drugs by the offender before and after the murder, I am prepared to accept on the balance of probabilities that he has no memory of it. That finding does not mean, of course, that the offender is to be excused in the slightest for what he has done.  Nor would that amnesia prohibit him from having, at the least, accepted responsibility for his actions, a step that he has been unwilling or unable to take. 
107The psychiatrist diagnosed the offender with ""stimulant use disorder"". I accept that diagnosis.  I am quite satisfied on the balance of probabilities that this man has been abusing prohibited drugs for three decades, and that his life and behaviour have been distorted as a result.   
108The psychiatrist also raised the possibility of a ""major or mild neurocognitive disorder"" that could be ""periodically affecting his level of consciousness and memory"".  That possible thesis was founded upon various parts of the history that the offender gave the psychiatrist, including a number of head injuries leading to loss of consciousness, seizures as a child, learning difficulties, and alcohol induced blackouts.  It was also founded on the possibility that the amnesia of the offender and his presentation to police when arrested was suggestive of such a disorder.
109I accept that that is a bare possibility. However, I consider that it is much more likely that the presentation of the offender to the police was the result of his ingestion of very large quantities of prohibited drugs. I also think that his amnesia is the result of the same actions.  His father gave no evidence to support such a theory, directly or indirectly.  In light of the absence of firm evidence supporting it, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time of the offences the offender suffered from any disorder other than his chronic dependence on prohibited drugs.
Prospects of rehabilitation
110It will be many years before the offender is at liberty again. By that stage he will not be a young man. He will have had a very substantial period in custody to try to address the problem with prohibited drugs that has marred his life.  He will also have had time to reflect upon the fresh start that he could make upon his release.
111It is not clear on the evidence whether he will have contact with his partner and children, or indeed whether that romantic relationship is continuing. I infer from the fact that his father was prepared to endure the painful process of giving evidence in his son's proceedings on sentence for murder that he will support his son as best he can in the years ahead.
112It is certainly true that the offender has demonstrated a disturbing tendency to the infliction of serious violence, culminating in a brutal murder. It is also true that the offender will require a great deal of assistance upon his release to reintegrate successfully into society. Nevertheless, if the offender is able to obtain help with regard to his dependence upon prohibited drugs, and if he is able to abstain from them when he is released, I possess a guarded optimism about his prospects for rehabilitation at the end of his minimum term of imprisonment.
Various matters 
113I turn to deal briefly with a number of separate aspects of my task.
114First, the parties were in agreement that any sentence structure that I impose should commence on the day that the offender came into custody; namely, 15 December 2012. I accept that joint submission.
115Secondly, I do not propose mechanistically to state the aggravating and mitigating features that I have taken into account for the purposes of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  These remarks on sentence fulfil that role.  I have referred to the section, and taken care to avoid double counting. 116Thirdly, defence counsel did not submit that there were special circumstances that would justify a reduction in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and head sentence. Nevertheless, I have considered that question for myself. The offender has been in custody for a substantial period in the past. He is not a young man.  The sentence I impose will include a parole period that is lengthy in any event.  In those circumstances, I do not consider that there are special circumstances that should lead to a variation in the statutory ratio.
117Fourthly, I am required by s 25C of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) to inform the offender that he may be detained even after the complete expiry of his head sentence, if it is considered that he remains a danger to the community.
Aspects of sentence structure
118These two offences of supplying a prohibited drug and murder are very much bound up with each other. The abuse of stimulants played a very large role in the commission of this senseless homicide; it is the possession of those stimulants for supply that founds the drug offence. I think that there should be a substantial degree of concurrence between the two sentences.  I also accept that the seriousness of the drug offence pales into insignificance when it is compared to the seriousness of the murder. 
119Having said that, I consider that a small proportion of the time that the offender is to spend in custody should be solely referable to the drug offence. I shall structure the sentences accordingly. With regard to the drug offence, I shall impose a fixed term that is intended to replicate the head sentence that I would have imposed if the offender were to be sentenced for that offence alone.
120Finally, I shall reduce the non-parole period of the murder sentence to a small degree, in order to maintain a ratio of 75 per cent between the overall non-parole period and the overall head sentence.  As well as that, a few weeks will be shaved off that non-parole period because the law does not concern itself with trifles. 


Victim impact statements
121I was provided with a victim impact statement prepared by the mother of the deceased, Ms Jeanette Reynolds, that spoke as well for the siblings, children and nephews and nieces of the deceased. Pursuant to s 28(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I take the contents of that statement into account in determining the appropriate sentence for the murder of the deceased.
122Michelle Reynolds was a much loved mother, daughter, partner, sister, family member, and friend. Her mother has spoken of her daughter's love for her children and her enjoyment of the simple pleasures of life such as singing with friends and family at karaoke evenings. The deep pain of many is worsened by their inability to understand the motivation for this murder, a question that may never be answered.
123Ms Jeanette Reynolds has spoken of the ""torment"" suffered by the children of the deceased at the loss of their mother. And speaking for herself, she described the loss of her daughter in stark terms: ""the devastation is unbearable"".
124On behalf of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, I extend my condolences to all of those who have loved and lost Michelle Jane Reynolds. The conclusion of the proceedings today may provide some relief to those who are suffering. But I accept that the after-effects of the murder of this young woman will be felt for many decades.
Conclusion
125In short, the offender bashed and thereafter strangled to death a defenceless woman. His intention at the latter time was to kill. Before death the deceased was injured with a chemical.  After death her body was treated with contempt. Although this unplanned and motiveless course of action was caused by the gross intoxication of the offender by prohibited drugs, I do not take that fact into account in mitigation.  At the time, the offender was in possession of prohibited drugs, some of which were to be supplied for profit. The offender has expressed no remorse whatsoever for what he has done. When he committed these offences the offender was subject to conditional liberty imposed by a criminal court. Regrettably, the previous act of brutal violence inflicted upon a defenceless woman that led to him being imprisoned for many years was unable to deflect the offender from progressing to the worst crime known to law. The criminal justice system must respond with a sentence of due severity.
Imposition of sentence
126Wayne Edward Jones, you are convicted of the offence of supplying a prohibited drug. For that offence, I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to date from 15 December 2012 and to expire on 14 June 2014. Because of the sentence structure, there will be no non-parole period. 
127Wayne Edward Jones, you are convicted of the offence of murder. For that offence, I sentence you to a non-parole period of 20 years to date from 15 September 2013 and to expire on 14 September 2033. There will be a parole period of 7 years that expires on 14 September 2040.  The first date upon which you will be eligible for release to parole is 14 September 2033.
128To express my orders another way, the offender is subject to an overall head sentence of imprisonment for 27 years 9 months, with an overall non-parole period of 20 years 9 months.

		31 October 2014",2014-10-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765188,Gaggioli v R [2014] NSWCCA 246,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with Fullerton J.
2FULLERTON J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal sentences imposed in the District Court on 19 July 2013 after pleas of guilty were entered in the Local Court on 23 April 2012 to three counts of aggravated robbery in company, contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  That offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.
3The offences were committed when three persons were robbed at gunpoint.  The property stolen consisted of cash, mobile phones and other electronic devices and credit cards.  The weapon, described in the particulars of each charge as a ""small black handgun"" was a dangerous weapon within the meaning of s 4 of the Crimes Act.  The particulars of each charge also alleged that it was the co-offender (Zarb) who had possession of the weapon.  
4On 19 July 2013 the applicant was sentenced as follows:
Count 1: A non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 27 March 2013 and expiring on 26 March 2016 with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months expiring on 26 September 2018;
Count 2: A non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 27 June 2013 and expiring on 26 June 2016 with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months expiring on 26 December 2018; and
Count 3: A non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 27 September 2013 and expiring on 26 September 2016 with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months expiring on 26 March 2019.
5A total term of imprisonment of 6 years was imposed with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months expiring on 26 September 2016.  A discount of 25 per cent was allowed for the early pleas.  
6The sentencing order reflects the application of the totality principle in that a non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment was imposed for each of the three counts with the sentences on Counts 2 and 3 partially accumulated by three months resulting in a total non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months.  A finding of special circumstances was made based, in part, on the partial accumulation of sentences.
7The applicant relies upon two grounds of appeal:
Ground 1: A justifiable sense of grievance has been engendered by the differential approach the prosecution has taken to the facts tendered in the sentence proceedings of the co-offender. 
Ground 2:  His Honour erred in partially accumulating the sentences on Counts 2 and 3. 
Proceedings and remarks on sentence 
8A statement of facts was tendered by consent.  The Crown also tendered the applicant's criminal history and custodial history together with a pre-sentence report.  The applicant tendered a report of Dr Bruce Westmore, psychiatrist, a report of Ms Anne-Marie De Santa Brigida, psychologist, a report of Mr Jonathon Barker, Salvation Army Bridge Program caseworker, and three character references.
9Since neither of the grounds of appeal concern the applicant's subjective circumstances it is unnecessary to set that evidence out at length.  Suffice to note that his Honour was satisfied that, despite the offences having been committed whilst the applicant was subject to a good behavior bond, there was little likelihood of him reoffending given his relatively limited criminal record and the steps he has taken after his arrest to address his drug addiction.  His Honour was also satisfied that the applicant was genuinely remorseful and that he had excellent prospects of rehabilitation.  
10The facts can be conveniently summarised as follows.
11The applicant and his co-offender (Zarb) followed the three male victims from inside Star City Casino at about 3.30am to their car which was parked in the casino car park.  One of the three men withdrew $1000 in cash from an automatic teller machine in the lobby of the casino en route.  The victims sat inside the vehicle with Mr Tang in the driver's seat, Mr Li in the front passenger seat and Mr Yang in the back seat.  The car doors were closed but not locked. 
12The applicant and Zarb opened the rear passenger door and got into the back seat of the vehicle.  Zarb sat in the middle seat next to Mr Yang.  The applicant sat in the rear seat behind the driver's seat.  Zarb produced a small black handgun which he pointed in the direction of Mr Tang, the driver, and directed him to drive.  Fearful for his safety, he complied.  At different times both offenders said words to the effect, ""Don't do anything stupid and nobody will get hurt"".  Zarb also said, ""Drive quickly, do you want the guy on the back seat to be shot?"".
13As the car approached Pyrmont both the applicant and Zarb demanded the victims surrender their property whilst threatening them with the handgun.  The applicant and Zarb then left but were arrested a few hours later playing poker machines inside the casino.
14Neither the stolen property nor the handgun used in the commission of the offences was recovered.  The victims identified the type of weapon from photographs shown to them by the investigating police.
15The sentencing judge considered the offending was a serious example of robbery with a weapon.  This finding, together with the value of the property stolen, the vulnerability of the victims, the threats that were issued which amounted to a very real threat of violence (although none was used) and the time over which the threats were issued, was sufficient to place it outside the Henry guideline (R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346).  That finding was not the subject of challenge.
The sentence proceedings of the co-offender Zarb
16On 26 March 2013 Zarb was committed to stand trial on the same counts of armed robbery to which the applicant pleaded guilty and for which he was sentenced in July 2013. 
17On 3 September 2013 (the first day of trial) the Crown presented an indictment which, in addition to the three counts of armed robbery under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act, included three alternative counts laid pursuant to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, in which robbery armed with an offensive weapon was alleged, the weapon being particularised as ""an object that looked like a pistol"".  That offence attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.  
18Zarb pleaded guilty to each of the alternative counts which were accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment.  Given the lateness of the pleas, his sentence was reduced by 10 per cent.  
19Zarb was sentenced on 29 November 2013 to a total term of 5 years and 4 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months, a sentence which was eight months less than the applicant's head sentence.  His non-parole period was three months less than that imposed on the applicant.
20Despite the desirability of co-offenders being sentenced by the same sentencing judge, the sentencing judge who sentenced Zarb was provided with the remarks on the applicant's sentence and, as her Honour's remarks on sentence make clear, she took considerable pains to ensure that the principle of parity was observed when sentencing Zarb.  
21Importantly, her Honour noted that the facts upon which the applicant was sentenced differed from the facts tendered in the sentencing proceedings before her.  In particular, she noted that it was not alleged that Zarb produced a handgun which he used repeatedly to threaten the victims in the course of the robbery - the factual basis upon which the applicant was sentenced.  That said, since it is clear, even on the applicant's case, that he and Zarb were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise to rob the victims, as her Honour rightly pointed out, it is of little consequence who was in physical possession of a weapon or, for that matter, who issued the verbal threats.
22Her Honour noted:
""The evidence before this Court from Mr Zarb is that he knew his co-offender [this applicant] had an item but did not see it before it was produced in the car, but he was aware there was an item that the co-offender had and was going to use.  Therefore this offender knew that the victims would have been aware that there was an item that looked like a pistol that was going to be used and used in a threatening manner.  Whether it was this offender who used the item or the co-offender who used the item in the circumstance of this case is of little consequence in my view.  This was a joint criminal enterprise.  Both offenders decided to rob these three victims at approximately the same time, and they acted in concert getting into the back of the car at the same time, with one of them producing a weapon.""
23Significantly, her Honour also noted that although the applicant pleaded guilty, therefore attracting a discount on sentence of 25 per cent, he was charged with an offence carrying a greater maximum penalty.  In addition, he was on a good behaviour bond at the time of the offending for what her Honour described as ""some intimidation-type offences in the Local Court"", an aggravating feature of the offending which would of itself attract a higher sentence. 
24Her Honour otherwise regarded the subjective circumstances of the applicant and Zarb as relevantly similar for sentencing purposes. 
Ground 1: Whether there has been a miscarriage of justice in that the prosecution changed the characterisation of the weapon and its possession in the sentencing proceedings of the applicant's co-offender engendering a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant.
25The principle of parity derives from the fundamental norm of equal justice.  In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [28] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, their Honours said of equal justice:
""... It requires, so far as the law permits, that like cases be treated alike. Equal justice according to law also requires, where the law permits, differential treatment of persons according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of the law. As Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 608, [65]:
Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect."" 
26In considering whether the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance it is necessary to have regard to what was done by both offenders in the course of the joint criminal enterprise to rob the victims, and the offences to which they pleaded guilty, as well as the factual findings made by the sentencing judges in each case. 
27It is well recognised that sentences imposed on co-offenders may be based upon different factual findings if the evidence tendered before either the same or different sentencing judges differs (see Baquiran v R [2014] NSWCCA 221 referring to R v Chandler; Chandler v R [2012] NSWCCA 135 per Basten JA at [6], referred to with approval in Ith v R [2013] NSWCCA 280 at [61]).  The Crown submitted that the difference between the applicant's sentence and that of Zarb (marginal though it is) is justified by the differing factual findings as to who was armed and with what weapon and, in the case of this applicant, that he was on a conditional bond at the time of committing the robberies.
28The applicant does not submit that the judge who sentenced Zarb proceeded on a wrong principle or that she failed to apply parity principles.  Rather, it was submitted that what her Honour identified as the difference in the criminal culpability of the applicant and his co-offender was the result of what counsel submitted was an arbitrary selection of different charges by the Crown which has been productive of unfairness to the applicant.
29Senior counsel for the applicant accepted that the discretion in the prosecution to determine the charges to be preferred against an offender or offenders is not susceptible to judicial review.  He submitted, however, that does not operate to exclude or even limit the operation of the parity principle and that when the principle of equal justice is applied in this case, wholly identical sentences should result, despite the difference in the maximum penalty between the two offences.  In support of that submission particular emphasis was placed upon a passage from the decision in Green at [30]: 
""In Lowe v The Queen and in Postiglione v the Queen, this Court was concerned with the application of the parity principle to persons charged with the same offences arising out of the same criminal conduct or enterprise.  Those decisions are not authority for the proposition that the principle applies only to persons so charged.  The foundation of the parity principle in the norm of equality before the law requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form.  Formal identity of charges against the offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application.  Nevertheless, as Campbell JA recognised in Jimmy v The Queen, there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes.  The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant.  The existence of those difficulties may be accepted. So too may the inability of a court of criminal appeal to undertake, under the parity rubric, a de facto review of prosecutorial charging discretions.  Those practical difficulties and limitations, however, do not exclude the operation of the parity principle.  The effect given to it may vary according to the circumstances of the case, including differences between the offences with which co-offenders are charged.""
30In Chandler a similar argument to that advanced on this appeal was considered but not decided.  The Court (Hoeben JA, with whom Bathurst CJ, Basten JA (with additional observations), McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J agreed) was of the view that application of the parity principle did not arise given the differences in the respective cases of the applicant and his co-offenders and, for that reason, it was not an appropriate case in which to consider the question whether it is open to this Court to examine the prosecutorial discretion in order to determine whether a legitimate sense of grievance has been made out. 
31That question has since been the subject of further consideration in Ivory v R [2014] NSWCCA 181 by Bellew J at [60] (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Adamson J agreed).  In that case a refinement of the argument that was advanced in Chandler and on this appeal included the submission that the choice of charges, and the fact that the Crown did not take steps to have the co-offenders sentenced by the same sentencing judge, was an abuse of process being for an improper purpose.  That argument was unsupported by evidence and rejected.  
32Consideration was then given to the underlying proposition that is open to this Court to examine the exercise of prosecutorial discretion where a parity ground is pressed.  As to that issue, Bellew J said:
""[61] Firstly, and contrary to the submissions made by counsel for the applicant, no part of the judgment of the High Court in Green (supra at [30]) is authority for the proposition that after a person is sentenced this Court is able to go behind, and examine, the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. In Green, their Honours recognised the practical difficulties, in terms of the application of parity principles, which can arise when a comparison is sought to be drawn between the sentences imposed on co-offenders who are charged with different offences. Their Honours did not make any reference at all to the issue of prosecutorial discretion. Nothing in the judgment suggests, even remotely, that the approach which was urged on this Court is open. 
[62] Secondly, the fact that such an approach is not open to this Court is evident from the more recent decision in Elias v R; Issa v R [2013] HCA 31; (2013) 248 CLR 483 where the High Court (French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ) said (at [30], citations omitted):""Parity is concerned with the equal treatment of co-offenders. As Green v R explains, the principle is not confined to co-offenders in the strict sense. It has application in the sentencing of persons involved in the same criminal enterprise. The norm of equality discussed in Green v R is not disturbed by sentencing an offender for the offence for which he or she has been convicted and not by reference to a different, less serious, offence which the court considers to be more appropriate to the offending conduct.""
[63] The Court then said (at [35]):""Prosecutors are subject to a duty of fairness in the exercise of their important public functions. In the unlikely event that the discretion to prosecute a particular charge (or at all) was exercised for some improper purpose, the Court has the power to relieve against the resulting abuse of process. The time for debate as to any claimed abuse arising out of the selection of the charge is before the entry of a plea. After an offender has been convicted of an offence it risks compromising the impartiality and independence of the court to require that it sentenced by reference to an offence of which the offender has not been convicted but which it considers the prosecution should have charged"".
[64] In the present case, no issue was raised by the applicant at the time of being sentenced about the Crown's decision to charge him with an offence contrary to s. 33(1)(a). The approach now urged on this Court on behalf of the applicant would clearly run the risk of compromising the impartiality and independence to which the High Court referred in Elias. It should be noted that in the course of oral argument counsel for the applicant was invited to refer the Court to any authority which supported the approach which was being advanced. No authority was provided.""
33Although in this case it was not submitted that the prosecutor had acted for any improper purpose in the decision to prosecute Zarb for a less serious offence, in my view the underlying principle that the prosecutorial discretion is unreviewable is the same.
34In Magaming v The Queen [2013] HCA 40; 302 ALR 461 at [68] Gageler J noted that it is undesirable for there to be close curial involvement in prosecutorial processes since the courts are a forum where criminal judgment is administered.  Such processes necessarily incorporate a decision as to whether a particular charge is to be laid, and in some circumstances whether a particular charge, having been laid, is to be proceeded with.  His Honour went on to say:
""...The main reason generally given is that the court's review of such an exercise of prosecutorial discretion would compromise the impartiality of the judicial process by involving a court in an inquiry into a forensic choice made by a participant in a controversy actually or potentially before the court.  A complementary reason often given is that a court's control over its own hearing and determination of whatever charge might in fact be laid and proceeded with in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion means that ""the court has other powers to ensure that a person charged with a crime is fairly dealt with"".""
35In any event, as the Crown submitted, any suggestion that an unfairness has been perpetrated as a result of the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion in this case is not borne out.  Significantly, the applicant admitted to a robbery with the use of a dangerous weapon while his co-offender did not, as was his entitlement.  In circumstances where the weapon was never recovered, the Crown case against the co-offender for the charge under s 97(1) would have relied, exclusively, on the description of the weapon by the three victims.  In the assessment of the prosecutor, this may well have been an inadequate basis upon which to prove that it was a prohibited weapon as defined, an essential element of the charge which the Crown was obliged to prove beyond reasonable doubt.  That being so, to include on the indictment to be presented at the trial of the co-offender an alternative charge under s 97(2) for each of the three armed robbery charges, and to accept pleas of guilty to the alternative counts in full discharge of the indictment, could not be the subject of any criticism.
36Further, I am well satisfied that the differences between the sentences, measured in months, is not only entirely explicable having regard to the different maximum penalties and the different facts with which both sentencing courts were concerned but that disparity is neither ""marked"", ""gross"" nor ""glaring"" such as might warrant intervention and correction by this Court (see Tan v R [2014] NSWCCA 96 at [39]).
37I would dismiss the first ground of appeal.
Ground 2:  His Honour erred in accumulating sentences on charges 2 and 3.
38The authorities recognise a wide sentencing discretion in the decision to accumulate sentences, in whole or in part, or to direct that sentences be served concurrently (see R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; 195 A Crim R 38).  Those considerations are determined by reference to the totality principle which requires a sentencing judge to consider whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of all other offences.  It is not infrequently the case that concurrent sentences will be imposed for offences rising out of the same criminal enterprise although that is not a necessary result.  In this case although the three counts of armed robbery were committed as part of the one course of criminality, extending from the time the offenders took the victims under siege in their car until the time of their release, each of the three victims was robbed and each surrendered their property under the threat of violence.  In those circumstances it was open to the sentencing judge in the exercise of the discretion to partially accumulate the sentences on Counts 2 and 3, consistent with the approach of this Court in Vaovasa v R [2007] NSWCCA 253; 174 A Crim R 16 in analogous circumstances, a judgment to which his Honour made express reference. 
39I would reject the second ground of appeal.
Orders
40Accordingly, the orders I propose are:(1)Leave to appeal granted.(2)Appeal dismissed.41ADAMSON J:  I agree with Fullerton J.

2765194,Craig v R [2014] NSWCCA 243,"Judgment
1LEEMING JA:  I agree with Fullerton J.
2FULLERTON J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal sentences imposed in the District Court on 9 September 2013 after pleas of guilty were entered on 28 August 2013 to two counts of threatening injury to a person with the intention of preventing the applicant's lawful apprehension contrary to s 33B(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  Against a maximum penalty of 12 years imprisonment an aggregate sentence of 6 years and 9 months was imposed with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months.  The person threatened in each count was a child.  The applicant was the father of both children. 
3In the same sentence proceeding the applicant also pleaded guilty to entering inclosed lands contrary to s 4(1)(b) of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 (NSW).  The maximum penalty for that offence is equivalent to 5 penalty units, that is a monetary penalty of $550.  A fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months, to be served concurrently with the aggregate sentence, was imposed for that offence.  
4On 15 October 2013 the sentence imposed on the charge brought under the Inclosed Lands Protection Act was corrected and, in substitution for the fixed term of imprisonment, the matter was dealt with pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). 
5Although the record of the proceedings on that date did not form part of the appeal papers, on the hearing of the appeal it was not suggested that her Honour's exercise of the jurisdiction under s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was not available. 
6In imposing the aggregate sentence the sentencing judge indicated that after applying a discount of 15 per cent for the pleas of guilty she would have imposed terms of imprisonment of 6 years for each offence.  The aggregate term of 6 years and 9 months reflects a notional accumulation of nine months.
7The non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months was appointed after a finding of special circumstances under s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act on two distinct bases: first, the notional accumulation inherent in the aggregate sentence and, second, the need for the applicant to have an extended period of supervision and assistance upon his release from custody with a view to consolidating his adherence to the treatment regime to be administered by Justice Health whilst he was a serving prisoner and to assist him in dealing with what her Honour described as his ""long-standing psychological issues"".  
The grounds of appeal
8The applicant's filed grounds of appeal included a complaint that her Honour erred in imposing a sentence in excess of the maximum penalty provided for in s 4(1)(b) of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act.  That ground was not pressed on the hearing of the appeal.  The sole ground of appeal was directed to the aggregate sentence, it being contended on the applicant's behalf that it was manifestly excessive.   
9Counsel did however advance the submission that the weight the sentencing judge must have given to the fact that the offences were committed in a place to which the applicant had no right of entry, as evidenced by her Honour imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for that conduct (albeit erroneously), supported the submission that she must have afforded weight to that feature of the applicant's conduct in threatening injury to his children and that an unjust and plainly unreasonable aggregate sentence has resulted (see Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321).
10That analysis is flawed in a number of respects.  Even were her Honour to have had regard to that feature of the applicant's conduct when sentencing for the s 33B(1)(b) offences (that is, that he threatened injury to his children in a place to which he had no right or entitlement to enter), she was obliged to deal with the offence laid under the Inclosed Lands Protection Act as part of the sentencing exercise.  It simply does not follow that because she treated the breach of s 4(1)(b) of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act as serious enough to warrant a fixed term of imprisonment that her Honour has inflated the objective seriousness of the conduct the subject of the s 33B(1)(b) offences and, in that way, imposed an aggregate sentence that is manifestly excessive.  As I read her Honour's sentencing reasons, the opposite is the case.  By imposing a discrete period of imprisonment (albeit in excess of jurisdiction) for the breach of s 4(1)(b) of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act she may be taken to have excluded that fact from her assessment of the sentence to be imposed on the related and much more serious offending against s 33B. 
The evidence on sentence
11The applicant was sentenced referable to a detailed set of agreed facts from which the following summary is drawn. 
12The two children the applicant threatened with injury were aged, respectively, three years and seventeen months.  At the time of the offending the children were in the care and custody of their maternal grandmother by order of the Family Court.  The applicant seized the children from their grandmother's home against her protestations, taking his infant son in his arms and commanding his young daughter to walk beside him.  As the sentencing judge described it, he then ""walked off with them into the night and through the town and scrubland"". 
13When police ultimately located the applicant in bushland he held a set of bladed scissors to the throats of his children threatening to stab them.  A stand-off between the police and the applicant persisted over some time with the applicant maintaining his entitlement to have his children with him.  At one stage he said to police, ""I'll finish them off if you come any closer"". 
14Ultimately, in negotiation with a senior police officer, the applicant agreed to submit to arrest after surrendering the children and relinquishing the scissors.  He told police that it was not his intention to hurt his children.
15Her Honour regarded the applicant's threats to harm his children, accompanied by the obvious risk of harm to them given that bladed scissors were being applied to their throats over a sustained period of time during which he was verbally and physically aggressive to police, as amounting to grave offending against the section, despite her Honour accepting that the applicant did not wish to hurt his children.   
16On the appeal it was submitted that her Honour had failed to preserve the distinction created by the breadth of the statutory language of a charge brought under s 33B between the actual use of harm by means of an offensive weapon in s 33B(1)(a) and the threatened use of harm in s 33B(1)(b).  Counsel also submitted that in this case the children were not at any risk of being harmed.  That submission is not only against the weight of the evidence, but ignores the fact that although the charges were laid under s 33B(1)(b), her Honour was entitled to take the risk of harm to the children into account in the assessment of objective seriousness of that offending. 
17Her Honour noted that although there was no evidence that any psychological harm the children suffered was substantial, such as to amount to an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the volatility of the situation created by the applicant must have frightened them.  That finding is not under challenge.  
18In the appointment of an appropriate sentence her Honour also had regard to the applicant's personal history and circumstances and his mental health, both at the time of the offending and at the time of sentence.
19In proof of those matters the applicant relied principally upon a report of Dr Patfield, a psychiatrist with Justice Health, dated 16 August 2012.  The applicant also gave evidence and was supported by close family members.
20Her Honour referred to Dr Patfield's report in summarising the applicant's personal history, his various encounters with the criminal justice system since his early teen years and with various mental health practitioners at regular intervals thereafter, both in community and custodial settings.  The most serious entry on the applicant's antecedent criminal record was a conviction as a juvenile in 1991 for murder, kidnapping and the use of an offensive weapon with intent to prevent his lawful apprehension.  As her Honour observed, there were disturbing similarities between the facts and circumstances of that offending and the matters for which he was to be sentenced.  
21It was not suggested on the appeal that her Honour referred to the applicant's prior criminal record otherwise than for the legitimate purpose of informing the issue of future dangerousness and in order to determine whether, and to what extent, any leniency could be extended to the applicant (see Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 477).  In particular, it was not submitted that the aggregate sentence was erroneously inflated because of the applicant's criminal record generally, or because of the prior offending of a similar kind or, more accurately, offences committed in a similar context.
22The issue of future dangerousness was a consideration which had particular currency in the sentencing process in light of the applicant's psychiatric ill health at the time of the offending, and an assessment in July 2013 (twelve months later) that he remained at a moderate risk of reoffending, in both a violent and non-violent manner, despite attending regular psychological therapy and being compliant with medication as a remand prisoner, a risk that was considered likely to increase to a moderate to high risk of reoffending if the applicant refused therapy or was not compliant with his medication. 
23Her Honour also noted an order made pursuant to s 55(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) in April 2011 under which the applicant was transferred to the Long Bay prison hospital as a remand prisoner awaiting trial on a charge of sexual assault (for which he was later acquitted at trial).  The Justice Health file records a diagnosis by a resident psychiatrist of ""pathological jealousy secondary to psychosis"" with the applicant at that time in an acute phase of ""a schizo-affective disorder"".  Throughout the period of that remand and his most recent remand following his arrest on the subject charges (within months of his release in March 2012 following his acquittal) the applicant was maintained on medication specific to that diagnosis.
24On his release from custody, the applicant was self-medicated on a range of psychotropic medications although his intake was irregular.  Her Honour accepted that over time some symptoms of his underlying psychiatric disorder resurfaced which were compounded by what she described as his ""heightened emotional state"" on the day of the offending, overlaid with stress, depression and his intoxication.  Her Honour accepted that this explained, at least in part, his offending conduct towards his children and, although his mental state served to reduce his moral culpability to some extent, a non-custodial penalty was not a sentencing option.  
25Dr Patfield consulted with the applicant within days of his arrest at which time he returned a diagnosis of ""chronic psychosis, possibly schizophrenia"".  He also noted that the applicant was generally compliant and responsive to treatment but that he found it easier to engage with mental health services (as I understand, both in the community and under the auspices of Justice Health) than coping on his own.  Her Honour accepted that the applicant was developing insight into his mental illness and recognising the need to maintain treatment to address it and to seek treatment once released from custody if he was to be successful in his wish not to reoffend.  She also accepted that by the time of sentence the applicant had accepted full responsibility for his actions.  That said, her Honour expressed a most guarded view as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation which she regarded as contingent on his willingness to submit to treatment and to adhere to it once released from custody.  She noted that in the past the applicant had neither the insight nor the opportunity to obtain long-term treatment for his psychiatric condition or counselling to address the abuse he suffered as a child. 
26It was not submitted on the appeal that in determining an appropriate sentence her Honour dealt with the evidence bearing upon the applicant's mental health other than as consistent with established sentencing principles (see Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 205 A Crim R 1).
27Finally, her Honour referred in terms to the purposes of sentence in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  When considering the need for general deterrence to be reflected in the sentence imposed, she accepted that a degree of moderation was required by reason of the applicant's mental health.  However, she remained of the firm view that personal deterrence also needed to be reflected in the sentence as did the need to protect the community and promote the applicant's rehabilitation which would also be ultimately in the community's interests.  None of these findings were the subject of challenge on the appeal.  The consideration given by her Honour to these matters was also entirely consonant with settled authority.   
28I am not persuaded that the sentencing discretion has been shown to have miscarried or that the aggregate sentence exceeded a legitimate sentencing discretion.

Â 

1On 4 April 2014, Mr Falah Alkanaan was arraigned on an Indictment which contained three counts to each of which he pleaded not guilty.

Â 

2His co-accused, Mr Ben Toleafoa, was also arraigned on the same day with respect to one count (Count 2) on the same Indictment. He also pleaded not guilty.

Â 

3On 2 May 2014, the trial of the charges was fixed to take place on 16 February 2015, for an estimated period of five weeks.

Â 

4On 25 July 2014, Mr Alkanaan filed a Notice of Motion in which he sought an order pursuant to s 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 severing Counts 3 and 4 on the Indictment, and an order that Counts 3 and 4 be tried separately from the other counts.

Â 

5Mr Toleafoa did not join in that application, and made no submission with respect to it.

Â 

6For the reasons which follow, the application should be dismissed.

Â 

The Indictment

Â 

7The Indictment charges Mr Alkanaan with three offences. They are:

Â 

(1)On 2 February 2013, at Blackett in the State of New South Wales, did murder Hussein Khanafer.

Â

Â 

(4)Between 8 February 2013 and 7 March 2013, at Silverwater and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales, did conspire with Peta Dawson and Arna-Maree McMiles to induce a person to be called as a witness in a judicial proceedings, namely Joshua Nuualiitia, to give false evidence.

Â 

Crown Case Statement

Â 

8At the time the applicant was arraigned, the Crown filed a Crown Case Statement. It was to the following effect:

Â 

""1 The victim, Hussein Khanafer (""Khanafer""), and the accused, Falah Alkanaan, were well known to each other. Khanafer was attempting to obtain money from Alkanaan. On 2 February, 2013, Khanafer sent a text message to Alkanaan in which he said, ""Good morning, cuz. I need my today $4500"".

2 At about 12.30pm on 2 February, 2013, Khanafer drove with his wife Kelly Khanafer, to Alkanaan's home at 20 Boldrewood Road, Blackett, in their white Nissan Tiida car. They parked in the street in front of this address. Whist Kelly Khanafer remained in the car, Khanafer walked to Alkanaan's front door. He and Khanafer had a conversation on the front verandah.

3 Alkanaan's vehicle, a bronze coloured Jeep, was parked in his driveway, and at one point during this meeting Alkanaan stood close by this vehicle.

4. At 12.41pm a call was made from a mobile phone belonging to Alkanaan to a mobile phone used by co-accused, Ben Toleafoa.

5 At about 1.10pm, Khanafer walked back to the street as a silver Ford Falcon BS-72-NS driven by Toleafoa arrived and parked behind Khanafer's car. Khanafer approached this vehicle and spoke through the driver's window with Toleafoa.

6 At this moment, Alkanaan walked from his front yard with a shotgun. From a distance of about one metre he shot Khanafer once in the head as Khanafer was standing by Toleafoa's vehicle. Khanafer fell to the roadway.

7. Kelly Khanafer was still sitting in Khanafer's car. She ran to Khanafer and tried to help him as she called out for assistance.

8 Alkanaan got into the silver Falcon, which was driven from the scene at speed by Toleafoa, leaving Boldrewood Road in the direction of Carlisle Avenue. The vehicle stopped over a small causeway in Carlisle Avenue. The front seat passenger (Alkanaan) got out, carrying an object. He squatted near a drain.

9 Police who were at the scene a short time later searched this drain, finding in it a double-barrelled 12 gauge shotgun and a spent 12 gauge shotgun cartridge.

10. Ambulance and medical personnel attended the scene. Attempts to revive Khanafer were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead a short time later. 

11. On 8 February, 2013, Alkanaan was arrested at Domestic Terminal, Sydney Airport, where he was attempting to board a flight to Darwin, posing as Joshua Nuualiitia. He was carrying identification documents belonging to Joshua Nuualiitia, and wearing plain glass spectacles as a disguise.

12. Alkanaan was interviewed by police. He told police he had been inside his home after speaking outside with Khanafer, when he had heard a shot and had run to the front door. He had seen a silver Ford Falcon behind the white Nissan car and had seen Khanafer fall to the roadway. He had then heard a second shot, at which point he had run through the house and away through the backyard as he believed that he himself was in danger. He declined to name the person or persons in the silver Falcon, giving as his reason that he feared reprisals if he did so.

13. Forensic examination of the shotgun and cartridge retrieved from the drain indicated the presence of the DNA of both Alkanaan and Khanafer on the shotgun; and that of Alkanaan on the cartridge.

14. Telephone calls were intercepted in the period between the shooting and the arrest of Alkanaan. On 7 February 2013 in an intercepted call with his girlfriend, Arna-Maree McMiles, the accused said, ""I've still got it if anybody asks... the one the coppers got, it's not mine...I got it okay...it's silver and wood and yeah. The name of it - double barrel shotgun... Remember, I only took two from you...the bullets, the bullets"".

15. On 13 March 2013 police searched the accused's Jeep. Secreted behind the glove box were two 12 gauge shotgun shells.

16. In a telephone conversation with McMiles on 8 February, Alkanaan was told by McMiles that she had found a white t-shirt that ""needed to be soaked as it had black stuff on it"". He asked her, ""Is there brains on the t-shirt or not?"".

17. In a telephone conversation from gaol on 1 March 2013 with Peta Dawson, the mother of McMiles, the accused said, ""Fuck my mate, tell him I killed him and I'm gonna kill him as well..."". In another such call on the same day, Alkanaan told McMiles that, ""Ben is my man honestly ... he didn't say nothing did he?"".

...

20. Text messages passed between mobile phones used by Alkanaan and Toleafoa in the 24 hour period before the shooting. 29 minutes before the shooting Toleafoa received a 23 second telephone call from Alkanaan.

21. On 28 May 2013 a conversation of Toleafoa, his girlfriend and her sister was recorded on a listening device. Toleafoa said, ""I was there but I didn't get out of the car...I was talking to the guy, I was like 'don't worry about it, man...everything will be fixed'...and that's when he walked out. I didn't know why he was walking out...he just goes, 'aw, you don't have the balls'. He said, 'yes, I do'...then he straight... he fired the first shot... I turned back and he jumped in the car... and then I went like up three houses and I said 'jump out' and he jumped out and he went down to the alley way"".

22. ...

23. Following the arrest of Alkanaan, his telephone calls from prison were monitored. A surveillance (listening) device was also employed by police to monitor visits he received in prison from his partner, Arna-Maree McMiles, and her mother, Peta Dawson.""

Â 

9Together with the submissions which were filed on the hearing of the Motion, the Crown also filed a Statement of Facts which outlined, in greater detail, the events upon which the Crown relies with respect to Counts 3 and 4 on the Indictment, namely the two conspiracy counts.

Â 

10It is apparent that the Crown alleges that on 21 February 2013, at about 10.20am, the applicant, Mr Alkanaan, and his two co-accused, McMiles, and Dawson, met at the Silverwater Jail. This meeting was intercepted using a lawfully obtained listening device. During that meeting an agreement was formed between the three parties to conspire to induce witnesses to withhold true evidence and to give false evidence.

Â 

11The Crown's case is that this conspiracy had two parts. The first agreement was to put pressure on Kelly Khanafer to withdraw or change her evidence in relation to seeing Alkanaan shooting the deceased, Hussein Khanafer. The second agreement alleged by the Crown was to fabricate evidence surrounding how Alkanaan took possession of Joshua Nuualiitia's identification. The evidence with respect to each of these counts consists largely, but not entirely, of recordings of conversations between all of the conspirators, and observations of the nature of the two co-conspirators.

Â 

12These conversations happened a number of times and on different days. The substance of the first agreement was that Mr Alkanaan's two co-conspirators would make contact with a mutual associate, Mr Paul Demarco, and they would persuade him to speak to Kelly Khanafer and get her to alter her evidence. With respect to the second agreement, the Crown's case in summary is that an agreement was made to speak with Nuualiitia to tell him to tell the police that he had lost his wallet at McDonald's in St Marys, and to hide the true circumstances of how Alkanaan came into possession of the wallet.

Â 

Submissions of the Applicant

Â 

13The applicant's submissions were contained in writing and were also delivered orally. In submissions, the applicant commenced by acknowledging, and accepting, that the evidence which would be led by the Crown in support of Counts 3 and 4 on the Indictment, would be relevant and admissible in a trial of the count of murder on the Indictment.

Â 

14When asked to describe the issues in the trial, in the sense of the basis of his present understanding of what those issues were likely to be, counsel for the applicant indicated that there were two, both of which were directed to the issue of the requisite mental element for the commission of the offence.

Â 

15Counsel submitted that, subject to the receipt of further evidence, it was the applicant's present intention to raise a question of diminished responsibility. As well he indicated, again subject to the receipt of further expert evidence, that it was likely that the applicant would raise the issue of accident, namely, that the shotgun was discharged, unintentionally and by accident, with the consequence that the applicant would not be guilty of the murder of Mr Khanaafer.

Â 

16The applicant submitted that the addition on the Indictment of the two conspiracy counts to the count of murder ""... overloads and complicates the Indictment"". He submitted that the charge of murder was utterly disparate from the charges of conspiracy, and that the Indictment was overloaded, thereby:

Â 

""... potentially creating oppression, unfairness, confusion in the minds of the jury and an unmanageable trial"".

Â 

17In oral submissions, counsel for the applicant put that the inclusion of the additional conspiracy charges on the Indictment ""... removed the focus"" from the principal count on the Indictment, being the charge of murder.

Â 

18He also submitted that inclusion of the three counts would lead to the accused being embarrassed in his defence. In support of this submission, attention was drawn to the complexity of directions which would need to given by the trial Judge to the jury with respect to the two conspiracy charges which, it was submitted, added to the complexity of the overall trial.

Â 

19In support of this submission, the applicant pointed to the fact that the two co-conspirators with respect to the conspiracy charges were not charged jointly with the applicant on the indictment before the Court, but rather that the Crown was proceeding separately against them in the District Court.

Â 

20In summary, counsel for the applicant encapsulated the essence of the basis for the application when he made this submission orally:

Â 

""I concede that the evidence post conduct in relation to the accused is relevant to the mental element of the offence and that evidence will end up before the jury. I can't see how I can stop it. So we will have the evidence but why do we need to have the added complication of the legal elements in relation to conspiracy to clutter, effectively, what should be the focus of the trial namely the criminal responsibility of the accused in relation to Count 1.""

Â 

Submissions of the Crown

Â 

21The Crown opposed the application of Mr Alkanaan, and submitted that the applicant had not demonstrated to the Court that it should form the opinion required by s 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, before the Court would order separate trials of the counts on the Indictment.

Â 

22The Crown submitted that the evidence which it would lead in support of the proof of the conspiracy counts was relevant to, and admissible in, the Crown's case on the murder count. It submitted that such evidence had a high probative value for the jury in the determination of the murder charge. It submitted that the addition of the need for the Court to give directions to the jury with respect to the separate conspiracy charges would not result in any significant additional extension of the trial, nor of any significant complexity for the jury.

Â 

23The Crown accepted that in order for the applicant to be convicted of the conspiracy counts the jury would have to be directed that they needed to be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, of the existence of the conspiracy to induce the witnesses to give false evidence or withhold true evidence. The Crown submitted that in that respect, it would be appropriate for the Court to give a direction to the jury to a similar effect before the jury was permitted to take the evidence supporting Counts 3 and 4 into account as consciousness of guilt evidence with respect to Count 1.

Â 

24The Crown submitted that this would in fact place a higher burden on the Crown, and would be beneficial for, rather than adverse to, the interests of the applicant.

Â 

25The Crown also submitted that it would be necessary for the Court to consider the public interest in not having the applicant tried separately with respect to the conspiracy counts because having a single trial would mean that the evidence would not need to be called twice. In that respect the Crown pointed out that in addition to the recordings of the various conversations which will form one of the bases of the Crown's case, there were a number of other potential police witnesses, and at least one lay witness, who it is intended will give oral evidence about the conduct of the two co-accused, in furtherance of the conspiracy.

Â 

26The Crown pointed to the undesirability, in the public interest, of putting those witnesses through a second trial, and the unnecessary cost and expense to the administration of justice of such a separate trial.

Â 

27The Crown pointed out that, in the context of those witnesses, they were also expected to give evidence at a trial in the District Court with respect to the two co-conspirators, and ultimately if the Court did sever the counts from the Indictment, those witnesses would be giving evidence three times with respect to these events.

Â 

28Shortly put, the Crown submitted that the counts on the Indictment fell within the statement of principle contained in R v Assim [1966] 2 QB 249, which the Crown submitted was approved in McCarthy v Regina (1984) 14 A Crim R 155 at 159, namely:

Â 

""Where, however, the matters which constitute the individual offences of the several offenders are upon the available evidence so related, whether in time or by other factors, that the interests of justice are best served by their being tried together, then they can properly be the subject of counts in the one indictment and can, subject always to the discretion of the court, be tried together.""

Â 

29The Crown submitted that the application did not meet the requisite test in s 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act because the applicant could not demonstrate how he would be prejudiced or embarrassed in his defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence, and further submitted that the applicant had not demonstrated that there was any other reason why it was desirable to have the charges tried separately.

Â 

30The Crown drew attention to the statement of principle in R v Verma (1987) 30 A Crim R 441 at 443 that:

Â 

""... The most straightforward case in which separate trials will not be ordered is whether the evidence admissible on the trial of one charge is in any event admissible on the trial of the other, by way (for example) of similar facts"".

Â 

31It submitted that this case was substantially the same as Verma, and was typically the very type of case where the Court would not order a separate trial of Counts 3 and 4 on the Indictment. 

Â 

Applicable Legislation

Â 

32Section 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act is the applicable legislation. It says:

Â 

""(2) If of the opinion:

Â 

(a)that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or

Â 

(b)that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment,

Â 

the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment.""

Â 

33Both parties accept that the applications are made in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act. It is appropriate that I set out the relevant parts.

Â 

34Part 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act deals with indictments. Section 21 deals with a question of a separate trial. It is in the following terms:

Â 

""21 Orders for amendment of indictment, separate trial and postponement of trial 

Â 

(1) If of the opinion that an indictment is defective but, having regard to the merits of the case, can be amended without injustice, the court may make such order for the amendment of the indictment as it thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of the case. 

(2) If of the opinion: 

(a) that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or 

(b) that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment, 

the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment. 

(3) If of the opinion that the postponement of an accused person's trial is expedient as a consequence of it having amended an indictment or ordered a separate trial of a count, the court may make such order as appears necessary. 

(4) An order under this section may be made either before trial or at any stage during the trial. 

(5) The following provisions apply if an order is made under this section for a separate trial or for the postponement of a trial: 

(a) if the order is made during the trial, the court may order that the jury be discharged from giving a verdict: 

(i) on the count or counts in respect of which the trial is postponed, or 

(ii) on the indictment, 

as the case may be, 

(b) the procedure on the separate trial of a count, and the procedure on the postponed trial, are to be the same in all respects (if the jury has been discharged) as if the trial had not commenced, 

(c) subject to the Bail Act 2013 , the court may commit the accused person to a correctional centre. 

(6) Any power of the court under this section is in addition to and not in derogation of any other power of the court for the same or similar purposes.""

Â 

35Section 21(4) provides that an order under s 21(2) may be made before a trial or at any stage during the trial.

Â 

36Part 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act deals with criminal proceedings generally, and includes s 29 which addresses the hearing of multiple offences. Section 29 is in the following form:

Â 

""29 When more than one offence may be heard at the same time 

Â 

(1) A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to 2 or more offences alleged to have been committed by the same accused person in any of the following circumstances: 

(a) the accused person and the prosecutor consent, 

(b) the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances, 

(c) the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character. 

(2) A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to offences alleged to have been committed by 2 or more accused persons in any of the following circumstances: 

(a) the accused persons and the prosecutor consent, 

(b) the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances, 

(c) the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character. 

(3) Proceedings related to 2 or more offences or 2 or more accused persons may not be heard together if the court is of the opinion that the matters ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice.""

Â 

Principles of Law

Â 

37The Crown submissions, and the application by the applicants' counsel that the evidence relevant to Counts 3 and 4 would be admitted with respect to the offences of murder in Count 1, correctly reflected the authorities.

Â 

38In McKey v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 1, Latham J (with whom Whealy JA and Hislop J agreed) said at [26] this:

Â 

""26 The law has always recognized the legitimacy of reliance upon post-offence conduct in support of a prosecution case. The most common example of such post-offence conduct is lies told by an accused (Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193), although an accused's silence in response to an allegation which he/she might reasonably be expected to deny (R v MMJ [2006] VSCA 226), the destruction of evidence ( R v Nguyen [2001] VSCA 1) and attempts to influence the evidence of witnesses ( R v Smit & Ors . [2004] NSWCCA 409) all fall into the same category. Similarly, 

Â 

'Flight from justice, and its analogous conduct, have always been deemed indicative of a consciousness of guilt. ...... It is universally conceded today that the fact of an accused's flight, escape from custody, resistance to arrest, concealment, assumption of a false name, and related conduct, are admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt, and thus of guilt itself :.. '

Â 

Wigmore on Evidence, Vol 2, (1979) par 276(4)""

Â 

39In Kuehne v R [2012] NSWCCA 270, Fullerton J, after referring to the decision in McKey, said at [68] this:

Â 

""68 Her Honour did observe that where the Crown intends to rely upon an accused's post offence conduct as evidencing consciousness of guilt, the evidence must be capable of rationally supporting an inference of guilt of the crime charged before it is admitted for that purpose and, as part of that enquiry, the conduct must be identified by the Crown with precision and its capacity to constitute an implied admission of the offence charged made patent.""

Â 

40Applying those principles, it is clear that the evidence of the post-murder conduct of the applicant would be admissible and may be persuasive in the jury's mind. Caution does not dictate that there is any reason here to think that the counts ought be tried separately on this basis.

Â 

41In McCarthy v Regina (1984) 14 A Crim R 155, Street CJ (with whom Reynolds and Miles JJ) agreed, said at p159 - 160:

Â 

""The test to be applied when examining whether or not the interests of justice are such as to permit the joinder of two counts was expressed in a decision of Assim ([1966] 2 QB 249) in terms that have been commended on a number of subsequent occasions in decisions of authority, both in this country and in England. At 261 in the judgment of that case it was said:

Â 

""As a general rule it is, of course, no more proper to have tried by the same jury several offenders on charges of committing individual offences that have nothing to do with each other than it is to try before the same jury offences committed by the same person that have nothing to do with each other. Where, however, the matters which constitute the individual offences of the several offenders are upon the available evidence so related, whether in time or by other factors, that the interests of justice are best served by their being tried together, then they can properly be the subject of counts in one indictment and can, subject always to the discretion of the court, be tried together. Such a rule, of course, includes cases where there is evidence that several offenders acted in concert but is not limited to such cases."" ""

Â 

42It is clear that if the two preconditions to the exercise of the Court's power to order separate trials of counts on an indictment are established, the Court maintains a discretion which it is required to exercise showing regard to the interests of justice.

Â 

43In Samadi and Djait v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 330; (2008) 192 A Crim R 251, Beazley JA (with whom Allsop and Price JJ agreed), said at [108]:

Â 

""108 The question of whether there should be joint or separate trials is a matter for discretion for the judge at the trial: see R v Grondkowski; R v Malinowski [1946] 1 KB 369; [1946] 1 All ER 559; Merritt v Roso (1985) 19 A Crim R 360 at 364. The discretion must be exercised judicially and not capriciously, having regard to the interests of justice as well as the interests of the accused: see Slattery CJ in CL and Carruthers J at 364.""

Â 

44Latham J (with the agreement of McClellan CJ at CL and Schmidt J) in R v Ceissman [2010] NSWCCA 50, adopted this approach at [21] and noted that the interests of justice are not solely referrable to the interests of an accused.

Â 

Discernment

Â 

45The first question which must be determined is whether I am satisfied that the applicant may be embarrassed or prejudiced in his defence by reason of all three counts remaining on the Indictment.

Â 

46Because of the properly made concession that the evidence with respect to the conspiracy counts was admissible on the murder count, any question of embarrassment or prejudice must be limited to some feature of the proposed trial over and above the evidence relevant to the conspiracy charges being put before the jury.

Â 

47The only additional element pointed to is the trial Judge's directions about, and the jury's consideration of, the guilt or innocence of the applicant on the conspiracy counts.

Â 

48I am wholly unpersuaded that these additional burdens, if such they be, are of a sufficient extent to cause any prejudice or embarrassment to the applicant in his defence of the proceedings. The directions about the conspiracy charge are not particularly complex, a written outline of the element of the offences are likely to be provided to the jury and the jury will be instructed to consider separately with respect to each count, whether the evidence led satisfies them beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the applicant. I do not accept that having the jury undertake such consideration will distract its focus from making its determination in the murder count.

Â 

49There is no other reason advanced which satisfies me that it is desirable that the charges be heard separately. The two issues announced by counsel for the applicant as likely to arise do not suggest that there ought be separate trials.

Â 

50As well, the interests of the administration of justice strongly favour the three counts being heard together so as to avoid the evidence to the extent that it depends upon the witnesses being called to support the existence of the conspiracy charged in Counts 3 and 4, being required to give evidence twice in respect of proceedings against the applicant.

Â 

51There is good reason why those witnesses should not be required to give their evidence, as being relevant to the applicant, on two separate occasions before two separate juries. Particularly is this so because they will also be required to give their evidence in the trial of the applicant's two co-conspirators which is presently scheduled to take place in the District Court late in 2014.

Â 

52Accordingly, I am satisfied that the interests of justice tell against making the order sought by the applicant.

Â 

Order

Â 

53The Court orders:

Â 

(1)Application for separate trials of Counts 3 and 4 on the Indictment presented on 4 April 2014 dismissed.

		28 October 2016",2014-10-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765200,Anjoul v R [2014] NSWCCA 234,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Davies J.

2HIDDEN J: Undoubtedly, the extent of Raymond Anjoul's dependence on the applicant was a troubling, indeed distressing, issue in this case. However, as is apparent from the judgment of Davies J, the sentencing judge gave it careful consideration and afforded it the weight it deserved. Error has not been shown in his Honour's approach.

3I agree with the orders proposed by Davies J and with his Honour's reasons.

4DAVIES J: The Applicant pleaded guilty to the following five offences committed on 11 October 2013:

(a) Sequence 2: Possession of a prohibited weapon, being a can of pepper spray. The maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of three years;

(b) Sequences 5 and 6: Possession of identification information to facilitate the commission of an indictable offence. The maximum penalty is 7 years imprisonment.

(c) Sequence 7: Deal with the proceeds of crime being $950.00 knowing it was the proceeds of crime. The maximum penalty is 15 years imprisonment

(d) Sequence 8: Supplying 168.4g of cocaine being the indictable quantity. The maximum penalty is 15 years imprisonment.

5The Applicant also pleaded guilty to two further summary offences committed on the same day. Those offences, which were before the District Court pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), were as follows:

(e) Sequence 1: Drive while suspended. The maximum penalty is 18 months imprisonment and/or a fine of $3,300 with an automatic period of disqualification of 12 months cumulative upon any period of disqualification or suspension existing at the time of conviction;

(f) Sequence 4: Possession of a false licence. The maximum penalty is 20 penalty units being $2,200.

6On 11 September 2014 the Applicant was sentenced by Judge Sides in the District Court:

(a) Sequence 2: A fixed term of four months to commence 27 July 2014;

(b) Sequences 5 and 6: A fixed term of five months to commence on 27 July 2014;

(c) Sequence 7: A non-parole period of six months with an additional term of six months to commence on 27 July 2014;

(d) Sequence 8: A non-parole period of ten months commencing on 27 July 2014 and expiring 26 May 2015 with an additional term of 20 months.

7In respect of the two offences on the s 166 certificate the Court did not impose any penalty pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). However, the Applicant was disqualified from holding or obtaining a licence for a period of 12 months commencing 23 October 2014. 

8The Applicant seeks leave to appeal on two grounds as follows:

(1) The learned Sentencing Judge erred in holding that there was no alternative to a sentence of full time custody of 30 months imprisonment.

(2) The learned Sentencing Judge erred in failing to consider a sentence of full time custody wholly suspended pursuant to s 12 or the imposition of an Intensive Corrections Order.

The offences

9As a result of information obtained from the use of a telephone interception warrant, the police stopped the Applicant's vehicle on 11 October 2013. The Applicant was in the driver's seat. Investigations showed that the Applicant's licence was suspended. Present in the car was a child aged about three years old, unrestrained and occupying the passenger seat of the vehicle. 

10By reason of intelligence the police had relating to the Applicant and the motor vehicle being involved in outlaw motorcycle gangs and firearm offences the police told the Applicant they proposed to search his vehicle. They asked if he had anything in the vehicle he wanted to disclose and he said that there was pepper spray in the glove box. When the police searched the glove box they found the pepper spray with the word ""Police"" on the front of the can. That gave rise to the possession of the prohibited weapon (sequence 2).

11The police also located a plastic box in the side step on the driver's side of the vehicle. Inside that box the police located a driver's licence number 15125050 in the name of Gerald Gray. The photograph on the licence bore a striking resemblance to the Applicant, including neck tattoos identical to those of the Applicant. The possession of the licence gave rise to the second matter on the s 166 certificate (sequence 4). 

12Inside the box there was also a Medicare card and a Commonwealth Bankcard. His possession of those gave rise to the offences in sequences 5 and 6.

13The police also found $1,950 in cash which the Applicant said was from work. His possession of the cash gave rise to the offence in sequence 7. 

14The police removed the glove box and located a clear, vacuum sealed bag inside which were six clear plastic bags. One of the six bags had a red seal. The bags contained white powder which the police at the time believed was cocaine. The white powder was sent to the Department of Analytical Laboratories and the white powder, which weighed 168.4g was found to be cocaine or a mixture of cocaine. That gave rise to the offence of supply being sequence 8.

Subjective matters

15The Sentencing Judge made the following findings concerning the Applicant's background. The Applicant was born on 21 July 1985. He was therefore aged 29 at the date of sentence. He was the third of five children of his parents and the Sentencing Judge noted that he had had the advantage of a supportive upbringing within a close family. He married in February 2008 and had two daughters, one born in April 2011 and the other in December 2012.

16The Applicant left school during year 10 without obtaining his school certificate to take up an apprenticeship as a plumber. He completed the apprenticeship and worked as a plumber in a family owned business until he became his brother Raymond's full time carer in circumstances that will be referred to. 

17The Applicant started using cannabis during his teenage years and later progressed to what he described as recreational use of cocaine.

18He did not have the benefit of prior good character. In September 2004 he had been placed on a supervised bond for 12 months for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In March 2008 he was placed on a bond for two years and fined for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In April 2013 he was fined for possession of drugs. In addition, he had a long and unsatisfactory driving record. 

19The significant matter in the evidence before the Sentencing Judge concerned the Applicant's older brother Raymond who has muscular dystrophy. Although lengthy, it is necessary to set out the Sentencing Judge's findings in this regard:

One of the Offender's older brothers, Raymond has muscular dystrophy. This condition was diagnosed when Raymond was about 15 years old. That diagnosis occurred in the context of Raymond breaking his leg and it not healing over an extended period of time. This disease causes severe deterioration of muscle tissues and is highly degenerative. By the time Raymond was 21 he could not stand without help. For a long time after the diagnosis he was resistant to using a wheelchair and became quite dependent on the Offender to assist with mobility.

Raymond sustained severe spinal and hip injuries in a motor vehicle accident in 2006. He has received a lump sum compensation payment in relation to those injuries. Obviously they added additional complications to those arising from his muscular dystrophy.

Raymond was again injured in a motor vehicle accident in 2012, this time to his shoulder. Obviously this further aggravated his overall physical disability. He has sought compensation, but to date not received any compensation and there has been no admission of liability.

Raymond's condition is such that he now has no movement at all on his left side of his body and has limited ability to contract muscles on the right-hand side of his body. He cannot grasp a cup and bring it to his mouth for the purposes of drinking or an implement to eat and he is entirely dependent upon others for sustenance. The Offender has been acting as his carer.

Raymond lives in his own house and currently the Offender lives some distance away in Winston Hills. He arrives at Raymond's place at around 7.30am and gets Raymond out of bed. He remains caring for his brother until about 9.30pm when he goes home after putting Raymond to bed. It appears that there is no one with Raymond from then until the Offender's return at about 7.30 the next morning. Raymond's disabilities, including his shoulder injuries and his weight, means that his carer has to have considerable strength to lift him in a way that does not cause pain or aggravate the shoulder injury. The Court notes that the Offender receives a carers' pension.

The Offender's mother, wife and sister do not have the capacity to provide all the care Raymond requires because of their inability to lift him. The Court notes that his sister and wife each have two very young children. According to Raymond's affidavit, his mother began to suffer medical problems about three years ago and, as a result was no longer able to do his washing, ironing or shopping. The evidence does not disclose the nature of his mother's health problems. The Offender's father cannot work because of a back injury and is not able to lift heavy objects such as his son Raymond.

Jerry, the Offender's other older brother, works in a family business and is due to start work interstate in the near future which would take him away from home six days a week. It is expected that he will be working interstate for about two years.

Elle, the Offender's younger brother, suffers from significant injuries that prevent him from working as a plumber. He currently works in Gerry's business doing accounts. According to his affidavit he suffers from memory loss and constantly forgets things and is unable to stick to a routine or timetables. Further, he is not able to stand for long times and cannot lift weights. He will also be working interstate for six days a week in the near future. Clearly his physical disability and memory problems mean that his capacity to care for or assisting caring for Raymond is very limited.

The only independent assistance the Offender currently gets in caring for Raymond is via Anglicare that is funded by the Commonwealth Government. They attend twice a day for brief periods to shower and assist in toileting Raymond.

Following the motor vehicle accident in September 2012, Raymond was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. As a result of the depression he became withdrawn and suffers from social phobia. He is extremely self-conscious in public and feels intense anxiety if he perceives people are staring at him. He also suffers from chronic unresolved pain that affects his left shoulder and radiates down his back. It disturbs his sleep and he has misused alcohol as a means of managing the pain.

Further, his marriage broke down because of his social withdrawal. Since November 2013 Raymond has been undergoing cognitive behaviour therapy on a weekly or fortnightly basis. However, this treatment has been disrupted from time-to-time because his low mood affects his motivation to attend therapy. The Offender's involvement in treatment has secured his regular attendance and assisted with Raymond's gradual exposure to public situations that he so fears. Obviously, in order to be successful this is a very gradual process. The Offender has also assisted Raymond to avoid situations that lead to heavy consumption of liquor.

Although the Offender has been involved in caring for Raymond before and after the motor vehicle accident in November 2012, Raymond's wife attended to many tasks but she and Raymond have now separated. Since their separation the Offender has undertaken the tasks previously performed by Raymond's wife.

The Offender is familiar with Raymond's medical and psychological conditions and Raymond does not trust others, particularly in connection with carrying him, as he fears an aggravation of his chronic pain. The Court notes that, whilst the Offender was in custody bail refused in connection with these matter, Raymond fell out of his wheelchair and remained on the floor for about 45 minutes until Jerry arrived and discovered his plight. An ambulance was called and the Court understands it conveyed Raymond to hospital.

Because of his psychological condition Raymond is vulnerable to exploitation. He is dependent on others for all activities, including feeding, grooming, as well as household chores, shopping and mobility. It is clear he has become dependent on the Offender and there is a risk that Raymond's psychological condition would suffer if the Offender were imprisoned and therefore no longer able to provide the support he currently provides.

Currently the Offender is vital to undertaking the task requiring heavy lifting in connection with his brother Raymond and also plays a very important part in addressing his mental health and psychological issues. However, there is no reason why family members apart from the Offender cannot do other tasks, such as cooking, feeding and grooming. Further, there is no credible evidence that some other members of the Offender's family cannot undertake household tasks such as shopping and spending time with Raymond and taking him to appointments, as well as cleaning the house. There is no reason why those less physically demanding tasks could not be shared amongst other members of his family rather than falling exclusively on one of them. This would permit them to attend to other demands in their lives, such as children. In this context the Offender's wife, sister and sister-in-law could provide assistance to his parents to carry out the less demanding physical tasks. Further, there is no evidence about the availability of resources within the community to assist Raymond beyond what is done currently by Anglicare. It may well be the case that if the Offender is not available then such resources would be available to undertake tasks in connection with Raymond, including the heavier tasks associated with lifting him.

20The Applicant's evidence during the sentencing hearing was that he only became Raymond's fulltime carer after he was released on bail in respect of these offences in November 2013.

Assessment by the Sentencing Judge

21The Sentencing Judge said that he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that each offence was premeditated and, in connection with the offence involving the drugs, the Applicant appreciated that he was enmeshing himself in organised criminal activity. Although his Honour found that no one suffered any harm from the cocaine or pepper spray because the police seized them, his Honour was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the possession of the pepper spray was connected to the drugs. He thought the seriousness of the offence of possessing a prohibited weapon was well below the middle of the range of seriousness.

22In relation to the possession of the Medicare card and the Bankcard, the Sentencing Judge found that each was in the name of Gerald Gray which was the same name as on the false licence. His Honour found that the Applicant had two cards with the intention of committing fraud and was also satisfied that he had the fake licence to facilitate that activity. His Honour thought the possession of the false cards and licence was a serious example of the offence. 

23The Sentencing Judge found that in the light of the nature of the other things in the Applicant's vehicle the $1,950 must have been related to illicit drugs or had been fraudulently obtained using the cards found during the search of the vehicle. His Honour said that the offence, while serious, was in the lower range. 

24The Sentencing Judge said that the offence of supplying a prohibited drug was the most serious matter before the Court. The Sentencing Judge said that the evidence established that 28.5% of the contents of the bag with the red seal was pure cocaine. The purity of the cocaine in one of the other five bags was 17%. His Honour found that the quantity of substance containing cocaine was vastly greater than both trafficable quantity (3g) and the indictable quantity (5g), and was 67% of the commercial quantity (250g).

25Although it was contended on the Applicant's behalf that his role in the drug supply was that of a courier, the Sentencing Judge said that in the light of the money that was the subject of the proceeds of crime offence the Court was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Applicant could exclude all inferences that would establish that his role was limited to being a courier. The Sentencing Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Applicant was involved in drug trafficking at a wholesale level but was not satisfied that the Applicant's activities placed him in the upper echelons of the drug trafficking hierarchy. His Honour noted that it was an aggravating feature that he came into possession of the drug in the presence of a child. His Honour said that the Applicant was involved in drug trafficking to a substantial degree and it was a serious example of an offence under the provision. 

Submissions on appeal

26It is convenient to deal with the two grounds of appeal together. 

27In his written submissions the Applicant submitted that there were exceptional circumstances present by reason of the Applicant's care of his brother, and those exceptional circumstances could and should have been used by the Sentencing Judge to consider a sentence of other than full time custody. The Applicant submitted that that was particularly so when, in the course of sentencing proceedings, the Crown conceded that a suspended sentence was within range. 

28Secondly, the Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge erred in concluding that the significant mitigating factors that justified a significant reduction in the custodial sentence were not such as to permit him properly to arrive at a custodial sentence of 24 months or less. 

29These submissions were developed in argument by the Applicant asserting that his Honour had fettered his discretion by not first having regard to the non-parole period. The Applicant submitted that if his Honour had carried out the sentencing exercise properly he would have reached the view that a fixed term of two years or less was appropriate which would then have given him the option of considering whether the sentence should be suspended or could be served by a means of an Intensive Corrections Order. In first deciding what the overall sentence would be and by failing to make reference to s 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act his Honour's discretion was thereby fettered. This was particularly so when a suspended sentence or an ICO was raised in submissions by the Applicant's counsel.

30The Applicant's counsel suggested that this Court, if it came to re-sentence the Applicant, might consider that a longer period was appropriate for the Applicant to be subject to some form of custody such as an ICO.

31The Crown submitted that, once his Honour had determined that the circumstances were ""sufficiently exceptional to justify leniency"" it was a matter for the Sentencing Judge's discretion to determine how and the extent to which the sentence should be ameliorated on account of those matters. In those circumstances the Applicant would need to demonstrate an error in the nature of those specified in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. The Crown submitted that no such error was demonstrated. The Crown also submitted that his Honour took the course of reducing substantially the non-parole period after having considered what the appropriate sentence should be.

Consideration

32His Honour considered first whether there were exceptional circumstances based on the need for the Applicant to care for his brother. His Honour then, following R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405 went on to consider what the appropriate sentence ought to be notwithstanding that finding.

33His Honour said this:

The Court is of the view that whilst there is evidence of hardship to Raymond if the Offender is imprisoned it is not as compelling as in the cases of R v Puskas [2001] NSWCCA 43 or R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405. The authorities make clear that leniency on the discrete basis of hardship to a third party can only be extended in highly exceptional cases. The Court is satisfied that in the circumstances of this case they are sufficiently exceptional to justify leniency on that discrete basis. However, such a finding does not mean that the appropriate sentence in a given case will not involve full-time imprisonment.

Notwithstanding such a finding the sentence must reflect the objective criminality of the offending behaviour and general deterrence: Hinton [op cit] paras 34 to 35 and R v Togias (2001) 127 A Crim R 235.

34His Honour then discussed two cases involving an assertion of exceptional circumstances. He said that the Applicant's anxiety about his brother and his inability to care for him if incarcerated would make his time in custody more burdensome. His Honour said that the Applicant's prospect of rehabilitation and not re-offending were good. He said he took into account all of the purposes of sentencing and considered that a custodial sentence was a sentence of last resort. 

35The Sentencing Judge then went on to say:

Absent the drug offence the Court would [not] have imposed full-time sentences. The authorities make clear that, absent exceptional circumstances, a full-time custodial sentence must be imposed in connection with the drug offence. Whilst the hardship to his brother is a significant mitigating factor justifying a significant reduction in the custodial sentence, the Court is not persuaded that a custodial sentence of less than 30 months imprisonment is appropriate to reflect all the circumstances of that matter including the objective criminality. There is no alternative to full-time imprisonment in connection with a sentence of that length.

The Court is satisfied in connection with the offences other than the supply that were the subject of the committal for sentence that custodial sentences are called for but, because they would not have been full-time sentences if he did not face the charge of supply, totality is appropriately reflected if they are served concurrently with the sentence imposed for the supply.

36This Court made clear in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [28] the process to be followed in determining the appropriate sentence. Howie J (with whom Hodgson JA and Levine J agreed) said:

[26] Having determined that there is no other penalty appropriate other than a sentence of imprisonment, the court is next to determine what the term of that sentence should be; R v Foster [2001] NSWCCA 215 at [30]. This has been regarded as the first step of a two-step approach in the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment, see R v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 at [50] to [52]; JCE at [17]. The determination of the term is to be made without regard to whether the sentence will be immediately served or the manner in which it is to be served. This is because any of the alternatives available in respect of a sentence of imprisonment can only be considered once the sentence has been imposed, see s 6 (periodic detention order), s 7 (home detention order) and s 12. It follows that the term of the sentence cannot be influenced by what order might be made after the sentence has been imposed. For example it cannot be increased because it is to be served by way of periodic detention: R v Wegener [1999] NSWCCA 405, or by home detention: R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 249. Nor can the term be reduced because an otherwise appropriate alternative is unavailable: R v T (NSWCCA, 19 June 1995).

...

[28] Once the term of the sentence has been determined the court is then to consider whether any alternative to full-time imprisonment is available in respect of that term and whether any available alternative should be utilised. The availability of an alternative to full-time custody will generally be governed by the length of the term that has been determined subject to the restrictions or pre-conditions imposed by the legislature on a particular sentencing alternative, see for example s 77 of the Act with respect to home detention. ... (Emphasis added)

37In Dipangkear v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 156 Whealy J (with whom Hodgson JA and Buddin J agreed) said at [34]:

[34] The present situation of the law, relevant to the present appeal, may be briefly stated as follows: - 

(a) Where all the features of the particular case point to the need to impose a custodial sentence but there is evidence of extreme hardship, a court may take into account the extraordinary features of the case in any one of three ways. It may suspend the sentence of imprisonment. Alternatively, the sentence may be shortened, or the non-parole period decreased.

(b) Each case will, to a very great degree, depend upon its own facts involving an evaluation of the seriousness of the objective circumstances of the offence committed, the extent of the requirement for general and, perhaps, specific deterrence, and the nature and degree of the impact of the sentence upon the third person.

38Nothing in s 44(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act suggests that a different course should be followed. What is provided in s 44 is a procedural provision directed specifically to the establishment of a ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term. It does not direct the Sentencing Judge, as part of the process of instinctive synthesis, to identify the non-parole period before considering what the overall term will be. Such an approach would be inconsistent with provisions in the Sentencing Procedure Act such as s 6 (home detention), s 7 (intensive correction orders) and s 12 (suspended sentences). 

39The issue of an ICO was raised in passing during sentencing submissions. Counsel for the Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge could consider a suspended sentence ""or even an ICO"". During the Crown submissions the Sentencing Judge raised the matter of an ICO but said that he doubted if the Applicant would be assessed as suitable. The Sentencing Judge also raised with the Applicant's counsel about the benefit of an ICO for the purpose of enabling the Applicant to look after his brother Raymond when the Applicant would be subject to a 12 months disqualification from driving and there was a 20 minute drive from the Applicant's home to his brother's home. 

40Although his Honour fixed a non-parole period of ten months he did so after having assessed that an overall term of 30 months was the appropriate period of imprisonment. That assessment necessarily resulted in a suspended sentence or an ICO being further excluded from further consideration. It cannot be inferred that his Honour overlooked the sentencing alternatives particularly given the exchange referred to above.

41Having determined that nothing less than a term of 30 months was appropriate his Honour then adopted one of the courses open to him on the basis of his finding of exceptional circumstances, that is, a significant reduction in the non-parole period. Since his Honour proceeded in an entirely orthodox manner it cannot be said that he fettered his discretion.

42Contrary to the Applicant's submissions the Crown did not accept that a suspended sentence was within range. The following exchange occurred:

HIS HONOUR: So the thrust of your submission, Mr Crown, is that a suspended sentence would not reflect the overall gravity of the offending behaviour?

MODDER: That's correct, your Honour.

43In my opinion, no error is demonstrated in the approach taken by the Sentencing Judge. He correctly said that the authorities make clear that in the absence of exceptional circumstances a full time custodial sentence must be imposed in connection with the drug offence. He noted that the hardship to the Applicant's brother was a significant mitigating factor which justified a significant reduction in the custodial sentence but said he was not persuaded that a custodial sentence of less than 30 months was appropriate to reflect all the circumstances of the matter including the objective criminality. The Sentencing Judge's additional observation that there was no alternative to full time imprisonment in connection with a sentence of that length indicates that his Honour gave consideration to the alternatives that had been put to him during submissions, namely, a suspended sentence and an ICO. 

44His Honour was under no obligation first to consider a fixed term under s 45. The fact that his Honour ultimately imposed a non-parole period of ten months does not give rise to any inference that his Honour erred in not referring to s 45 or to sentences that did not involve full time custody. Moreover, it is not necessary for the sentencing court expressly to state that it has applied the two staged approach (in Zamagias at [28]) in arriving at the sentence imposed: Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455 at [62].

45Although not raised by either party on the appeal, it should be observed that his Honour appears to have imposed a fixed term of imprisonment in respect of the offence of possessing a prohibited weapon (sequence 2). This offence carries a standard non-parole period. A fixed term is not therefore available as a sentencing option: s 45(1) Sentencing Procedure Act. Since the term for that offence has now expired it is not necessary for the error in relation to that sentence to be corrected.

46In my opinion, the following orders should be made:

1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.

		31 October 2014",2014-10-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765202,R v Polley [2014] NSWDC 323,"SENTENCE


	
	Early one morning in October last year, the day after Christopher Polley turned 20, he was sitting in a white Toyota utility with two of his mates. A fourth man was outside. Police saw that the fourth man was urinating in the street so they approached. This act of stupidity on the part of one of Mr Polleyâs friends has led to him being detected as a drug dealer who now faces a significant term of fulltime imprisonment.
	
	
	While police were speaking to the four men they saw a number of clear plastic resealable bags in the driverâs footwell. Accordingly, they decided they would search the vehicle. They found money, further clear plastic resealable bags and drugs. In particular they found 109 MDMA tablets and 65 methylamphetamine tablets secreted in various parts of the utility. Police also found that the offender was in possession of two mobile phones, one of which was a Samsung Galaxy mobile phone which, helpfully for police, the offender had used as part of his drug dealing activities by exchanging text messages with his customers and, perhaps even more helpfully, doing nothing to erase any of those messages.
	
	
	He now faces two charges of drug supply, one relating to the MDMA tablets and one relating to the methylamphetamine tablets. Together with what was found by police on 6 October 2013, the contents of the messages found on the phone reveal the significance of the offenderâs drug dealing activates.
	
	
	When this matter was first before me the Crown tendered an annexure, annexure E, setting out relevant text messages found on the offenderâs mobile phone. The Crown submitted that there were something in the order of 15 separate customers who had sent text messages to the offender as revealed by those text messages.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence. In the course of this - although not explicitly saying so - he did not cavil with the proposition that in quite a short time he had managed to accumulate at least 15 customers. However, in the course of submissions from the offenderâs counsel, it was submitted that there were fewer customers than that to be found on the mobile phone. Accordingly the matter was adjourned so that proper analysis could be undertaken. I received written submissions, and further oral submissions today, regarding the significance of various entries.
	
	
	I am satisfied as a result , and of course satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that a proper analysis reveals that the offender had something in the order of 12 to 14 customers and was willing to obtain more. The reasons for that are to be found in the transcript of submissions. I will return to the significance of that finding in due course.
	
	
	Also on the phone were three photographs of the offender; two were selfies and one was taken by another person. Those photographs show the offender in possession of an enormous amount of cash. A great deal of evidence was adduced as to the source of the cash. Ultimately the evidence established that the cash was not the offenderâs, but belonged to others who had obtained in through legitimate means.
	
	
	As I mentioned, the offender had just turned 20 when he was arrested. He was described as an immature 20 year-old. The law of course deals with people over the age of 18 as adults but there is no bright line by which those who turn 18 suddenly reach adult maturity. I am prepared to accept that the offender was, although he just turned 20, very immature for his age.
	
	
	He was brought up in a caring and supportive family by parents who clearly loved him. He was well provided for and effectively wanted for nothing, either materially or emotionally. But there were nevertheless a number of things which deeply affected him in adverse way as he was growing up.
	
	
	The first of those was the sudden death of a school friend of his when they were both in about Year 9. Whilst his friend had been receiving regular blood transfusions because of a condition from which he suffered, his sudden death was a complete shock.
	
	
	The next challenge the offender had to face involved a threat to his own life. He began experiencing episodes of collapse which were eventually found to be due to a problem with his heart. Medication was unsuccessful in remedying the problem and he required an operation. The risks to his life from the condition, and the operation, were significant and the effect of the real possibility of death upon this young man must have been substantial.
	
	
	At this stage he had fallen behind in his school work, both from the psychological effects of the two events which are described and also the fact that he had been off school for some time as his physical condition was treated. Rather than repeat Year 11 at a school where he feared he would be teased because of this, he changed schools, but then found it difficult to fit in. He finally left school completely, began work for a builder, and eventually obtained a carpentry apprenticeship.
	
	
	Unfortunately fate was not finished with him. Another significant event occurred in his life. A friend of his was killed when struck by a train whilst engaged in an act of vandalism. The offenderâs psychological wellbeing went downhill. He gave up work because of reduced motivation and, tragically given what this led to, he was introduced to ecstasy by his peers.
	
	
	I have no difficulty at all in accepting that a contribution to Mr Polleyâs offending was an underlying recurrent depressive disorder to which he was made vulnerable by the deaths of two friends and the very real fear that he had for his own life. This disorder led him to engage in substance abuse in an attempt to alleviate his depressive symptoms, which in turn lead to a substance abuse and dependence disorder. But it is one thing to use drugs, another to supply them, and another to supply them as enthusiastically as the offender did.
	
	
	He had a friend who was a drug dealer. The offender said that this person was always cashed up while he himself was short of money. In those circumstances the offender began dealing in drugs well beyond low-level dealing of the type usually engaged in by drug users to support their own habits.
	
	
	The offender has a criminal history but nothing approaching the seriousness of these offences. He got a s 10 bond after writing his dead friendâs name on a wall and was also dealt with for a low range PCA matter.
	
	
	Given the severity of the offending for which I must sentence him those earlier matters can effectively be ignored. He was also dealt with under the Crimes Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act for a domestic violence matter involving his girlfriend. Reports prepared for those proceedings were tendered in these proceedings. In particular the report of Dr Allnutt, which I accept, speaks eloquently of the mental state of the offender at the time of this offending.
	
	
	Gradually, after his arrest for these matters, his mental state has improved. Although he had suffered from a major depression for some time the evidence would indicate that when he was seen by psychiatrists in May and September of this year he was no longer mentally ill.
	
	
	He no longer uses drugs and has now commenced work in a real estate agency run by his godfather. That man, Sebastian Bonaccorso, gave very impressive evidence about what he described as the incredible transformation in the offender, which he had observed from March 2014 when he started working for him. Whilst in the past he was very immature, there has apparently been a substantial and pleasing turnaround in the offenderâs attitudes and behaviours.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence saying that he was disgusted by himself,. Primarily because of the effect that his offending has had on his family, but also because he now realised the effects of drugs on people; drugs like those he supplied to others. Consistent with his remorse he has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentences I will impose upon him will be 25% less than they would otherwise have been.
	
	
	The law is clear; if the offender was trafficking to a substantial degree then the offender must go to gaol fulltime unless there are exceptional circumstances. I am satisfied that he was trafficking to a substantial degree. There were 174 pills in the car, together with resealable bags, and only relatively small number of those were for his own use. There were 12 to 14 instances of a relationship of customer and drug supplier found on his phone. One message refers to the supply of â100 eccy wangs â sold. He was trafficking for financial profit and his motivation went well beyond an intention to supply only to fund his own drug habit.
	
	
	Further, in my view, there are no exceptional circumstances justifying a sentence of other than fulltime custody. Â Â Â Certainly there are matters on which the offender is entitled to rely, in particular his major depression at around the time he committed these offences and the substantial rehabilitation he has achieved, but these are not circumstances which in any way can be described as exceptional, even in combination.
	
	
	Many people begin to use drugs because of significantly unhappy events such as those to which this offender was subject. Many begin to use drugs because of trauma in their lives, and many are able to give up drugs once there is a real possibility that they will be sent to gaol having been detected by police as being a drug dealer.
	
	
	If a reason for using drugs, then rehabilitation, were enough to demonstrate exceptional circumstances then the law would soon cease to have an adequate deterrent effect. More importantly, the word and I know I am not interpreting a statute here, does not mean commonplace. It is terribly sad to send a young man to gaol for the first time. It is even sadder when the man who appears for sentence is in a real respect a different person to the person who committed these serious offences.
	
	
	In all cases prison is very much a sentence of last resort but on the other hand it is important not to lose sight of the fundamental purpose of sentencing; to protect the community. Â Â Â On occasions that is achieved by imposing significant, even harsh sentences, in an effort to deter the offender and others from committing offences in the future. On occasions the fundamental purpose of sentencing is best achieved by focussing on an offenderâs rehabilitation. If that offender can be assisted to avoid committing offences in the future then the community benefits.
	
	
	In this case I have decided that, consistent with the authority which binds me, nothing less than a sentence of fulltime custody is necessary to reflect the objective gravity of the offenderâs conduct. Many, many immature young men are seduced by the opportunities to make money which drug dealing presents. Their conduct is of great harm to their individual customers and society generally.
	
	
	While I appreciate that there is some risk to this offenderâs already achieved rehabilitation, the requirements of general deterrence, moderated of course because of the offenderâs underlying depressive order, requires the sentences I have decided to impose. In any case, the length of the sentences I will shortly announce precludes any consideration of an alternative to fulltime custody.
	
	
	I have decided to impose concurrent sentences. This matter could have been dealt with as a single charge and it is unlikely that offender appreciated that he was in possession for the purpose of supply of two different drugs. On both counts on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period of one year and three months to commence today, 31 October 2014.
	
	
	There is to be a head sentence of two years and six months on each count. He is to be released to parole on 30 January 2016. I dismiss the matter on the s 166 certificate and order that the drugs are to be destroyed.

		11 May 2015",2014-10-30 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765206,Louizos v R [2014] NSWCCA 242,"Judgment

1LEEMING JA: Freda Louizos (the appellant) was tried before a judge of the District Court and a jury of twelve between 6 and 25 August 2008. She was found guilty of soliciting to murder her former husband. On 25 September 2008, she was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. Her appeal against conviction and the Crown's appeal against sentence were heard, concurrently and rapidly, in December 2008. By judgment delivered in March 2009, this Court dismissed the appeal against conviction, but allowed the Crown's appeal against sentence: Louizos v R; R v Louizos [2009] NSWCCA 71; 194 A Crim R 223. This Court set aside the sentence imposed at first instance and imposed a new sentence of imprisonment of 13 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 10 years. 

2Although the Court's reasoning in the Crown's appeal accorded with settled authority at the time, aspects were concededly erroneous following the High Court's decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. The matter returns to this Court because of a reference by a judge of the Supreme Court pursuant to s 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), on 19 December 2013. 

3I agree, substantially for reasons given by Fullerton J, that notwithstanding the erroneous Muldrock reasoning, this Court was correct in 2009 to conclude that the original sentence was manifestly inadequate. Although the sentence imposed in 2009 must be quashed, I agree with her Honour that in its place this Court should impose a sentence of imprisonment of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years.

4I respectfully disagree with some aspects of her Honour's reasoning on the threshold question of the nature of this Court's jurisdiction. That question is not straightforward where, as here, there has been a reference following a successful Crown appeal. So far as I am aware, this is the first time this Court has enjoyed the benefit of full submissions on the point. Indeed the appellant has advanced two distinct positions to this Court (first, orally and in written submissions filed in advance of the hearing, and secondly, by lengthy written submissions filed 2 June 2014, by counsel who had not previously been briefed, whose approach was radically different. In what follows, references to the appellant's submissions are to those dated 2 June 2014.).

5The issue arose for determination for two reasons. First, the Crown said that leave was required for the appellant to advance a ground of appeal extending beyond the matters addressed in the reference. Secondly, the appellant submitted that in certain circumstances this Court should restore the decision of the primary judge (in so saying, I am considerably simplifying the appellant's elaborate submission in this respect; it is reproduced in full below). 

6Contrary to the Crown's submissions, I do not consider that leave is required to advance the new ground. Contrary to the appellant's submissions, I have concluded that the proceeding is to be approached as if the Court of Criminal Appeal's sentence was itself the subject of an appeal under s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), such that if error be detected, it is for this Court itself to impose the appropriate sentence pursuant to s 6(3). Error may be detected if it be found that the principles applicable to Crown appeals were misapplied by the previous decision of this Court. However, the result of error is not restoring the original sentence; it is instead the exercise of the power under s 6(3), made applicable by ss 79(1)(b) and 86 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. It is in this respect that I respectfully disagree with Fullerton J, although I share her Honour's ultimate conclusion.

Non-controversial aspects of the statutory regime

7Section 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act relevantly provides:

""(1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.""

8Section 79(1)(b) provides:

""(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion: 
...

(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912."" 

9Section 79(1)(b) is to be read with s 86, which relevantly provides:

""On receiving a reference under section ... 79(1)(b), the Court is to deal with the case so referred in the same way as if the convicted person had appealed against the conviction or sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and that Act applies accordingly."" 

10Section 78 authorises an inquiry into a conviction or sentence. Following consideration of an application under s 78, there is power conferred by s 79 to ""refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal"". A precondition of the exercise of the power is that ""it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case"". It is established that sentencing which arguably discloses Muldrock error (as it has come to be called) answers the description of a ""doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstances in the case"": Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383; 85 NSWLR 783. A judge of the Supreme Court so found. The only basis of the reference was Muldrock error.

11The closing words of s 79(1)(b) (""to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912"") and s 86 give rise to a new statutory creature, whose incidents closely resemble those of an appeal created by the Criminal Appeal Act. I shall call it a ""quasi-appeal"", to distinguish it from an ordinary appeal against sentence pursuant to s 5(1)(c) and 6(3). (I prefer not to use the language in the appellant's submissions of a ""virtual appeal"", because the process is a real exercise of judicial power with real consequences whose result may be to set aside a sentence of imprisonment.) 

12It was common ground that the inquiry into a conviction or sentence authorised by s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act extended to a sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, consistently with the course followed in other decisions of this Court: see Kazzi v R [2014] NSWCCA 73 at [3]. As Bathurst CJ said in A reference by the Attorney General for the State of New South Wales under s 77(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 re the conviction of Frederick Lincoln McDermott [2013] NSWCCA 102; 303 ALR 143 at [22]: 

""The words 'as if' [in s 86], in my opinion, indicate that the Court is to treat the appeal as one properly brought and which it had power to deal with under s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act.""

13That echoes what was said by Jordan CJ, with the concurrence of Davidson J, in R v Gunn [No 1] (1942) 43 SR (NSW) 23 at 26, about the predecessor section (s 26(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)) being treated as an investment of jurisdiction to deal with the matter ""as if it were an appeal against conviction duly instituted by the prisoner himself in the ordinary way.""

14It follows that the effect of ss 79(1)(b) and 86 is that this Court has authority to review and, if appropriate, set aside the sentence imposed by it in 2009. That is something it would otherwise be incapable of doing: see Burrell v The Queen [2008] HCA 34; 238 CLR 218 at [24] and the authorities there mentioned. Sections 5(1)(c) and 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act, read with the definition of ""sentence"" in s 2, only create an appeal from a ""sentence"" imposed by the court of trial. 

15The critical effect of s 79(1)(b) read with s 86 in this case is that the sentence imposed in 2009 by this Court pursuant to s 5D(1) is deemed to be the sentence to be dealt with following a reference. That must be so; there is after all only one extant sentence requiring the appellant to be imprisoned, namely, the sentence imposed when the Crown appeal was allowed in 2009.

Nature of the quasi-appeal created by ss 79(1)(b) and 86

16The function imposed by ss 79(1)(b) and 86 is to be performed ""as an appeal"", and ""as if the convicted person had appealed against"" the sentence imposed in 2009 by this Court. What legal content is to be given to the quasi-appeal thereby created? An appeal is a creature of statute, and the precise nature of appellate jurisdiction will be expressed in, or is to be inferred from, the statute including its context: Lacey v Attorney-General (Qld) [2011] HCA 10; 242 CLR 573 at [56]. So too here, the legal nature of the quasi-appeal falls to be determined from the statute including its context.

17In some contexts an ""appeal"" can refer to a hearing de novo whereby the matter is determined afresh irrespective of the need to identify error: see Allesch v Maunz [2000] HCA 40; 203 CLR 172 at [23]. In some contexts, an ""appeal"" can refer to a ""strict appeal"", where the only question is whether the decision under appeal was or was not erroneous on the evidence before it and on the law as it stood when the original decision was given: Lacey at [57]. It is plain that neither of those possibilities is presently applicable to the quasi-appeal created by ss 79(1)(b) and 86. The natural meaning in this context of the Criminal Appeal Act is for the procedure created by ss 79(1)(b) and 86 to be determined similarly to the appeal elsewhere created in the same Act. That is to say, it amounts to an appeal by way of rehearing, whose success depends upon the identification of error. No party expressly submitted to the contrary, although it will be seen that the appellant's submissions contended for an outcome which was different from that obtaining if s 6(3) applied.

18Within the context of the Criminal Appeal Act, ""appeals"" invariably have grounds, so as to identify error in the decision the subject matter of the appeal. Indeed, the nature of the grounds determine whether the appeal lies as of right, or only by leave. The process created by ss 79(1)(b) and s 86 also involves grounds.

What constraints (if any) govern the grounds raised?

19It has been held that once there has been a reference, leave is not required: Carlton v R [2014] NSWCCA 14, at least in relation to the grounds which were the subject of the inquiry. The question whether leave is required for new grounds not raised in the original application under s 78 was left open in Imnetu v R [2014] NSWCCA 99 at [4] (which is the most recent decision in this State, delivered after judgment was reserved) and has been the subject of conflicting dicta. Whether the distinction in s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act between grounds of appeal against conviction which involve a question of law alone, and other grounds of appeal against conviction and against sentence is preserved is also undetermined, although it has been said that s 5 is effectively ""bypassed"" by ss 79(1)(b) and 86: R v Doyle [2001] NSWCCA 252; 123 A Crim R 151 at [62]- [63]; McDermott at [16]. The position in relation to a notice of appeal is similar. What invokes the jurisdiction of the Court in the present case is the reference, under s 79(1)(b), as opposed to a notice of appeal: see also Imnetu at [5]-[6]. 

20The substantial question is how and when are the grounds of appeal necessary to establish error (without which the quasi-appeal will fail) to be identified? It was common ground that the grounds raised in the s 78 inquiry were part of the ""whole case"" which is to be dealt with under s 86. But can they be enlarged as of right, and at any stage? The appellant submitted that they could; the Crown that they could not. Taking the appellant's submissions to their logical extreme, would it be open to the appellant, at the hearing of the quasi-appeal (or even after judgment was reserved) to propound new grounds to challenge the correctness of the sentence? Can fresh evidence said to be relevant to the new ground be introduced as of right? Indeed, would it be open to challenge the correctness of her conviction, a doubt only having been raised at the time of inquiry and reference as to her sentence? However, it will not be necessary to resolve those questions on this occasion.

21There are statements endorsing a broad approach by the High Court in Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259 at 312 and Mallard v The Queen [2005] HCA 68; 224 CLR 125 at [10]-[12]. Nevertheless, leave was refused to re-argue a ground which had been the subject of an application for leave to appeal in the previous appeal in JJT v R [2006] NSWCCA 283; 67 NSWLR 152. However, I agree with Fullerton J's observation that JJT is not authority for the proposition that leave is required, the point not having been taken.

22The appellant pointed to the obligation to deal with ""the whole case"", and in substance contended that the whole case was as large or small as the appellant might choose to make it, with the Court being obliged to consider any question of fact or law raised by her at any time. 

23The language of ""the whole case"" reflects the original form of the antecedent to the provision, in s 26 of the Criminal Appeal Act as originally enacted, which copied the substance of s 19 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1907 (UK). Section 26 empowered (emphasis added):

"" ... the Minister of Justice, on the consideration of any petition for the exercise of the pardoning power having reference to the conviction of any person or to any sentence other than the sentence of death passed on a convicted person, may - 

(a) refer the whole case to the court, and the case shall be heard and determined by the court as in the case of an appeal by a person convicted;

(b) if he desires the assistance of the court on any point arising in the case with a view to the determination of the petition, refer that point to the court for their opinion thereon, and the court shall consider the point so referred and furnish the Minister with their opinion thereon accordingly.""

24The reference to the whole case arose in the context of a petition for mercy, and was in contradistinction to the possibility of referring any point arising in the case. Indeed, as Heydon J observed in Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] HCA 28; 214 CLR 318 at [74] and as Basten JA observed in Sinkovich at [21] and [34]-[35], the statutory language in New South Wales pre-dates by some decades any statutory right of appeal, let alone Crown appeals against sentence.

25However, the ""whole case"" having been referred, in a provision which is plainly intended to confer a benefit upon the convicted person and to put in place a mechanism to ensure fairness in the ultimate outcome, there is no good reason for there to be a limitation upon the grounds of the quasi-appeal. It has been observed (R Pattenden, English Criminal Appeals 1844-1994, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1996, p 361) of the English legislation that:

""Once a reference is made, the parties decide what the issues are, and the [Court of Criminal Appeal] decides on the basis of what the parties have argued and not the terms of the reference.""

26That approach reflected the result of R v Chard [1983] 3 All ER 637, which overruled R v Caborn-Waterfield [1956] 2 QB 379 to the opposite effect. In Australia too, Chard has been approved by the High Court in Mallard v The Queen at [12]. In Mallard at [10], the High Court said, of materially identical language in the Western Australian counterpart:

""Subject only to what we will say later about the words 'as if it were an appeal' which appear in s 140(1)(a) of the Act, the explicit reference to 'the whole case' conveys no hint of any inhibition upon the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal on a reference. Indeed, to the contrary, the words 'the whole case' embrace the whole of the evidence properly admissible, whether 'new', 'fresh' or previously adduced, in the case against, and the case for the appellant. That does not mean that the Court may not, if it think it useful, derive assistance from the way in which a previous appellate court has dealt with some, or all of the matters before it, but under no circumstances can it relieve it of its statutory duty to deal with the whole case. The history, as we have already mentioned, points in the same direction. The inhibitory purpose and effect of the words 'as if it were an appeal' are merely to confine the Court to the making of orders, and the following of procedures apposite to an appeal, and further, and perhaps most relevantly, to require the Court to consider whether the overall strength of the prosecution case requires the Court to apply the proviso contained in s 689(1) of the Criminal Code.""

27Accordingly, I agree with Fullerton J that leave is not required to advance a new ground, merely because it was not part of the reference. However, it does not follow that the quasi-appeal created by ss 79(1)(b) and 86 wholly displaces the Court's ordinary procedures designed to ensure a fair hearing. To the contrary, the ordinary language of those provisions is that a person who has the benefit of a reference under s 79(1)(b) is to be placed substantially in the position as if he or she had properly brought an appeal, in which there are limits to the extent to which grounds may be taken. However those considerations do not arise here. 

28It is also not necessary for present purposes to resolve a related issue raised by the appellant. The appellant accepted, properly, that it was not necessary to deal with matters which were frivolous or vexatious. However, the appellant submitted that:

""the mere fact that a previous Court has considered a matter now raised by the appellant does not make it frivolous or vexatious. It is the nature of a Pt 7 referral to reconsider a case already determined, such that the Court may 'derive assistance from the way in which a previous appellate court has dealt with some, or all of the matters before it' if it think it useful (Mallard at [10]).""

29There is, at least arguably, a tension between that submission and earlier authorities. In R v Gunn [No 2] (1942) 43 SR (NSW) 27, Jordan CJ said with the concurrence of Davidson and Halse Rogers JJ that (at 29):

""In a case in which there has already been an appeal which has been disposed of on the merits, I am of opinion that the Court, in the case of a reference such as the present, is not called upon to re-adjudicate upon any ground of appeal which has been already heard and disposed of, unless some new matter has come to light which makes a reconsideration of the ground necessary or desirable.""

30That passage was reproduced in the reasons of Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Mickelberg v The Queen at 311-312, immediately before their Honours concluded (citations omitted):

""It is the whole case which must be passed upon by the application of legal principles appropriate to criminal appeals. That being so, the power to exclude matters from consideration is properly to be seen as an aspect of the inherent power of a court to control its own proceedings. That power will authorize the exclusion of issues which are frivolous or vexatious. However, subject to an issue being properly excluded as frivolous or vexatious, it is, in our view, the duty of a court to which there has been a reference of the whole case to pronounce upon the whole case as presented."" 

31Their Honours were there addressing the way in which the Court of Criminal Appeal had dealt with ground 8 of Peter Mickelberg's appeal. They concluded at 312:

""Whatever the Court of Criminal Appeal might previously have said relating to Peter's conviction for conspiracy, it was not said in the course of an adjudication on the merits as to that conviction. As previously noted, Peter's earlier appeal was limited to his convictions for breaking and entering and setting fire to the premises from which the cheque forms were stolen. That being so, the issue of inconsistency as raised in ground 8 of Peter's grounds of appeal could not properly be excluded as vexatious or frivolous on the basis that it had already been determined on the merits after full opportunity for argument.""

32Mason CJ and Brennan J agreed with that reasoning of Toohey and Gaudron JJ.

33It is not entirely clear whether Mallard is to be read as supplanting the approach stated in Gunn [No 2] and seemingly endorsed in Mickelberg. However, it is likely, for the reasons given below, that any tension between the two approaches is illusory, once the true nature of the quasi-appeal is appreciated. For only if the appellant persuades a court that there is error will the sentence be set aside and a new sentence imposed. That may occur where, as here, the earlier court has applied principles subsequently held to be incorrect, or otherwise made some error of fact or law in its reasoning process. It may also arise where the earlier court has not dealt with a particular matter. However, where the earlier court has dealt with a matter, and the appellant makes no submission that there is error, then the approach of Jordan CJ in Gunn [No 2] as endorsed in Mickelberg will be available.

What if error is identified following a successful Crown appeal?

34How do those provisions apply where, as here, a reference follows a successful Crown appeal? The appellant's written submissions were elaborate; it is best to reproduce them in their entirety:

""32. This is a novel scenario that has only recently arisen in the context of Muldrock error Pt 7 referrals. The matters to be determined by this Court on such an appeal can be summarised as follows:

(1) Whether the CCA erred in determining that the original sentencing judge made material errors sufficient to warrant a Crown appeal. If the CCA so erred, this Court must overturn the Crown appeal and determine:

(a) Whether the Crown had established in the original CCA that the sentencing judge otherwise erred to the requisite extent to permit a Crown Appeal, in which case this Court must proceed to consider (2) below; or

(b) If the Crown had not established that the sentencing judge otherwise erred to the requisite extent, this Court should reinstate the original sentence.

(2) If this Court determines that the CCA did not err in finding that the sentencing judge materially erred, or else determines that the CCA did so err but that the Crown appeal should have been allowed on another of the Crown's original grounds, it must then consider whether:

(a) It was or is now correct to allow the Crown appeal, having regard to all of the legal principles applicable to Crown appeals in March 2009, including the residual discretion, and

(b) In the case that this Court finds that the Crown appeal should have been allowed on one of the Crown's grounds other than the ground upon which the CCA first allowed the appeal, this Court must also take into account whether the Crown appeal should now be allowed, many years after the original sentence and re-sentence, having regard to the appellant's subjective circumstances since the first appeal, and taking into account the residual discretion.

If neither 2(a) nor 2(b) are satisfied, this Court must overturn the Crown appeal and should reinstate the original sentence. 

(3) If, having determined in accordance with (1) and (2) above that, either the CCA did not err in allowing the Crown appeal or else that such an appeal should nevertheless have been allowed on another of the Crown's grounds, this Court must then proceed to determine whether the CCA's sentencing discretion miscarried. If it did (as is conceded in this case) this Court must compare its re-exercise of the sentencing discretion (as though on the Crown appeal put before the CCA, but having regard to the appellant's present subjective circumstances) against the sentence imposed by the CCA, to determine whether some other sentence is warranted in law.

It must then either dismiss the appeal or impose the new sentence accordingly.

33. In other words, this Court is effectively reassessing the original Crown appeal, and it must re-exercise its discretion from the point at which material error in the original CCA decision is identified, informed by the appellant's current circumstances and the residual discretion.""

35I do not agree that the concise language of ss 79(1)(b) and 86 leads to such an elaborate outcome.

36Sections 79(1)(b) and 86 bypass the rights of appeal created by s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act and create what I have termed a quasi-appeal. Although there are some differences, to which I have made reference, both sections require the process to be dealt with ""as an appeal"". The subject matter of the appeal is the sentence imposed by the earlier Court of Criminal Appeal. It is for the appellant to identify error in that sentence. The identification of error is to be undertaken in light of the grounds advanced by the appellant, and in light of the fact that the sentence was imposed following a Crown appeal. If material error be found, then s 6(3) applies, for s 86 requires the assumption to be made that ""the convicted person had appealed against the ... sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act, and that Act applies accordingly."" Those words can have but one meaning. They mean (at least in ordinary cases - I am putting to one side provisions such as s 7(1A)) that the power conferred by s 6(3) extends to quashing the sentence imposed following the earlier successful Crown appeal, and imposing the sentence which ""is warranted in law"", in accordance with what was said in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37 at [42]-[43], confirming what Spigelman CJ had said in Baxter v R (2007) 173 A Crim R 284. 

37In short, the new process created is not a rehearing of the Crown appeal. It is a new ""appeal"" by the offender against the sentence imposed following the Crown appeal. 

38What follows from the foregoing in the present case is this. Ms Louizos is taken to have appealed under s 5(1)(c) against the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. She does not need leave to prosecute these proceedings. She is entitled to identify grounds which go beyond the matters raised in the inquiry and reference under ss 78 and 79. She points to two matters: Muldrock error (which is conceded) and error in assessing her objective criminality. There is no reason not to consider those grounds on their merits. They are to be assessed as if an appeal. For the reasons given by Fullerton J, Muldrock error is made out, and it was material to the sentence imposed. It follows that the sentence imposed in 2009 must be quashed. Also for reasons given by Fullerton J, the sentence which is warranted in law, having regard to objective seriousness of the offence and her subjective circumstances to date, is a sentence of 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years.

39I agree with the orders proposed by Fullerton J.

40FULLERTON J: On 25 August 2008 the appellant was convicted after trial of soliciting to murder her former husband contrary to s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). That offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

41On 25 September 2008 she was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years. 

42The Crown successfully appealed the sentence under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (Louizos v R; R v Louizos [2009] NSWCCA 71; 194 A Crim R 223). On 20 March 2009 the sentence imposed by the trial judge was quashed and the appellant was re-sentenced to imprisonment for 13 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 10 years. An appeal against conviction was dismissed. 

43Following the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120; 212 A Crim R 254 the appellant sought an inquiry under Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) into the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal following the successful appeal. 

44On 19 December 2013 Latham J was satisfied that in allowing the Crown appeal against sentence and on re-sentence, the standard non-parole period assumed a primary or determinative significance, contrary to the decision of the High Court in Muldrock, as a result of which she referred the matter to this Court pursuant to s 79(1)(b) within Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act. 

45Section 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act is in the following terms:

79 Consideration of applications 

(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion: 

(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or 

(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
[Emphasis added]

(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

46On receiving a referral, the Court of Criminal Appeal is required by s 86 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act ""to deal with the case so referred in the same way as if the convicted person had appealed the conviction or sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and that Act applies accordingly"".

47One of a number of the issues arising on the appeal is what is meant by a referral of ""the whole [of the appellant's] case"" under s 79(1)(b). It will also be necessary to consider what is involved in dealing with the case ""as if"" the appellant had appealed (the approach mandated by s 86 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act) when the proceedings are not brought pursuant to s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, and where s 6(3) of that Act (a section to which both parties referred as governing the outcome of the appeal) is confined to applications for leave to appeal against sentence under s 5(1).

48Another question that arises on the appeal is whether the considerations that inform the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act have any practical application where the matter referred under Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act is from a sentence imposed after a successful Crown appeal, in this case in circumstances where the Court of Criminal Appeal found that the original sentencing discretion had miscarried because of the failure on the part of the sentencing judge to apply the provisions of s 54B of Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) in accordance with R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168, the law that applied in this State before the High Court decision in Muldrock. 

49In its submissions filed in advance of the hearing the Crown conceded that in both allowing the Crown appeal and in re-sentencing the appellant, the reasoning and approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal revealed Muldrock error. The Crown submitted, however, that when all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles are applied to the exercise of this Court's sentencing discretion in accordance with Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 (including the legal principles applicable to Crown appeals as they applied at that time), this Court would be satisfied that no other sentence other than that imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal is warranted in law and the appeal should be dismissed in accordance with s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The appellant's original filed submissions implicitly accepted that s 6(3) would govern the outcome of the appeal. On the appellant's behalf, however, it was submitted that on re-sentence a lesser sentence is warranted at law and that the sentence originally imposed by the sentencing judge is consistent with such a finding and should be reinstated.

50In the appellant's supplementary submissions, filed with leave after the hearing by senior counsel and junior counsel, neither of whom appeared on the hearing of the appeal, the nature of the jurisdiction that is invoked by a Part 7 referral was reconsidered and a different analysis of the questions that arise in the disposition of the appeal was proffered. The appellant's counsel submitted that if this Court were satisfied that there was Muldrock error in both allowing the Crown appeal against sentence and in the exercise of the Court's re-sentencing discretion (as conceded by the Crown), the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal must be set aside in its entirety. It was submitted that the question with which this Court is then concerned is not whether some sentence other than that imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal is warranted at law (the language of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act) but whether this Court is persuaded that the Crown appeal against the sentence imposed by the primary judge should be allowed in any event, referable to the grounds of appeal formulated and argued in 2009 but not formally dealt with by the Court in allowing the Crown appeal. 

51On that analysis it follows that if this Court is not persuaded that the Crown appeal should be allowed (having regard to the legal principles that applied in Crown appeals in 2009, including the residual discretion to dismiss the appeal even if error is identified - see Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462; 214 A Crim R 152), it seems to me to follow that this Court must reinstate the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge, since the exercise of the re-sentencing discretion by this Court would simply not arise. Conversely, it also follows that were this Court persuaded that the Crown appeal should be allowed (again having regard to the legal principles that applied in Crown appeals in 2009), then it will be necessary for this Court to consider whether, in the exercise of its re-sentencing discretion, and having regard to the appellant's current subjective circumstances, the original sentence should be disturbed. The appellant submitted that were this Court persuaded that the Crown appeal should be allowed (and that the residual discretion is not to be exercised in the appellant's favour), then a comparison between the sentence this Court is minded to impose and the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2009 might be undertaken, not by applying the terms of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, but with a view to assisting the Court to arrive at a sentence that is both just and proportionate, having regard to the objective seriousness of her offending and her subjective circumstances at the time of trial and her current circumstances, including the time that has elapsed both before and after the Crown appeal. Since reconsideration of the Crown appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence imposed on this appellant after trial must be decided by this Court referable to the Crown's original grounds of appeal, the arguments advanced by the parties in 2009 and the analysis of those arguments in the judgment of Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Grove J agreed) will be of some guidance in reconsidering whether the Crown appeal should be allowed. 

52The appellant submitted that after undertaking that exercise this Court would be satisfied that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge is the appropriate sentence.

53For my part, I am persuaded that the approach to this appeal contended for in the appellant's revised submissions is the correct approach, and that the submissions filed by the parties in advance of the hearing, which focused on the application of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, understated or overlooked the principled enquiry that is engaged by the Part 7 referral in this case. 

54Leaving to one side for the moment what is comprehended by a referral of ""the whole case"" in s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act as a matter of statutory construction, at least for the purposes of this appeal it is inevitable that the evidence at trial and the findings of the sentencing judge based upon that evidence, will be the subject of consideration on the appeal. Put another way, the question whether the Crown appeal as formulated in 2009 should be allowed and the appellant re-sentenced in accordance with Muldrock principles, including application of the settled principles which constrain the exercise of the jurisdiction under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act, cannot be decided without ""the whole case"" being reviewed. That question must also be decided referable to the legislation that was in force at the time of the Crown appeal, including the ""double jeopardy"" considerations which applied prior to the amendment to the Crimes (Appeal and Review Act) by the insertion of s 68A in September 2009, given that the transitional provisions provide that s 68A ""extends to an appeal that was commenced but not finally determined before the insertion of the section"". 

55A question which was raised in the hearing of the appeal was whether the appellant was required to file a notice of appeal and, even if not required, whether its effect, if filed, confined the appellant to the ground of appeal. That question arose because of the Crown's opposition to an application by the appellant's counsel for leave to amend the notice of appeal to add, as a ground additional to Muldrock error (the sole ground of appeal as filed), that the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in finding that the objective seriousness of the offending was ""significantly above"" the mid-range. It was that question which attracted the grant of leave to file supplementary submissions in the course of which the jurisdiction exercised by this Court on a Part 7 referral, and the way that jurisdiction is to be understood where a successful Crown appeal is infected by Muldrock error, was addressed for the first time. 

56In developing the argument in support of leave to amend the notice of appeal being granted, the appellant's counsel (then appearing) accepted it was open to the Court of Criminal Appeal to regard the appellant's offending as above mid-range but submitted that the Court was in error in finding it was ""significantly"" above mid-range. He submitted the appropriate finding was that the offending was somewhere between the mid-range and significantly above it. He further submitted that, to the extent that the appellant's motive in having her former husband killed was able to be discerned from the evidence, it neither aggravated nor mitigated the objective seriousness of her offending, and that Howie J's criticism of the way the sentencing judge dealt with the question of motive, by converting the absence of any finding that the appellant's motive (whatever it might be presumed to be) was an aggravating factor into a mitigating factor, failed to factor in the neutrality of motive in assessment of the objective seriousness in this case. That was then relied upon as an additional basis to challenge the appointment of the objective gravity of her offending at significantly above the mid-range. 

57If it be the case that ""the whole case"" that was before the Court of Criminal Appeal on the Crown appeal is under review on this appeal (which, for the reason set out above, I regard as the proper approach), the question for this Court is whether the sentencing judge's finding of offending at below the mid-range was a sentencing error, as contended for by the Crown in its filed grounds of appeal in 2009, not whether the Court of Criminal Appeal was in error in its assessment of objective seriousness at significantly above mid-range. While this Court might be informed by the consideration given to that question by the Court of Criminal Appeal, it is neither bound by that finding nor is that finding under review for error. The concession by the appellant's counsel at the hearing of the appeal that the offending was above mid-range offending, must however be taken to be the appellant's instructed position. The question remains whether error in the sentencing judge's finding of objective seriousness will justify allowing the Crown appeal and the exercise of the re-sentencing discretion.

58In summary, although the appellant's application for leave to add a further ground of appeal and the Crown's opposition squarely raised the question whether leave to amend the notice of appeal was required (or, for that matter, whether a notice of appeal specifying grounds of appeal was required at all), and although it was that issue which prompted a number of related questions concerning the jurisdiction that is exercised by the Court of Criminal Appeal when a matter is referred to it under Part 7, for the reasons already discussed, in my view the issue of leave to amend the notice of appeal simply does not arise on this appeal. 

59If that analysis is misconceived, and it is the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal which is under appeal, the question whether it is open to an appellant to raise grounds additional to the ""doubt or question"" that formed the basis of the Part 7 referral does arise. That question has been considered in a number of recent decisions in this Court where Muldrock error in a sentence at first instance (or following an appeal brought under s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act) was the basis of a Part 7 referral, without any concluded view being reached, either because the Court did not consider it necessary to decide the point (Carlton v R [2014] NSWCCA 14) or because it was not fully argued (Kazzi v R [2014] NSWCCA 73) or it was not raised in argument at all (Imnetu v R [2014] NSWCCA 99). 

60Carlton is authority for the proposition that an appellant does not require leave to bring the appeal under s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, or to seek an extension of time within which to appeal in respect of the matters that were the subject of referral, where the matter is on a referral under Part 7, those procedural requirements effectively being bypassed by the referral itself. At [39] RA Hulme J expressed the view, without the need to decide it, that were an appellant to raise matters on the appeal additional to the aspect of the proceedings that gave rise to the referral, they ought to be considered by the Court unless they were considered to be ""frivolous or vexatious"", language used in Mickelberg v R [1989] HCA 35; 167 CLR 259 as adopted in the joint judgment of Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Mallard v R [2005] HCA 68; 224 CLR 12; 157 A Crim R 121 at [11]. In Mallard, the High Court was considering the referral of a petition for clemency under s 140(1) of the Sentencing Act 1995 (WA) to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination under s 689 of the Criminal Code (WA). Section 140(1)(a) provides for the referral of ""the whole case to be heard and determined as if it were an appeal by the offender against the conviction or against the sentence (as the case may be)"". 

61The approach taken by RA Hulme J in Carlton was consistent with the approach of Giles JA (with whom Latham J agreed) in Kearns v R [2011] NSWCCA 103; 213 A Crim R 150, a case which concerned the question whether there had been a miscarriage of justice in the trial of the appellant where it was said that the trial judge was asleep during the proceedings. While that was the only question that grounded the Part 7 referral, further grounds had been added by the time of the hearing of the appeal. As RA Hulme J observed in Carlton at [34], Giles JA cited the High Court in Mallard as authority for the proposition that as ""the whole case"" was the subject of the referral, the Court was obliged to consider all grounds (unless frivolous or vexatious) and that if leave were required to consider those grounds it ought be granted. In Kazzi at [11], Leeming JA did not consider it necessary to express any final view as to what follows from the fact that it is ""the whole case"" which is the subject of the referral under s 79(1)(b), his Honour merely noting that although it may not have been necessary to do so, in the case under consideration the appellant filed a notice of appeal where the sole ground of appeal was Muldrock error following a successful Crown appeal and that the written and oral submissions were confined to that issue. Button and RA Hulme JJ did not consider the question at all. 

62In Imnetu, Basten JA gave detailed consideration to a number of jurisdictional questions raised by a Part 7 referral, including whether a notice of appeal is required in bringing the appeal, although none of the issues considered by his Honour arose for consideration in the hearing of the appeal or its disposition. Basten JA expressed the view that although, as a matter of statutory construction, the reasoning underlying the decision in Carlton was persuasive, it may be necessary to consider, in a particular case, questions of leave in relation to grounds of appeal not the subject of the enquiry which led to the referral. His Honour went on to say that although the question whether a notice of appeal is required might be covered by the reasoning in Carlton (as distinct from it being adopted as a matter of administrative convenience in the Registry of the Court of Criminal Appeal), he doubted whether the referral of ""the whole case"", of itself, entitled an appellant to raise grounds of appeal unrelated to the matter which gave rise to a doubt or question leading to the referral. As his Honour saw it, this was seemingly inconsistent with the legislative purpose of Part 7. 

63Since both parties filed supplementary written submissions which addressed the question of jurisdiction on a referral under Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, I propose to set out the arguments of the parties as to what is comprehended by a referral of ""the whole case"", albeit in a summary way. 

64The Crown submitted that leave was required to amend the notice of appeal despite ""the whole case"" being referred under s 79(1)(b) and despite it being this Court's statutory duty under s 86 to deal with the appeal on that basis. The Crown submitted that the referral of what was perceived by Latham J to be Muldrock error in the disposition of the Crown appeal in 2009, does not entitle the appellant to expand her case on appeal to this Court as of right. The Crown repeated its earlier submission that the matter referred by her Honour was whether Muldrock error allows for the conclusion by this Court that a lesser sentence is warranted in law. While the Crown accepted that the appellant does not require leave to challenge the sentence on that basis, it submitted that leave is required to argue any additional ground of appeal. This submission seems to me to expose the same error in the Crown's approach to the disposition of the appeal as appears in the submissions filed in advance of the appeal, in that it appears to focus on s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act as governing the outcome.

65The appellant submitted that the terms of ss 79(1), 79(2) and 86 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act mandate that these proceedings be treated ""as"" an appeal (per s 79(1)(b)) and ""as if the convicted person had appealed"" thereby attracting the power to dispose of the appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act. The appellant sought to emphasise, however, that because the proceedings are not brought under that Act the procedural steps preliminary to commence an appeal are bypassed by the referral, as is the need to obtain leave to appeal against a sentence under s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act. Counsel submitted that the language of ""the whole case"" may be contrasted with a significantly revised version of the legislation (otherwise of the same historical origin) in force in the ACT. In that jurisdiction, the type of matters which may be referred are expressly limited by the legislation. An inquiry following referral is similarly limited to such matters as are stated in the order for inquiry (equivalent to an order for inquiry under s 79(l)(a); see s 427(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT)). This is in marked contrast with the referral of ""the whole case"" mandated under the New South Wales Act.

66In short, the appellant submitted that for the Crown to seek to maintain the argument that the only matter referred by Latham J was Muldrock error is to confuse why the appellant's case was referred with what was actually referred. In the exercise of the administrative power under s 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, the appellant submitted (correctly in my view) that Latham J could have done no more than to have referred ""the whole"" of the appellant's case to this Court since that is the only category of referral her Honour was empowered to make. 

67Applying the same reasoning, the appellant submitted that no question of leave to amend the notice of appeal arises on a Part 7 referral since the Court is obliged by the terms of the referral under s 79(1)(b) to consider the whole of the appellant's case, including any issues of fact or law, whether or not raised by the referral, subject only to the Court's inherent jurisdiction to restrict the hearing of the appeal to matters that are not frivolous or vexatious. Further, it was submitted that since the Crown has conceded that in allowing the Crown appeal in this case the Court of Criminal Appeal committed a Muldrock error, it is inevitable that the matters bearing on an assessment of objective seriousness will need to be considered afresh by this Court in determining whether the Crown appeal (absent Muldrock error) would have succeeded in any event and, if so, in the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion that would inevitably follow from that finding. The appellant submitted that the Crown's description of the Court's consideration of that question as ""vexatious and frivolous"", as they sought to argue in the supplementary submissions, fails to appreciate the nature of the current proceedings and the matters that fall to be determined in them. In that connection, it was submitted that it is inevitable that the appellant's motive in soliciting to have her former husband killed will fall to be considered by this Court, since it forms part of the facts and circumstances of her offending as disclosed by the findings of the primary judge, informed by the consideration given to those findings by the Court of Criminal Appeal.

68Both parties referred to authorities which have considered similar legislative provisions to those in Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.

69In my view, the Crown's reliance upon a passage at [10] in the joint judgment of Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Mallard (as extracted below) in support of the proposition that the Court is to merely follow the procedures apposite to an appeal when considering ""the whole case as if it were an appeal"" and not to reconsider ""the whole case"", is too narrow a reading of that decision. On a proper reading of the passage at [10], it does not constrain the manner in which an appellant might bring an appeal following a Part 7 referral under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. 

70In Mallard, the High Court found that the approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Western Australia to considering not merely the evidence at the appellant's trial, but the relevance of that evidence to further evidence upon which the appellant sought to rely, as if the Court were inhibited by the term of the referral, was erroneous. The Court said:

[10] ... Subject only to what we will say later about the words ""as if it were an appeal"" which appear in s 140(1)(a) of the Act, the explicit reference to ""the whole case conveys no hint of any inhibition upon the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal on a reference. Indeed, to the contrary, the words ""the whole case"" embrace the whole of the evidence properly admissible, whether ""new"", ""fresh"" or previously adduced, in the case against, and the case for the appellant. That does not mean that the Court may not, if it think it useful, derive assistance from the way in which a previous appellate court has dealt with some, or all of the matters before it, but under no circumstances can it relieve it of its statutory duty to deal with the whole case. The history, as we have already mentioned, points in the same direction. The inhibitory purpose and effect of the words ""as if it were an appeal"" are merely to confine the Court to the making of orders, and the following of procedures apposite to an appeal, and further, and perhaps most relevantly, to require the Court to consider whether the overall strength of the prosecution case requires the Court to apply the proviso contained in s 689(1) of the Criminal Code. 
[Emphasis added.]

[11] This construction of Pt 19 of the Act is consistent with the approach of Toohey and Gaudron JJ (Mason CJ and Brennan J agreeing) in Mickelberg v The Queen: 

""The words of s 21(a) of the Code, so far as they require 'the whole case ... [to] be heard and determined', permit of only one meaning. It is the whole case which must be passed upon by the application of legal principles appropriate to criminal appeals. That being so, the power to exclude matters from consideration is properly to be seen as an aspect of the inherent power of a court to control its own proceedings. That power will authorize the exclusion of issues which are frivolous or vexatious. However, subject to an issue being properly excluded as frivolous or vexatious, it is, in our view, the duty of a court to which there has been a reference of the whole case to pronounce upon the whole case as presented."" 

[12] It is also consistent with the construction adopted by Lord Diplock (Lords Scarman, Roskill, Brandon of Oakbrook and Templeman agreeing) in R v Chard of like language of s 17(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 (UK): 

""In my view, which I understand is shared by all your Lordships, the words of paragraph (a) of subsection (1) in their natural and ordinary meaning are free from any trace of ambiguity; the person whose case which resulted in his conviction is the subject matter of the reference is to be treated for all purposes as if he were a person upon whom there is conferred by section 1 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 a general right of appeal to the Court of Appeal on any ground which he wishes to rely (whether it be of law or fact or mixed law and fact), without need to obtain the prior leave of that court. 
... 

Since it is the 'whole case' that is referred, this must include all questions of fact and law involved in it ..."" (emphasis added) 

71In A reference by the Attorney General for the State of New South Wales under s 77(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 re the conviction of Frederick Lincoln McDermott [2013] NSWCCA 102; 231 A Crim R 183 was cited by the appellant in support of the construction of s 79(1)(b) advocated in counsel's supplementary submissions. 

72In considering the operation of s 76 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, where application may be made for a review of a conviction or sentence in the exercise of the Governor's pardoning power, Bathurst CJ referred to s 77(1)(b) which provides that after the Governor has considered the petition, the Minister may refer ""the whole case"" to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with ""as an appeal"" under the Criminal Appeal Act. As to the operation of that provision, his Honour said:

[15] There are a number of matters which should be noted. First, a petition to the Governor under s 76 may be made by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person. In this case the relevant application was, of course, made by Ms Sheelah on behalf of Mr McDermott. There is no reason from the text of the legislation why such an application cannot be made on behalf of a deceased person.

[16] Second, s 77(1)(b) of the Act empowers the Minister to refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal. There is no requirement for a Notice of Appeal to be lodged or, for that matter, any action to be taken by the convicted person. As Spigelman CJ said in R v Doyle [2001] NSWCCA 252; (2001) 123 A Crim R 151 at [62]-[63] in respect of equivalent provisions in the Crimes Act, s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act which confers a right of appeal on a person convicted on indictment, effectively is bypassed. Thus, a reference under the equivalent of s 77(1)(b) of the Act in that case both empowered and required the Court of Criminal Appeal under the s 86 equivalent to deal with the matter on appeal, notwithstanding the fact that it was a summary conviction to which the appeal rights conferred by s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act would not apply...

73Counsel submitted that while it may be preferable, and is certainly practical, for matters relied upon in favour of and against the appellant to be enunciated in advance of the hearing of the appeal (as is customarily the case where directions are made by the Registrar for the filing of submissions), the Court's inherent jurisdiction to control its own proceedings and to ensure procedural fairness may, as in the present case, result in the grant of leave to file further submissions to respond to any matters arising in the proceedings not otherwise ventilated in the filed submissions or identified as an issue in advance of the hearing. However, that does nothing to derogate from the fact that preliminary procedures having been bypassed by the referral, there is no statutory obligation upon an appellant in a Part 7 referral to provide a notice of appeal.

74Finally, the Crown also relied on JJT v R [2006] NSWCCA 283; 67 NSWLR 152. Although that case involved a petition under s 474B in the Crimes Act (since repealed), the predecessor to the referral process in Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, the Crown submitted that there were no substantive difference between the two statutory processes since under both, the ""doubt or question"" is to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act on a review of ""the whole case"". After having referred to ""the whole case"" and the High Court decision in Mallard, McClellan CJ at CL (James and Simpson JJ agreeing) considered that leave was required to argue a ground of appeal which had been the subject of an application for leave to appeal in the previous appeal, which had been refused. McClellan CJ at CL said:

[87] There are powerful considerations which would point to this Court denying leave. As was said, admittedly in a different context, in Gregory [2002] NSWCCA 199 the interests of justice include consideration of the administration of the law generally, including ""considerations supporting the finality of judicial decisions"" ... 

[88] There is another aspect of the present matter favouring a grant of leave. The appeal comes to this Court following referral by the Minister. Mindful of the breadth of approach to the appeal which the High Court required in Mallard this Court should be slow to refuse leave to raise this ground even after the lapse of time.

75The Crown's reliance upon JJT as support for the proposition that leave to amend the notice of appeal is required also seems to be misplaced. In that case, the Court appears to have assumed leave was required, and granted it accordingly. In those circumstances, no principle of the kind argued by the Crown can be derived from what appears to have been an unchallenged assumption. 

76The Crown did not seek to file any submissions in reply directed to the issues as both clarified and reformulated in the appellant's further submissions.

77I am of the opinion that the construction of s 79(1)(b) for which the Crown contends, such that ""the whole case"" refers only to the reason for which a referral under Part 7 was granted, cannot be supported. It is contrary to binding authority and unduly hinders the statutory duty imposed upon the Court by s 86 for which there is no statutory warrant. 

Crown appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal 

78The facts on which the appellant was sentenced are conveniently set out in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal:

[6] BB, the victim, was the former husband of the appellant. There were three children of the marriage. The appellant and the victim had separated in 2001 and there had been an ongoing custody dispute in the Family Court. As at February 2006 there was an interim custody order in favour of the appellant. However the eldest child, KB aged 13, was voluntarily living with the victim. The victim had weekend access to the two younger children. There was a further hearing in the Family Court listed for 22 October 2006. 

[7] On Monday 27 February 2006, the victim left home in his Landcruiser at about 3am to attend his place of employment. He came across a number of wheelie bins placed across his driveway. He stopped the vehicle and alighted to remove the bins. As he was about to move the second bin, a man armed with a knife attacked him. The victim tried to enter his vehicle but was stabbed in the stomach. He was stabbed a number of times after he fell from the vehicle onto the roadway. The assailant entered the victim's Landcruiser and it was driven away. It was later found burned out. The victim was left for dead but regained consciousness in hospital. The appellant and their son visited him there. KB went to live with the appellant shortly after the stabbing. 

[8] There was no dispute at the trial that the man responsible for the stabbing was Morgan Denning. He was unknown to both the victim and the appellant. Denning had been engaged to attack the victim by Chad Williams. There was also no dispute that Leigh Moyes acted as a get away driver and had been engaged by Williams to carry out that role. 

[9] The chief Crown witness was Williams. According to his evidence the appellant asked him to kill the victim and she was party to the planning of the attempt on the victim's life. By the time he gave evidence against the appellant he had been convicted of an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm arising from the stabbing and sentenced to a prison term for that offence. He had been given the benefit of a 45 per cent discount for the assistance he had provided to the investigating police including giving evidence against the appellant at the trial. 

[10] Williams lived at the Wyoming Caravan Camp that was owned by the appellant and her second husband. Williams had three children from a previous relationship who were living with foster parents. He was at the time of the offending living with a partner who was pregnant with their first child. Williams was employed as caretaker of the caravan park. His duties involved cleaning toilets, general maintenance and attending the office when the appellant and other staff were unavailable. After the birth of their child, Williams and his partner moved into a house adjoining the office rent-free. He was attempting to regain custody of his children and was keen to have stable employment and accommodation. 

[11] It was William's evidence that in January 2006 the appellant asked him whether he was interested in ""knocking off"" her ex-husband. He declined to do it himself but said that he knew some people who might be interested. He agreed to make inquiries. Thereafter the appellant frequently spoke to him about whether these persons would carry out the murder. She told Williams that it was the only way she would get custody of the children. Eventually Williams decided that Denning would do the killing and the appellant agreed that he was to be paid $2000. Williams approached Denning in mid-January 2006 and asked if he was prepared to earn some money. He told Denning that the victim had molested a child whom Denning knew. Denning agreed to carry out the killing. 

[12] According to Williams, in February 2006 the appellant drove him in her vehicle to show him where the victim lived. She drove to the vicinity of the victim's home but did not want to be seen by him. She gave Williams the registration number of the victim's vehicle and told him what time the victim left for work. She showed him a photograph of the victim. 

[13] Williams gave evidence as to the circumstances surrounding the stabbing of the victim at which he was present. [He received nine stab wounds to the back, neck and abdomen]. After the attack Williams assisted in burning the victim's motor vehicle. He then returned to the caravan park and fell asleep. He woke up and saw the appellant entering the house. She said that her husband was in hospital. Some time later she asked him why the victim was not dead. 

[14] Some weeks after the stabbing the appellant's husband told Williams to leave the caravan park for supplying drugs. He ultimately moved to a caravan park at Coolah near Dubbo where he was arrested on 6 September 2006. Police had identified Moyes as being involved in the stabbing and arrested him at the appellant's caravan park Williams learned that Moyes had implicated him in the stabbing and thereafter agreed to assist police. As part of that assistance Williams agreed to take part in telephone calls with the appellant that were to be recorded by police. 

79The admissibility of these calls was considered as part of the appeal against conviction. The Court was satisfied that they were properly admitted and summarised the content of the calls as follows: 

[27] Williams made three telephone calls to the appellant at the instigation of police after he and Moyes had been arrested. The first two were made on 7 September 2006 the day after Williams' arrest and the third on 20 September 2006. Det Milton suggested that Williams should speak to the appellant in the conversation ""as if you knew that [Moyes] had rolled"". In respect of the third of the calls the detective suggested that Williams should tell the appellant that he had been in custody for traffic matters.

[28] An employee of the caravan park answered the first call from Williams and he asked her to pass on an urgent message to the appellant that ""Leigh [Moyes] had rolled"". A few minutes later the appellant rang Williams. That conversation, included the following:

Williams: Urn, I've just found out that Lee's (sic) rolled on us.
Appellant: Yeah.
Williams: I've got coppers all over town fuckin' chasin' me.
Appellant: Huh uh. Why you?
Williams: Um...
Appellant: Why you?
Williams: Why me? Because I was involved in it, Freda.
Appellant: Listen, let me say...
Williams: Lee's told 'em
Appellant:... let me say something to ya.
Williams: Yeah.
Appellant: You keep your mouth shut, no one else will talk.

...

Appellant: All I can say to you is, you keep your mouth shut, they've got no DNA, they've got no nothing. 
Williams: Mm hm.
Appellant: They've got no fingerprints. They've got...
Williams: Yep.
Appellant: ...nothing. The car was sold, the car's gone.
Williams: Yep, yep. Righto. Ah....
Appellant: He can't ID. In the paper apparently they're looking for a white European looking male.
Williams: Yep, all right.
Appellant: So does that fit your description?
Williams: No it doesn't.
Appellant: Right

...

Williams: ...[Moyes] said that you paid some money. 
Appellant: Well I paid nothing.
Williams: ..he said - well, that's what he said. He said that you've paid money, he said that fuckin' I went out there and fuckin' me and Morgan done the fuckin' job. 
Appellant: Well you, keep your mouth shut...

...

Appellant: Um, anyway, like I said to you before, you can be guaranteed it's all tight this end, mate.
Williams: Yep, yep, all right. So just keep me mouth
Appellant: Yeah.
Williams: ...shut and
Appellant: Keep your...
Williams:...I should be right.
Appellant: Deny the whole thing.
Williams: Yep, deny it?
Appellant: Because there's nothing on you.
Appellant: But if they do, if they grab ya...
Williams: You know what I'm like, I've done nothing anyway, Freda. Fuck you know what I mean? It's all Morgan.
Appellant: You weren't there, mate.
Williams: Fuck, I was only up the road, Freda, so it doesn't fuckin' matter, like for me.
Appellant: You don't know nothing about it.

This was the conversation that the Crown chiefly relied upon to support the evidence of Williams.

[29] The third conversation contained some material that revealed knowledge by the appellant of the role of Moyes and his connection with Williams when she referred to him as ""your other mate"" and when Williams said, ""the one with the car that [you're] talking about?"" she replied, ""Yes"".

The sentencing reasons of the trial judge 

80After referring to the appellant's family and domestic circumstances at the time of the offending, the sentencing judge was satisfied that the telephone calls (extracted in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal at [27]-[28] and above) corroborated the evidence of Williams that he was contracted by the appellant to kill her former husband and that the appellant told him that she could get custody of the children if he ""disappeared"". On that basis, and there being nothing else in the evidence at trial suggestive of any other reason the appellant would wish her former husband dead, the sentencing judge appeared to proceed to sentence on the basis that the appellant's only motive was to secure custody of all her children. At one point in his sentencing remarks, his Honour described this as ""obscure, even mysterious"" since there was no evidence of family violence or obvious antagonism over the custody of the children despite there being Family Court proceedings where the question of custody was in contest. 

81His Honour was not satisfied to the criminal standard that the appellant was motivated to intentionally derail or pervert those proceedings. He was satisfied that the offending was aggravated by the fact that it involved preplanning and the implication of others as accessories, and that the intended victim of the murder sustained serious injuries and suffered ongoing mental trauma.

82His Honour also expressed the view that a desire to be with one's children (even, it would seem, if that motivated the appellant to contract to have their father killed) is different from, and not as serious as, being motivated to kill to secure a financial or other material advantage and soliciting another to secure that objective. He concluded that to the extent that the appellant's motive was able to be discerned from the evidence, it was ""a crime of passion rather than one of profit"" and that this mitigated the objective seriousness of her offending. His Honour also took into account, in mitigation on sentence, the fact that the appellant had no previous criminal record, that she was a person of previous good character and that she was unlikely to reoffend. 

83He made the following observation in relation to the maximum penalty and the applicable standard non-parole period:

For the present offence there is a maximum possible penalty of twenty five years imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of ten years. However, I do not regard this as a case where the imposition of such a minimum term as the standard non-parole period in this case would be appropriate. 

In particular, notwithstanding the objective seriousness of the offence, the apparent absence of comprehensible motivation causes me to impose a lesser non-parole period than the standard non-parole period. In the range of offences involving soliciting to murder, there are commonly motivations involving the diversion of legal proceedings and financial gain. These are the common ones. Love gone wrong is another one. Hatred and revenge are other motives which do appear from time to time. In this case, as I have said, it is difficult to discern a motivation but there are certainly many worse motivations to crime than the desire to be with one's children, even if that desire provokes, as the jury has found in this case it did, seriously wrong conduct.

84Having regard to the appellant's lack of criminal antecedents, her motives (insofar as they were discernible), and that separation from her children would make the conditions of custody more onerous, his Honour made a finding of special circumstances. 

The Crown appeal against sentence in 2009 

85The Crown relied upon three grounds of appeal: the first that the sentencing judge erred in finding the offence fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness; the second that he erred in making findings with respect to the appellant's motive for the offence which lessened its objective seriousness; and, third, that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. 

Grounds 1 and 2

86In the Court of Criminal Appeal, Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Grove J agreeing) described the offence as ""a very serious example of its kind"" and that the appellant's role in initiating the plan to kill her former husband for her own purposes (whatever they might have been), repeatedly encouraging Williams to carry the plan out, arranging payment to him to do so and the cold-blooded nature of the intended killing, coupled with the serious physical injuries and the psychological harm that were inflicted as a consequence, attracted an assessment of offending significantly above the mid-range of objective seriousness and that the sentencing judge had erred in finding otherwise. 

87As noted at [57] above, on the hearing of this appeal the appellant's counsel conceded in oral submissions that the offending was above mid-range but not ""significantly above it"". No similar concession was made when the appellant was respondent to the Crown appeal in 2009. In those proceedings the appellant submitted that the sentencing judge was justified in finding the offending was less than the mid-range and that an assessment of objective seriousness by a sentencing judge after trial was an exercise of a discretionary judgment with which this Court should not lightly interfere. 

88In the view I have taken of the jurisdictional question that is exercised on this appeal, this Court must determine for itself whether it was open to the Court of Criminal Appeal to have allowed the Crown appeal in 2009, based on the case that was presented at that time, including the first ground of appeal which asserts error in the sentencing judge's assessment of objective seriousness, in accordance with House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. 

89In reviewing the reasons for sentence on the Crown appeal, Howie J concluded that because the primary judge did not undertake any principled assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending against an offence in the mid-range of seriousness, there was no proper determination of whether the standard non-parole period should be imposed, or whether there were reasons to depart from it, the approach required by the law as it stood at that time. It was for that reason that the Court was ultimately satisfied that the sentencing discretion miscarried and that the resultant sentence fell so far short of the standard non-parole period that it was necessary to intervene and re-sentence. That being so, the Court did not consider it necessary to determine the other grounds of appeal relied upon by the Crown, including, in addition to the sentencing judge's finding as to objective seriousness, whether there was error in the way the sentencing judge approached the issue of motive (the second ground of appeal) and the weight given to his finding on that question in imposing a non-parole period less than the standard non-parole period. 

90Given the intersection between the way the sentencing judge dealt with the issue of motive and his assessment of objective seriousness, the first two grounds of appeal can conveniently be dealt with together. If error is made out in respect of either or both grounds, that will likely inform the question whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate, being the third ground of appeal. 

91As I see it, because this Court is bound to apply the law post Muldrock, consideration of the first ground of appeal does not so much require consideration of whether the sentencing judge was in error in his appointment of the offending as below the mid-range (a finding which was only ever made implicitly) or whether the Court of Criminal Appeal was justified in describing the offending as significantly above the mid-range, but whether the sentencing judge's approach to the assessment of objective seriousness was flawed. An assessment of objective seriousness remains a feature of the process of synthesising the full range of factors relevant to sentence in the approach as mandated by Muldrock, being part of the process of reasoning to arrive at a just and proportionate sentence. In contrast, an appointment of offending relative to the mid-range or to mid-range offending is no longer required for sentencing purposes although it is not an error to do so (see McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [28]-[29]). 

92In considering the way the sentencing judge dealt with the appellant's motive (or presumed motive), at [80]-[82] Howie J considered the offence of solicit to murder and a range of potential motives a person may have in seeking to have someone murdered. Although this Court is not bound by Howie J's approach to that question, I regard it as both instructive and principled. The appellant does not submit to the contrary. His Honour said:

[80] The offence of solicitation is of such a nature that there is less scope for significant variation in the factual basis for the offence or the degree of culpability of the offender than might be the case with other offences to which a standard non-parole period applies. The intention of the offender will never vary; the death of the victim is always intended. The offence will always be unsuccessful in achieving its intended result. One exceptional mitigating factor would be where the offender having solicited the killing of another later, on reflection, takes action to ensure that the murder does not take place. But generally it will be unusual to find a case of solicitation that is not premeditated. There can be variations in the role played by the offender, so that, for example, it may be less serious if the offender is merely the go-between for the principal and the would-be killer. But again given the nature of the offence, in the normal case the fact that the offender was not the instigator will not be significantly mitigating. 

[81] There can of course be variations in the motive or reason for which a person seeks to have another murdered but, given the intended consequence of the offender's actions, there generally can be little mitigation found in the purpose behind the solicitation. An exceptional mitigating factor might be that the offence is a result of provocation or that the offender suffers from some form of mental disturbance at the time of the solicitation. These are matters that reduce the offence of murder and, therefore, would be mitigating of the offence of solicitation to murder. But putting those matters to one side it is unlikely that the motivation for the offence will be mitigating. It is more likely that a particular motivation will be an aggravating factor. 

[82] I make these comments because, as will be seen, the ascertainment of the appellant's motivation became a matter of crucial significance to his Honour's determination of the sentence he imposed upon the appellant. With respect, in my opinion the Judge paid far too much attention to this factor and allowed it to distract him from a proper evaluation of the appellant's criminality. Ultimately it became decisive in his decision to depart from the standard non-parole period notwithstanding that he acknowledged the seriousness of the appellant's offending. 

93His Honour went on to conclude that the consideration given by the sentencing judge to the appellant's motive was seriously flawed:

[90] Having regard to the very serious nature of the offence, it was unlikely that the motive of the appellant in seeking the death of her husband was going to be a factor that would significantly reduce the objective seriousness of the crime or the offender's criminal culpability. Yet, as has already been noted, the substantial part of his Honour's consideration of the seriousness of the offence was taken up with this issue and it was ultimately decisive in his determination of the sentence to be imposed. 

[91] In considering this issue his Honour appears to have fallen into the error of converting the absence of a finding of an aggravating factor into a mitigating factor. For example, his Honour was not satisfied that the motive was to ""derail or pervert"" the pending Family Court proceedings. But this finding did not mitigate the offence because had the offence been so motivated this would have been a seriously aggravating factor and would have resulted in the offence being in the most serious category. Unless his Honour concluded that there was a motive that could truly be characterised as mitigating, the offence remained a very serious one; it simply was not as serious as it might have been had a motive been found that could be characterised as aggravating.

...

[93] ... The fact that there might have been worse motives than a desire to be with one's children does not reduce the objective seriousness of the offence.

...

[102] An offence is not mitigated by the fact that no comprehensible motive can be shown. Motive is like any other aspect of the circumstances surrounding the commission of an offence. The Crown is only required to prove the elements of the crime charged. If the Crown wishes to rely upon motive as an aggravating feature, the Crown must prove it beyond reasonable doubt. If the accused contends that the motive is a mitigating factor, the accused is required to prove it on the balance of probabilities. If the court cannot determine what motivated the offender, it follows that it is not a factor that can be taken into account in determining the objective seriousness of the offence or in any other way relevant to sentencing.

94This Court was not taken by either counsel to any authority to the contrary of the consideration Howie J gave to the significance of motive for sentencing purposes generally, or as they apply to the crime of solicit to murder or any authority which supports the distinction the sentencing judge drew between the financial, quasi-financial or non-financial motives that may prompt a person to have another kill on their behalf or his attribution of graduating levels of moral culpability referable to motives of that kind. In Quealey v R [2010] NSWCCA 116 at [24]-[27], Latham J reviewed a number of decisions where the motive for an offence was retribution or vigilantism, including R v Mitchell [2007] NSWCCA 296; 177 A Crim R 94, Barlow v R [2008] NSWCCA 96; 184 A Crim R 187, R v Rayment [2010] NSWCCA 85, and R v Dole; R v Nguyen [2010] NSWCCA 101. These cases emphasise that no countenance is to be given to a person's resort to criminal conduct as a response to another's misconduct, however genuinely motivated an offender may be to right a perceived wrong or to exact revenge. As her Honour said at [28], these authorities establish that while such motives might provide an explanation for the infliction of intentional violence, they do not reduce the moral culpability of an offender who embarks upon deliberate and considered criminal conduct of that kind to any significant degree. The same obtains, in my view, with even greater force in this case.

Was the sentence manifestly inadequate?

95In Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6] Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said: 

Manifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion. A sentence is, or is not, unreasonable or plainly unjust; inadequacy or excess is, or is not, plainly apparent. It is a conclusion which does not depend upon attribution of identified specific error in the reasoning of the sentencing judge and which frequently does not admit of amplification except by stating the respect in which the sentence is inadequate or excessive. It may be inadequate or excessive because the wrong type of sentence has been imposed (for example, custodial rather than non-custodial) or because the sentence imposed is manifestly too long or too short. But to identify the type of error amounts to no more than a statement of the conclusion that has been reached. It is not a statement of reasons for arriving at the conclusion. A Court of Criminal Appeal is not obliged to employ any particular verbal formula so long as the substance of its conclusions and its reason is made plain. The degree of elaboration that is appropriate or possible will vary from case to case.

96In the submission filed in support of the Crown appeal in 2009, and maintained in the submissions filed in support of this appeal, the Crown contends that the sentence failed to adequately reflect the seriousness of her offending, including what the Crown identified as an aggravating factor additional to those found by the sentencing judge, since the intended victim of the offence was the father of her children who would have been deprived of their father and his role in their lives were the attack to have proved fatal (see Benitez v R [2006] NSWCCA 21; 160 A Crim R 166 at [44]). In the Crown submissions, the sentencing judge's failure to make a proper and informed assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending was compounded by using the appellant's motive, such as it appeared from the evidence at trial, to reduce the objective seriousness of her offending (seemingly by reducing her moral culpability for it). Although the Crown submissions on the present appeal departed from the Crown's submissions on the Crown appeal, post Muldrock, as to the significance of the standard non-parole period, the Crown maintained the submission that, in the sentencing remarks and in the sentence actually imposed, the sentencing judge failed to pay proper heed to the significance of the maximum penalty and the need for the sentence to reflect the fact that an intention to kill is an essential ingredient of the offence of solicit to murder. 

97Although the Crown did not submit that there was any proper warrant for the imposition of the maximum penalty in this case (having made no submission that it might be viewed as in, or close to, a category of worst case), a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years for the gravity of the appellant's offending, even with consideration given to her favourable subjective circumstances, was to fail to reflect the fact that to solicit a person to kill someone is itself a most serious offence and the appellant's conduct is a most serious example of it (see R v Potier [2004] NSWCCA 136 at [55]).

98In this Court, the appellant submitted that the Crown has failed to establish that the sentence was manifestly inadequate irrespective of whether that assessment is informed by the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2009 or by this Court undertaking its own enquiry without reference to that decision. In the appellant's supplementary submissions, it was suggested that the view of the Court of Criminal Appeal as expressed by Howie J at [112] that the original sentence was ""half of what it should have been"" was an analysis infected with Muldrock error, since the Court was comparing the original sentence with the sentence it would have imposed were it not hearing a Crown appeal. There is some force in that submission. Although I consider the approach by Howie J to the evidence bearing upon the objective seriousness of the offending to be a principled approach, and although I regard his Honour's consideration of the relevance of the issue of motive to the appellant's moral culpability supported by authority both in the context of an offence of solicit to murder and more generally, on my own review of the evidence I am driven to conclude that the offending reveals a high degree of objective seriousness and serious moral culpability in the absence of any significant factors mitigating that finding. I am unable to see how the appellant's desire to be rid of her former husband to secure her custody of their children by having him killed does anything at all to mitigate her offending. In the result, having regard to the combination of aggravating factors, including the circumstances in which the murderous attack was launched and the injuries that were inflicted, and the relatively modest weight that can be afforded her prior good character, I am satisfied that the sentence is unreasonable and plainly unjust. In this case there was such a disconnect between the offending and the factors bearing upon the appellant's subjective circumstances that the only conclusion is that the sentence imposed at first instance was ""manifestly too short"" (see Dinsdale at [6]).

99The pendency of the Family Court proceedings to the commission of the offence, coupled with the evidence that the appellant wanted her former husband to ""disappear"", lends very great weight to the submission, advanced by the Crown in 2009, that in contracting Williams to have her former husband killed the appellant was, by necessary inference, attempting to interfere with the due process of the Family Court proceedings by foreclosing on their outcome in her favour. As the Crown pointed out, the appellant admitted under cross-examination that the proceedings in which her former husband sought custody were costly and that a hearing which was listed in October 2006 would have necessarily entailed more expense. The fact that these additional dimensions to her wish to have her former husband killed were not proved to the satisfaction of the sentencing judge to the criminal standard was an unduly favourable finding which, in the circumstances of a review of the Crown appeal, I would not disturb. 

Residual discretion

100Manifest error having been established in the sentence imposed and patent error in the reasoning of the sentencing judge, having regard to the limiting purpose of Crown appeals the question whether the Crown appeal ought to have been allowed does not admit of an easy answer. While the principles are clear (see Malvoso v R [1989] HCA 58; 168 CLR 227; 43 A Crim R 451; Everett v R [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295; 74 A Crim R 241; R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42; 71 NSWLR 692 at [70]) and I can discern nothing in the approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal to suggest that the Court was unaware of them (Howie J having made it clear at [14] that the sentence ultimately imposed on re-sentence was reduced by reason of double jeopardy principles), the evidence available at that time bearing on the exercise of the residual discretion cannot be readily disentangled from the evidence upon which the appellant relies in seeking to have the residual discretion exercised in her favour at this time. 

101Another difficult question which also does not admit of an easy answer is whether the sentence imposed by the primary judge was so outside the appropriate range for offending against s 26 of the Crimes Act (not using the standard non-parole period in s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act prescriptively, using it as a yardstick or indicator of an appropriate sentence) that intervention is required to govern and guide sentencing courts and to avoid a manifestly inadequate sentence being undisturbed (per Barwick CJ in Griffiths v The Queen [1977] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293 at [310] as applied in Green v R; Quinn v R at [1] and [36]). Since no submissions were directed to this question and where no comparative cases were referred to, I do not regard it an exercise that should be undertaken on this appeal.

102Doing the best I can to make an informed judgment in this case, and after taking into account the principle of double jeopardy and the exercise of the residual discretion to dismiss the Crown appeal at this time despite the erroneous leniency of the sentence, I have concluded that the Crown appeal should be allowed (or would have been allowed in 2009 absent Muldrock error). 

103The exercise of the residual discretion was considered most recently in R v Reeves [2014] NSWCCA 154 where the Court (Bathurst CJ, Hall and RA Hulme JJ) said:

[13] In exercising the residual discretion, it is for the appellate court to answer two questions:

(1) Whether, notwithstanding the inadequacy of the sentence, the Court should decline, in the exercise of its ""residual discretion"" under s 5D, to allow the appeal and thereby interfere with the sentence appealed from. 

(2) To what extent, if the appeal is allowed, the sentence appealed from should be varied: Green v R; Quinn v R at [35].

[14] In Green v R; Quinn v R it was noted by the plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ), quoting Griffiths v The Queen [1997] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293 at 310 [53] (Barwick CJ), that the primary purpose of Crown appeals against sentence is ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons"": at [1]. This was similarly expressed in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at [70]:

""... the purpose of a Crown appeal is not simply to increase an erroneous sentence imposed upon a particular individual. It has a wider purpose, being to achieve consistency in sentencing and the establishment of sentencing principles. That purpose can be achieved to a very significant extent by a statement of this Court that the sentences imposed upon the respondent were wrong and why they were wrong.""

[15] This purpose is a ""limiting purpose"" that does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges. Rather, it provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion: Green v R; Quinn v R at [36].

[16] Accordingly, it has been held that it may be appropriate for the appellate court, in the exercise of its discretion, to dismiss a Crown appeal where ""circumstances may combine to produce the result that if the appeal is allowed the guidance provided to sentencing judges will be limited and the decision will occasion injustice"": Green v R; Quinn v R at [2]. 

104The interests of justice require the imposition of appropriate sentences for serious offending (see R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 at [264] citing R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56 at [126]). This is a matter to which I have given predominant weight in declining to exercise the residual discretion in the appellant's favour.

105I am also of the view, however, that the sentence imposed on re-sentence in 2009 cannot be sustained (principally because it is infected by Muldrock error) and that a lesser sentence than that imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal should be imposed, utilising the maximum penalty of 25 years and the standard non-parole period of 10 years as important indicators to an appropriate sentence.

106In considering the re-sentencing discretion that is enlivened by that finding, and after taking into account the appellant's subjective circumstances following the successful Crown appeal in 2009, as deposed to in the affidavits filed on this appeal, including the significant personal advancements she has made while in custody since then (despite the active steps she has taken to challenge her conviction after her conviction appeal was dismissed and the maintenance of her denial of guilt); the fact that her classification as a prisoner was downgraded as a consequence of the very significant increase in her sentence in 2009 with a corresponding diminution of her conditions in custody; and the fact that she has already once been through a Crown appeal, I would preserve the finding of special circumstances by the sentencing judge and impose a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years.

107The orders I propose are as follows:

1. The appeal is allowed.

2. The sentence imposed by this Court on 20 March 2009 is quashed.

3. In lieu thereof the appellant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 years comprised of a non-parole period of 8 years and a balance of term of 4 years. The sentence is to commence on 25 September 2008. The appellant is eligible to be released to parole on 24 September 2016.

108R A HULME J: I agree with the reasoning and conclusions of Leeming JA in relation to the nature of this Court's jurisdiction.

109To my mind there can be no doubt that the subject matter of the ""quasi-appeal"", as Leeming JA has referred to it, is the sentence imposed by this Court. There was an application to the Supreme Court for an inquiry into a sentence (s 78(1)). The sentence in respect of which the inquiry was sought was the one imposed by this Court in 2009, not that which was imposed in the District Court in 2008. Upon referral of the whole case to this Court to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act (s 79(1)(b)) this Court is required to deal with the case so referred in the same way as if Ms Louizos had appealed against ""the ... sentence"" (s 86). As Leeming JA has pointed out (at [15]), there is only one extant sentence, that which was imposed in 2009.

110This is not the first occasion the Court has had a sentence previously imposed by it referred under Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. In none of the three cases of which I am aware has it been doubted that the sentence in question is the one imposed by this Court. 

111In Kazzi v R [2014] NSWCCA 73, the appellant had been resentenced by this Court upon a successful Crown appeal: R v Kazzi [2008] NSWCCA 77. It was contended that there had been Muldrock error in the resentencing exercise but the contention failed. In the course of discussing generally the nature of the jurisdiction being exercised by the Court, Leeming JA said (at [9]):

""the sentence imposed in 2008 by this Court pursuant to s 5D(1) is taken to be a sentence supporting a further appeal"". 

112Button J, with whom R S Hulme AJ agreed, referred (at [40]) to a submission made by the appellant's counsel that there was an issue as to whether it was this Court's sentence, or the original sentence imposed in the District Court, that was the subject of the appeal. But counsel, upon reflection, conceded that the District Court sentence had been quashed and the appeal was concerned with this Court's sentence. The judgment of Button J continued in apparent acceptance of this approach.

113In RJA v R [2014] NSWCCA 89 and MLP v R [2014] NSWCCA 183, appeals against the severity of sentences had been allowed and this Court had resentenced: RJA v R [2008] NSWCCA 137; 185 A Crim R 178 and MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; 164 A Crim R 93. The matters came back to this Court via Pt 7 referrals. Muldrock error in the resentencing exercises by this Court was established. In both cases the Court turned immediately to a consideration of whether a lesser sentence was warranted and should have been passed: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act. 

114I agree with Fullerton J as to the disposition of this appeal but I do so through a reasoning process consistent with the jurisdictional issue as explained by Leeming JA. The starting point is that error has been established (and conceded) in the reasoning of this Court in 2009 as to the sentence it imposed. A question of resentencing is thereby enlivened. Her Honour has expressed conclusions in relation to the objective gravity of the offending with which I agree. She has also considered the appellant's subjective circumstances including the evidence provided in the event of resentence. I am of the view that a lesser sentence is warranted and should have been passed: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act. Although her Honour has also factored the ""double jeopardy"" principle that formerly applied to Crown appeals into her assessment of sentence, I nevertheless agree that the 12 year term, with a non-parole period of 8 years, is the lesser sentence that is warranted.

2765211,Johnston v Rooty Hill RSL Club Pty Limited (No 2) [2014] NSWDC 258,"Judgment

1. Introduction


	
	After a late night at the Rooty Hill RSL Club owned by the defendant (""the Club"") William Johnston slipped and fell outside in the car park fracturing his wrist and ankle. He sues the Club in negligence.
	


2. Background


	
	Mr Johnston visited the Club with his two sons on Saturday evening, 24 July 2010. He said they arrived at about 9pm; his son, Allen Johnston, said the arrival time was 5pm or 6pm; and his wife, Jill Johnston, who did not attend with him, said it was about 10pm. Mr Johnston and his sons spent the time together drinking schooners of full strength beer and playing the poker machines.
	
	
	At some time after 1am, perhaps after 3am, Mr Johnston decided to leave. The Club had a practice of closing the front eastern doors at 12 midnight, so the means of exit were through the rear western doors, which open onto the main car park, and a taxi rank. The Club also provided a courtesy bus for local patrons like Mr Johnston who lived within five kilometres of the club.
	
	
	When Mr Johnston exited the club, he found a number of people waiting for a taxi. He said in evidence-in-chief that this was the first time he had left by the western exit, but he accepted in cross-examination that he had previously used this exit and had caught a taxi or the courtesy bus home when using this exit. He accepted that he could have waited for a cab or arranged to use the courtesy bus.
	
	
	The weather was wet. There was no evidence that Mr Johnston had an umbrella. Nevertheless, Mr Johnston determined to go to the main road to the east of the club in search of a taxi. This involved him walking some distance south through the car park, turning to the east to walk past the loading dock and southern end of the club and then turning north. He did not get that far.
	
	
	Mr Johnston walked south. He was wearing ""joggers"" for footwear, which he said were in reasonable condition. The lighting enabled him to see where he was walking and the things in front of him.
	
	
	When he reached the last car to his left he turned sharply to his left. He said that the lighting went very dark, however, he was able to see a kerb in front of the last car. He claimed that initially he thought the kerb was a footpath.
	
	
	In front (that is, to the east) of the last two or three cars to Mr Johnston's left as he walked south, with the club to his left, was a small triangular garden bed. Beyond that was a driveway down to the loading dock. A concrete kerb bordered the garden bed. At its southern extremity, one corner of the triangle, the two sides were in filled with concrete in a semicircular shape, the rounded side to the south. The kerb at that point had a diameter of about 3 or 4 feet or so. The statement of claim called this area of concrete at the southern end of the garden bed a concrete kerb and I will adopt the same terminology. This was the kerb seen by Mr Johnston.
	
	
	The concrete kerb was painted yellow on its western face and southwestern face. On the eastern side at the top, and perhaps on its eastern edge, it was painted white. I infer that the painting was to alert vehicles parking or using the loading dock, or travelling in that vicinity, and perhaps also to alert pedestrians to the presence of the edge of the kerb.
	
	
	Mr Johnston, notwithstanding the asserted darkness and with no obstacles blocking movement to the more lighted area to the south, turned eastward and soon stepped onto the concrete kerb at the end of the garden bed. He then took a second step, said he noticed that his foot went an extra inch or so lower and his front foot then slipped for 6 inches off the end of the kerb and onto the roadway whereupon Mr Johnston fell forward and suffered the injuries to his wrist and hand.
	
	
	Mr Johnston noticed problems with his arm and leg. He crawled to the covered area in front of the loading dock and telephoned his sons. They came within five minutes and with him took a taxi to Mt Druitt Hospital. The hospital triage records indicate that Mr Johnston presented at emergency at about 3.42am and that at 4.27am his arm was put in a sling and he was given some Panadeine Forte and Endone for pain and advised to return later as X-rays were not presently available.
	


3. Credit


	
	The defendant did not submit that Mr Johnston was dishonest with his evidence, nor did I find anything in Mr Johnston's evidence to suggest this. His evidence was not only honestly given but also generally balanced. He made several concessions including some in evidence-in-chief. However, his evidence was not always accurate. He gave evidence that the fall happened early on a Saturday morning, that he had never used the western exit, that his arm was not put in a sling at the hospital and that he had received no pain medication. All of these matters were either conceded by him to be wrong subsequently, or disproved by other evidence including contemporaneous documents.
	
	
	The defendant also raised other matters.
	
	
	First, it was submitted that Mr Johnston did not merely visit the club fortnightly as he asserted, because this was the third day in succession that he had visited the club. Mr Johnston was on leave from work at the time, which may explain a variation from his usual practice when working. There was nothing to indicate that his estimate of the frequency with which he visited the club was substantially different from his actual usual practice. On the other hand, that he was on leave was another matter he wrongly denied, although not a matter of particular significance.
	
	
	Secondly, the defendant submitted that the plaintiff did not arrive at 9pm and depart at 1am after five beers, as he said, but rather arrived at five or 6pm and departed after 3am intoxicated, having consumed more than ten beers.
	
	
	I was not satisfied that the plaintiff's estimate of arrival at 9pm was inaccurate. That it conflicted with his son Allenâs estimate may have been a reflection on the reliability of his son's recollection. The events were perhaps of more significance to Mr Johnston.
	
	
	The fact that Mr Johnston's other son was available but did not give evidence may mean that I must infer that his evidence could not have helped Mr Johnston in accordance with Jones v Dunkel. It does not mean that I should conclude that the other son would have corroborated Allen Johnstonâs estimate of a 5pm to 6pm arrival time.
	
	
	I do not attribute any real significance to the different estimates of drinks per hour given by Allen Johnston compared to Mr Johnston's evidence as to the amount of beers he consumed. I think it is likely that Mr Johnston left the club closer to 3am than 1am principally because of the hospital records, but that does not persuade me to any significant extent that it was more likely than not that he was intoxicated.
	
	
	I note that the hospital records indicated âintoxicatedâ although not with any level of intoxication specified.
	
	
	Mr Johnston gave evidence that he had never drunk alcohol so as to be slurring his speech or stumbling in his walk. He had not been refused service on the night or any other night at the club and I accept his evidence that he was not intoxicated, that is, drunk or manifestly affected by alcohol at the time of his fall. He had been drinking alcohol, it was wet, he had no umbrella, he wanted to get home, and he wanted to get to the front of the club to catch a taxi. These matters may have made him move with undue haste and be less observant than an average person in other circumstances might have been.
	
	
	I do not find there is any application of the intoxication provisions in Pt 6 of the Civil Liability Act 2002. I do not find he was intoxicated to the extent that his capacity to exercise reasonable care and skill was impaired.
	
	
	Further, if Mr Johnston were intoxicated, I find that the injuries were likely to have occurred even if he had not been intoxicated, once he had determined to go to the front of the club in haste, in the rain, ignoring the darkness he asserted was present when determining his route of travel and deciding to step onto a kerb.
	
	
	Whilst this decision might have been unwise, plainly not all unwise decisions are attributable to excessive alcohol consumption. I am not persuaded that Mr Johnston's unwise decision on this particular night should be attributed to him being under the influence of alcohol.
	
	
	I also generally accept Mr Johnston's evidence as to the effect of his injuries.
	


4. Liability


	
	According to allegations in the statement of claim, the negligence of the Club included ""[h]aving on the premises a sloping concrete kerb which was extremely slippery when wet"", a failure to treat the kerb with nonslip paint, failure to warn of the slippery, dangerous surface, a failure to ensure the area was well lit, a failure to barricade a slippery kerb to prevent walking on it and a failure to provide an exit to an area where taxis were available. It is convenient largely to deal with each of these matters separately.
	


(a) Sloping, slippery when wet concrete kerb on the premises


	
	Mr Johnston led no evidence to identify in any measurable way the level of slope of the concrete kerb or the extent of the slipperiness whether when wet or dry. Neil Adams, an ergonomist who has taken slip resistance measurements in many other cases, did not do so in this instance. He gave evidence that he felt the surface and said that it was ""smooth painted surface with no asperities of the type I would expect to feel"" and that the adjacent concrete surface was ""substantially rougher"". Mr Adams did not refer to the gradient of the concrete kerb.
	
	
	One of the photographs (Exhibit D upper photo) appeared to indicate that the kerb sloped down to the east. However, after analysing that photo, including the apparent slope of the roadway from west to east, I was left unsatisfied that the photo fairly indicated the gradient. I accept that there was some slope down to the east but there was little evidence to assist me as to the level of the downward slope and none to indicate the significance of the extent of the downward slope on the level of slipperiness.
	
	
	Mr Johnston stated that his foot went down an inch or so. If I infer that his step was say 33 inches, in quantitative terms that would indicate a slope of about 3% (or 2 degrees), but I do not think I can safely draw this conclusion as to the gradient from this estimate by Mr Johnston. In any event, it does not assist me without other expert guidance as to what significance a 3% gradient has on the matter of slip resistance. Nor do I know how this gradient differs from the surrounding gradient of the roadway.
	
	
	Section 5B of the Civil Liability Act 2002 provides:
	


â5B General principles

(1) A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless:

(a) the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known), and

(b) the risk was not insignificant, and

(c) in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the personâs position would have taken those precautions.

(2) In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following (amongst other relevant things):

(a) the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken,

(b) the likely seriousness of the harm,

(c) the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm,

(d) the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm.â


	
	Mr Johnston did not assert that the concrete kerb constituted a not insignificant risk of harm in good lighting. He submitted that in those conditions the kerb could be simply avoided by taking a step to the right. Slipperiness alone was not pressed as a sufficient basis to establish negligence.
	
	
	Consistent with this submission and leaving aside the issue of the lighting, I am not persuaded that the slipperiness of the kerb presented a not insignificant risk of harm. It was not a footpath or a pedestrian walkway of any sort. Although it was located at the end of a parking area, there was no evidence as to the extent, if at all, it protruded beyond the last vehicle. Had it done so, it might potentially have constituted a trip hazard, which may provide some reason for the yellow and perhaps white paint on its side. But, in this case, there was no trip alleged or occasioned.
	
	
	It is apparent that painted surfaces are commonly walked upon: pedestrian crossings and lines indicating parking spaces are but two obvious examples. Merely because a surface is painted does not establish that it is insufficiently slip resistant.
	
	
	Standards for slip resistance, presumably, depend in part upon the purpose of the surface. The fact that this was a kerb and that this kerb was not a pedestrian walkway is likely to be of relevance in determining whether a standard (and if so what) is applicable. I accept the principle in Shoalhaven City Council v Pender [2013] NSWCA 210 at [47] urged upon me by the defendant:
	


âIn order for the respondent to succeed against the appellant, he had to adduce evidence supporting a positive inference implying negligence on its part, an inference which arose as an affirmative conclusion from the evidence and one which was established to the reasonable satisfaction of a judicial mind. The evidence had to rise above the level of conjecture, could not be based on possibilities but had to be established as a matter of probability, and had to do more than give rise to conflicting inferences of equal degrees of probabilityâ.


	
	Similarly, the circumstance that the place where the fall occurred was not a pedestrian walkway is critical, in my view, in determining whether or not there was a duty to take care to ensure it was slip resistant or to paint it with a slip resistant coating. The Club cannot be obliged to coat every surface not a public walkway with a slip resistant coating, and if not all surfaces why this one. Section 5B(2)(a) and (c) of the Civil Liability Act 2002 and also s 5C(a) and (b) militate against such a burden.
	
	
	I find the Club was not so obliged, again noting that this aspect of the case was not pressed as sufficient in itself for negligence.
	


(b) Failure to treat the kerb with nonslip paint


	
	This matter received no attention at trial. There was no evidence of the type of paint, whether white or yellow, that was used or could have been used on the kerb. There was no evidence that non-slip paint was not used (a matter Mr Adams did not address) and no evidence of how it should have been applied, to what part of the kerb, and what difference it would have made.
	
	
	In any event, for the reasons I have already given, I do not accept that reasonable care required painting this kerb with non-slip paint since it was not a surface that was intended to be or would reasonably appear to be a pedestrian walkway. There could be no duty to render slip resistant every external surface on the club property, even every external, horizontal, near ground level surface, irrespective of whether it was a pedestrian walkway or not.
	


(c) Failure to warn of slippery surface and failure to barricade the slippery kerb


	
	These particulars of negligence were also not the focus of the plaintiff's submission at trial and must also fail because of the failure to prove the ""slippery surface"" as found above.
	


(d) Failure to provide an exit area where taxis were available


	
	Mr Johnston conceded in evidence that taxis were available at the western exit and, thus, this particular of negligence must fail. Evidence that the eastern exit was not kept open after midnight because of the cost of employing three additional staff is of no significance.
	


(e) Failure to ensure the area was well lit


	
	This was the primary focus of Mr Johnston's case. It relied upon his evidence that after he turned to proceed east, around the southern area of the club, he was in darkness and could only see two foot in front of him.
	
	
	Mr Johnston faced a number of challenges in this aspect of the claim.
	
	
	First, Mr Adams, retained by the plaintiff, performed testing at night and found that the lighting in the area of the fall was adequate. The lighting at the time of Mr Adams' testing consisted of floodlights on the upper parts of the walls of the club, lights in the car park, and light emanating from the loading dock area and the internal sections of the club. Mr Adams inferred that some of this lighting was not present at the time of Mr Johnston's fall and, in particular, the floodlights. But the evidence was largely to the contrary.
	
	
	The floodlights mounted near the roof of the club were accepted to be present at the time of Mr Johnston's fall by Allen Johnston and by Mr Johnston. Mr Adams determined these floodlights to ""[provide] adequate levels of illumination in the subject area"".
	
	
	Secondly, Mr Johnston accepted in cross-examination that although he thought, ""from a distance [the kerb] was a footpath"" and therefore went to stand on it, he, nevertheless, saw the kerb and recognised that it was a kerb in sufficient time to enable him to ""step up"" onto it and also saw and recognised that he would ""have to immediately step off"" the kerb.
	
	
	Thus, the only significance to him of the lighting was that, potentially, he was unable to discern the increased level of slipperiness. But as I have found inadequate slip resistance not to be satisfactorily established, it removes the foundation of the plaintiff's claim. Mr Johnston did not fall because of inadequate light but because, as he says, he slipped on the surface.
	
	
	If the slipperiness of the surface is not satisfactorily established, then there can be no negligence that is causative of the fall. It was argued that had the lighting been better, Mr Johnston would have avoided the kerb as a person in daylight might be expected to do. But Mr Johnston conceded that ""even reasonably close to the kerb"" he could see it was a kerb, and that, if he ""stepped up,"" he would have to ""immediately step off.""
	
	
	In my view, on Mr Johnston's evidence, the lighting became irrelevant before Mr Johnston stepped onto the kerb. In any event, I am not persuaded that the lighting did anything other than provide adequate levels of illumination.
	
	
	The plaintiff perceived a need to establish that the floodlights were either not working or directed away from the relevant area, at the time of the fall, and thus were different from how they were on the night Mr Adams performed his illumination tests. But there was no evidence to this effect. The floodlight globes last three years, and there were two floodlights reasonably proximate to the kerb where Mr Johnston fell. Allen Johnston gave evidence that he returned to the scene a couple of days later, prior to any report of the fall, and the area was said by him to be well lit with the floodlights working.
	
	
	The maintenance records did not indicate any lighting maintenance in the period between the fall and the subsequent visit by Allen Johnston, nor was any maintenance on the lights shown some two weeks later when the monthly inspection was carried out. Nor was there any evidence to establish that the angle of focus of the floodlights mounted high on the walls of the club were altered in the intervening period. There was evidence, which I accept, that the lighting came on automatically one hour before sunset and switched off an hour after sunrise.
	
	
	Although the external lighting system was controlled by computer, it was capable of being overridden. But there was no evidence that any overriding of the lighting system occurred on this day. If the computer system had failed, apparently all the lights rather than just those above the loading dock would have failed. This did not occur.
	
	
	Both Mr Johnston and Allen Johnston gave evidence of darkness near the loading dock. I accept that there are shadowed areas including immediately in front of the loading dock. This may have made it difficult for Allen Johnston and his brother to see Mr Johnston when they came to his aid shortly after the fall. That is not where the fall occurred. There was nothing capable of causing shadows on the concrete kerb, and I am not satisfied that lighting was inadequate in that area.
	
	
	I note that there were bollard lights in a garden bed close to the kerb at the time of the fall that were not present at the time of Mr Adams' test. In the circumstances, I am unable to give them any significance, nor do I give any significance to the change in lighting from the southern car park, given Mr Adams' conclusions, which focus on the overhead floodlights.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am not persuaded that the area around the relevant concrete kerb was other than ""adequately illuminated"" on the night of the accident.
	
	
	For all these reasons, in my view, Mr Johnston has not made out a case for breach of duty in relation to the lighting of the area of the accident or that the lighting was causative of the accident. I was not persuaded that Mr Johnston walked on the kerb because of inadequate lighting, he having noticed that it was a kerb before he walked on it.
	
	
	This case differed from Port Macquarie Hastings Council v Mooney [2014] NSWCA 156 in that the subject area here was adequately illuminated, not established to be slippery and the kerb was seen by Mr Johnston.
	
	
	In case I am wrong, I should say something about my view on damages.
	


5. Damages


	
	Mr Johnston worked for many years as a forklift driver and continues to do so. He had a fractured ankle in 1993, but that seems to have been of no real consequence. He also underwent repair of a pneumothorax in November 2005. As a result of the fall on 25 July 2010, Mr Johnston underwent surgery on his right wrist and left ankle including open reduction and internal fixation on the distal radial fracture and open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture of the right calcaneus. The left heel wound became infected and in November 2010 Mr Johnston was readmitted to hospital where the screws were removed and it was surgically cleaned. Subsequently, a vacuum assisted closure (âVACâ) dressing was applied for ten days on 21 December 2010. Mr Johnston did not return to work until 28 February 2011.
	
	
	In mid-2012 Mr Johnston developed pain in the left groin due to a left artery stenosis or occlusion, unrelated to the accident. An artery stent was inserted in November 2012, and Mr Johnston was off work from October 2012 until November 2013. Mr Johnston saw this as his major problem. It prevented him from doing physical labour including mowing the lawn, although he may have ceased mowing the lawn after the fall. Mr Johnston also had a further period off work in May and June of this year as a result of an injury to his right hand, unrelated to the fall.
	
	
	As to the various components of damage, the plaintiff submits that I should assess the non-economic loss of the plaintiff at 35%, but I accept the upper end of the defendant's estimate of 26% of a most serious case, which equates to a sum of $46,000 for non-economic loss. I note that Mr Johnson is still working and able to work but he does notice issues in both his wrist and ankle and experiences pain especially after a long day of work.
	
	
	The past out-of-pocket expenses are agreed at $1,276. As to future out-of-pocket expenses there is a prospect that Mr Johnston may have an operation to remove the metal plate in his wrist at a cost of $8,000. However, that is not advised because of his vascular problems and so far he has followed the advice of his doctors in that regard. There is a real possibility that improvement in his vascular problems or a change of mind in relation to the plate may cause him to decide to have the operation to remove the plate. That cost would be directly attributable to the fall. He also has the need for occasional painkillers. I would award the sum of $10,000 for future out-of-pockets.
	
	
	In terms of past economic loss, the plaintiff was off work after the accident for a period of 32 weeks. The defendant's calculation of the amount of loss in this regard exceeds the plaintiff's. I accept the defendant's figures of a loss of $26,560 ($830 per week) on the basis that they are derived from the tax return, which may include overtime amounts that are not included in the defendant's figures. That produces an amount for lost past superannuation of $2,992.
	
	
	In terms of future economic loss, the plaintiff sought the sum of $100,000 whereas the defendant submitted a sum of $20,000 including future superannuation loss. The plaintiff's ability to work since the accident, from February 2011 without interruption save for matters unrelated to the accident, suggests that his fall is unlikely to be the cause of any inability in the future to work as a forklift driver.
	
	
	It may be that Mr Johnston will be unable to work a normal working life. But that is far more likely to be due to his vascular problems, which he accepted were his major issue. In that event, I am persuaded to award the sum suggested by the defendant of $20,000 as a buffer for the possibility of future economic loss attributable to the fall, an amount in the order of six monthsâ earnings.
	
	
	That leaves the question of past and future care. There was some evidence of regular care provided to Mr Johnston by his wife until about Christmas 2010. However, since the accident happened on 25 July 2010 Mr Johnston needs to establish that care and assistance were necessary until at least 25 January 2011 to reach the six-month threshold provided in s 15(3) of the Civil Liability Act 2002.
	
	
	The evidence relied upon by Mr Johnston in relation to care and assistance was given by his wife in these terms:
	


âQ. By the time you get to January 2011 how much time each day on average were you spending doing either extra housework or tasks assisting your husband personally because of his injuries?

A. Probably about an hour.

Q. Once he went back to work did you continue doing those extra things for a while or not?

A. Not helping my husband, no, he didn't need help then.â


	
	Mrs Johnston thus accepted that she was not still doing things for him ""[b]y the time he got back to work"".
	
	
	Mrs Johnston was also asked:
	


âQ. In that period from Christmas up until the time he went back to work was he having to rest his foot?

A. Yes.

Q. Were you having to help him with dressing or bathing or anything at that time?

A. Yes, because he had the VAC on so I had to help him with the cords and the cables from the VAC machine.

Q. Around the time of that infection did you then go back up to doing more for him again or not?

A. Not really.â


	
	The VAC was in place for the last 10 days of December 2010 and Mr Johnston gave evidence that he was able to get around with it attached. Thus, the reference to the VAC machine seems to confine the time of the assistance to the period ending at the end of December 2010 or the very beginning of January 2011. The assistance had certainly ended by the time Mr Johnston went back to work at the end of February 2011.
	
	
	I think the words ""By the time you get to January 2011"" should be read as referring to the beginning of January 2011. In the intervening period before the return to work, that is January and February 2011, I can only speculate as to whether help was needed and provided, as the evidence does not address this period.
	
	
	That is not enough to discharge the burden on the plaintiff. The absence of evidence that care was being provided up to the end of January 2011, rather than up to the time when the VAC machine was (or ceased) being used, means that the six-month threshold had not been reached and therefore no past care can be awarded.
	
	
	Nor am I satisfied that any future care due to Mr Johnston's injuries from the fall is likely to be necessary. Mr Johnston conceded that, as I mentioned, the other injuries, namely, his vascular problems and the stent were more significant than those that resulted from the fall.
	
	
	Thus, on my calculations the damages amount would have been $106,828.

		09 February 2015",2014-11-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765216,R v Heath [2014] NSWDC 351,"Judgment


	
	Daniel Heath is a young man who turned just twenty earlier this year. He has had a disrupted youth. I say that because he got himself involved in alcohol and drugs in his teenage years. He started to use cannabis at fourteen and taking alcohol at fifteen. He left school and started an apprenticeship as a boilermaker but, as a presentence report says, âlost this position due to illicit substance abuseâ.
	
	
	His personal circumstances are set out at length in a helpful report by the psychiatrist Dr Christopher Bench. I have no reason to doubt the information contained in that report. He dealt with his difficulties and challenges by drinking too much and by the daily use of cannabis.
	
	
	In January this year he had a car accident. It was his fault. He ended up with debts of over $8,000. He reacted to this by starting to use amphetamines. As the Court well knows, the effect of that was to become very quickly addicted.
	
	
	Under the influence of alcohol and amphetamines, and weighed down by his financial obligations, he spontaneously decided one night to rob the local takeaway noodle store in Tanilba Bay where he lives.
	
	
	He turned up with a machete and an imitation gun. He pointed them towards the proprietor MsÂ Feng. Ms Feng told him that he could take the money and as he walked towards her she turned and ran away. Daniel Heath then chased her, saying, âYou get the money for me.â She agreed to do that. He again pointed the machete at her and they walked towards the cash register again before MsÂ Feng again ran away. Again Daniel Heath chased her. Ms Feng was screaming as she ran. Then she stopped, turned and, as the agreed facts say, âstood still and screamed in fear. She raised her fists. The offender stopped, turned and ran away.â However, Ms Feng was not to be stopped. She âwent back inside the store and armed herself with a knife.â The police arrived and found that Daniel Heath had left his backpack with his mobile phone.
	
	
	They called on him at his home and he admitted doing the crime. He said that he had gone because âhe wanted moneyâ. He had researched the internet on how to make an imitation gun âfrom paper and plastic tapeâ. He had covered his face so that he would not be recognised. The facts record that his âmotivation was to obtain money to pay fines flowing from a recent car accident.â He acknowledged what he had done as âthe stupidest thing to do everâ and acknowledged the fear that he must have put into Ms Feng.
	
	
	As a result of that behaviour, he was charged with assaulting Ms Feng with intent to rob and armed with an offensive weapon. That is an offence against s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment.
	
	
	In other words, Daniel Heath, having got through his troubled life without any serious incident up till then, found himself charged with a very serious crime. Up till then he had no criminal record. Since then he has pleaded guilty to an offence of stalking and intimidating someone and possessing a prohibited drug. He got a good behaviour bond and a recorded conviction. His progress on the good behaviour bond is regarded as satisfactory.
	
	
	Daniel Heath lives with his grandparents in Cessnock in a positive and supportive relationship and also has a good relationship with his own parents.
	
	
	He is assessed as a low to medium risk of reoffending by Sanna Hutchinson, the author of the presentence report. She goes on to say this-
	


âMr Heath acknowledged the seriousness of his offence, and reported made efforts to change his circumstances, including relocating away from past poor associates and ceasing drug use. Whilst it is positive the offender has taken some initiatives, it would appear he would benefit from community based interventions to assist with relapse prevention and developing pro social skills.â

It is thought that he would benefit âfrom a period of supervision by Community Correctionsâ and strategies to help him with alcohol and drug intervention and securing employment.


	
	Dr Bench diagnosed Daniel Health with a depressive disorder, a social phobia and polysubstance dependence. His diagnoses are such that were he in the Local Court he could have been dealt with, according to Dr Benchâs opinion, under s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.
	
	
	I should add that after he was arrested he spent some time in custody, bail refused, which amounts, I am told by Mr Fitzhardinge who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, to be 125 days or some four months. Daniel Heath has pleaded guilty to the charge at what Mr Fitzhardinge acknowledges is at an early time.
	
	
	Since being bailed in July he has been on quite strict bail conditions. His mother, who is supportive of him, acknowledges that her son âneeds help by way of counselling, programmes, courses and supportâ.
	
	
	Mr Fitzgerald of counsel, who appears for Mr Heath, has applied to adjourn the sentence proceedings from today to a date next year, with a mention date in between, for the purpose of assessing his clientâs capacity and prospects for rehabilitation or demonstrating that rehabilitation has taken place.
	
	
	I am able to agree to such an adjournment under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Often such adjournments result in an offender demonstrating rehabilitation or his prospects and coming back to court where the judge imposes a sentence which does not involve fulltime custody. I asked Mr Fitzhardinge his attitude to such an application. He acknowledged that if rehabilitation is demonstrated then a sentence not involving fulltime custody would be an available option.
	
	
	Mr Fitzgerald proposed some conditions for the bail which would accompany the adjournment and I regard those as acceptable.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose to adjourn these proceedings for mention only.
	
	
	Under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I find Daniel Health guilty of the offence. I convict him of that offence. I make an order adjourning these proceedings to Thursday 18 December 2014 at 10am before me in Sydney. The purpose of the adjournment is to assess MrÂ Heathâs capacity and prospects for rehabilitation and for the purpose of allowing him to demonstrate that rehabilitation has taken place. I grant him bail until that date on the following conditions:
	



	
	To remain abstinent from prohibited drugs and alcohol
	
	
	To have regular urine drug screens
	
	
	To have regular mental health care monitoring by his general practitioner
	
	
	To comply with any recommendations or treatments by his general practitioner including but not limited to medication compliance, attendance at appointments and participation in individualised or group therapy.
	


HIS HONOUR:Â Â Â Now, Daniel Health, you have heard what I have said. Mr Fitzgerald suggested I adjourn your case and the prosecution has allowed it. I am adjourning it till December the 18th in Sydney and that is to see how you are going with dealing with your drug and alcohol problems. You are on bail till then. You will get a piece of paper that you have got to sign. You have got to stay off the grog and any prohibited drug. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: It is a condition of your bail. You have got to allow yourself to have regular urine screening. You have got to have - allow your GP - do you get on all right with the GP?

OFFENDER: Yep.

HIS HONOUR: Good. Is it a him or a her?

OFFENDER: Him.

HIS HONOUR: You have got to allow him to monitor your mental health and you have got to agree with any recommendations that he makes, including complying with his medication and going along to individualised or group therapy if he recommends that. They are conditions of your bail. We are going to bring you back in December to see how you are going and then probably adjourn it to March. Then if you are still on track in March, you will probably get a prison sentence but it will be suspended or might be some other form of limiting your freedom but not in gaol. That is what Mr Fitzgerald is hoping to be in a position to ask me to do. Do you understand all that?

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: So you are getting a chance. You are a young man who has made a serious mistake at this stage of your life but you are getting a chance from the system to put it right and start again. So good luck.

OFFENDER: Thank you.

HIS HONOUR: There will be a form for you to sign, a bail form, coming along.


	
	I direct a transcript of todayâs proceedings, including my remarks, to be available to me on or before Monday 15 December 2014.

		09 September 2015",2014-11-04 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765218,WorkCover Authority of NSW v Zisoglou [2014] NSWDC 371,"On 11 December 2010 at Thorp Road, Woronora Mr Vassilious Nikopoulos, a 19 year old apprentice electrician employed by the defendant Mr Bill Zisoglou, suffered severe and permanent brain damage in consequence of electrocution. He suffered these injuries because Mr Zisoglou failed to ensure that energy did not pass into the electrical circuit of a house upon which Mr Nikopoulos was working.
	
	
	Mr Zisoglou pleads guilty to the charge that, contrary to his duties pursuant to section 8(1) of the Occupational Health & Safety Act 2000 he failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of his employee Mr Nikopoulos.
	
	
	Mr Zisoglou was engaged to perform cabling work on the house. At the end of some of that work Mr Zisoglou restored the mains power to the house without checking that there was no fault in the system.
	
	
	Australian Standard ASNSZ 3000 of 2007 required that before the power be reconnected a meter be attached to the main board and the integrity of the system tested. These tests are fundamental, and if they had been performed on this occasion by Mr Zisoglou they would have detected the escape of electricity into the pipe that Mr Nikopoulos touched, causing his electrocution.
	
	
	The gravity of the offence is towards the upper end of the scale for two reasons. Firstly because of the nature of the possible and actual consequences, and secondly because of the ease with which the risk could have been averted. The testing would take no more than a minute.
	
	
	In circumstances where a straightforward standard is ignored the sentence should reflect a powerful statement of general deterrence.
	
	
	The circumstances also impose a need for specific deterrence. Although Mr Zisoglou asserted in his affidavit that he does not intend resuming work as a licensed electrical contractor, that is inconsistent with his other evidence that he expended costs in excess of $50,000 in persuading the Civil and Administrative Tribunal to reduce a life ban from holding a contractorâs licence to effectively a ban of six years.
	
	
	The penalty must express community denunciation of the circumstances in which Mr Nikopoulos has been deprived of a normal life. This has affected not only himself but also his family.
	
	
	In a victim impact statement by his father, Mr Nikopoulos senior says this:
	


âBilly requires constant care which is provided by his mother who has given up and re-arranged work to meet Billyâs needs. Additionally carers are provided by Allianz Insurers under the Work Cover scheme. Billy can now feed, dress and go to the bathroom himself, however Billyâs speech has not returned, he communicates using hand gestures. Our whole family has been affected emotionally and physically, especially Billyâs mother, stepfather, sister and brother who live with him and are constantly caring and supervising Billyâs condition. The injuries have left Billy with significant behavioural issues. He is aggressive at times and can be physical. He experiences episodes of psychosis. Billyâs condition frustrates him which leads to depressive moods.â


	
	The defendant submits that the penalty should be mitigated pursuant to the Fines Act 1996 in recognition of his limited capacity to pay. In this regard he bears the onus.
	
	
	His affidavit speaks of an income of only $52,500. He has however received large sums of capital, including $550,000 from the sale of two homes and possibly $350,000 in relation to sale of shares in a business. No evidence is given, apart from the defendantâs assertion, to confirm that it was dispersed in living expenses and in legal costs. No records are produced.
	
	
	It is sufficient to say that the defendant has not persuaded me that the penalty should be reduced in recognition of inability to pay.
	
	
	An appropriate penalty is in the upper range of the maximum $55,000. A penalty of $36,300 would otherwise be appropriate, however in recognition of co-operation with the authorities and the early plea of guilty he is entitled to a discount of 25%.
	
	
	The defendant is convicted and fined $27,225.
	
	
	I order the defendant to pay prosecution costs agreed in the sum of $15,000. Order that Work Cover have a moiety of the fine.

		14 December 2015",2014-11-05 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765222,R v Wortley [2014] NSWDC 212,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: The law is clear! those who are supplying prohibited drugs to a substantial degree must expect a sentence of full time custody unless there are exceptional circumstances.

2In this case the offender was arrested in possession of a significant quantity of amphetamines when he was on a train at Broadmeadow.

3He spent eight days in custody before being granted bail. One might have expected that being arrested in possession of drugs and charged with supplying drugs was a salutary experience but apparently not to Mr Wortley because a few months later he was arrested and found in possession of drugs which he intended to supply. Although it was a relatively small quantity on that second occasion, the fact is that Mr Wortley intended to sell them.

4The first offence came to light when police boarded a Country Link train that Mr Wortley was on. Police had with them a drugÂ detection dog, ""Yorkie"". ""Yorkie"" indicated an area of interest near Mr Wortley. He was searched and police found three separate bags of amphetamines. They totalled 47.3 grams of drugs. That was in August 2013. Evidence given today establishes that the offender had purchased those drugs in the Newcastle area intending to supply them.

5In December 2013 police at Gunnedah, where the offender lives, received some information that he was selling drugs in the dart's room of the Gunnedah Services and Bowling Club. They approached the dart's room. As they did so, they saw the offender leaving, they called out to him, and he ran off throwing a small resealable plastic bag away as he did so. That bag was found to contain 5.19 grams of methylamphetamine.

6The offender pleaded guilty to supplying the drugs found at Broadmeadow at the earliest opportunity and guilty to supplying the drugs in his possession at Gunnedah after being committed for trial to the District Court. Although he is entitled to more of a discount for the utilitarian value of his plea regarding the first matter and less of a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea regarding the second matter given the circumstance I am just about to mention, it becomes unnecessarily precise to specify different discounts for the utilitarian value of the two pleas.

7The offender has also to be granted the benefit of another discount. Exhibit B is an envelope and its contents, that envelope is to be sealed at the conclusion of today's proceedings and is not to be opened unless there is a further order of a judge of this Court or a superior court. For obvious reasons I will be circumspect about what I say. I have noted its contents. The offender is deserving of a significant discount for what he has done. Accordingly, the combined discount for plea and assistance would be something in the order of 40%. However, discounts are not always applied on a strictly numerical basis. I have reflected those discounts, not only in determining the length of the sentence I will shortly announce but also the manner in which it is to be served.

8The offender has a criminal history including, perhaps most relevantly, a conviction for supplying prohibited drugs. For that matter he received a suspended sentence of imprisonment. Really that did nothing to deter his drug dealing activities.

9The offender is now 32 years of age. He lives with his partner, Ms Eason, he is her carer. She in turn is the carer of those of her children who are currently living with them. When she met the offender she had three children and together the offender and Ms Eason have had two children. The two youngest, their children, do not live with them, having been taken away by DoCS. The oldest child does not live with them either, she lives independently with her own two children. One of the remaining two children lives with them but parental responsibility was the subject of orders made at the request of DoCS. Ms Eason has been diagnosed as suffering from bipolar disorder. When the offender was in custody bail refused for a two month period earlier this year she said she fell apart, she apparently relies on the offender.

10The offender left school in year 9 and has worked for some periods of time although for the last four years he has been in receipt of Centrelink benefits. He has plans for the future. He hopes to get a job with a friend of his mowing lawns although why he has not done that to date was not explained in evidence. He tells me that he has not used drugs for some time.

11I take into account of course the presentence custody and there were two separate periods totally two months and eight days. I do not take into account, because it is not exceptional, the hardship to any third parties which would be occasioned through the offender being sent to full time custody. As I said earlier, those who are trafficking to a substantial degree must expect to go to gaol unless there are exceptional circumstances. With one exception, the circumstances of case are depressingly ordinary. That exception concerns exhibit B. Not only is the offender entitled to be rewarded for what he has done but the circumstances in which he would serve a sentence of full time custody cannot be ignored.

12When I look at all of the matters that I must take into account in deciding what sentence to impose, I have concluded that a custodial sentence is required. I have decided on the length of that sentence and primarily because of the contents of exhibit B, I have determined that if appropriate and if suitable it may well be the case that I order that the offender serve that sentence by means of an Intensive Corrections Order.

13Accordingly, I will grant bail to the offender and order that a report as to his suitability to serve a sentence of imprisonment by means of an Intensive Corrections Order be prepared. It will be a condition of that bail, and I expect that this will be done as part of the assessment procedure anyway, that Mr Wortley be subject to urinalysis as often as Probation and Parole require it in order to determine whether he has, as he told me, truly given up using drugs.

		10 December 2014",2014-11-05 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765224,Kerr v R [2014] NSWCCA 235,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Harrison J.

2HARRISON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed by his Honour Bennett DCJ on 22 January 2013. The applicant was convicted following a trial that commenced on 12 June 2012 and concluded on 4 July 2012. The jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of all 39 counts on the indictment variously comprising offences contrary to s 178BA(1), s 193B(1) and s 300(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. These offences are referred to in more detail in annexure A to these reasons.

3The applicant was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. The indicative sentence for each offence is set out in annexure B to these reasons. The structure of accumulation and concurrency adopted by his Honour that produced the aggregate sentence is depicted in annexure C to these reasons.

4The applicant propounds a single ground of appeal in this Court, contending that the sentence imposed by his Honour is manifestly excessive being unreasonable and plainly unjust.

The facts of the offences

5William Pittelkow was the sole shareholder and director of a packaging company, Pharmaceutical Fillers Pty Ltd. In late 2005, the applicant and his business partner began to use Pharmaceutical Fillers' premises to package a product. The applicant and Mr Pittelkow took steps towards establishing a joint venture business, and discussed the applicant acquiring Pharmaceutical Fillers on Mr Pittelkow's retirement. The applicant began to act as the company's business development manager.

6In early 2006, Pharmaceutical Fillers acquired the manufacturing and packaging arm of a client, Innoxa Pty Ltd. Pharmaceutical Fillers took over Innoxa's premises and became its supplier. Innoxa became Pharmaceutical Fillers' main client, although it continued to provide services to existing customers.

7Until its takeover of Innoxa, Pharmaceutical Fillers had an account with AMP Bank. Some customers paid their invoices directly into the account. After the takeover, Pharmaceutical Fillers required increased capital and cash flow. It entered into an arrangement with Benchmark Debtor Finance. Pharmaceutical Fillers submitted customer invoices to Benchmark, which paid it 75 percent of their value and the balance less an 11 percent service fee once payment was recovered from the customer. It was anticipated that this arrangement would continue for up to fifteen months.

8The applicant became increasingly involved in Pharmaceutical Fillers' financial management. He was nominated as its contact for dealings with Benchmark and dealt with payments pursuant to the arrangement with Benchmark. The applicant was also nominated as the company's contact for dealings with Innoxa and dealt with its payments.

9On 23 November 2006, the applicant opened two accounts in his own name with Westpac Bank. The next day, he sent AMP Bank a fax with the falsified signature of Mr Pittelkow. The fax purported to authorise Pharmaceutical Fillers' customer payments to be paid into one of the Westpac accounts, stating it was a Benchmark account. Two days later, the applicant sent an identical fax to the financial controller of Innoxa. This conduct constituted the two offences of use false instrument.

10Between 27 November 2006 and 26 March 2007, payments of Pharmaceutical Fillers' customers were transferred into the applicant's first Westpac account. Between 30 November 2006 and 2 February 2007, Innoxa also paid funds into the account. This conduct constituted the eleven offences of obtain financial advantage by deception. Particulars of the transactions are set out in annexure A.

11Between 27 November 2006 and 15 May 2007, the applicant transferred funds from the first Westpac account into the second Westpac account. This conduct constituted the twenty-six money-laundering offences. Particulars of the transactions are also set out in annexure A.

12From time to time the applicant in fact transferred funds from the first Westpac account into Benchmark's true account. Despite this, Mr Pittelkow noticed that Pharmaceutical Fillers was suffering from what appeared to be a poor cash flow and retained a bookkeeper who examined its accounts and discovered the transfer of funds into the applicant's first Westpac account. The applicant was asked to attend a meeting but he feigned illness. The applicant fled briefly to the United Kingdom but returned and was charged with the offences on 7 August 2007.

13The funds transferred from the Pharmaceutical Fillers' AMP Bank account into the first Westpac account totalled $323,065.67. The funds Innoxa paid into the first Westpac account totalled $1,040,566.70. The funds involved in the offences of obtain financial advantage by deception thus totalled $1,363,632.37. However, as the applicant had transferred some funds into the true Benchmark account, his Honour accepted a submission on behalf of the applicant that the total amount misappropriated was $246,461,25.

14Pharmaceutical Fillers' financial position deteriorated as a result of the offences and the company was sold. Mr Pittelkow had to defer his retirement plan and became an employee of the new owner. His Honour did not find harm or loss caused by the offences to be an aggravating factor. Nor did he accept that the offences involved limited planning or sophistication, and considered the applicant returned funds only to avoid discovery.

Subjective circumstances

15The applicant was aged 46 at the time of these offences. He had no prior convictions. After completing high school, he was employed as a director of several companies operating in various industries. He had worked most recently as a consultant but at the time of the sentence proceedings he was in receipt of a government benefit.

16The applicant has two adult daughters from his first marriage and an eleven year old son from his second marriage. That marriage ended in 2009. When sentenced, the applicant had been in a new relationship for two and a half years. He and his partner had a son shortly before the sentence proceedings and she had a four year old daughter from a previous relationship. The applicant's partner had experienced traumatic events in Sierra Leone and was dependent upon the applicant. His Honour did not consider those circumstances to be exceptional.

17Dr Richard Furst reported on 3 October 2012 that the applicant had symptoms of depression that arose in 2008 as a result of marital stress and the investigation of the present offences. He attended a general practitioner in 2007 and a psychiatrist from late 2007 until 2008. He was prescribed anti-depressant medication and was admitted to hospitals on several occasions in 2008 and 2009 as a result of his condition. He was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder that was current when the offences were committed. His Honour rejected a contention that the applicant's condition affected his decision-making when he committed the offences and considered that it developed only as a result of the investigation and prosecution. His Honour did accept that imprisonment would weigh more heavily on the applicant because of his mental condition.

18His Honour did not find the applicant to be remorseful and considered that he had misrepresented the circumstances of the offences and attempted to avoid prosecution. His Honour was not satisfied that the applicant had prospects of rehabilitation. He found that there were special circumstances as the applicant suffered from anxiety and depression as well as for the reason that his partner was left alone with the sole care of their child.

Submissions

The applicant

19The indicative sentences for the offences of deal with proceeds of crime and obtain financial advantage by deception vary according to the quantum of funds involved in the particular transaction. The indicative sentences for the former offences are nevertheless substantially greater than those for the latter offences, subject to the amount involved.

20The difference between the indicative sentences for the deal with proceeds of crime offences and those for the obtain financial advantage by deception offences appears to reflect the greater maximum penalty applicable to the former category of offences. However, the substantial maximum penalty is not a reliable guide as to the seriousness of a particular offence, as the provision embraces a very broad range of both conduct and criminality: Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294; (2009) 198 A Crim R 135 at [33]; Frahm v R [2014] NSWCCA 10 at [22] and [31].

21Although an offence of deal with proceeds of crime may be constituted by the use of funds obtained through a substantive fraud offence, it represents a ""highly technical"" instance of such an offence: Thorn at [31]. The applicant's conduct in committing the deal with proceeds of crime offences was the transfer of funds from the first Westpac account to the second Westpac account. There was no transformation of the nature of the funds or disguising of their source that could have been described as ""money laundering"".

22In the light of the range of conduct potentially falling within the terms of the offence, the deal with proceeds of crime offences involved only very limited criminality. The indicative sentences for these offences are said to be inconsistent with a proper assessment of the discrete criminality involved in these offences.

23The applicant also contended that where the offences of deal with proceeds of crime reflect the use of funds obtained through substantive fraud offences, they may involve no real additional criminality that warranted an effective increase in sentence: see Dela Cruz v R [2010] NSWCCA 333 at [19]; Schembri v R [2010] NSWCCA 149; (2010) 78 ATR 159 at [15]; Nahlous v R [2010] NSWCCA 58; (2010) 77 NSWLR 463 at [17]; Subramaniam v R [2013] NSWCCA 259 at [33] - [35]. 

24The indicative sentences for the deal with proceeds of crime offences were substantially greater than those for the obtain financial advantage by deception offences. Despite their partial concurrency, the indicative sentences for those offences gave rise to a substantial increase in the effective sentence. The applicant contended that the effective increase exceeded what was warranted to reflect the discrete criminality involved in the offences.

25The applicant also contended that the indicative sentences for the use false instrument offences were inconsistent with any proper assessment of the discrete criminality involved in these offences. The indicative sentences for these offences were terms of imprisonment for five years. The conduct constituting these offences consisted of the applicant sending the false faxes to AMP Bank and Innoxa. The conduct was ancillary to that constituting the obtain financial advantage by deception offences. The indicative sentences for the use false instrument offences cannot be reconciled with the conduct constituting those offences unless it were taken to embrace the criminality involved in the obtain financial advantage by deception offences, in which case it represents double punishment: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [40], [42], [45] - [47].

26The indicative sentences for the use false instrument offences nominally commenced before and expired after the indicative sentences for the obtain financial advantage by deception offences. The use false instrument offences gave rise to an effective increase in sentence that is inconsistent with any proper assessment of the additional criminality involved in those offences.

27The applicant submitted that an examination of the criminality involved in the individual offences and the indicative sentences determined for the offences respectively demonstrates that proper principle was not applied in determining the aggregate sentence: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [59], [75]. The resultant aggregate sentence was therefore unreasonable or plainly unjust: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-5; Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; (2009) 83 ALJR 579 at [8].

28The applicant submitted that a lesser aggregate sentence was warranted in law and should have been imposed: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

The Crown

29The applicant submitted that the proceeds of crime offences related to the use of the same funds acquired as a consequence of the obtain financial advantage by deception charges, and that therefore the former offences represent a highly technical instance of such an offence, involving no real additional criminality warranting an effective increase in sentence. The Crown acknowledged that if the different offences related to the same moneys then there would be merit in this argument. However, the total amount of $515,009.44 involved in the proceeds of crime offences was significantly larger than the overall amount of $323,065.67 involved in the obtain benefit by deception offences. The proceeds of crime charges did not therefore relate only to funds obtained as a result of the obtain benefit by deception charges.

30Some of the proceeds of crime charges related to money that had been paid by Innoxa directly into the applicant's account in accordance with the false document given to them by the applicant. There was therefore arguably additional criminality warranting an effective increase in the sentence. Consequently, there was no strong reason in principle why the indicative sentences in respect of each of the proceeds of crimes charges should run entirely concurrently with the indicative sentences for the obtain benefit by deception charges. 

31The applicant further contended that the indicative sentences imposed by his Honour in respect of the proceeds of crime offences were, in effect, incorrectly inflated because of the substantially longer maximum penalty for that offence, particularly when regard is had to the length of the indicative sentences his Honour imposed for the obtain benefit by deception charges. The Crown accepted that there may be some substance to this complaint. That is because despite having a higher maximum penalty, the deal with proceeds of crime offences were not the principal offences. The authorities relied upon by the applicant provide support for the conclusion that the greater criminality lay in the acts of obtaining the funds through fraudulent means rather than in the use of those funds after they had been so obtained: Thorn at [27].

32However, the way his Honour structured the indicative sentences meant there was no increase in the effective sentence as a consequence of the 11 obtain benefit by deception charges. This is because the indicative sentences in respect of the obtain benefit by deception charges were entirely subsumed by the sentences imposed for the use false instrument charges. That approach was clearly favourable to the applicant.

33The applicant also benefited from the fact that the two use false instrument indicative sentences were made entirely concurrent with each other. Whilst each of them involved the use of the same false document, it was nevertheless used on two separate and discrete occasions by the applicant for two different purposes. In the first count, it was used to authorise the AMP bank to permit transfers of greater than $5,000 into the applicant's account (on the pretext it was a Benchmark Debtor Finance Account). This enabled the applicant to transfer customer payments that were made into the AMP Bank account into his own personal account. On the second occasion, the document was handed by the applicant to Innoxa's financial controller for the purposes of inducing Innoxa to transfer payments directly into the applicant's account.

34The applicant further submitted that the indicative sentences of 5 years for the use false instrument charges are themselves excessive. These offences carry a maximum penalty of 10 years. The conduct the subject of the charges is described by the applicant as ""ancillary to that constituting the obtain financial advantage by deception charges"". However, there were no obtain benefit by deception charges in respect of Innoxa's payments into the applicant's account.

35Further, in each case the creation and use of the false fax was the first necessary step in the applicant's overall fraudulent scheme. Without these crucial actions the applicant would not have been able easily to transfer the money into his account. As his Honour observed, ""all that followed the commission of those offences was facilitated and made possible by the publication of those fraudulent instruments.""

36The applicant also submitted that the indicative sentences for the use false instrument offences could not be reconciled with the conduct constituting those offences unless it were taken to embrace the criminality involved in the obtain financial advantage by deception offences, in which case it represents double punishment. At certain points in the remarks his Honour did refer to the Innoxa transactions being made as a consequence of the use of the false instrument the subject of count 2. The funds obtained from Innoxa as a result of the use of the false document could have been taken into account in assessing the criminality involved in count 2 given that there was no separate obtain benefit by deception charges in respect of those amounts. There were no such further charges because no further action was required by the applicant after the initial use of the false document, in contrast to money transferred in from the AMP Bank account. Consequently, there would have been no double counting involved if his Honour took into account the amounts received in the applicant's account from Innoxa under count 2.

37The Crown did however acknowledge that if that approach was indeed taken, then the deal with proceeds of crime charges would have represented funds obtained either as a consequence of the obtain benefit by deception charges or of the use false instrument charge in count 2, and therefore there should not have been any effective additional penalty in respect of the proceeds of crimes charges. The receipt of the money from Innoxa had already been reflected in the sentence for count 2.

Consideration

38The offences involved planned and protracted criminal activity. They involved reasonably intricate and structured arrangements which permitted the applicant to exploit the trust extended to him by Mr Pittelkow. It involved the applicant using a false instrument on two occasions and fraudulently obtaining access to $1,363,632.37, of which $246,461.25 was ultimately retained by the applicant and not subsequently recovered.

39As his Honour noted, regardless of the sums actually retained and used by the applicant, it remained the case that he availed himself of substantial sums of money at the expense of Pharmaceutical Fillers and its creditors. As his Honour also found, the return of some of the funds while these frauds were continuing simply gave the applicant scope to persist in what he was doing by minimising the risk of detection.

40The Crown emphasised that the applicant embarked on an egregious course of conduct by befriending Mr Pittelkow. While ostensibly assisting him, the applicant acquired considerable influence over Mr Pittelkow, which both enabled him to gain control of the financial side of the business and thereafter to exploit it to his own advantage. The applicant appropriated funds in order to maintain his lifestyle and further his own interests. His actions left the business financially vulnerable and caused Mr Pittelkow and his family to lose assets and resources that had been accumulated from years of hard work.

41His Honour found that the applicant was neither remorseful nor contrite. He was entitled to do so on the material before him and no challenge is mounted to that finding. His Honour imposed sentences after a trial so that any comparison with comparable cases needs to recognise the absence of any discount for a plea of guilty. There was also no favourable finding made in respect of the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation. The applicant had the benefit of a finding of special circumstances which was reflected in the overall non-parole period representing 66.6 percent of the total term. 

42It seems to me that, with one exception, his Honour approached the sentencing exercise by attributing primacy to the use false instrument offences. His indicative sentence of five years for each of these offences, respectively commencing and concluding on the same date, suggests that his Honour considered that these offences were at the heart of the facilitation of the entirety of the fraudulent conduct. The indicative sentences for obtain financial advantage by deception are wholly subsumed within the indicative terms for the use false instrument offences. It is difficult in the circumstances to find fault with the way in which the indicative sentence structure adopted by his Honour deals with the relative terms for these sets of offences. Indeed, subject to the applicant's complaint that the use false instrument sentences were too long standing alone, the latest of the obtain financial advantage by deception sentences expires twelve months before the five year term for the use false instrument sentences. That total concurrency means that the applicant was effectively not sentenced to any separate term of imprisonment for the obtain financial advantage offences inasmuch as they were entirely subsumed in the sentences for the two use false instrument offences. 

43The one exception to which I have referred is the way in which his Honour aggregated the sentences he proposed to impose for the deal with proceeds of crime offences in counts 16, 18, 21 and 39. The sentences for these four offences were structured to increase the overall aggregate sentence by 12 months. The applicant's complaint is that the criminality involved in these offences did not warrant sentences that had that effect, either in terms of their relative expiration dates or the length of their non-parole period, because the conduct giving rise to these charges was in reality not discretely different to that concerned with the use false instrument offences. The applicant formulates his complaint in this respect as one of double counting.

44In Thorn the following passages appear:

""[26] The second ground asserts that the sentence for the money laundering offence was excessive. The submission is that the criminality involved in this offence is less than the fraud offences and that the sentencing of the applicant was overly complicated by the use of this offence, especially as it overlapped to an extent with the fraud offences. It is further submitted that the sentence imposed is out of proportion with the penalty imposed for the other offences. 

[27] This was an unusual use of a money laundering offence. To the extent that there was an overlap with the fraud offences the charge represented the use of the funds that had been dishonestly obtained under those offences. The criminality was very much in the obtaining of the funds not in their use. It is somewhat analogous to a robber being sentenced for both the robbery and being in possession of the stolen goods. But in the present case, according to the maximum penalties prescribed, the money laundering offence was more serious than the frauds by which the money was obtained. Further the money laundering charge was used to punish the applicant for his criminality arising from his partner's fraudulent conduct. As was noted earlier, there is no concept of a joint criminal enterprise under the Code, so the applicant could not be charged with his partner's fraudulent activity even though it was common activity of them both.

...

[31] But here the applicant was merely transferring the money obtained by the fraudulent claims from the company accounts to his personal account or drawing it from an ATM so that he could use it to gamble. He was doing nothing to hide the source or to change the nature of the funds. He was simply gaining access to them. The activity came within the scope of the offence under s 400.4, because the offence is so widely drawn. But it was a highly technical version of the offence.

...

[33] In my opinion his Honour should have treated this as an offence towards the lowest range of the type of offending covered by the section, even while noting, as he did, that it encompassed a number of transactions over a significant period of time. In the particular circumstances of this case the maximum penalty was not a reliable guide to the seriousness of the conduct involved: see Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [30]. Further, the penalty was based upon the offender dealing with money over the value of $100,000 yet that amount was reached by including a sum of money, whatever it might have been, that overlapped with the fraud offences.

...

[35] Whether the sentence for the money laundering offence is manifestly excessive depends upon how that sentence compares with what would have been appropriate to reflect the seriousness of the dishonesty offences by which the funds had been obtained, bearing in mind that they would each have attracted a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment...""

45The burden of the applicant's complaint is that whereas his convictions for the proceeds of crime offences may have been technically unexceptionable and liable to attract the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment standing alone, the extent to which his overall sentence was thereby increased meant that the resultant practical sentencing outcome was unreasonable or plainly unjust.

46It is obvious that where a recipient of the proceeds of crime has been uninvolved in the crime that produced them, a deal with proceeds of crime offence will have a useful role to play. The utility of such charges in circumstances where the relevant offender is one and the same is less obvious. Nonetheless, the actual use of, or dealing with, the proceeds of crime may have an important independent significance. In the present case, the applicant defrauded his victim by the use of a false instrument. For as long as the money obtained in that way remained in the accounts set up by the applicant for that purpose, so that the transaction could be reversed, the victim had potentially suffered no irrecoverable loss. It was the use of the funds, or so much of them as were utilised or directed for the applicant's own purposes, that consummated the loss. That loss has never been recouped. In that sense at least, the effective damage was caused by the applicant's dealings with some of the proceeds of the use false instrument offences. In that way the deal with proceeds of crime offences displayed an independent criminality that was worthy of a separate penalty.

47The applicant was not sentenced to any term for the obtain financial advantage offences that resulted in any discrete period of imprisonment not otherwise subsumed within a sentence for a different offence. The applicant's Pearce complaint may in such circumstances have theoretical force but has generated no practical prejudice in the end result. The applicant's contention must therefore be considered as raising the single question of whether an aggregate head sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years for the other offences was in all of the circumstances unreasonable or plainly unjust. On one view, his Honour's aggregate sentence was stern. A shorter head sentence and a correspondingly shorter non-parole period could certainly have withstood scrutiny in this Court. However, that is neither the point nor the proper approach.

48His Honour's reasons are expansive and clear. It is a significant aspect of his conclusions that the applicant was engaged in a planned and extensive course of criminal conduct. It was not triggered by some family crisis or other personal catastrophe, which might render his conduct explicable if not excusable. The anguish and anxiety diagnosed by Dr Furst was to a considerable extent a function of the applicant's original continuing and undetected criminal activities. The applicant's letter to his Honour was curiously self-centred and arguably lacked any degree of insight. The criminal activities in which the applicant engaged had serious practical consequences and no restoration of the loss was offered or made.

49I am not persuaded, to the extent that the applicant has been punished by the imposition of an aggregate sentence that contemplated serving any additional time beyond the sentence indicated for the use false instrument offences, that he has been doubly punished or that the sentence is therefore or in any other way unreasonable or unjust. Nor am I satisfied that the imposition of a five year term for those offences was itself beyond the bounds of a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion. It is the nature of sentencing that no one sentence is correct. It follows that the availability of a different view about the suitability or appropriateness of a sentence does not mean that error has been demonstrated. The aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour was not in my opinion manifestly excessive. It was not unreasonable or plainly unjust. I do not consider that some other sentence is warranted in law.

50In my opinion the applicant should be given leave to appeal but the appeal should be dismissed.

51McCALLUM J: I agree with Harrison J. I would add that I do not think it was necessary for the learned sentencing judge to address the issue of accumulation in the detail that he did in his indicative sentences, which included specification of the commencement and concluding date of each sentence: cf Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 36 at [231] per Button J (Hoeben CJ at CL and Garling J agreeing at [1] and [2]). The whole point of the introduction of a power in s 53A to impose an aggregate sentence was to remove at least one complexity in the sentencing task which was adding unnecessarily to the already substantial sentencing workload of the District and Local Courts. These remarks are not in any respect to criticise the learned sentencing judge, whose approach was detailed and precise, but only to note the permissibility of adopting a simpler approach. Section 53A(2) requires a court imposing an aggregate sentence to indicate ""the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence (after taking into account such matters as are relevant under Part 3 or any other provision of this Act) had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence"". Truong, I think, stands as authority for the proposition that, in order to comply with that provision, in the case of sentences of imprisonment, the judge need only indicate the term of imprisonment that would have been imposed for each individual offence. In doing so there is no need, in my view, for the judge to indicate the commencement date or non-parole period that would have been fixed for each individual offence

		27 November 2014",2014-11-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765225,R v Payne [2014] NSWDC 264,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing a young man for a very serious crime. He is still only 25. His counsel Mr B Bickford, correctly summarised his clientâs position in the following terms -
	


âMr Payne is a disabled drug addict with a sad personal history. His motivation for this offence was driven by addiction and an obsession with wanting to fit in.â


	
	The crime that Jack Mervyn James Payne has been charged with is unlawfully selling three or more firearms within a period of 12 months. It is a very serious offence. One can tell that because Parliament, in enacting the offence in s 51B(1) of the Firearms Act 1996, fixed a maximum penalty of 20 years to the crime and a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	Mr Payne pleaded guilty to the offence at what Mr Fitzhardinge, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, agreed is the earliest opportunity and in due course he will receive a 25 per cent discount from the sentence I would otherwise impose upon him. That is because he has assisted the criminal justice system in a number of practical ways, by avoiding the need for a trial so that other matters can be heard.
	
	
	I should say something about the crime which he committed. It is summarised in exhibit A, which is an agreed statement of facts. The crime comprised two sales of firearms by Mr Payne and negotiations for the sale of firearms on four other occasions. An undercover operative was involved.
	
	
	The first occasion, which was a sale, was 18 November 2013 and Mr Payne sold that undercover operative an SKS style rifle in exchange for $2,200 in cash.
	
	
	The second sale was only a few weeks later on 3 December 2013. The same undercover operative contacted Mr Payne and discussed buying another weapon. Mr Payne said that he would go back to his supplier and they both went to meet that supplier. That was in fact on 8 December 2013. There, the undercover operative was given a .22 calibre pistol in exchange for $1,100 in cash. Not only that, the original supplier (not Mr Payne) provided the undercover operative with five rounds of appropriate ammunition.
	
	
	There were four other occasions when Mr Payne negotiated to sell some weapons, which I understand amounts to a sale under the legislation.
	
	
	His telephone was being monitored and he acted as a go-between between his own supplier and another customer for the sale of a weapon. The customer went around to Mr Payneâs place on 14 December 2013 to complete the transaction.
	
	
	As it happened on the same day, Mr Payne negotiated a second sale, this time with an undercover operative. This time the operative asked for a .22 calibre bolt action rifle for $700 and that amounted to a further offence.
	
	
	The following day, 15 December 2013, Mr Payne took a call from a customer, not an undercover operative, about selling a firearm and offered to sell to that customer a firearm for $350 in cash. They agreed to meet at a shopping centre.
	
	
	Finally, the following day, 16 December 2013, Mr Payne offered to sell the undercover operative a shotgun and a rifle for $3,500. A couple of days later Mr Payne indicated that the rifle was available but not the shotgun.
	
	
	By those four sets of negotiations, he had committed the offences - so he engaged in six separate transactions, two actual sales and four negotiated sales. Exhibit A includes photographs of the weapons that were sold. One can readily understand why Parliament has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period to crimes such as this, although I will return to that.
	
	
	Jack Payne comes before the court with a criminal record, most of it in the Childrenâs Court comprising break and enter, theft and assaulting. He also has traffic matters and has been called up a number of times for breach of bonds. Significantly, his record contains an offence of possessing a firearm in or near a public place. In 2010 he was given a community service order for that offence. So this is not the first time that Mr Payne has been involved with a firearms offence.
	
	
	He was arrested on 26 March 2014 and has been in custody ever since.
	
	
	It is important for a judge, in sentencing an offender, to make some kind of assessment of how serious an example of the particular crime has been committed by that offender. As Mr Bickford pointed out - by reference to the Court of Criminal Appealâs decision in R v Mack [2009] NSWCCA 216 -considerations relevant to assessing the seriousness include the number of firearms and the nature and type of the firearms. They also include, he argues by reference to the Court of Criminal Appealâs decision in R v Parkinson [2010] NSWCCA 89, that the fact that his client was acting as an agent for someone else was significant. I accept both of those submissions. His client was more a go-between than the direct source.
	
	
	I do not accept Mr Bickfordâs submission that his client was not involved in a business. His client was involved in a business. He reaped some $3,300 from the sale of the firearms and also in some transactions prohibited drugs were obtained for the firearms. Indeed as Mr Fitzhardinge points out, some of the transactions obviously occurred in exchange for drugs which suggests that he was prepared to sell his firearms to those already involved in illegal activity. He was indiscriminate about whom he sold those to. It did not bother him who was purchasing the firearms and what may become of them.
	
	
	Mr Fitzhardinge proposed that the offence, given the limited number of firearms actually supplied and the fact that he was an agent, fell below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I accept that submission. I do not accept that it was towards the bottom of the range at all. However, I do agree that it fell below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	It is important also for a judge to take into account personal factors which are relevant to an offender. As I said, Mr Payne is now 25. He has been described as functionally illiterate because his education was affected by a very serious incident which occurred to him when he was nine. He was seriously burnt by petrol which became alight. Evidently, the circumstances involved some behaviour by men which resulted in them being charged. He spent months in hospital and had to spend a lot of time in recuperation after hospital. Mr Bickford called Shirley Tibbett, Mr Payneâs mother, who confirmed what had happened. She pointed out, as has been mentioned in some other places, that the tattoos which Mr Payne wears on his face are to cover his scarring. She noticed a big change in his early teenage years which, to my mind, is probably connected with the accident and his disfigurement as a result of that accident. Her evidence is consistent with a detailed pre-sentence report prepared by Stacey Deller, who said that it was âfrom this moment...the offender realised a decline in his behaviour and self-confidenceâ. He started mixing with the wrong people.
	
	
	He has had employment on only one occasion but found it very difficult because of another accident which occurred when he was still only 17. He had a serious motor bike accident. He was affected by drugs and alcohol at the time and he lost some fingers as a result of the accident or amputation to his right hand.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report says that Mr Payne âhas been chronically consuming a multitude of illicit substances since his teenage years.â Revealingly the pre-sentence report also noted that he has two institutional misconduct charges since his admission into custody. One was for possessing a drug implement and the other for failing a prescribed urine test. In addition he was segregated for attempting to bring drugs into a visitor centre at Cessnock Correctional Centre.
	
	
	He had previously been under supervision from the Community Corrections Service and the report regarded his compliance as being satisfactory. He has ongoing support from his parents and his brothers and sisters. He started smoking cannabis at around 15 and by the time he was 16 he began using amphetamines, hallucinogens, heroin and cocaine. Then he also started on methamphetamines.
	
	
	The author assessed his risk of reoffending as medium to high and the author also noted that the Justice Health medical file âconfirmed that the offender is currently being treated with antipsychotic medication on a daily basisâ. The author insightfully said that unless Mr Payne âis willing to genuinely addressâ his inclination to crime âhe will likely continue to engage in criminal activityâ. There is an opportunity for him to enter the program at Bennelongâs Haven.
	
	
	Whilst in custody he has undertaken an OH&S course. Before he went into custody he was on a disability support pension which was related to his right hand.
	
	
	Mr Bickford tendered a report from a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Furst. Dr Furst noted the drug and alcohol history and that Mr Payne âhas never been admitted to a drug and alcohol counselling rehabilitation serviceâ. Dr Furst noted his plans to try to get off the drugs. He diagnosed Mr Payne as having a substance use disorder as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and acquired head injury related to the bike accident, chronic dysthymia and childhood ADHD. Dr Furst thought that in his offending behaviour Mr Payne âwas probably motivated by financial gain and an apparent desire to be accepted by his âupline supplierââ. Realistically his drug habit was also a motivating factor. Dr Furst pointed out that Mr Payneâs âunderlying post-traumatic stress disorder, low self-esteem and chronic dysthymia were probably indirectly related to his offendingâ. Dr Furst recommended that he be referred to a clinical psychologist within Corrective Services . Dr Furst proposed a treatment plan which he thought Mr Payne is âlikely to benefit fromâ. Dr Furst thought that Mr Payne âhas good prospects of being successfully rehabilitatedâ.
	
	
	There is a reference from Sister Margaret Mary Birgan, the congregational leader of Our Ladyâs Nurses for the Poor. She has known Shirley Farrell (nee Tibbett) for almost 30 years. Sister Birgan insightfully pointed out in her reference the âabsolute fragmentation of a family with little resources and backup as they struggled to grow up.â She pointed out how Mr Payne had âsuffered from the effects of his burnâ, as well as his schooling suffering. Both Sister Birgan - and Ms Tibbett in evidence - said that Mr Payne had received an insurance payout of some half a million dollars which he squandered, leaving nothing. Sister Birgan thought that âif Jack has someone to believe in him and guide him and to give him hope, he can make the gradeâ. She thought that being taught to read and write would be a very good start.
	
	
	Mr Payne has a three and a half year old daughter, Shanella.
	
	
	Mr Payne expressed his remorse for his offending behaviour when giving evidence before me. In evidence he said that he wanted to get off the drugs and get back to a stable life. He was driven by a desire to make friends and fit in. That also affected his drug taking behaviour in gaol.
	
	
	Mr Fitzhardinge, in his helpful written submissions, referred to what the former Chief Justice, Spigelman CJ, had said in the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Howard [2004] NSWCCA 348, a case involving the sale of firearms. At [66] his Honour said this -
	


âWhere it appears that there are elements within the community who refuse to accept that firearms offences must be regarded as serious, the objectives of general and personal deterrence are entitled to substantial weight in sentencing for such offences. The availability of such weapons poses a major threat to the community particularly where, as here, an accused is completely indifferent to the persons who were to acquire them. The community has determined that trade in such weapons on any other than a strictly regulated basis is to be regarded as a serious offence. That must be reflected in the sentence imposed.â

Needless to say that is a judgment which applies to me in sentencing Mr Payne today.


	
	Mr Bickford also provided some helpful written submissions as well as addressing me in Court. He correctly pointed out that although his clientâs drug and alcohol addiction did not provide an excuse, it was relevant to his moral culpability in that they would have affected his capacity for judgment. In other words it was not as if his client was a sober, cold and calculating dealer in firearms. Mr Bickford submitted that there are special circumstances for altering the usual ratio between a non-parole period and a full sentence. Normally a non-parole period is 75 per cent of a full sentence but a judge can reduce that in special circumstances. Mr Bickford pointed out that this would be his clientâs first time in adult prison and also that he needed structured supervision for his rehabilitation on release. He also had limited opportunities for employability in prison, given the injury to his hand. Mr Fitzhardinge did not cavil with those submissions and I accept them.
	
	
	I also accept Mr Fitzhardingeâs submissions that the previous conviction involving a firearm âindicates a need for greater emphasis to be placed on specific deterrence for this offenderâ.
	
	
	I need to determine an appropriate sentence for this crime in light of the observations which I have already made. I regard as an appropriate sentence for a crime such as this, taking into account all of the matters that I have referred to, as one of five and a half years imprisonment. However, Mr Payne has pleaded guilty at what is acknowledged to be the earliest opportunity. I would therefore reduce that five and a half year sentence by 25 per cent. That reduces the sentence from five and a half years to a couple of months over four years. I would be prepared to round the sentence down to four years.
	
	
	Needless to say - but I say it - there is no alternative in sentencing Mr Payne other than to full-time custody.
	
	
	Normally for a four year gaol sentence, the non-parole period should be three years. In this case I propose to fix the non-parole period as two years. That is a significant reduction. I do that because of the special circumstances which Mr Bickford drew to my attention and which I have already referred to.
	


HIS HONOUR:Â Â Â I am going to sentence you now Jack Payne, if you would stand up please?


	
	I set a non-parole period of two years, which commenced when you were arrested on 26 March 2014 and expires on 25 March 2016. The balance of the term is two years, which will commence on 26 March 2016 and expire on 25 March 2018. The first date on which you will be eligible for parole is 25 March 2016.
	


HIS HONOUR: So Mr Payne your overall sentence is four years. Youâve got a non-parole period of two years. Normally it would be three, but I have reduced it to two. It commenced when you were arrested 26 March this year, and you will be eligible for parole 25 March 2016. You know better than I do that if you keep drawing the attention of the prison authorities to your activities in prison to do with drugs, then the Parole Authority is not going to be very impressed by this. But that is up to the Parole Authority. Just have a seat there for a moment. Now am I right in thinking I donât fix parole? Three years or under, I do not fix parole.

FITZHARDINGE: Three years and under, where your Honour needs to direct.

HIS HONOUR: No. Now are the mathematics correct Ms Eyers and Mr Fitzhardinge?

FITZHARDINGE: Yes your Honour.

EYERS: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right and I will make available to my associate exhibit 1 which is Dr Furstâs report. I will ask him - there is not a clean copy of that I suppose is there Ms Eyers?

EYERS: I havenât checked that your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Would you mind having a look because I marked it in pencil, it will just save my associate having to rub it all out.

EYERS: It may unfortunately be with counsel.

FITZHARDINGE: If it assists your associate your Honour, I can make available a copy that has some yellow highlighter that wonât show up when run through--

HIS HONOUR: That would be good. Could you make available - thank you, he will give that back to you but if you make that available he will photocopy it and I will just ask Corrective Services officers, should I give that to one of you to accompany him into custody? It is a psychiatric report and those who classify or who will classify Mr Payne are assisted by these reports and I can either fax it to someone or send it with you into custody, provided it gets to the right place.

SPEAKER: --put with his file.

HIS HONOUR: Say that again? Go with you?

SPEAKER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: All right, my associate will photocopy it and send it down for you and it is to accompany him and to be made available to those who assess him. Is that okay? Good. Anything else Ms Eyers, Mr Fitzhardinge?

FITZHARDINGE: No thank you your Honour.

EYERS: No your Honour.

		12 February 2015",2014-11-05 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765238,R v Holden [2014] NSWCCA 230,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: I agree with Harrison J.

2HARRISON J: Phillip Holden appeals against his conviction by his Honour Frearson DCJ sitting alone on 12 December 2012 of one count of (deemed) supply of a prohibited drug, namely 5.4 grams of 3, 4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine contrary to s 25(1) and s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 

3The applicant requires leave to appeal: s 5(1)(b), Criminal Appeal Act 1912; Smith v R [2007] NSWCCA 156 at [1].

4The applicant originally relied on two grounds as follows:

(1)In applying the balance of probability standard, the trial judge's failure to take into account the gravity of the allegation caused the trial to miscarry.

(2)The verdict of the trial judge is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence: s 6, Criminal Appeal Act.

5Ground 1 was abandoned by the applicant prior to the hearing of the appeal.

6Section 29 of the Act provides relevantly as follows:

""29 Traffickable quantity-possession taken to be for supply 

A person who has in his or her possession an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the traffickable quantity of the prohibited drug shall, for the purposes of this Division, be deemed to have the prohibited drug in his or her possession for supply, unless: 

(a) the person proves that he or she had the prohibited drug in his or her possession otherwise than for supply..."" 

7By reason of the quantity of the drug in the applicant's possession, he was deemed to possess it for the purposes of supply. The only issue at the trial before his Honour was therefore whether or not the applicant had established that he had the prohibited drug in his possession otherwise than for supply. The applicant bore the onus of establishing that fact on the balance of probabilities.

The facts

8The facts before his Honour were briefly as follows.

9At about 10.50pm on 10 January 2012, the police attended level 2 of the underground car park of the Novotel Hotel at Brighton-Le-Sands, in response to a report that a vehicle was being broken into. It was the applicant's vehicle and not long after the police arrived the applicant approached. He was in a state of drug intoxication, and he uttered words to the effect, ""They ripped me off"". His behaviour was rather erratic and he explained to the police that he had a ""point"" two hours before.

10Jake McKenna-King and Alana Wayne then approached and explained to police that they had been staying in the same room as the applicant. The applicant looked at them and said words to the effect, ""You ripped me off"".

11The hotel room was in fact booked under the name of Alana Wayne and the applicant although Alana Wayne signed the documentation and the applicant produced his passport. Under cross-examination the applicant agreed that he partly paid for the room. 

12There was a consensual search of the room and the police observed a clear plastic bag protruding from under a pillow. That bag contained drugs in the form of capsules and some white powder that was visible to police.

13At that point the applicant said something initially like, ""What substance? There's no fucking substance unless it's yours"", pointing to the two other occupants of the room. However, at the hotel he conceded that it was in fact his, and did so again when he was later interviewed at the police station and participated in a recorded interview.

14In a caged truck that was used to transport the applicant, police subsequently located a bag containing eighty-four smaller plastic bags. The applicant fingerprint was on one of those bags. He admitted in evidence that he had discarded the bag containing the plastic bags in the truck.

15The clear plastic bag found under the pillow contained 4 smaller bags, one of which is the subject of the appeal. It contained 43 capsules containing 5.4 grams of MDMA of 27.5 percent purity.

The judgment

16His Honour's judgment was provided to this Court as part of the appeal. Some of what his Honour said is as follows:

""The Crown is required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was in possession of this prohibited drug 3,4-methylenedioxmethamphetamine. Once the Crown does that, the onus shifts to the accused to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that he had the drug in his possession other than for supply. Indeed, the accused in this case contends that he had the drug in his possession for personal use and he has given evidence to that effect, and that is what he said to the police initially and that is what he said in the recorded interview with the police.

...

This trial has been conducted on the basis that there is no issue as to possession of not less than the trafficable quantity of the drug MDMA. The sole issue in the trial; the single issue is whether the accused has established the defence on the balance of probabilities. He has contended that the drug was not for sale and it was not to be distributed or furnished to anybody else.

I need to determine that issue on the totality of the evidence given at the trial and that obviously includes the evidence of the accused. I acknowledge that the fact that the accused has given evidence does not change the fundamental rules that the Crown is required to establish possession beyond reasonable doubt of not less than the trafficable quantity, but that is not in issue.

...

I find beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was in possession of the 5.4 grams of MDMA, the MDMA that was located in the hotel room as well as the eighty-four plastic bags that were located in the caged police truck.

...

When I look at the credibility of the accused generally and his account; the vagueness of the man from Kings Cross; about where he had purchased the drugs precisely; about his own association with drugs and the inconsistency in his interview and his evidence; about his reason for being at the hotel I do not find to be a credible account. That leads to the question of the eighty-four plastic bags. There is the fact that he had the MDMA and the fact that at the same time he had possession of (although they were in a different place at one point) the eighty-four plastic bags. One would wonder why he would have eighty-four plastic bags. That leads to the question of what he did with the bags. He said in evidence he dakked the bags because of the implications of supply. He said that he abandoned them in the caged truck. Later when he was shown the bag, according to police, he was asked if he could tell the officer anything about it and he said no. The accused apparently dakked the bags before the police became involved and thereafter he dumped them in the vehicle.

It seems to me that in the circumstances of this case that is a material and significant fact whether he had bags at the very time he had possession of the drugs and it seems to be as a material, a significant fact, whether he made any attempt to conceal the fact that he was in possession at the same time of both the drugs and the bags. The only reasonable explanation of the evidence in my view is that he did not wish to be associated with the bags because of the obvious implication, namely that he knew that the bags would tend to implicate him in drug supply. 

Now I do appreciate that people do not always act rationally, that people can do things out of panic, confusion, to escape an unjust accusation, or to protect themselves when completely innocent. Those are always possibilities but my conclusion is that on this occasion, and I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused did what he did in dakking the bags, putting them into his own pants and then abandoning them later because he feared that the bags would implicate him in drug supply and that although there are other possibilities they are mere possibilities which I exclude as being reasonable possibilities. 

Even if I were to disregard entirely what the accused did with the eighty-four bags and just consider the fact of his possession of the drug of 27.5 per cent purity and the possession, at the same time, of eighty-four clear plastic bags, I would conclude that the accused has not established and has not demonstrated to me, on the balance of probabilities that he possessed the drugs otherwise than for supply. Indeed I am satisfied of the contrary that he had them for supply. For these reasons I find the accused guilty.""

17Counsel for the applicant also referred during the proceedings in this Court to certain other things that fell from his Honour during the course of the trial. Although some faint reliance on those matters was urged in the course of argument in this Court, that approach was ultimately and quite properly discarded.

The applicant's contentions

18The applicant contended in this Court that his Honour's reasons were unreasonable because he did not believe him. He argued that an analysis of the objective facts on the one hand and the applicant's evidence on the other hand meant that it was unreasonable for his Honour not to accept his evidence. 

19The applicant submitted in terms that ""there was nothing in [his] account from which it could be concluded that he is lying about how and why he possessed the drugs."" He contended that ""the evidence is consistent with possession being for personal use."" The applicant submitted that because the evidence was consistent with a probability that possession was for personal use, it was ""not open for the trial judge to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [he] possessed [the drug] for the purpose of supply.""

20In support of that contention the applicant helpfully described the evidence that he submitted supported that conclusion. It was briefly as follows.

21First, he was affected by drugs when he first came to the attention of police. Secondly, he admitted to having injected one of the 43 tablets that were in his possession. Thirdly, the applicant admitted to the police that he was in effect a heavy user of drugs. Fourthly, his personal and financial circumstances included the fact that he had recently received a compensation payment of $300,000 for an industrial accident sustained in the course of his work as a carpenter and that he had spent a considerable amount of that sum on drugs for personal use. Fifthly, the applicant was unable to describe or identify the person from who he had purchased the drugs in question. Sixthly, the sum that he spent to acquire the drugs was only $350. Seventhly, the applicant had only a limited knowledge of what was in the bag containing the drugs at the time of his purchase, which was different to his Honour's expressed experience that drug purchasers are often ""quite fussy about whether they get value for money."" Eighthly, although the applicant conceded that the discovery of the 84 snap lock bags made him look like a seller, he gave evidence that they came with the drugs and that his attempts to hide or discard them was related to his wish to dispel that impression. Ninthly, his attempts to hide the drug bags, either under the pillow at the hotel or later by ""dakking"" them was also related to and explained by his desire to avoid giving the impression that he was a dealer. Finally, there was no evidence of cash, scales, account or client books or phone records suggestive of the conduct of a drug supply business.

22The applicant contended that these factors compelled this Court to experience a doubt about the evidence said to establish his guilt, which was a doubt that his Honour must also have entertained, and which could not have been and cannot now be accommodated or explained by the manner in which the evidence was given or otherwise by making full allowance for the advantage enjoyed by his Honour in the course of the trial.

The Crown's response

23The Crown referred to the well settled principles in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400; and R v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; (2010) 242 CLR 491.

24In M v The Queen at 493, 494-5 the following passage appears:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty ... But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations...

In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence... In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty..."" [Citations omitted]

25In Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 193 the Court emphasised that an appellate court considering whether a jury verdict is unreasonable must make its own assessment of the evidence. That assessment must include a consideration of the cumulative effect of the evidence with ""due regard to the common experience of human affairs and common sense brought by the jury to their determination of guilt or innocence"": at [65].

Consideration

26The Crown emphasised that it was significant that his Honour sat as the tribunal of fact and had the important advantage of hearing and observing the applicant in the witness box. That advantage was the same as that enjoyed by juries to which the authorities predominantly refer. However, in the present case, the evidence did not in my view even produce a doubt that required deference to the trial judge's special advantage. The evidence promoted by the applicant did not point in only one direction or produce the conclusion that the trial just must have entertained a reasonable doubt. On the contrary, the factors highlighted by the applicant were at best colourable. In other words, none of them either alone or in combination necessarily points only or even persuasively to the conclusion that the applicant acquired the drugs for his personal use or ""otherwise than for supply"". Such a conclusion is arguable but no more than that. In the events that occurred, his Honour did not accept the applicant's explanation of the circumstances in which or the purposes for which he acquired the drugs. His Honour was perfectly entitled to reach that conclusion.

27That is particularly so having regard to the fact that many of the matters upon which the applicant relied do not speak for themselves, but are dependent upon acceptance of the applicant as a witness of truth. The fact that there was no evidence that directly contradicted the applicant's version of events does not equate to proof by him on the balance of probabilities that he possessed the drugs otherwise than for supply. The burden of the applicant's submission is in effect that his uncontradicted evidence had to be accepted by his Honour and that he fell into error by not doing so. That general proposition is not, and for obvious reasons could not be, correct. His Honour rejected the applicant's evidence for the reasons that he gave. His Honour fell into no error by doing so.

Orders

28I consider that this application is wholly without merit. Leave to appeal should be refused.

29GARLING J: I agree with the orders proposed by Harrison J and with his Honour's reasons for those orders.

2765242,R v Milosevski [2014] NSWDC 333,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Many times in this Court have I said the words, âdrugs are terrible thingsâ, we have yet another example of the awful consequences that drugs supply and drug use bring.
	
	
	Appearing for sentence today is Michael Milosevski. He does not have the excuse that many drug users and drug suppliers have. Often I am told that because of trauma in a personâs early life, sometimes terrible, awful trauma, people resort to drugs to hide reality. Mr Milosevskiâs upbringing had no such problems. He was brought up by a close and loving family who still support him. Mr Milosevski has experienced no obvious trauma that would lead to him needing to block out reality through the use of drugs. Instead he began using drugs with his friends and continued to use them because, especially in the case of cocaine, he really liked it. This is why drugs are such terrible things. They are, as is obvious, addictive. People begin to use drugs and continue using more and more until often enough they end up living the sort of life that Mr Milosevski was leading when he was arrested.
	
	
	The description he gave of his life as a user/dealer is depressing in the extreme. He was living by himself, sitting alone at his home, âoff his headâ as he described, waiting for customers. He was cut off from his family. He had no real purpose in life apart from using and dealing in drugs. Not surprisingly he describes being arrested by police as a thing that has benefited him enormously. He is no longer using drugs, being in custody. He has reconnected with his family and his life has improved enormously with one qualification of course, that is, that he is in custody, but he has good prospects for the future. He recognises what went wrong and has plans to ensure that that never happens again.
	
	
	He is now 38 turning 39 in two weeksâ time. It is unusual for someone to commit their first serious offence at his age. That is perhaps enough to demonstrate that he does have good prospects of rehabilitation but on top of that he impressed me today when giving evidence, as a man with a genuine desire to better himself and he plans to use his time in custody wisely obtaining qualifications which will assist him to get work once he is released from custody.
	
	
	He has expressed his remorse today in what I believe to be a genuine expression of contrition. He said, probably quite accurately, that what he has done has damaged a lot of families. He knows for himself what can happen to a drug user because it happened to him.
	
	
	I am to sentence Mr Milosevski for two offences. One of supplying cocaine and one of supplying methyl-amphetamine. To each of those offences there are matters attached on a form 1, an offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime is attached to the supply cocaine matter, that related to the sum of $16,980 which was found in Mr Milosevskiâs home when he was arrested. The offence attached to the supply methyl-amphetamine matters is an offence of possessing cannabis relating obviously to a quantity of cannabis found in his home when he was arrested.
	
	
	Consistent with what he told police on his arrest and his expression of remorse in court today he has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. The sentences I am about to announce will be 25% less than they would otherwise have been.
	
	
	Ms Hickleton and the offender himself, as revealed in documents tendered on his behalf, accept that the only possible outcome is a custodial sentence. He has been in custody for almost a year. I am satisfied that a further period of custody is necessary in order to reflect the objective gravity of Mr Milosevskiâs criminal conduct.
	
	
	I make a finding of special circumstances in his favour. Clearly, as a long term drug user, he is going to face some challenges when he is released on parole. It is in not only his interests but it is also in the communityâs interests that he be assisted upon his release from custody in order to ensure, as far as possible, that he does not fall back to his old ways. For that reason I will make a variation from the statutory ratio of head sentence to non-parole period.
	
	
	I impose an aggregate sentence consisting of a non-parole period of two years with a head sentence of four years to date from 21 November 2013. That means that Mr Milosevski is eligible to be released to parole on 20 November 2015. I can indicate that were it not for me using the aggregate sentence provisions I would have imposed sentences of three years on each of the two matters.
	
	
	Mr Milosevski was on a s 9 bond at the time of this offence. I have taken that into account in deciding the appropriate sentences. Of course his offences represent a breach of that bond, I have decided that there should be no action taken on the breach given the sentences that I have already announced.
	
	
	I order that the drugs are to be destroyed.
	
	
	I will make an order that $16,980 be forfeited.

		16 June 2015",2014-11-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765243,The Application of the Attorney General for New South Wales dated 4 April 2014 [2014] NSWCCA 251,"HEADNOTE[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]
The Attorney General for New South Wales submitted for determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal three questions of law pursuant to s 108 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).  Those questions arose out of orders for the production of documents made by a judge of the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court in criminal proceedings in which the accused was indicted for the murder of a child.
Prior to his trial, the accused caused subpoenas to be issued to the Department of Family and Community Services (""the Department"") for the production of reports made pursuant to the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998 (NSW) (""the Act"") concerning the deceased child.  The trial judge ruled that s 29 of the Act did not preclude the Court from making the order for production.  Following production of the reports, the trial proceeded as a judge alone trial and the accused was acquitted.
The questions submitted by the Attorney General to this Court were in the following terms:
(1)  Did [the trial judge] err in construing s 29 of the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998 (the Act) as enabling a Court to order production to the Court in response to a subpoena and over objection of reports under Part 2 of the Act except insofar as they disclosed or tended to disclose the identity of the person or persons who made the reports?
(2)  Did [the trial judge] err in construing s 29(1)(e) of the Act?
(3)  Did [the trial judge] err in making the order for [production]?
Subsequently, notice was given of a constitutional matter arising in relation to s 29(1)(e) of the Act.
Held, providing negative answers to the three questions (Macfarlan JA; Beazley P and Bellew J agreeing):
(1)  The right of every accused person to a fair trial according to law extends to the whole course of the criminal process and includes an accused's right to require third parties to produce relevant documents on subpoena duces tecum ([22], [23], [29]).
(2)  The purpose of s 29 of the Act is to provide protections to persons who make reports in good faith to the Director-General of the Department concerning children or young persons ([24]).  The section is concerned with protecting the identity of reporters rather than precluding disclosure of the contents of reports as such ([31]-[32]).
(3)  The protections afforded to reporters by s 29 are by no means absolute.  The section does not exhibit an intention to preclude persons such as the accused from ever coming into possession of reports made by other persons.  Rather, the intention is limited to precluding production from being compelled ([28]).
(4)  The trial judge did not err in construing s 29 and making an order for production of s 29 reports.  The principle of legality requires that the general words of s 29(1)(e) be read down so as not to interfere with the accused's right to a fair trial by precluding him or her from compelling, by subpoena, production of s 29 reports that are relevant to the issues at trial ([29]).  The legislature has not expressed its intention to abrogate this right ""with irresistible clearness"" or ""by unmistakable and unambiguous language"" ([30]-[31]).  
(5)  The subpoenas in question were directed to a ""person"" within the meaning of s 29(1)(e) of the Act.  The word ""person"" includes a body politic.  New South Wales state government departments are aspects or manifestations of the Crown in right of the State and the State is, in turn, a body politic ([36]-[37]).  
(6)  In the alternative, in the event that s 29(1)(e) is to be construed as precluding an order for production of relevant reports, it is nevertheless not constitutionally invalid.  The State Parliament has authority to enact laws regulating the conduct of criminal trials within the State.  The legislation in question could not be regarded as quite outside the bounds of a reasonable attempt to reconcile the competing objectives of encouraging reporting of issues concerning children and young persons, and ensuring that accused persons receive fair trials ([46]-[48]).  As such, it does not interfere with the institutional integrity of the Supreme Court ([48]).




			Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Macfarlan JA.  I agree with his Honour's reasons and the answers to the questions submitted by the Attorney General.  
2MACFARLAN JA:  By Notice dated 4 April 2014 the Attorney General for New South Wales submitted for determination by this Court questions of law that arose out of orders for production of documents made by a judge of the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court in criminal proceedings in which the accused was indicted for the murder of a child.  The submission was made pursuant to s 108 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).  Following production pursuant to the orders, the trial proceeded as a judge alone trial and the accused was acquitted.
3The questions submitted by the Attorney General to this Court were in the following terms:
(1)Did [the trial judge] err in construing s 29 of the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998 (the Act) as enabling a Court to order production to the Court in response to a subpoena and over objection of reports under Part 2 of the Act except insofar as they disclosed or tended to disclose the identity of the person or persons who made the reports?
(2)Did [the trial judge] err in construing s 29(1)(e) of the Act?
(3)Did [the trial judge] err in making the order for [production]?
4The issues before this Court were in essence, first, whether s 29 of the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998 (NSW) (""the Act"") purports on its true construction to preclude the Supreme Court from making an order compelling the production of reports of the type referred to in s 29 and, secondly, whether, if it does, it is constitutionally invalid by reason of the principles stated in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24; 189 CLR 51.  The argument in relation to the first question focused on the application to s 29 of the principle of legality, which is to the effect that legislation should not be construed as abrogating fundamental rights in the absence of clear words or necessary implication that the legislature intended that result.  The fundamental right in question was said to be the right of an accused to a fair trial which, it was argued, necessarily involved a right to secure the production of relevant documents from third parties.  
SECTION 108 OF THE CRIMES (APPEAL AND REVIEW) ACT 2001
5By reason of s 108(3) of this Act, the Court's determination of the questions submitted to it by the Attorney General will not ""in any way affect or invalidate the verdict of acquittal or any other decision given at the trial"" of the accused.  Furthermore, s 108(5) provides that the ""hearing and determination of any question under [the] section is to be held in camera"".  It is not clear how the ""determination"", as distinct from the hearing, may be ""held in camera"".  However, it is tolerably clear from this subsection and from subsection (6) that the legislative intent is that the Court's judgment should not permit identification of the person charged but subsequently acquitted.  Subsection (6) is in the following terms:
""(6) The following is not to be published:
(a) any report of a submission made under subsection (2),
(b) any report of proceedings under this section that discloses the identity of the person charged at the trial or affected by the decision given at the trial.
Any such publication is punishable as a contempt of the Supreme Court.""
6As a result, the trial judge's decision is not identified in this judgment which adopts the description ""The application of the Attorney General for New South Wales dated 4 April 2014"" as its title.  
7As the judgment is incapable of affecting the rights of the formerly accused (and now acquitted) person (""the accused""), it is understandable that he did not wish to instruct counsel or solicitors to represent him at the hearing in this Court.  To provide a contradictor, the Attorney General, at his expense, instructed counsel to argue the submitted questions on behalf of the accused.  This was a course contemplated by s 108(4).  Mr Dhanji SC appeared with Ms K Edwards of counsel in this capacity.  The hearing proceeded in camera as required by s 108(5).
CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS (CARE AND PROTECTION) ACT 1998 (NSW)
8Section 8 of the Act states the Act's objects as follows:
""8   What are the objects of this Act?
The objects of this Act are to provide:
(a) that children and young persons receive such care and protection as is necessary for their safety, welfare and well-being, having regard to the capacity of their parents or other persons responsible for them, and
(b) that all institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care and protection of children and young persons provide an environment for them that is free of violence and exploitation and provide services that foster their health, developmental needs, spirituality, self-respect and dignity, and
(c) that appropriate assistance is rendered to parents and other persons responsible for children and young persons in the performance of their child-rearing responsibilities in order to promote a safe and nurturing environment.""
9Section 24 of the Act provides that a ""person who has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child or young person is, or that a class of children or young persons are, at risk of significant harm may make a report to the Director-General"" of the Department of Family and Community Services.  Section 25 provides for pre-natal reports in respect of children who may be at risk of significant harm after their birth and s 27 provides for mandatory reporting by certain health care professionals and others who suspect that a child is at risk of significant harm.  Sections 120, 121 and 122 provide for the making of reports concerning the homelessness of children and young persons.  
10Section 29 of the Act is in the following terms:
""29   Protection of persons who make reports or provide certain information
(1) If, in relation to a child or young person or a class of children or young persons, a person makes a report in good faith to the Director-General or to a person who has the power or responsibility to protect the child or young person or the class of children or young persons:
(a) the making of the report does not constitute a breach of professional etiquette or ethics or a departure from accepted standards of professional conduct, and
(b) no liability for defamation is incurred because of the report, and
(c) the making of the report does not constitute a ground for civil proceedings for malicious prosecution or for conspiracy, and
(d) the report, or evidence of its contents, is not admissible in any proceedings other than the following proceedings (and appeals arising from the following proceedings):
(i)  care proceedings in the Children's Court,
(ii)  proceedings in relation to a child or young person under the Family Law Act 1975 of the Commonwealth,
(iii)  proceedings in relation to a child or young person before the Supreme Court or the Civil and Administrative Tribunal,
(iv)  proceedings before the Civil and Administrative Tribunal,
(v)  proceedings under the Coroners Act 2009, and
(e) a person cannot be compelled in any proceedings to produce the report or a copy of or extract from it or to disclose or give evidence of any of its contents, and
(f) the identity of the person who made the report, or information from which the identity of that person could be deduced, must not be disclosed by any person or body, except with:
(i) the consent of the person who made the report, or
(ii) the leave of a court or other body before which proceedings relating to the report are conducted, 
and, unless that consent or leave is granted, a party or witness in any such proceedings must not be asked, and, if asked, cannot be required to answer, any question that cannot be answered without disclosing the identity or leading to the identification of that person.
(1A) A certificate purporting to be signed by the Director-General that a document relating to a child or young person or a class of children or young persons is a report to which this section applies is admissible in any proceedings and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, is proof that the document is such a report.
(2) A court or other body cannot grant leave under subsection (1) (f) (ii) unless the court or other body is satisfied that the evidence is of critical importance in the proceedings and that failure to admit it would prejudice the proper administration of justice.
(3) A court or other body that grants leave under subsection (1) (f) (ii):
(a) must state the reasons why leave is granted, and
(b) must ensure that the holder of the report is informed that evidence as to the identity of the person who made the report, or from which the identity of that person could be deduced, has been disclosed.
(3A) The protections given by this section to a person who makes a report apply to:
(a) any person who provided information on the basis of which the report was made, in good faith, to the person, and
(b) any person who otherwise was in good faith concerned in making such a report or causing such a report to be made, 
in the same way as they apply in respect of the person who actually made the report.
(4) Subsection (1) (f) does not prevent the disclosure of information from which the identity of a person may be deduced if the prohibition on the disclosure of that information would prevent the proper investigation of the report.
(4A) Subsection (1) (f) also does not prevent the disclosure to a law enforcement agency of the identity of the person who made the report (""the reporter""), or information from which the identity of the reporter could be deduced, if:
(a) the identity of the reporter, or the information, is disclosed in connection with the investigation of a serious offence or reportable conduct alleged to have been committed or done against a child or young person, and
(b) the disclosure is necessary for the purposes of safeguarding or promoting the safety, welfare and well-being of any child or young person (whether or not the victim of the alleged offence). (4B) However, subsection (4A) does not apply unless:
(a) a senior officer of the law enforcement agency to which the disclosure is made has, before the disclosure is made, certified in writing that obtaining the reporter's consent would prejudice the investigation of the serious offence or reportable conduct concerned, or
(b) the person or body that makes the disclosure has, before making the disclosure, certified in writing that it is impractical to obtain the consent of the reporter.
(4C) The person or body that discloses to a law enforcement agency the identity of the reporter, or the information from which the identity of the reporter could be deduced, is required to notify the reporter of the disclosure unless:
(a) it is not reasonably practicable in the circumstances to do so, or
(b) the law enforcement agency to which the disclosure is made has advised the person or body that notifying the reporter would prejudice the investigation of the serious offence or reportable conduct concerned.
(5) (Repealed)
(6) In this section:
""court"" includes a court exercising federal jurisdiction.
""law enforcement agency"" means any of the following:
(a) the NSW Police Force, (b) the Australian Federal Police, (c) the police force of another State or Territory, (d) a person or body prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this definition.
""report"" includes a report under sections 24, 25, 27, 120, 121 and 122.
""reportable conduct"" means:
(a) reportable conduct within the meaning of Part 3A of the Ombudsman Act 1974 or conduct referred to in clause 2 of Schedule 1 to the Child Protection (Working with Children) Act 2012, or
(b) conduct occurring elsewhere than in New South Wales that, if occurring in New South Wales, would be reportable conduct under paragraph (a).
""senior officer"" means:
(a) in relation to the NSW Police Force-a commissioned police officer within the meaning of the Police Act 1990, or
(b) in relation to any other law enforcement agency-a person (or class of persons) prescribed by the regulations as a senior officer of the agency.
""serious offence"" means:
(a) a serious indictable offence within the meaning of the Crimes Act 1900, or
(b) an offence committed elsewhere than in New South Wales that, if committed in New South Wales, would be an offence under paragraph (a).
Note:  It is an offence under section 254 for a person to disclose any information obtained in connection with the administration or execution of this Act, except in certain circumstances. The maximum penalty is 10 penalty units (currently $1,100) or imprisonment for up to 12 months, or both.""
THE ACCUSED'S SUBPOENAS AND THE TRIAL JUDGE'S DECISION
11Prior to his trial, the accused caused subpoenas to be issued to the Department of Family and Community Services (misdescribed as ""the Department of Community Services"") for the production of reports relating to the child that he was accused of murdering and relating also to the child's mother.  Having found that the reports were reports to which s 29 of the Act applied, the trial judge ordered that they be produced to the Court save to the extent that they disclosed or tended to disclose the identity of the persons who made them.
12Redacted copies of the reports were produced to the Court, made available to the accused and utilised by the accused at his trial.  As noted earlier, the accused was acquitted.
13Before making the order for production of the reports, the trial judge rejected the submission made by the Director-General of the Department that s 29 of the Act prevented the Court from making it.  The judge relied upon the principle of legality, finding that the accused's fundamental common law right to a fair trial would be jeopardised if s 29 were construed to preclude the Court from ordering production of the reports and that the Act did not manifest any clear intention that the section should be so construed.  
14The trial judge also rejected the Director-General's submission that the reports were privileged (and therefore should not be the subject of an order compelling production) because s 29(1)(d) rendered them inadmissible in the proceedings.  The trial judge held they were in fact at least prima facie admissible by reason of s 29(1)(d)(iii).
THE CONSTRUCTION ARGUMENT
Authorities concerning the principle of legality
15In X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92 at [86], Hayne and Bell JJ quoted with approval the principle stated by O'Connor J in Potter v Minahan [1908] HCA 63; 7 CLR 277 at 304 that:
""It is in the last degree improbable that the legislature would overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or depart from the general system of law, without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness.""
16The principle of legality dictates that ""[a] statute said to affect important common law rights and procedural and other safeguards of individual rights and freedoms will be construed 'as effecting no more than is strictly required by clear words or as a matter of necessary implication'"" (Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 87 ALJR 1082 at [29] per French CJ; see also [126] per Crennan J; [307]-[314] per Gageler and Keane JJ).
17As explained by Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ in Coco v The Queen [1994] HCA 15; 179 CLR 427 at 437:
""The insistence on express authorization of an abrogation or curtailment of a fundamental right, freedom or immunity must be understood as a requirement for some manifestation or indication that the legislature has not only directed its attention to the question of the abrogation or curtailment of such basic rights, freedoms or immunities but has also determined upon abrogation or curtailment of them. The courts should not impute to the legislature an intention to interfere with fundamental rights. Such an intention must be clearly manifested by unmistakable and unambiguous language. General words will rarely be sufficient for that purpose if they do not specifically deal with the question because, in the context in which they appear, they will often be ambiguous on the aspect of interference with fundamental rights"".
18The rationale for requiring that the Parliament make clear its intention to interfere with fundamental rights and freedoms was identified in the following observations of Lord Hoffmann in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department; Ex parte Simms [2000] 2 AC 115:
""The constraints upon [Parliament's power to legislate contrary to fundamental rights] are ultimately political, not legal.  But the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost.  Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words.  This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process.  In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual"" (at 131).
19As stated by Gageler and Keane JJ in Lee, the application of this principle of construction ""is not confined to the protection of rights, freedoms or immunities that are hard-edged, of long standing or recognised and enforceable or otherwise protected at common law.  The principle extends to the protection of fundamental principles and systemic values"" (at [313]). 
Authorities concerning the right to a fair trial
20The right of every accused person to a fair trial according to law is well-established (see X7 per French CJ and Crennan J at [37] and the authorities cited therein). 
21That right encompasses not only the trial itself but the activities and processes which occur prior to and in preparation for trial.  As French CJ and Crennan J observed in X7:
""An accused's right to a fair trial is commonly 'manifested in rules of law and of practice designed to regulate the course of the trial', but the right extends to the whole course of the criminal process"" (citations omitted) (at [38]).
22In Alister v The Queen [1984] HCA 85; 154 CLR 404 Brennan J canvassed the historical development of an accused person's right to compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses, before stating that:
""It is so basic and important an aspect of our criminal procedure that a trial in which the right is denied cannot be, in my opinion, a trial according to law.  There is no distinction to be drawn in this respect between a subpoena ad testificandum and a subpoena duces tecum"" (at 451).
23It follows that the ability for an accused person to seek access to relevant (and potentially decisive) material for the purpose of defending criminal charges brought against him or her is an aspect of the overarching right to a fair trial. 
Observations concerning s 29 of the Act
24First, it is apparent from the terms of s 29 that its purpose is to provide protections to persons who make reports in good faith to the Director-General concerning children or young persons who are at risk of harm or are homeless.  In part, the section protects a person who makes a report against professional sanctions and civil liability.  Importantly, it also seeks to protect reporters against disclosure of their identity.  It does this for the obvious reason that persons criticised or otherwise referred to in such reports may visit consequences on the reporter and the prospect of that occurring may deter or inhibit persons from making reports. 
25This object is particularly addressed by s 29(1)(f) but it is notable that the prohibition imposed by that paragraph on disclosure of the identity of the person who makes a report is not absolute.  Disclosure may occur with the consent of that person or with ""the leave of a court or other body before which proceedings relating to the report are conducted"".  
26Section 29's intent to provide protection to reporters and informants by this and other means is confirmed by its heading which, whilst not part of the Act (Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), s 35), may be referred to as relevant extrinsic material (ibid, s 34(1)(a)).  To similar effect are the Second Reading Speeches relating to s 29 in its original form and as amended in 2000 and 2011.  As the relevant Minister said in her Second Reading Speech prior to the statute's enactment in 1988:
""The unfortunate reality is that for many people concern that they may be identified as the reporter is a strong impediment to their reporting such children. Clause 29 of this bill significantly extends the protections offered to people making reports"" (at 9761).  
27Secondly, whilst s 29(1)(e) precludes a person from being compelled to produce reports or disclose their contents, the Act does not prohibit the voluntary production of reports or disclosure of their contents, provided that the identity of the reporter is not disclosed except in accordance with s 29(1)(f).  If, as its terms suggest, s 29(1)(e) precludes an accused person from compelling the Director-General to produce reports at the accused's trial, the outcome of the trial could be significantly influenced by a decision of the Director-General as to whether or not to produce the reports voluntarily.  Similarly arbitrary consequences might flow from the exceptions to inadmissibility stated in s 29(1)(d).  If parties to the there-identified proceedings chose to tender reports of which they had possession, the other parties to the proceedings, including any persons who were unable to compel their production, would be provided with copies of the reports.  As a result, the latter's rights could be significantly affected by the decision of the former to tender the reports. 
28These observations demonstrate that the protections afforded by s 29 are by no means absolute and that the section does not exhibit an intention to preclude a person such as the accused in the present case from ever coming into possession of relevant reports made by other persons to the Director-General.  Rather, the intention is limited to precluding production from being compelled.
Conclusion concerning the proper construction of s 29
29In my view s 29 should not be construed so as to preclude the accused in a criminal trial from compelling, by subpoena, production of s 29 reports that are relevant to the issues at the trial.  Thus, I consider that the principle of legality to which I have referred above (see [15] to [19]) requires that the general words of s 29(1)(e) be read down so as not to interfere with the accused's right to a fair trial.  As indicated above (see [21] to [23]), that right relates to the ""whole course of the criminal process"" and includes an accused's right to require third parties to produce relevant documents on subpoena duces tecum. 
30The legislature has not expressed its intention to abrogate this right ""with irresistible clearness"" (see [15] above) or ""by unmistakable and unambiguous language"" (see [17] above).  In the words of Lord Hoffmann (see [18] above), the legislature has not ""squarely confront[ed]"" the issue and ""general or ambiguous words"" are insufficient to abrogate such a right.
31The terms of s 29(1)(f) provide some confirmation that the present issue was not addressed by the legislature.  That paragraph prohibits disclosure of the identity of a reporter without either the consent of that person or the leave of the court or other body before which proceedings relating to the report are conducted.  Thus, a court could, if it considered ""that the evidence is of critical importance in the proceedings and that failure to admit it [into evidence] would prejudice the proper administration of justice"" (see subsection (2)), permit the disclosure of the identity of a report-maker.  It would be anomalous if a court were prevented by s 29(1)(e) from requiring a witness to give evidence of the contents of a s 29 report but could nevertheless require the witness to identify the maker of the report.  This would conflict with the apparent purpose of s 29 to protect reporters rather than to protect the contents of reports as an end in itself.
32The view that s 29 is concerned to protect the identity of reporters rather than to preclude disclosure of the contents of reports as such is confirmed by the contemplation in s 29(1)(d) that reports may be admitted into evidence in various specified court proceedings.  The section does not require confidentiality orders to be made in relation to reports so admitted, save that s 29(1)(f) restricts disclosure of the identity of the reporter.
33It follows from the above that the trial judge did not err in construing s 29 and making an order for production of s 29 reports.  The three questions submitted by the Attorney General to this Court (see [3] above) should therefore be answered in the negative.  
34In conclusion I should refer to the alternative submission put on behalf of the accused that s 29(1)(e) did not prevent the trial judge from compelling production because the order was not directed to a ""person"" within the meaning of that paragraph.  
35The accused's subpoenas were directed to the Department of Community Services but the parties agreed that they should be treated as if the Department had been correctly named as the Department of Family and Community Services.  Counsel instructed to argue the submitted questions on behalf of the accused in this Court submitted that the Department was not a ""person"" within the meaning of s 29(1)(e) and that the prohibition in s 29(1)(e) accordingly did not apply.
36New South Wales state government departments such as the Department of Family and Community Services do not have separate legal personality but are rather ""aspects or manifestations of the Crown in the right of the State of New South Wales"" (Haines v Tempesta (1995) 37 NSWLR 24 at 30).  The State is, in turn, a ""body politic"" (Lipohar v The Queen [1999] HCA 65; 200 CLR 485 at [48] and [107]; Hoxton Park Residents Action Group Inc v Liverpool City Council (No 2) [2011] NSWCA 363 at [50]; and Sneddon v State of New South Wales [2012] NSWCA 351 at [206]).
37The inclusive definition of ""person"" in s 21 of the Interpretation Act 1987 applies to the word ""person"" in s 29(1)(e) of the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act.  That definition includes within the meaning of ""person"", ""a body corporate or politic"".  As the subpoenas in question were directed to a manifestation of a body politic, being the State of New South Wales, they were directed to a ""person"".  The alternative construction argument advanced on behalf of the accused is therefore rejected.  
THE CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY OF S 29(1)(e)
38As an alternative to the construction argument with which I have dealt above, counsel on behalf of the accused argued that s 29(1)(e) of the Act is constitutionally invalid because it requires the Supreme Court of New South Wales to conduct proceedings in a fashion which substantially impairs, or is incompatible with or repugnant to, the Court's institutional integrity.  This situation is in turn said to be incompatible with the Court's role as a repository of the judicial power of the Commonwealth.
39Counsel relied upon the principles stated in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24; 189 CLR 51 which were referred to by the plurality in Pollentine v Bleijie [2014] HCA 30 as follows:
""42. ... The principles have their roots in Ch III of the Constitution and limit State legislative power. '[T]he Parliaments of the States [may] not legislate to confer powers on State courts which are repugnant to or incompatible with their exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth.' And it is now the accepted doctrine of the Court that, as Gummow J said in Fardon, 'the essential notion is that of repugnancy to or incompatibility with that institutional integrity of the State courts which bespeaks their constitutionally mandated position in the Australian legal system'. But, as the plurality in Pompano also pointed out, the repugnancy doctrine 'does not imply into the Constitutions of the States the separation of judicial power mandated for the Commonwealth by Ch III'. Hence, 'the notions of repugnancy to and incompatibility with the continued institutional integrity of the State courts are not to be treated as if they simply reflect what Ch III requires in relation to the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth'"" (citations omitted).
40The general features of the judicial process were described by Gaudron J in Re Nolan; Ex parte Young [1991] HCA 29; 172 CLR 460 as follows:
""... open and public enquiry (subject to limited exceptions), the application of the rules of natural justice, the ascertainment of the facts as they are and as they bear on the right or liability in issue and the identification of the applicable law, followed by an application of that law to those facts"" (at 496) (emphasis added).
41This description was quoted with approval by the plurality in Assistant Commissioner Condon v Pompano Pty Ltd [2013] HCA 7; 87 ALJR 458 at [142].
42It is well-established that the Parliament has the power to regulate criminal trials by enacting laws relating to evidence and procedure, including laws which prescribe what evidence may or may not be used in those proceedings.  However, as noted in Nicholas v The Queen [1998] HCA 9; 193 CLR 173 by Toohey J:
""It might be necessary, in a particular situation, to look closely at the consequences of rejecting or admitting the evidence. Those consequences may, for instance, be so inimical to the idea of a fair trial that a question arises as to the power of the legislature, at any rate where the judicial power of the Commonwealth is involved"" (at [53]).
43Mr Dhanji SC submitted on behalf of the accused that the fact that the result of a trial such as that of the accused might be ""affected by an arbitrary decision made by a non-judicial body and unreviewable by the court before which the proceedings are conducted, is apt to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice"".  He submitted that whilst the Department of Family and Community Services could not, on the Attorney General's construction of s 29, be compelled to produce s 29 reports, it was open to the Department to produce them voluntarily to whoever it thought fit and thereby potentially affect the outcome of the trial by its voluntary act.  
44In reliance upon Pompano at [88], he also submitted that it was a factor against constitutional validity that the Supreme Court did not ""retain decisional independence"" or ""the powers necessary to mitigate the extent of the unfairness"" to an accused.  He submitted that the unfairness involved in precluding the accused from obtaining relevant material from third parties was emphasised by the fact that the Court would never know whether an accused was in fact denied a fair trial in particular circumstances.
45In response, the Attorney General submitted that the legislation did not lead to any departure, or at least not any radical departure, from conventional procedure in that the decision as to whether documents fell within a category where production could be resisted was left to the Court.
46In my view the accused's constitutional invalidity argument should be rejected.  The argument needs to be considered on the hypothesis (which I have found not to be the case) that, as a matter of construction, s 29(1)(e) precludes an order being made in favour of an accused for the Department to produce the s 29 reports in question.  This would have been found to be the correct construction of the provision only if the Court had concluded that the legislature had made plain its intention to interfere with the important rights of the accused to which I have earlier referred.  If the assumption is made that the legislature did this, the accused's argument of constitutional invalidity must in my view fail. 
47Clearly the State Parliament has authority to enact laws regulating the conduct of criminal trials within the State.  Unquestionably, in respect of many issues, the Parliament must balance competing interests and objectives.  Here the Parliament had to balance the undoubtedly desirable objective of encouraging reporting of issues affecting the safety, welfare or well-being of children and young persons with the objective of ensuring that accused persons receive fair trials.  If, as must be assumed when considering the constitutional invalidity argument, the legislature considered not only the former but also the latter objective, it would be difficult to conclude that the institutional integrity of the Court was undermined unless Parliament's considered decision could be regarded as quite outside the bounds of a reasonable attempt to reconcile those competing objectives.  In my view, the legislation in question here cannot be described as either arbitrary or manifestly disproportionate to the issues at stake (see KS v Veitch (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 266; 84 NSWLR 172 at [64] per Basten JA referring to Williamson v Ah On [1926] HCA 46; 39 CLR 95 at 117).  As with the law in question in Veitch, s 29(1)(e) does not ""deprive [an] accused of some source of information to which he is presumptively entitled"" nor, bearing in mind the competing objectives which it attempts to attain, is it ""a law which would tend to bring the criminal trial process into disrepute"" (Veitch at [65]).
48Whilst, on the Attorney General's construction, s 29(1)(e) constitutes an erosion of an accused's right to a fair trial, it is not (on the assumption that I make at this point in the argument) an erosion that has occurred without careful consideration and attention to rational competing objectives.  As such, it is not an erosion of such a type or magnitude that should be regarded as interfering with the institutional integrity of the Supreme Court (compare the observation of Toohey J in Nicholas referred to in [42] above).  It is not therefore ""repugnant to the judicial process in a fundamental degree"" (International Finance Trust Company Ltd v New South Wales Crime Commission [2009] HCA 49; 240 CLR 319 at [140] per Heydon J citing Gummow J in Kable at 132).
CONCLUSION
49For the reasons above, negative answers should be given to each of the following three questions submitted by the Attorney General to this Court for determination:
(1)Did [the trial judge] err in construing s 29 of the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998 (the Act) as enabling a Court to order production to the Court in response to a subpoena and over objection of reports under Part 2 of the Act except insofar as they disclosed or tended to disclose the identity of the person or persons who made the reports?
(2)Did [the trial judge] err in construing s 29(1)(e) of the Act?
(3)Did [the trial judge] err in making the order for [production]?
50As the accused has not been represented in the proceedings in this Court other than by counsel for whose reasonable costs the Attorney General or Director of Public Prosecutions is responsible under s 108(4) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, it is unnecessary to make any order for costs.
51BELLEW J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.

2765245,R v Heffernan [2014] NSWDC 302,"Judgment


	
	Most people face financial difficulty of some sort or another in their lives. People deal with their financial setbacks, including losses. But the man I am sentencing today was not prepared to see his parentsâ property fail to sell, so he embarked on a stunningly bold and illicit project to raise quick cash within a year. The project was also dangerous. Not only was he at risk of being caught but it was very dangerous for the community, particularly young people.
	
	
	The manâs name is Steven Wayne Heffernan. I am sentencing him for two serious crimes, both of them under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The first crime is cultivating a prohibited plant, namely cannabis. That is an offence against section 23(1)(a) of the Act and Parliament has fixed a maximum of 10 years imprisonment to that crime. The second crime that I am sentencing him for is supplying a prohibited drug. Again the prohibited drug was cannabis but the amount was a commercial quantity. That is an offence against section 25(2) of the same Act. Parliament regards that as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of15 years imprisonment to that offence.
	
	
	When I am sentencing Mr Heffernan for the drug supply offence, he has asked me to take into account an offence of having goods in custody, namely $1,400. I will take that into account when I am sentencing him and I sign a Form under section 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to that effect.
	
	
	It is important for a judge to set out, as part of the judgeâs remarks on sentence, what happened in the particular case to constitute the crime. This is so that there is a public record of what happened but also so that the judge can make an assessment of how serious an example of the crime the particular one is that the judge is sentencing for. Some behaviour amounting to an offence may be much more serious than other behaviour amounting to the same offence.
	
	
	In this case Steven Heffernanâs parents, Michael and Anne Heffernan, own a rural property named âLosannieâ. It is at Mirannie, about an hourâs drive from Singleton. On 10 April 2014 police turned up at Losannie for an enquiry quite unrelated to what they found. When they arrived they found the roller door to a garage up and inside they found, as the agreed facts say, âbranches from cannabis plantsâ. They were hanging from a line drawn across the garage. Mr Heffernan met the police and immediately admitted that he was responsible for what the police found.
	
	
	Inside the farmhouse police found âa large quantity of cannabis heads in the process of being weighed in the kitchen area of the homestead. There were also vacuum sealed bags containing cannabis leaf and a large plastic container containing cannabis heads inside the home.â Mr Heffernan remained co-operative and admitted that he was responsible for what the police found.
	
	
	Police searched the property. Again Mr Heffernan was co-operative and he showed them where he had been growing plants on the property. Police seized the following: 32.8 kilograms of cannabis leaf and head, 12 cannabis plants and $1,400 in cash. Mr Heffernan was charged with the two offences that I am sentencing him for today.
	
	
	The 32 kilograms of cannabis leaf is, as I said, more than a commercial quantity of that drug. However, it is not much more because the commercial quantity is a minimum of 25 kilograms. That is a relevant factor for me to take into account.
	
	
	Exhibit A, tendered by Mr H Fitzhardinge who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, includes photographs of the plants and the cannabis leaf, some of it, indeed, divided into large plastic bags. There is no suggestion that Mr Heffernan was involved with anybody else in the offences that he committed.
	
	
	It is also important for a judge, in sentencing an offender, to take into account the personal circumstances of the offender. In this case Mr Heffernan is 51. He comes before the court with practically a clear criminal record. There is only one PCA conviction from almost 30 years ago. That has no weight whatsoever. I treat him as a man with no criminal convictions.
	
	
	In addition, I regard him as a man of exemplary character. I do not say that lightly. The references which are included in exhibit 1, which was tendered by Mr P Harper of counsel who appears for Mr Heffernan, bear out that opinion. They are references from men and women who have known Mr Heffernan for a very long time and who, knowing about the offences, have made assertions about his good character and about the efforts, extraordinary in some cases, that he goes to in order to help others whom he has come across in his life.
	
	
	Also included amongst the material is a letter from his parents which points out that they had been trying to sell their family property. They have been trying to sell it since 2007. They had it listed for nearly $800,000 but it is now listed for nearly $600,000. The Valuer General has determined the landâs value at $250,000. They have not received any offers despite inspections. They said that their son, Mr Heffernan, âhas been lending us money to pay outstanding accountsâ. Both of them pointed out that their health is not good. MrÂ Heffernan senior has had a heart attack and heart surgery. He also has osteoarthritis and has had knee surgery and, understandably, has depression related to his sonâs predicament. Mrs Heffernan has suffered breast cancer and also suffers from osteoarthritis. They no longer can live at Losannie because of its remote location.
	
	
	There is also a letter from the offender Mr Heffernanâs wife. They share two children. They have been living together on and off for some time but were married last year. Mr Steven Heffernanâs wife, Linda, also has health issues, including rheumatic heart disease, and explains obviously how MrÂ Heffernanâs offending behaviour has impacted on their children, their two daughters, one of whom is 14 and the other nine.
	
	
	Included in exhibit 1 was a letter from Mr Heffernan himself. In addition, Mr Harper called his client to give evidence in the proceedings before me. MrÂ Heffernan explains in his letter how he has been employed as a plant operator at Lemington open cut mine for the last 33 years. He is still in that job. He has suffered a number of injuries at work, which are attested to by an affidavit of his solicitor, John McDonald, attaching numerous medical reports and documents related to his injuries at work. The result of those is that he is on restricted duties and earns less than he might otherwise do. A couple of years ago he was diagnosed with diabetes and has required insulin treatment ever since. The house he lives in with his wife and daughters is mortgaged for about $70,000 and he is the sole breadwinner. That is because his wife cannot work because of her injuries. His eldest daughter is at high school - she has some learning difficulties - and his youngest daughter is in primary school. He referred to his parentsâ predicament and how everything âcame to a head in March this year when my father had a heart attack and underwent bypass surgeryâ.
	
	
	Mr Heffernan himself has financially supported his parents over the last half dozen years, to the extent of some $60,000. The farm needs a good deal of maintenance. One item was a road repair. There was no cash within the family to do that in order to improve the property.
	
	
	Mr Heffernan explained that he âsaw an article online that said âplant Fatherâs Day and harvest Motherâs Dayâ.â He added that he âsaw it as a solution to the problemâ. The article was about growing cannabis. He then proceeded to buy âseeds on line from England using my Visa cardâ. They arrived and he âplanted out 20 seedlings, expecting a failure rate of possibly 50%â.
	
	
	He acknowledged that his âsolutionâ hurt everyone and he expressed his remorse and contrition. He expressed that very clearly in the witness box as well.
	
	
	In the witness box he explained that his current salary is $140,000 per annum on his restricted duties.
	
	
	Exhibit 1, which is a carefully prepared document, shows the amounts that Mr Heffernan has paid to support members of his family over the years. It comes to a total of nearly $81,000. It is consistent with the kind of person described by those who have provided character references.
	
	
	As he said in the witness box, he conceived the idea âto get the farm up to scratch to he could sell itâ. The problem was, the farm could not be sold.
	
	
	He was asked by Mr Harper what he was going to do with the harvest. He said that he was trying to organise a purchaser. He knew someone who smoked cannabis and he hoped to source a bulk buyer. He was hoping to sell his supply of cannabis as one lot and raise at least $40,000. He did not think at the time of the impact that it might have on the community, having, if everything went according to the plan, over 30 kilograms - well over 30Â kilograms, including any to be harvested, which is relevant to observe on sentence - distributed in the community.
	
	
	Unlike many offenders, exhibitÂ 1 includes the product of MrÂ Heffernanâs research on cannabis use which he has made since being arrested and charged. In the witness box, when I asked him, he acknowledged the links between cannabis and mental health issues, the time and energy devoted by police and the risk to young people. Those observations are consistent with the research.
	
	
	I might add that exhibit 1 also demonstrates that Mr Heffernan is a supporter of the Cancer Council, with regular and generous donations.
	
	
	Mr Heffernanâs own medical condition is borne out by a letter from his general practitioner, Dr Jon Pauley, contained in exhibit 1. It confirms his insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and WorkCover related conditions. Mr Harper asked Mr Heffernan about his future employment. He asked for leave at half pay but that was refused. He has accumulated leave which will take him through to the middle of March next year. Mr Harper asked him what would happen then. Mr Heffernan replied that he had enquired at work and if he did not turn up at work after his leave expired then his employment would be terminated. At his age, and with his medical conditions contributing to his restricted employability, his prospects of future employment would not be good at all. In addition, Mr Heffernan expressed the opinion that being terminated would deprive him of the opportunity for any redundancy payment in the future, which could amount to something like a quarter of a million dollars.
	
	
	Cross-examined by Mr Fitzhardinge, he acknowledged that this was his first and only crop, and the risk that was posed to the community, especially by a man with his own children.
	
	
	In assessing the seriousness of the offences, I bear in mind that MrÂ Heffernan was acting alone in this enterprise. It is also relevant to find that the supply offence was towards the bottom of the commercial quantity range. So far as the cultivation was concerned, there were only 12 plants left. I have to be careful there. I make that observation - and indeed, finding - because the rest of the cannabis had been harvested. I am sentencing him for, so far as I am concerned, cultivating 12 plants.
	
	
	Mr Harperâs argument was that his clientâs enterprise should not be counted as trafficking because it is one transaction. I reject that argument. To my mind it flies in the face of common sense for me to conclude that a person who grows cannabis and is at the stage of having harvested over 30Â kilograms in order to sell and make money is not trafficking in drugs. Grove J, in Livas v R [2006] NSWCCA 54 at [14], expressed the opinion that âa person may be involved in âtraffickingâ without necessarily supplying on more than one occasion.â
	
	
	This was, in my opinion, a relatively sophisticated and certainly commercial enterprise that Mr Heffernan was engaged in. He wanted to raise sufficient funds to add capital improvements to a property. This is the point made in submissions by Mr Fitzhardinge. The enterprise was for one purpose, namely to make money so that he could improve the value of a property to make it more saleable. I accept Mr Fitzhardingeâs submission.
	
	
	Returning to the question of trafficking, Mr Heffernan was not a trafficker in the sense of being a street dealer selling regularly but he was the grower and cultivator and source of the drugs, and hoping to reap the large profit. He was not selling, or proposing to sell, in order to eke out an existence as a drug dependent addict, but in order to improve the value of a capital asset.
	
	
	There is, in my opinion, no duplicity in the two charges. There should be some concurrency in the proposed sentences but I have to bear in mind that, in addition to the 30-odd kilograms of cannabis leaf that was to be supplied, there were still 12 plants unharvested which are not included in that 30-oddÂ kilograms.
	


HARPER: Might I assist your Honour on that point?

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

HARPER: Your Honour, those 12 plants--

HIS HONOUR: Are the subject of the photograph.

HARPER: I can show you a photograph, your Honour. They had been harvested.

HIS HONOUR: They are on the brief, arenât they?

FITZHARDINGE: They are, they are part of the exhibits, exhibit A.

HARPER: It is part of the 30 kilo, your Honour. So what was found were the stems.

HIS HONOUR: They are part of it?

HARPER: Stems left in the ground. They had been harvested. So they are the ones the police found in the ground, that they then pulled out and took back to the farmhouse and photographed. Thatâs the state they were in when they were discovered by police.

HIS HONOUR: So that the 30 kilograms odd included--

HARPER: Those 12, the product of those 12 plants.

HIS HONOUR: Which had been harvested. All right, I will give that back, I have looked at that.

HARPER: Thank you.

HIS HONOUR: Just bear with me for a moment, in that case.

HARPER: So your Honour was talking about no duplicity, and there needed to be some concurrency because in addition to the 32 there were 12 plants.

HIS HONOUR: I return to my remarks on sentence.


	
	Mr Harper appropriately interrupted me to draw my attention to a photograph as part of exhibit A which is of about a dozen plants which were uprooted. He pointed out, which I had not appreciated, that they had obviously been harvested and effectively stripped bare. He makes that observation in support of his submission that there is a degree of duplicity in the charges. I myself would not regard the charges as duplicitous but I think there is some force in his submission as it relates to the seriousness of that offence and to the question of totality. I have in fact revised the sentence which I proposed to impose in respect of that offence and I will refer to that shortly.
	
	
	I accept the submission of Mr Harper concerning the credibility of his client. Mr Harper submitted that his clientâs actions demonstrated a misdirected but loyal attitude to his parents. I do not regard âmisdirectedâ as an appropriate description of the behaviour of his client. To my mind it was a flagrant offence against the community and its laws.
	
	
	Mr Harper argued that his client should receive a discount of 25% on the sentence I would otherwise impose because of his early plea of guilty. MrÂ Fitzhardinge agreed with that submission.
	
	
	Mr Harper acknowledged that I have no other choice but to impose a prison sentence, which is a relevant consideration under section 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. He added, however, that there would be a question as to how the sentence might be served, and that options might include home detention or an intensive corrections order.
	
	
	Mr Harper acknowledged that an aggravating factor of the offence was that it was committed for financial gain. That is provided for by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(o). I also am of the view that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity in accordance with clause (n). I agree with MrÂ Harper that it lacked a degree of sophistication that some plantations might have but, on the other hand, it was conceived as a way of earning money, and MrÂ Heffernan went to the trouble of contacting a supplier in England, paying for the seeds and planting and harvesting them. It was far from a spontaneous or thoughtless crime. I accept also that his client was acting alone.
	
	
	I now turn to the question of the appropriate sentences which I should impose for these crimes committed by Mr Heffernan. Taking into account my findings on how serious the crimes were and his personal features, I formerly regarded the appropriate sentence for the cultivate offence as one of two years imprisonment. In light of Mr Harperâs submission, I have revised that and I now regard an appropriate penalty for that offence as being one year imprisonment.
	
	
	The other offence is more serious. It carries a greater maximum. I have to take into account the matter on the Form 1, although it is relatively minor. I regard an appropriate sentence for the supply charge as one of three and one-half years imprisonment.
	
	
	Because Mr Heffernan has pleaded guilty to each offence, I am going to reduce my proposed sentences by 25% each. The one year proposed sentence will become a sentence of nine months imprisonment. The three and a half years sentence of imprisonment, I am going to reduce to two and a half years imprisonment, even though that is a slightly greater discount than 25%.
	
	
	Because of the point made by Mr Harper, the accumulation which I formerly had in mind of six months, I am going to reduce to two months. So I would have accumulated the two sentences so that the overall total would be two years and eight months.
	
	
	What I propose to do is to fix an aggregate sentence of imprisonment. That means instead of fixing two sentences, I will fix one sentence of two years and eight months. Normally a sentence of two years and eight months would carry a non-parole period of some 20 months. However, I accept Mr Harperâs submissions that there are special circumstances for reducing that. I am of the opinion, as he submitted, that his clientâs prospects of rehabilitation are very good, and that he is unlikely to reoffend. His client was obviously contrite as well. But in fixing this sentence, I have to bear in mind that I am sentencing a man who, despite being a father, put - or was proposing to put - into the community some $40,000 worth of cannabis.
	
	
	Returning to the question of the non-parole period, I propose to fix a non-parole period of 50%, or one year and four months.
	


HIS HONOUR: I am going to sentence you, Mr Heffernan.


	
	I sentence you to imprisonment for two years and eight months. That sentence commences today - no, I am going to backdate the sentence to Monday, because of your time in custody earlier when you were arrested, about four days - so that sentence commenced on 3 November 2014, and will expire on 2 July 2017. I fix a non-parole period of one year and four months. That also commenced last Monday, 3 November 2014, and will expire on 2Â March 2016. The balance of the term is one year and four months, commencing 3 March 2016 and expiring on 2 July 2017.
	


HIS HONOUR:Â Â Â Have a seat, Mr Heffernan. First, gentlemen, are the figures correct, and secondly, I have to make a parole order, so I am wondering about conditions of parole.

FITZHARDINGE: Just bear with me for a moment, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

FITZHARDINGE: The Crown is content with the figures, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: The mathematics are correct?

FITZHARDINGE: The mathematics works. As far as supervision on parole, it is difficult to envisage what supervision would be of assistance to the--

HIS HONOUR: I am inclined to agree. I am not sure that he needs much, if anything; perhaps just a good behaviour.

FITZHARDINGE: Whilst my friend is doing figures and things, I will ask your Honour for an order under section 39P of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, just in relation to the destruction of the drugs. And I understand weâd be asking your Honour to make some consent orders in relation to the Form 1 matter, the money.

HIS HONOUR: What, forfeiture?

FITZHARDINGE: Forfeiture to the Crown.

HARPER: Thatâs by consent.

HIS HONOUR: Okay. And the numbers?

HARPER: Correct, your Honour. Sorry for the delay.

HIS HONOUR: No, thatâs all right; itâs important. Now, conditions. Mr Harper, I am thinking--

HARPER: I have heard what your Honour has had to say. I donât oppose that course, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: You agree? All right.


	
	Under s50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I make an order directing the release of Mr Heffernan on parole on 2 March 2016. The conditions of the parole are these:
	



	
	That he be of good behaviour.
	
	
	That he notify the registrar of this Court of his address and any change of address.
	
	
	That he attend court if he receives a notice to do so.
	



	
	Under s39P of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, I direct that the drugs the subject of this case be destroyed.
	


HIS HONOUR:Â Â Â And you have got a notice of motion?

FITZHARDINGE: Short minutes of order for your Honour to sign in relation to the forfeiture of theâ


	
	I grant leave for the filing in court of the short minutes of order. And I should add that I convict Mr Heffernan of the two offences.
	


HIS HONOUR: What is the leave? The property forwarded by order - blank - be disposed of forthwith. What does that mean? So I am forfeiting the $1,400 to the State, and the second is a leave.

FITZHARDINGE: Iâd invite your Honour to delete the âgives leave thatâ, and the second order. It simply needs to be forfeited to the State.

HIS HONOUR: Just delete (2) altogether?

FITZHARDINGE: Thank you, your Honour.


	
	I make orders in the short minutes of forfeiture order, signed and dated by me today, and that is an order that the $1,400 be forfeited to the State.
	


HIS HONOUR:Â Â Â I will give that to my associate to place on the court file. Now, is there anything else before I explain the sentence to MrÂ Heffernan? No?

HARPER: No, thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Heffernan, I have given you a gaol sentence, it is two years and eight months. It commenced last Monday and it will finally expire on 2 July 2017. Your non-parole period, which would normally be three-quarters of that, about 20 months, I have reduced it to one year and four months, 16 months. That commenced last Monday as well, and it will expire on 2 March 2016. I have ordered that you be released on 2 March 2016, and you will be on parole then. You will be on parole for another year and four months, until the sentence itself expires on 2 July 2017. When you are on parole, both Mr Harper and Mr Fitzhardinge do not think you need supervision, and nor do I, but you need to let the registrar of the Court know where you are living, and any change of that address, and if you get a notice to come to court, you have got to turn up.

Does that all make sense?

OFFENDER: It does, yep.

COURT OFFICER: Corrective Services are on the way.

HIS HONOUR: They are on the way. Okay, you will have to wait, I am afraid. Do your relatives want to come up here to - they donât have to; no, fine. All right, you have got to stay there, I am afraid.

Thanks, Mr Harper. Thanks, Mr Fitzhardinge.

2765270,R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 12) [2014] NSWSC 1595,"ex tempore Judgment

Re application for discharge of accused Issakidis and/or application for separate trial for accused Issakidis (ref T3341)


	
	On 4 November, 2014, being day 51 of this trial, one of the accused, Anthony Dickson, completed his evidence in chief. On day 52, and immediately prior to the Crown Prosecutor commencing his cross-examination of Mr Dickson, IÂ heard and determined an application by the Crown to cross-examine MrÂ Dickson on certain documents and lead evidence in reply (see R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 11) [2014] NSWSC 1570) (âDickson (No 11)â). During the course of that application there was a discussion about the source of certain documents recently handed to the Crown Prosecutor, including one that was said to âcut right across this caseâ. It emerged during the course of argument that the defence had never previously seen at least some of those documents.
	
	
	Shortly after the judgment in Dickson (No 11) was delivered Mr Byrne QC, Senior Counsel for the other accused, Michael Issakidis, advised the Court that he had instructions to seek a discharge of the jury so far as his client was concerned and to apply for a separate trial. Further argument in respect of both of Mr Byrne QCâs applications was adjourned until day 54, being Friday 7Â November 2014.
	
	
	Both on 5 and 7 November 2014, Senior Counsel for Mr Dickson, Mr Gross QC confirmed that he had express instructions on behalf of his client not to seek a discharge of the jury in respect of him.
	
	
	In his written submissions filed in support of the applications, Mr Byrne QC identified the basis for the discharge application as being what was described as a continuous and, it was said, late disclosure of material by the Crown throughout the trial, including after the close of the Crown case. It was submitted that this had caused such prejudice that his client could no longer receive a fair trial. Mr Byrne contended that, among other matters, the late receipt of the material had denied his client an opportunity to cross-examine a number of important Crown witnesses, including Mr John Dickson, Adrian Compton and Michael Harvey, with a view to establishing that Mr Issakidis was not involved âat the pointy end of the conspiracyâ, the subject of Count 1, that is he had no knowledge or involvement in the lodgement of tax returns by NeuMedix Health Australasia Pty Ltd (âNHAâ) that contained allegedly false depreciation claims.
	
	
	These submissions were developed orally in a manner outlined below and which, at least in part, concentrated on the fact that the source of some of these documents was the Australian Taxation Office (âATOâ).
	
	
	The application for a separate trial was based largely on a statement from the judgment in R v Darby [1982] HCA 32; 148 CLR 668 at 678 (âDarbyâ) and the supposed differences in the evidence admissible âagainstâ each of MrÂ Issakidis and MrÂ Dickson.
	
	
	It should be noted that, although the practical effect of granting Mr Issakidis' discharge application might be that he obtains a trial separate to Mr Dickson, that would not necessarily be the case. If Mr Issakidis was to be discharged, but for some reason the trial in respect of Mr Dickson did not proceed to verdict, then the possibility of a joint trial with Mr Issakidis would still arise. It follows that, even if I grant Mr Issakidis' discharge application, it will still be necessary to address the application for a separate trial. That said, IÂ will address the discharge application before the separate trial application. However it is first necessary to briefly outline some features of the Crown case and the nature of the defence advanced on behalf of Mr Issakidis to date.
	


The Crown case


	
	I set out a brief prÃ©cis of the Crown case in R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 1) [2014] NSWSC 1068 (âDickson (No 1)â) at [7] ff (âDickson (No 1)â). I discussed it further in R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 9) [2014] NSWSC 1460 at [20]ff (âDickson (NoÂ 9)â. IÂ will not repeat either of those discussions, but the following three points should be noted.
	
	
	First, the Crown case includes a vast number of documents. To date each juror has been given over twenty folders. I referred to the significance of this in R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 6) [2014] NSWSC 1368 at [19] and [26] (âDickson (NoÂ 6)â) and IÂ will not repeat those comments.
	
	
	Second, there is a significant difference in the strength of the Crown case on Count 1 against Mr Dickson compared to MrÂ Issakidis. Count 1 is a conspiracy case. The critical element of the charge is whether Mr Dickson and Mr Issakidis agreed to âcause [NHA] to lodge income tax returns claiming depreciation expenses based on the alleged cost of the purported acquisition of intellectual property by [NHA] where no such cost or obligation had been incurred by [NHA]â.
	
	
	It is now not in dispute that Mr Anthony Dickson caused NHA's tax returns to be lodged. At the time of the lodgement of the first set of returns the Crown witness, Michael Harper, was working with Mr Dickson and for NHA. He had commenced working with NHA in July 1999. Further, the evidence revealed that another Crown witness, Adrian Compton, prepared the amended tax returns under MrÂ Dickson's direction. They were ultimately signed by MrÂ Dickson.
	
	
	Although in Dickson (No 9) I accepted that there was a prima facie case that MrÂ Issakidis entered into an agreement the subject of Count 1, I also accepted that there was no direct evidence that he saw the returns, any of the agreements on which the depreciation claims were based, or any of the allegedly bogus valuations from the Karkalla Biotechnology Group (âKBGâ) which were provided by MrÂ Dickson to the ATO to support the claims in the tax returns (see Dickson (No 9) at [26]). The only development on that position from MrÂ Anthony Dickson's evidence to date, was that he has stated that he discussed the terms of the assignment from Athena Health Patents Inc (âAthenaâ) to NHA with MrÂ Issakidis. The executed documents of the assignment agreements which have been put into evidence by Mr Anthony Dickson were signed by him and not by Mr Issakidis.
	
	
	Third, consistent with what I have just stated, to this time the approach taken by MrÂ Byrne QC on behalf of Mr Issakidis has been to cross-examine Crown witnesses in an effort to negate any suggestion that his client was involved, or at least had any substantial involvement, in the financial and taxation affairs of NHA.
	


Duty to ensure a fair trial


	
	In Libke v R [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [35], Kirby and Callinan JJ described the duty of a trial judge to ensure a fair trial as âtranscendentâ and the âhighest of all dutiesâ. Although their Honours were in dissent, there is no reason to doubt their description of the extent of the duty imposed on the trial judge. Nevertheless, as submitted by the Crown Prosecutor, a fair trial is not necessarily a perfect one (see Dietrich v R [1992] HCA 57; 177 CLR 292 at 365). With a perfect trial, the accused person is apprised of the evidence relied on by the Crown and all other relevant material well prior to the trial commencing. With an imperfect trial, the material is sometimes provided late, but the occasioning of an unfair trial is avoided by the Court adopting various measures that fall short of discharging the accused person, such as recalling a witness, conducting a Basha inquiry (R v Basha (1989) 39 A Crim R 337), or precluding the material that is produced late from being relied on by the Crown (see, for example, Dickson (NoÂ 6)).
	
	
	However, in a trial such as this, the later the provision of documents, whether as material to be relied upon by the Crown or simply in discharge of its duty of disclosure, then the more difficult it becomes to address the prejudice thereby occasioned to the accused. That said, I make it clear that I am approaching this application on the basis that I should not discharge the jury unless I am positively satisfied that a fair trial for Mr Issakidis is no longer possible.
	


The ATO documents


	
	In around March or April 2012, the Australian Federal Police (âAFPâ) executed search warrants on the business premises of NHA, Mr Anthony Dickson's home, Mr Michael Issakidis' home, and various other premises. Following the execution of those warrants, the ATO executed notices under sÂ 263 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (âITAAâ) on many of those premises. In executing those notices the ATO officers took copies of documents from the relevant locations that were not seized by the AFP. Later, the ATO served notices under sÂ 264 of the ITAA on the AFP, and obtained electronic copies of the materials that the AFP had seized. In the end result, the ATO possessed an electronically searchable database that included material that was not seized by the AFP.
	
	
	After the ATO executed the sÂ 263 notices, it engaged in correspondence with the relevant owners or occupiers of the various premises in relation to such matters as to whether legal professional privilege was claimed over the documents that had been copied. However, the relevant ATO officer, Mr Harvey, accepted that no steps were taken by the ATO to apprise each of the accused persons of the documents that were seized and copied at any of the premises, other than their own homes.
	
	
	On 26 May 2014, the Crown served on each of the accused persons a notice under sÂ 142 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (the âCPAâ) (see Dickson (No 6) at [7]). Section 142(1)(j) of the CPA provides:
	


â142 Prosecutionâs notice

(1) For the purposes of section 141 (1) (a), the prosecutionâs notice is to contain the following:

â¦

(j) a list identifying:

Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â any information, document or other thing of which the prosecutor is aware and that would reasonably be regarded as being of relevance to the case but that is not in the prosecutorâs possession and is not in the accused personâs possession, and

Â Â Â (ii)Â Â Â the place at which the prosecutor believes the information, document or other thing is situatedâ


	
	This provision needs to be read with sÂ 142(1)(i) of the CPA which requires the Crown to provide:
	


âA copy of any information, document or other thing provided by law enforcement officers to the prosecutor, or otherwise in the possession of the prosecutor, that would reasonably be regarded as relevant to the prosecution case or the defence case â¦â


	
	In relation to these provisions, the notice stated that disclosure had previously been provided by way of a letter dated 24 October 2013. A schedule enclosed with the letter of 24 October 2013 identified the ATO as a âthird partyâ holder of documents. In this part of the schedule there were three columns, namely âSourceâ, âDescription of Itemsâ and âCommentâ. Each of the descriptions were very general. Thus, for example, with the material obtained from the source âNeuMedix Head Officeâ the description was â[c]opies of documents and electronic files obtained in Operation Beaufighter 263 Access on NeuMedix Head Office (Eight Mile Plains QLD) in March 2012. Material relates to all aspects of NeuMedix Australian and Overseas operationsâ.
	
	
	The jury was empanelled on 21 August, 2014. On 20 August 2014 the legal representatives of Mr Dickson caused a subpoena to be issued out of this Court to the ATO. A motion was filed on behalf of the ATO seeking to set the subpoena aside on the ground that it was, amongst other matters, too wide. Within days, Mr Dickson withdrew the subpoena. Paragraph 1 of the subpoena had sought printed copies of an ATO database concerning NHA for the period 15 November 2005 to 30 June 2014. Another part of the subpoena had sought production of a so called âauditâ database concerning NHA for the same period.
	
	
	The following matters should be noted about the ATO database(s).
	
	
	First, sÂ 142(1)(j) of the CPA required the provision by the Crown to the defence of a âlist identifying any â¦ document or other thing of which the prosecutor is awareâ, etc. The description given in the schedule to the letter of 24 October 2013 was certainly not a âlistâ. It is not known whether, at the time of that letter, the Crown was aware of what was on the database. However, as I will explain, the evidence demonstrates that at some point the Crown has had the capacity to access the database. There is, in fact, no reason to doubt that the ATO would not have provided to the Crown, if requested, a list of the documents that were contained on its database. In the context of what has emerged since the trial commenced, this is of some significance.
	
	
	In the case of Mr Issakidis, the only indication he had of the scope of the material separately held by the ATO was what was copied from his own home.
	
	
	The end result was that he was not provided with any indication of the scope, or content, of the materials copied from other sources by the ATO, nor proffered any means of ascertaining it, much less accessing it. Thus, MrÂ Issakidis' solicitor deposed in his affidavit that his reading of the letter of 24Â October 2013 did not alert him to the fact that the ATO was in possession of âexculpatory documentsâ, such as MFI 47 and 48 discussed below.
	
	
	Second, on no view of what occurred was Mr Issakidis apprised that the Crown had the ability to search the ATO database and obtain document from it and that the ATO might spontaneously provide such documents to the Crown.
	
	
	Third, the difficulty that has emerged in this case is exemplified by the fate of the subpoena issued on behalf of Mr Dickson. On its face the subpoena appeared too wide and was probably liable to be set aside. Amongst other problems, its width meant that the test for the validity of the subpoena discussed in R v Saleam [1999] NSWCCA 86 was unlikely to be satisfied. However, at least so far as the material copied by the ATO pursuant to the sÂ 263 notices is concerned, as events have transpired the Crown has had the ability to access the material and the defence has not. In other words, if the ATO had simply provided to the Court what the subpoena requested and the defence had obtained access then, at least to some extent, the accused would have been in a similar position to what the Crown appears to have been in for some considerable time.
	


Mr Shields' affidavit


	
	As noted, the solicitor for Mr Issakidis has sworn an affidavit in support of his client's application. His solicitor, Peter Joseph Shields, recounts in detail the history of the provision of the material by the Crown to the defence. There is no doubt that there has been a continuous âstream of materialâ supplied by the Crown from the time of the letter of 24 October 2013. However, some aspects of that history can be dealt with briefly as they have not created any existing prejudice to a fair trial that can then be accumulated with the concerns that have been raised recently. Thus, for example, in the period up to or just after the trial commenced, the Crown was still providing revised charts and summaries to the defence when, strictly, they were required to be supplied in April 2014 pursuant to the order requiring compliance by the Crown with sÂ 142 by that time (see sÂ 142(1)(g) of the CPA). However, I have not been able to discern any prejudice to MrÂ Issakidis as a result of this. To the contrary, such charts have assisted in making the trial far more manageable.
	
	
	Also Mr Shields points to a number of notes of recent conferences conducted by the Crown Prosecutor with Crown witnesses that he was supplied with as the trial proceeded. On its face, there is nothing objectionable about this. To the contrary, it can be expected that the Crown Prosecutor will conduct such conferences and, if apprised of something new, will immediately disclose it. In some cases, not this one, such disclosure can cause a trial to be aborted. However, this will not be through any fault of the Crown. In any event, in this case the disclosures were addressed by such measures as the granting of short adjournments or conducting Basha inquiries.
	
	
	However, this does not exhaust the matters addressed by Mr Shields in his affidavit. He addresses the circumstances of the disclosure of MFIÂ 33, 47 and 48 which are outlined below. Further, Mr Shields explained that he has obtained instructions from Mr Issakidis on every document in the Crown tender bundle, every witness statement, every witness summary and all relevant documents which have been disclosed in the correspondence of the Crown. The significance of this is that it reveals that very careful consideration has been given within the legal team representing Mr Issakidis to the approach that they would take to the Crown case, both in light of the material sought to be relied on by the Crown, and the material that was disclosed to them pursuant to the Crown's disclosure obligations.
	


MFI 33


	
	On about 2 October 2014, the instructing solicitor for the Crown sent an email to each of the solicitors acting for the accused stating:
	


âDear Colleagues,

It has been brought to my attention that the handwritten note on page 3912 of the Critical Documents, refers to a separate teleconference that occurred on 6 July 2010 between the NZIRD, Anthony Dickson and Adrian Compton and that the ATO possesses a summary of this teleconference conference in the same form as the summary at pp.3912-3920.

I have requested the ATO to provide me with this document today in order that I can disclose it forthwith.""


	
	Two matters should be noted about this email. First, the author clearly recognised her obligation to disclose any relevant material that she personally received. Second, implicit in the email was that the Crown had the capacity to request the ATO to provide any documents without the necessity to obtain a court order or other form of authorisation.
	
	
	In his oral evidence, Mr Harvey explained that the document that was requested had been received by the ATO from the New Zealand tax authorities some months previously, but the ATO could not release it without the New Zealand authority's approval. Mr Harvey said that there had been a number of discussions about its release. He said that on the morning of 2 October 2014 he again requested permission from the New Zealand authorities to release it and that permission was granted. The document was then provided to the Crown and the defence. It was marked MFI 33.
	
	
	It should also be noted that, although this document appeared to have a restriction on its disclosure outside of the tax office, there was no such restriction on the disclosure on the material that had been copied by the ATO pursuant to the sÂ 263 notices, at least so far as disclosure to the Crown was concerned.
	
	
	MFI 33 is a typed record of a meeting between tax officers from New Zealand, MrÂ Anthony Dickson and the Crown witness, Adrian Compton. It appears to relate to a series of depreciation claims made in tax returns submitted to the New Zealand authorities by a company of which Anthony Mr Dickson was a director and of which MrÂ Issakidis was not.
	
	
	The scheme appears to have many similar attributes to the scheme that is alleged by the Crown to have been implemented in this case. The depreciation claims appear to have been supported by valuations allegedly made by DrÂ Peggy Wong from KBG. During the interview MrÂ Anthony Dickson, in the presence of MrÂ Compton, made various assertions about the role of his brother, Mr John Dickson, and Dr Wong from Karkalla. At one point MrÂ Compton is recorded as making a comment supporting MrÂ Anthony Dickson's protestations about the genuineness of the amount said to have been incurred by the relevant New Zealand company in acquiring intellectual property the subject of the depreciation claims in the tax returns that were lodged.
	
	
	The potential forensic significance of this document to Mr Issakidis' case was immediately recognised by Mr Byrne QC. Thus, in the absence of the jury on 3Â October 2014, he stated:
	


""The new material reveals to us what we have hinted at from the start of this, that there is evidence capable of showing a conspiracy, firstly, it is not a conspiracy involving Mr Issakidis, rather it is a conspiracy involving other persons, some of whom have been called as witnesses. One will be called as a witness and others who perhaps should, if the matter is to proceed, be called as witnesses.""


	
	At this time the possibility of the discharge, so far as Mr Issakidis was concerned, was raised. Mr Byrne QC told the court that that was something, âwe wouldn't do lightlyâ. Ultimately, a discharge was not pursued.
	
	
	The following week, Mr Byrne QC cross-examined Mr Compton concerning MFI 33 on a Basha inquiry. He later cross-examined Mr Compton in front of the jury, but did not refer to MFI 33. Instead, the cross-examination was directed to negating any suggestion of any involvement by Mr Issakidis in the accounting and taxation affairs of NHA and establishing the legitimacy of certain loan transactions in favour of Mr Issakidis that the Crown alleges are bogus.
	
	
	For present purposes, the critical point to note is that the suggestion that was made on this application that Mr Issakidis could have, if armed with material at a proper time, realistically pursued an approach pointing to a âconspiracy involving othersâ, including Crown witnesses, is not some recent contrivance, but something his legal team were alive to from an early point. Although there are obvious risks in pursuing such an approach, it does have the potential advantage that it can be the basis of a more substantial attack on Crown witnesses who may incriminate Mr Issakidis, and it also addresses the potential line of thought that involves one considering the unlikelihood of MrÂ Anthony Dickson pursuing the scheme alleged by the Crown without the knowing assistance of others.
	


Further documents


	
	On 24 October, 2014, Mr Anthony Dickson commenced giving evidence. MrÂ Harvey was present during at least part of his evidence. Mr Dickson stated that, throughout his time as a director of NHA, he was acting in his capacity as an employee of a firm known as Rand Stone Consulting, which was providing consultancy services to a âprivate equity partnershipâ registered in the Cayman Islands, âHFACâ.
	
	
	Mr Anthony Dickson said that Athena entered into the relevant assignment agreements with NHA as agent for HFAC. He said that he negotiated the assignment agreements with a John Taylor from HFAC and he took directions from him as to the distribution of the funds said to have been paid by NHA under the assignment agreements. Mr Dickson said these arrangements were recorded in a Deed dated 1 March 2006 to which, inter alia, he, HFAC, NHA and Mr Issakidis were parties. Mr Dickson said his signature was applied to the final draft of the Deed around June or July 2006 and his was the last to be applied.
	
	
	On learning of Mr Dickson's evidence about taking instructions from a John Taylor, Mr Harvey undertook some key word searches on the ATO's database using that name. One document yielded by that search was a draft Non-Compete Agreement between an entity called Karkalla Timber Fund and the company Craxgold, being Mr Issakidis' private company. In this draft Agreement John Taylor was listed as the contact name for Karkalla Timber Fund.
	
	
	This document had been obtained by the ATO from the AFP and was referred to in R v Dickson (No 11) at [31] as the âmore advanced versionâ. It is not clear whether that document was previously disclosed by the Crown to the defence.
	
	
	Mr Harvey's searches also revealed an early version of this agreement with handwritten annotations which has been marked MFI 48, also referred to in Dickson (No 11) at [31]. This document was obtained by the ATO pursuant to a sÂ 263 notice executed on NHA's offices. It follows that it was a document that was not previously disclosed by the Crown to the defence. It has only emerged because an ATO officer perceived it to have significance to the case and provided it to the Crown.
	
	
	This version includes various annotations in what appears to be Mr Anthony Dickson's handwriting indicating that John Taylor should be listed as a contact for Karkalla Timber Fund. On its front there is the annotation âMM, please amend as shown â fresh copy/not mark-up. Due Today 7.4.10â. The evidence elicited in the trial is such that the reference to âMMâ is capable of referring to Michael Harper. As noted, Michael Harper was called by the Crown and he said that he commenced working for NHA in July 2009.
	
	
	The significance of these documents to the Crown case is they suggest that in April 2010 Mr Dickson gave instructions to include John Taylor as a representative of Karkalla Timber Fund on an agreement that was to be backdated. On the evidence elicited to date Mr Taylor had no connection to Karkalla Timber Fund. Thus these documents are capable of suggesting that MrÂ Anthony Dickson simply placed Mr Taylor's name on documents when it suited him.
	
	
	Mr Harvey's search of the ATO database also yielded an earlier draft of the Deed dated 1 March 2006 which Mr Dickson says was executed no later than June or July 2006. This document was initially marked as part of MFI 47, but to avoid confusion will be referred to as MFI 47B. This Deed was also obtained by the ATO when executing a s 263 notice on NHA's offices. That is, it was not seized by the AFP and therefore was not provided to the defence pursuant to any previous disclosure regime. This version of the Deed contained the following annotation:
	


âMM, Please keep mark-ups shown on this document + add to the mark-ups with what is shown in green on this document. Thx. AD.â


	
	As stated, the evidence is capable of demonstrating that âMMâ is Michael Harper. He said he did not commence work with NHA until July 2009. Other handwritten annotations on the document make provisions for the inclusion of HFAC as a party. Thus this document is capable of supporting a conclusion that sometime after July 2009 Mr Anthony Dickson instructed MrÂ Michael Harper to amend the Deed to include references to HFAC and then backdate its execution. It was no doubt for this reason that this document was described by the Crown Prosecutor as cutting âright across this caseâ. Nevertheless the Crown accepted that the timing of the document's production meant that it could not be used against MrÂ Dickson. However, this only begs the question, to which I will return, as to how any prejudice occasioned to Michael Issakidis by its late production could be addressed.
	
	
	Further, in his evidence Mr Anthony Dickson addressed that part of the Crown case that alleged that the KBG valuations supplied to the ATO in support of NHAâs depreciation claims was bogus. Mr Anthony Dickson stated that their alleged author, Dr Peggy Wong, was a real person. He tendered a number of documents which he stated emanated from her. They included her telephone number. This telephone number was also listed in certain documents said to have been published by KBG, including some documents that had been tendered well prior to the close of the Crown case.
	
	
	Mr Harvey undertook a search on the ATO's database using that telephone number. His search yielded an email chain from April 2007 between MrÂ Dickson's brother, that is Mr John Dickson, and their sister, who said she was relaying messages from Mr Anthony Dickson (MFI 47A). The emails referred to Mr John Dickson as having provided Mr Anthony Dickson with a mobile phone. The number of the phone is stated in one of the emails and corresponds with the number listed for Dr Peggy Wong on the documents to which I have referred. It is also the contact number for various other entities that do not appear to be associated with her.
	
	
	In one of the emails Anthony Dickson's sister requested that Mr John Dickson do âAnth a big favourâ and have his wife leave a message on the phone âin her best English accentâ to the effect âthe offices are currently unattendedâ. MrÂ John Dickson replied suggesting that he could have his personal assistant âdo a message in a Chinese accent in both English and Cantonese? Far more convincing then â¦ whaddya think?â This email chain is clearly capable of supporting a conclusion that, via their sister, Mr Anthony Dickson and MrÂ John Dickson planned to use the phone in a manner that falsely suggested that it would be associated with a business. The suggestion by Mr John Dickson that his personal assistant leave two messages may have particular significance. It is at least capable of supporting the suggestion that the phone number is that of DrÂ Peggy Wong. Mr Anthony Dickson has stated that she is a woman in her 60s of Chinese extraction. Hence the reference to leaving a message in Cantonese. Mr Anthony Dickson's evidence also suggests that she is capable of speaking English.
	
	
	As I have said, Mr John Dickson was called in the Crown case. He denied having any knowledge of Dr Peggy Wong whatsoever. Mr Harvey stated that this email chain was obtained by the ATO from the AFP. Despite the fact that the AFP had the email chain, it was not provided to the defence in accordance with the disclosure requirements in s 142 of the CPA.
	


Effect on the trial of Michael Issakidis


	
	It is clear that the documents recently provided to the Crown by Mr Harvey have the potential to be highly damaging to Mr Anthony Dickson's case. As noted, the Crown accepted that the timing of the production and disclosure to the defence of at least the draft Deed dated 1 March 2006 was such that it could not be used by the Crown in its case against him. Leaving aside the question of use by the Crown in the case against him, no other prejudice was asserted on MrÂ Anthony Dickson's behalf and, as I said, he does not seek a discharge.
	
	
	However, what about the position of Mr Issakidis? In his affidavits Mr Shields referred to the effect of late disclosure of material on his client's opportunity to make an application for a separate trial, and then referred to the use that might be made of this material in any separate trial that followed. However, in his oral submissions Mr Byrne QC addressed the effect of the late disclosure of this material on this trial.
	
	
	The first matter to note concerns the attack that was previously conducted on behalf of Mr Issakidis on the credibility of Mr John Dickson. As I noted in Dickson (No 9), Mr John Dickson gave evidence of a particular conversation said to involve Mr Issakidis which, if accepted, appears to be particularly incriminating, especially on Count 6. The conversation is, as I understand it, strongly disputed and Mr John Dickson's credit was attacked. Nevertheless, the email chain I have noted above appears to be capable of having a very damaging effect on MrÂ John Dickson's credit. The Crown case is now closed and MrÂ John Dickson has returned to Hong Kong. Subject to the matters addressed below, the opportunity to attack him by using the emails that are MFIÂ 47A appears to have been lost.
	
	
	However, that is only part of the problem occasioned by the late production of this material. This and the other documents are all material of a kind adverted to by Mr Byrne QC on 3 October 2014 in the extract set out above, that is, it is material capable of showing a conspiracy ânot â¦ involving Mr Issakidisâ, but ârather â¦ a conspiracy involving other persons, some who have been called as witnessesâ. If this material had been made available in a timely fashion it would have been open to Mr Issakidis to not only point to the relative absence of material incriminating him in respect of Count 1, but also point to evidence demonstrating the involvement of others.
	
	
	One point made by the Crown was that this approach was always open on the basis of other material which has been tendered in the Crown case. This has some force, but it is no real answer. An assessment of whether to take the course I have outlined depends upon the strength of the available evidence, and this particularly strong evidence was not made available. As I have said, it is clear from the extract noted above that the possibility of taking this course had been under serious consideration.
	
	
	Further, the Crown characterised this as only a lost opportunity for MrÂ Issakidis. That may be so, but it does not mean that the trial has not become unfair. In particular it was an opportunity that was lost because MrÂ Issakidis did not have the same level of access to evidentiary material that the Crown possessed. I have already found that the email chain involving John Dickson, that is MFIÂ 47A, was material that should have been, but was not, disclosed.
	
	
	In relation to the material obtained under the sÂ 263 notices, that is MFIÂ 47B and 48, the parties sought to debate the large question as to whether the ATO could be regarded as part of the prosecution for the Crown for the purpose of assessing the scope of the prosecutorial disclosure obligation. However, in my view the matter must be addressed by considering what the evidence reveals is the precise arrangements for access to documents, then considering the terms of sÂ 142 of the CPA and otherwise considering what fairness required.
	
	
	The underlying premise of the disclosure notice served in October 2013 was that the ATO was a âthird partyâ, and that the documents held by it were not âin the possession of a prosecutorâ for the purposes of sÂ 142(1)(i). That premise may have been correct at the time. However, what the above demonstrates is that at some point the Crown acquired a capacity to request any documents from the ATO database, and no doubt had the capacity to request that searches be undertaken of the database without any court order or apparently other form of authorisation. It is also clear the ATO was willing to provide documents and sometimes would do so spontaneously.
	
	
	The outcome of this was that at some point or other the Crown was certainly able to request and provide a âlistâ identifying any documents held by the ATO for purposes of sÂ 142(1)(j)(i). Further, it may be that the effect of these arrangements was that the Crown was in fact in possession of those documents on the ATO database for the purposes of sÂ 142(1)(i), although it is not ultimately necessary to determine that question.
	
	
	Leaving aside the precise words of sÂ 142, what in fact developed was an outcome whereby the ATO held a pool of primary evidence to which the Crown had apparent unfettered access and the defence had none, but in respect of which no disclosure of its contents was made until a document was physically handed to the Crown Prosecutor or their instructing solicitor from that pool.
	
	
	The potential for unfairness to flow from such an arrangement is obvious. At the very least Mr Issakidis was entitled to a similar access to the primary material held by the ATO pursuant to the s 263 notices as that enjoyed by the prosecution.
	
	
	The potential unfairness proposed by this structure has materialised in the way MFIÂ 47B and MFI 48 have emerged during Mr Anthony Dickson's evidence. In the case of Mr Anthony Dickson, that unfairness is addressed by the Crown's disavowment of reliance on at least some of those documents, a matter that will be clarified. However, that does not address the prejudice to MrÂ Issakidis. As already explained, the material is potentially exonerative and could have been taken up with Crown witnesses. Theoretically it might be possible to recall them all now, including by having MrÂ John Dickson return from Hong Kong. However, even if that were to occur, it does not address the problem caused by the existence of the ATO's database which is simply too large to review in the time available, although perhaps some searches could be undertaken if search access was granted but even then the time frame is far too limited. On any view a reasonable level of access to the ATO database would have to be forwarded to Mr Byrne QC in the time prior to him having to cross-examine Mr Anthony Dickson, a matter to which I will return.
	
	
	It follows that I am satisfied that the trial of Mr Issakidis has become unfair. As events have unfolded he has not received disclosure of, or even the means of access to, a pool of potentially exculpatory material to which the Crown has had unfettered access. It is known that that pool in fact does contain material which is exculpatory, namely MFI 47B and MFI 48. Otherwise he has also not received disclosure of MFI 47A even though he was entitled to it.
	
	
	It follows I will order Mr Issakidisâ trial be postponed and the jury be discharged in respect of him.
	
	
	I note that the Crown Prosecutor submitted that before I did so I should consider the wider interests of justice and, in particular, have regard to the point of the trial that has been reached and the resources involved in any retrial. No doubt such considerations are relevant as to whether to grant a separate trial, but I am not persuaded that they are to be weighed up once I have reached a positive conclusion that the trial of Mr Issakidis is relevantly affected by unfairness that cannot be remedied. However, even if such matters were to be considered they would not affect my determination to order a discharge. In that regard I note three points.
	
	
	First, if the trial continues then it will be open to Mr Byrne QC to cross-examine Mr Anthony Dickson on MFI 47A, 47B and 48. As I have said those documents are potentially exonerative and there is simply no basis upon which Mr Issakidis can be prevented from putting them forward and cross-examining his clientâs co-accused. Yet the documents are also potentially highly incriminatory of MrÂ Anthony Dickson and, because of their late production, as a matter of fairness he should not be confronted with them in his own case well after the Crown case has closed.
	
	
	It follows that, if such a cross-examination was to occur, then it is highly likely that the trial of Anthony Dickson would need to be aborted. In that event he would have been confronted with highly damaging evidence that was not disclosed earlier. So much is implicit in the Crown's acceptance that it cannot rely on MFIÂ 47B. If Mr Anthony Dickson's trial was to be aborted then MrÂ Issakidis' trial would also have to be aborted. In that event the status of MrÂ Anthony Dickson's evidence would be uncertain, as would the status of evidence of some acts of Mr Anthony Dickson that appear to be unrelated to the alleged conspiracies the subject of Counts 1 and 6. Thus not aborting the trial of Mr Issakidis would carry with it an appreciable risk of aborting both trials shortly thereafter.
	
	
	Second, if the trial proceeds with both accused then there appears to be a reasonable likelihood it will continue well into the Christmas period. I note this would be contrary to a number of statements given to the jury about the trial's estimated length. No doubt those statements have been the basis on which they have made plans.
	
	
	Third, although it is unclear, there is some reason to believe that any separate trial of Mr Issakidis may occupy significantly less time than this one. In such a trial there is some basis for expecting that the real focus would be on whether the Crown can demonstrate Mr Issakidis' involvement in an agreement to lodge false returns, and may not involve the need to prove a number of matters against MrÂ Anthony Dickson that the Crown has sought to do in this trial.
	
	
	Accordingly I will order the discharge of the jury so far as Mr Issakidis is concerned.
	


Separate trial


	
	Mr Issakidis' application for a separate trial was based on the following passage from Darby at 677 to 678:
	


âNevertheless, there remains an incongruity in the direction of a trial judge which on the one hand instructs the jury that they must consider separately the guilt of each accused, taking into account only the evidence admissible against each and on the other tells them that they must either convict them both or acquit them both. But it may be worse than that. Such a direction might well result in injustice to one accused. In a case where the evidence against A is overwhelming, a jury which is directed that they must either convict or acquit both may find it practically impossible to sustain and act on a reasonable doubt on the evidence admissible against B.

In the light of these considerations, in our opinion there is much to be said for the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Guimond v R (1979) 44 CCC (2d) 481, requiring separate trials in cases where the evidence admissible against one accused is significantly different from the evidence admissible against the other. We would encourage the adoption of such a practice.â


	
	The balance of Mr Byrne QC's written submissions in support of this aspect of his application emphasises the significant differences âin the evidence relevant to the two accusedâ. In my view the submissions elide the difference between a case where there is different evidence admissible against co-conspirators and a case where there is a difference in the weight of the evidence pointing to each co-conspirator's involvement in the alleged conspiracy. This case is an example of the latter, whereas Darby appears to be addressing the former. In R v Ronen [2004] NSWSC 1289 and R v Baladjam (NoÂ 57) [2008] NSWSC 1471 Whealy J addressed an application for a separate trial in conspiracy cases by reference to considering the difference in the evidence admissible against each accused concerning the existence of a conspiracy, and the participation by each accused in the conspiracy. His Honour did not address it by reference to the weight of the evidence pointing to the involvement of each accused in the conspiracy.
	
	
	To this point, prima facie, most of the evidence admitted in the trial is admissible against both accused. As I have indicated there are some areas of the Crown's evidence that appears to involve conduct of Mr Dickson that appears not to be related to the alleged conspiracies the subject of Count 1 and Count 6. Further, there is some uncertainty as to whether various acts and utterances of MrÂ Anthony Dickson that expressly or impliedly implicate MrÂ Issakidis in the alleged conspiracy the subject of count one and count six will ultimately be able to be used for that purpose (see Dickson (No 11) at [11] to [14]). Although I have found that there is reasonable evidence of Mr Issakidis' involvement in the conspiracy, it is still incumbent upon the Crown to identify with precision what those acts and utterances were, then for the Court to determine whether the other parts of the test in Ahern v R [1988]] HCA 39; 165 CLR 87 have been satisfied and, if so, whether any discretion to restrict the use of that material in this way should be exercised.
	
	
	However, in the absence of the identification of any particular body of evidence that is admissible only against Mr Dickson and not against Mr Issakidis, it follows that the basis for a separate trial identified in Darby has not been established. This application will be refused.
	
	
	However I do note two further matters. First, if the events transpire that the question of a joint or separate trial needs to be determined, then the starting point will be that the Crown must identify with precision how each item of evidence concerning Mr Anthony Dickson's conduct and utterances undertaken in the absence of Mr Issakidis is admissible against MrÂ Issakidis. Until that is done, in my view the question of whether the trial should be joint or separate simply cannot be properly determined.
	
	
	Second, one part of Mr Shields' affidavit appears to suggest that the basis for a separate trial would be the mere fact that one alleged co-conspirator seeks to blame the other. It should be made clear that, of itself, that is not a sufficient basis, although the employment of evidence designed to establish that may cause such unfairness that a separate trial is the practical result. IÂ have in fact already outlined how that could occur in this case.
	
	
	In any event IÂ refuse the application for separate trial.
	


Dickson (No 11)


	
	In Dickson (No 11) I allowed the Crown to, inter alia, cross-examine Mr Anthony Dickson concerning the two versions of the draft non-compete agreements to which I have referred and also tender them in reply if necessary. Amongst other matters I concluded that the necessity for the Crown to so deploy that material had âsolely emerged from Mr Dickson's evidenceâ in question. At the time of the ruling I did not address any matter arising from the provenance of those documents. I think I may have mistakenly assumed that they had all been disclosed to the defence in accordance with the orders requiring compliance with s 142.
	
	
	As it transpires, MFI 48 has never been disclosed to the AFP and therefore could never have been disclosed to either of the accused in accordance with the Crownâs disclosure obligations. As I have indicated, I am uncertain at this point about the status of the other non-compete agreement. At least so far as MFI 48 is concerned it would follow from my earlier findings that it cannot be used to cross-examine Mr Dickson and cannot be tendered in reply, and that that aspect of Dickson (No 11) will have to be revisited. The position of the other non-compete agreement will also need to be clarified.
	


Conclusion


	
	Accordingly I will shortly order that the jury be brought in and I will discharge them in respect of Mr Issakidis.

2765272,Batcheldor v R & Walsh v R [2014] NSWCCA 252,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Hidden J and with his Honourâs reasons.
	
	
	I also agree with the additional remarks of R A Hulme J.
	
	
	HIDDEN J: The appellants, Lauren Batcheldor and Richard Walsh, were tried on an indictment charging them jointly with two counts:
	



	
	the specially aggravated kidnapping of Matthew Digby (s 86(3) of the Crimes Act 1900);
	
	
	the murder of Mr Digby.
	


It was the Crown case that the offences occurred at Wollongong and Dapto on 23 January 2010. The first count alleged that the appellants, while in the company of each other, detained Mr Digby without his consent with intent to obtain an advantage, and at the time of the detention actual bodily harm was occasioned to him. It was the combination of the offence being committed in company and the infliction of actual bodily harm which constituted the circumstances of special aggravation.


	
	It was Walsh who was alleged to have killed Mr Digby, but Batcheldor was said to have been complicit in the murder. Both were found guilty of each count and were sentenced to substantial terms of imprisonment. Batcheldor has appealed against her conviction and sought leave to appeal against sentence. Walsh has appealed against conviction only.
	


The Crown case


	
	In the morning of 25 January 2010, the deceasedâs body was found in a burnt out car, a Mazda wagon, in bush near Robertson. His body was on the reclined front passenger seat, secured by two lengths of steel chain. One was across his torso and extended down past either side of the seat. The other was wound around his neck and the headrest, extending down the side of the torso and wrapped around his rear thighs. A subsequent post-mortem examination could not identify the cause of death because of the extent of damage to the body caused by the fire.
	
	
	The appellants and the deceased were known to one another. The background to the offences was a break-in at Batcheldorâs home at Albion Park Rail in the night of 14 January 2010. Among the property stolen was a gold necklace of hers and a coin collection belonging to Walsh. Batcheldor reported the matter to the police, but she also made her own enquiries about it, assisted by Walsh and others.
	
	
	On 18 January her enquiries led her to a pawn shop in Wollongong, which she attended with a friend, Evren Agdiran. They found that Mr Digby had pawned her gold chain there. She suspected that he was involved in breaking into her home or, at least, that he had information about it. She told Mr Agdiran that she intended to go to the unit at Wollongong where Mr Digby lived and get her âshitâ back. She added that she was going to âsmash his place upâ with a baseball bat. In a recorded interview with police on 27 January, four days after the deceasedâs body was discovered, she said that she âwanted to go to his house straight away and punch him in the head.â
	
	
	That evening she drove in her car, a Commodore, to the deceasedâs unit, accompanied by Walsh and another friend, Cihan Karaoglu. Also accompanying them was a woman who was to be an important Crown witness. She had been charged with involvement in the murder but was later indemnified by the Attorney General. The trial judge made an order prohibiting the publication of her name, which remains in place, and she was referred to as âwitness A.â The Mazda wagon in which the deceasedâs body was found was hers.
	
	
	When they arrived, Batcheldor, Walsh and Karaoglu went into the unit and witness A remained in the car. The deceased was not in the unit but a man named Michael Small was. He gave evidence that Batcheldor had him contact the deceased by phone and she spoke to him, apparently asking him to return to the unit. Walsh and Karaoglu behaved in an intimidating manner towards Small, but did not hurt him. They searched the flat but did not locate any of the property they were looking for.
	
	
	The deceased returned to the flat, where he was questioned about the property. Walsh did most of the talking and, according to Small, he and Karaoglu were aggressive towards the deceased but Batcheldor was not. The deceased denied any involvement in the break-in and said that he had been given the chain. He agreed to pick it up from the pawn shop the next day and return it to Batcheldor. He also gave Walsh and Karaoglu some prescription tablets, they calmed down and the three of them left.
	
	
	The deceased had been driven back to his flat by a friend, Tini Eli, who remained in his car while the deceased went inside. Eli said that he heard âa lot of swearing and stuffâ emanating from the flat which, he said, âwas pretty loud.â Later he saw the deceased, Batcheldor, Walsh and Karaoglu come out. As the deceased returned to the car, one of the men said, âBetter get that fucking chain back, better get that fucking stuff back.â
	
	
	In the recorded police interview, Batcheldor made no reference to this incident. Rather, she said that the day after she visited the pawn shop she phoned the deceased and went to see him at his unit. He disclaimed any knowledge of the break-in but said that he had received the chain from a prostitute, who had herself got it from another man. He said that he did not know where the rest of her property was but would be able to find out. He agreed to recover the chain. The next day he rang to say that he could not find out anything about the man from whom the prostitute claimed to have received the chain. The following morning, they went together to the pawn shop, she gave him the money to reclaim it, and he returned it to her.
	


Beaton Park


	
	It was the Crown case that the appellants and the deceased met at Beaton Park, Wollongong at about 12.30am on 23 January. There, it was alleged, he was detained in the Mazda wagon in which his body was later found and driven to the home of witness A at Dapto, where the detention continued. This was the conduct the subject of the first count, the intended advantage being to obtain information about the stolen property.
	
	
	Phone records in evidence disclosed that between 20 and 23 January there had been regular phone contact between the three of them and, in particular, Batcheldor had phoned the deceased and sent him a text message very shortly after midnight on the 23rd. It was the Crown case that this series of calls related, at least in part, to the stolen property and that in the course of them Batcheldor arranged the meeting at the park.
	
	
	In the police interview Batcheldor said that the deceased had asked her if she was interested in buying from him an Xbox and some internet cards, and that they had arranged to meet at the park for that purpose. They arrived there independently, the deceased driving his own car. When they met, she said, he showed her the Xbox but she did not buy it as she did not have the money for it. She also asked him whether he had found out anything about her stolen property. He said that he had not but he was still trying. They then parted, and she did not see where he went. She did not suggest that Walsh was present on this occasion but, as will be seen, she did place him there in her evidence at the trial.
	
	
	There was in evidence a very different account of the encounter at the park, but it was admissible only against Walsh. This was the evidence of another witness whose name is suppressed, and was referred to as âwitness B.â He was a prisoner with whom Walsh shared a cell at the MRRC while he was in pre-trial custody. According to witness B, Walsh admitted to him that he had detained the deceased and killed him. Part of what Walsh is alleged to have told witness B could only be an account of what happened at the park. He said that he was in a car with the deceased and had taken him to a grassy area to question him about the break-in. The deceased got out of the car and tried to run away, but Walsh chased him, dragged him back to the car and âchained him up inside the car with dog chains.â He then drove the car to the home of witness A.
	


Witness Aâs home


	
	I turn, then, to the evidence of witness A about the events in the early hours of 23 January. This, of course, was admissible against both appellants. It was the Crown case that, after the deceased had been detained in the Mazda wagon, the appellants returned to witness Aâs home at Dapto, Batcheldor travelling in her own car. According to witness A, Batcheldor had rung her to say that they were on their way over. It should be noted that such a call does not appear in the phone records. Batcheldor knocked on the front door and was admitted by witness A. Batcheldor asked her to open the electronically controlled door of the downstairs garage, so that Walsh could drive the Mazda into it. Witness A went down the internal stairs to the garage and turned the power on for that purpose, but she did not see Walsh drive in. She returned upstairs. Batcheldor was still there and she remained there for about an hour.
	
	
	Before Batcheldor left, according to witness A, Walsh came upstairs from the garage and said that he had the deceased in the car. He had a set of keys and a mobile phone which, as I understand the Crown case, were alleged to be those of the deceased. He said that he was going to go back down to the garage and speak to the deceased to find out what he knew about the stolen property. He went back to the garage and returned a short time later. He said that the deceased had told him everything that he needed to know. He asked witness A to pour two glasses of drink, saying that he was going to go back to the garage and give the deceased a drink because âheâd done the right thing and told him where everything was.â He also said that he was going to let the deceased out of the car to âhave a drink and stretch his legs.â Witness A poured the drinks and Walsh returned to the garage.
	
	
	It was around this time that Batcheldor left. After she left, witness A heard the sound of âbangingâ from the garage, of a car door opening and shutting, and more sounds âjust like thudding bangs.â Walsh ran up the internal staircase and pushed past witness A, saying, âThe prick nearly got me.â He said that he had blood all over him, and he ran into the bedroom and showered. He did not say in terms that he had killed the deceased, but witness A thought it obvious that he had. She affirmed in cross-examination that neither she nor Batcheldor had gone anywhere near the garage during the period that Batcheldor was at the home, and that Batcheldor had left after Walsh had come up from the garage to obtain the drinks for the deceased and himself and before she had heard any noises from the garage.
	
	
	At this point it is convenient to return to the evidence of witness B, admissible against Walsh only. According to that witness, Walsh told him that he returned from the park to witness Aâs home with the deceased restrained in the car. Having arrived, he got himself a drink and returned to the garage. He âslappedâ the deceased, who refused to tell him anything and threatened that he would kill Walsh and his family if he were not released. Walsh responded, âWell, now youâve said that, I canât let you go.â
	
	
	He went upstairs to get the deceased a âlast drink.â When he returned, the deceased had freed one of his hands. Walsh kicked him in the face and, having knocked him out, he put a length of dog chain around his neck, put his feet on the back of the rear seat and pulled the chain back. He did so until he heard cracks in the deceasedâs neck and he stopped moving.
	


Subsequent events


	
	Returning to the evidence of witness A, she said that after Walsh had showered he put the clothes he had been wearing, including his sneakers, into a plastic bag. At some time thereafter Batcheldor returned to the home. In her presence, Walsh told witness A that the dash of her car had been smashed. She was âobviously annoyedâ that her car had been âwreckedâ because it was the only one she had. Batcheldor said, âDonât be a spoilt brat, weâll get you a new car.â
	
	
	Also in Batcheldorâs presence, Walsh told witness A that she would need to move the deceasedâs car from where it had been left, so that if anyone who knew that he had met Walsh and Batcheldor at the park would assume that he had just left in his car. He had witness A disguise herself and, in lieu of gloves, she put socks over her hands. Batcheldor then drove her to Beaton Park and pointed out the deceasedâs car. She got into that car and followed Batcheldor to a point near the Botanical Gardens. There she left the car and returned to Batcheldorâs car.
	
	
	The following evening, 24 January, witness A accompanied Batcheldor on a journey to Kiama, where Batcheldor obtained two masks from a friend of hers. She gave that friend a false explanation of why she needed them. Witness A described them as rubber masks with breathing holes in them. As I understand it, it was the Crown case that Walsh saw the need of a mask to cope with the odour emanating from the deceasedâs body during the process of disposing of it.
	
	
	The two women then repaired to witness Aâs home. There Walsh told them that he was going to get rid of the Mazda by burning it. Apparently to provide witness A with an alibi, it was agreed that Batcheldor was to drive her to Wollongong Hospital, ostensibly to get syringes from a vending machine there. At the hospital witness A was to walk to a toilet area where her image would be caught by CCTV. Walsh told witness A that he would ring her to pick him up after he had set fire to the Mazda, and it was agreed that Batcheldor would organise a car for her to do so.
	
	
	Batcheldor drove witness A to the hospital. Later witness A received a call from Walsh giving her directions about where to pick him up and, in the event, Batcheldor allowed her to use her car to do so. Her journey required her to negotiate the Macquarie Pass, from which she turned to find Walsh and the burning car.
	
	
	At this point also it is convenient to turn to the evidence of witness B. According to that witness, Walsh told him that he covered the windows of the car so that the body could not be seen. He went back to the house and, when he returned to the garage, he noticed blood, faeces and urine from the deceased inside the car. He obtained a change of clothes, put on a facemask, and drove the car into bush. There he changed his clothes, threw the clothes and shoes he had been wearing into the car, threw fuel over the car and ignited it.
	
	
	Returning again to the evidence of witness A, she said that after she picked Walsh up they returned to her home. There he showered and put the clothes he was wearing, together with two mobile phones that were in the bedroom, into a backpack. Witness A was to return Batcheldorâs car to her, and Walsh told her to take the backpack with her, saying that it had to be burnt. Witness A drove to Batcheldorâs home with the backpack in the boot. She told Batcheldor that her car had been burnt out, that the deceasedâs body was in it, and that the backpack containing Walshâs clothes needed to be burnt. Batcheldor rang her boyfriend, Mick Perman. He came over and Batcheldor asked him to dispose of the backpack. When he asked what was in it, she said, âPlease donât ask questions, Mick, just can you do it for me, thereâs one thing I need you to do, thatâs that.â He took the backpack to his own car, and witness A never saw it again.
	
	
	There was in evidence a text message sent by Batcheldor to Perman, at 11.31pm on 25 January, which included the following:
	


âIâm really sorry I got you involved but I do thank you very much for helping me. I would be fucked if you didnât and will never forget what you did for me â¦ .â


	
	Witness A also said that she had two English Staffordshire dogs, which were very strong and had to be restrained by substantial chains when they were outside her home. She had kept a set of chains in her Mazda wagon for that purpose.
	
	
	Evren Agdiran gave evidence that in late January he had a conversation with Batcheldor in which she said, âDo you know if thereâs a website where you can check where there are CCTV cameras like at Macquarie Pass or Beaton Park because thatâs where we met him, at Beaton Park?â Mr Agdiran said that he did not know if there was any camera at either location.
	
	
	In the recorded police interview Batcheldor gave a brief account of her visit to Kiama and to Wollongong Hospital on 24 January. She said that she did go, with witness A, to the general area in Kiama where she was alleged to have picked up the facemasks. She claimed, however, that that was for an entirely innocent purpose: to visit a friend of hers, Jason Alison, to confirm an arrangement for her to stay at his place for a few days. They then left and she drove witness A back to her home at Dapto.
	
	
	She went on to say that she returned to her home at Albion Park. A friend of hers, Stacey Callaghan, visited her there that night to help her prepare her insurance claim for the stolen property. She received a call from witness A asking her to drive her to Wollongong Hospital. She did so, waiting in the car while witness A went in to get some needles. Witness A then drove back to Batcheldorâs home, dropped her off, and retained the car to get herself home.
	
	
	Stacey Callaghan could not be found at the time of the trial, and parts of a statement she made to police were read to the jury. This supported Batcheldorâs account to the extent of confirming that she had gone to her home to assist with the insurance claim, and that she remained at the home to mind the children while Batcheldor went out for a period. However, she did not see witness A, who was known to her, that night.
	
	
	This is a selective summary of the evidence of major witnesses and, of course, there was other evidence in the Crown case. What I have set out, however, is sufficient for the purposes of the appeal.
	


Batcheldorâs case


	
	Batcheldor gave evidence at the trial. There is no need to refer to her evidence concerning the break-in, her enquiries about it and her dealings with the deceased at that early stage. It is sufficient to focus upon those aspects of her evidence relevant to the appeal.
	
	
	As to the meeting at Beaton Park, she maintained her account to the police that this related to the proposed purchase of the deceasedâs Xbox, but she expanded upon it significantly. She said that before the night of 23 January the deceased had rung her several times, asking her to meet him. She assumed it was because he had information about the break-in. She rang him just after midnight on the 23rd and he suggested the meeting at the park. Walsh was with her at this time.
	
	
	She drove to the park in her car, accompanied by Stacey Callaghan. Walsh did not like the idea of the two women going by themselves, so he followed them in the Mazda wagon. The deceased arrived at the park in his own car, and they had the conversation about the Xbox. Walsh arrived, the two men shook hands, and Walsh asked the deceased to go with him so that they could talk about anything he knew concerning the break-in. The deceased was happy to do so, the two men got into the Mazda, and they drove off.
	
	
	She said that she and Callaghan also left. They met up with Agdiran and the three of them drove to a hotel at Corrimal. However, by the time they got there it was too late for them to be admitted. She received a call from the deceased, who said that he and Walsh were near her home and that they intended to visit her. She set off with Callaghan, and she called the deceased when she reached home. He and Walsh arrived, and the deceased told her that he had found out that one Wayne Nelson, whom she knew, had stolen her property and buried it in his backyard.
	
	
	The two men then left, saying that they were going to witness Aâs home to have a couple of drinks. That, she said, was the last time she ever saw the deceased. Callaghan left not long thereafter, and she decided to go to witness Aâs home herself as she was âfreaking outâ about the fact that her home had been broken into and she did not want to stay there alone.
	
	
	She drove to witness Aâs home. After she arrived Walsh came upstairs. She did not see where he had come from and she did not go anywhere near the garage. Walsh told witness A to move the deceasedâs car and asked Batcheldor to give her a lift for that purpose. She did so, thinking that the deceased wanted his car moved because he and Walsh had been drinking.
	
	
	As to the journeys to Kiama and Wollongong Hospital on the following day, she maintained the account she had given police in the interview.
	
	
	As to the backpack which she asked Perman to dispose of, she confirmed that witness A arrived at her home with her car on the morning of 25 January. She was shocked when witness A told her that Walsh had burnt out her own car with the deceased in it, describing herself as âa mess.â She confirmed that witness A said that there was a bag in the boot of the car which she wanted burnt. She did not see the bag and did not know what was in it, and said that she was not âgetting rid of anything.â She rang Perman and asked him to come over because she did not know what to do. She said that when he arrived he asked witness A what was in the bag, but she did not tell him. He then took the backpack away with him.
	
	
	Generally, she said that she ânever agreed with anybody to detain anybodyâ, and ânever wanted anybody to get hurt.â
	
	
	A statement made by Stacey Callaghan to Ms Batcheldorâs solicitor was read. It confirmed that she had gone to Beaton Park with Batcheldor, and lent support to her account of events there. It also supported Batcheldorâs account that thereafter they went to Corrimal, with Agdiran, and then returned to her home.
	
	
	Jason Alison gave evidence that on 24 January Batcheldor arrived at his home at Kiama, enquiring whether an offer he had earlier made to her to stay at his home was still open.
	


Walshâs case


	
	Walsh also gave evidence. For the purposes of the appeal, it can be summarised briefly.
	
	
	In his case also there is no need to review the background of the break-in to Batcheldorâs home and their initial contact with the deceased, except to note what he had to say about his visit to the deceasedâs flat with Batcheldor and Karaoglu. He said that, while there was no shouting, he was quite assertive and spoke to Michael Small in such a way that he had âevery right to feel intimidated.â When the deceased came to the flat, he said, Batcheldor spoke to him calmly but he demanded to know if the deceased had any information about his coin collection.
	
	
	His description of the meeting at Beaton Park was consistent with that of Batcheldor. He confirmed that he also drove to the park because he did not think that Batcheldor and Callaghan should go there alone. When he arrived he heard discussion between Batcheldor and the deceased about buying âthingsâ. He again asked about his coins but the deceased said that he had found out nothing about them. He decided to offer the deceased drugs to persuade him to âdo the right thingâ, an offer which the deceased accepted. The deceased locked his own car and willingly joined Walsh in the Mazda for a journey to witness Aâs home, where the drugs were to be supplied.
	
	
	At the home Walsh drove into the garage, saying in evidence that he had opened the garage door with a remote control. He left the deceased in the car, telling him that he was going to get some clean syringes, some âgearâ and some drinks. He went upstairs, obtained two clean syringes and drugs, and had witness A pour two drinks.
	
	
	When he returned to the garage he saw the deceased crouching down near the door. He stood up, holding a screwdriver and demanded drugs. As Walsh moved towards the car, the deceased lunged at him and stabbed him on the left side of his waist with the screwdriver. They wrestled and Walsh put the deceased into what he called a âguillotine holdâ, a hold which he had not used before. They fell to the floor, the deceasedâs head striking it. Walsh released him, seeing that he did not move and appeared unconscious. He could not find a pulse.
	
	
	Walsh picked the deceased up, put him into the front passenger seat and went upstairs. According to him, he said to witness A, âThe prick nearly got me, I think I killed him.â He dressed his wound and put his clothes, which were bloody, into a garbage bag. He returned to the garage, picked up the deceasedâs phone and removed his car keys from his pocket. He could get no response from the deceased and could tell that he was dead.
	
	
	He put the deceasedâs phone and keys in the upstairs bedroom. He told witness A to call Batcheldor so that they could move the deceasedâs car. She did so and Batcheldor arrived.
	
	
	On the following day he made the plan to dispose of the deceasedâs body. Having arranged for witness A to pick him up after he had set fire to the car, he set off on the Monday. He took tins of paint and lacquer to set fire to the car. He denied using a mask, or ever asking anyone to obtain a mask for the purpose of disposing of the body. He said that he coped with the odour of the body simply by winding down the driverâs window. While driving up Macquarie Pass the body shifted in the seat. He stopped, and used the chains which were kept in the car to secure the body.
	
	
	He drove to the end of a bush track, where he set the car alight. Before doing so he threw into it the screwdriver which the deceased had used to stab him. Asked in cross-examination why he disposed of that screwdriver, which might have supported his account that he was acting in self-defence, he said that he panicked and did not know what to do.
	
	
	As to the evidence of witness B, he said that much of what that witness said was wrong. He did speak to witness B about what had happened, but he gave him the same account as he had given in evidence. Specifically, he denied telling witness B that he had choked the deceased in the car.
	


Batcheldorâs appeal


	
	In this court Ms Batcheldor was represented by Mr David Dalton SC. Neither he nor the Crown prosecutor in this court had appeared at the trial. Grounds of appeal had been filed for Batcheldor before Mr Dalton came into the matter. When he did the grounds were recast to some extent, and not all of those were pursued at the hearing. I shall not deal with them in order, but shall commence with the ground which I think is the most significant of them.
	


The directions as to constructive murder (ground 8)


	
	The charge of murder against Batcheldor was founded upon what is loosely termed felony murder but has come to be known as constructive murder. It was alleged that she was complicit in an act of Walsh causing the death of the deceased done in the course of the commission by both of them of a crime punishable by imprisonment for 25 years: s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. Specially aggravated kidnapping is such a crime. The ground, as refined in oral argument, was that the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury as to the mental element required in Batcheldorâs case, that is, that she contemplated the infliction of actual bodily harm upon the deceased as a possible incident of the kidnapping offence.
	
	
	The trial judge did not give such a direction. He provided the jury with written directions as to the elements of each count against each appellant, upon which he expanded in oral directions. The written directions on the case of murder against Batcheldor set out as elements:
	



	
	the death of the deceased at the relevant time;
	
	
	that his death was caused by a deliberate act of Walsh; and
	
	
	that that act was done by Walsh during the commission by him, or some accomplice with him, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for 25 years, namely, detaining the deceased for advantage in circumstances of special aggravation.
	



	
	In oral directions his Honour repeated those elements, noting that it was the third element which might be the focus of their deliberations. As to that element, he emphasised that the jury would have to be satisfied of Batcheldorâs involvement in what he described as the foundational crime. Accordingly, they could not find her guilty of the murder unless they also found her guilty of the first count.
	
	
	The issue of the criminal responsibility of what I might term secondary parties in a case of constructive murder was considered by this court in the well known decision of Reg v Johns [1978] 1 NSWLR 282. That was the all too familiar case of an attempted robbery with tragic results. The involvement of the appellant, Johns, was as an accessory before the fact to that crime. Two other men, Watson and Dodge, set out to rob the victim, one Morriss. Watson was carrying a loaded pistol. When the two of them confronted Morriss there was a struggle and Watson fired the pistol, fatally killing him.
	
	
	Watson was himself killed before the matter came to trial. Dodge and Johns were jointly tried for murder and for armed assault with intent to rob with wounding (s 98 of the Crimes Act). Dodge was classified as a principal in the second degree and, as I have said, Johns as an accessory before the fact. The leading judgment in this court was given by Begg J, Street CJ agreeing in a separate judgment and Lusher J dissenting. Begg J set out a lengthy extract of the summing-up of the trial judge (OâBrien J) at pp 292-5 of the report. OâBrien J had defined murder in two parts, the first being on the basis of an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm and the second being constructive murder. His Honour had instructed the jury about common purpose and directed them, as to both bases of murder, how Dodge and Johns might be criminally responsible for the killing of Morriss.
	
	
	For present purposes it is sufficient to set out what OâBrien J had to say about constructive murder (quoted at 294-5):
	


âUnder the second part of the definition, the Crown submits that there was a design to which Dodge and Johns gave their assent and encouragement by which Watson, armed with an offensive weapon, would assault Morriss with intent to rob him; that it must have been within their contemplation that Watson might, during the assault with intent to rob Morris, produce that pistol, or immediately after the assault he might produce it, [and] whether or not in pursuance of the common design and whether or not intentionally it might be discharged by him. The very fact that he was armed with an offensive weapon when he went to the robbery must, the Crown contends, have meant for them the possibility that in the course of it all somebody might get killed by the discharge of that pistol whether or not it was necessary for the purpose and done for the purpose and whether or not it was intentional or otherwise. If they were engaged in such a purpose of armed robbery, armed assault with intent to rob, and in the course of it Watson fired the pistol, whether or not accidentally and whether or not in furtherance of the common design, so long as it was a contingency which they had in mind, then the discharge of that weapon killing Morriss was murder in the first degree in Watson and to that murder Dodge was an accessory at the fact, or as it is now called a principal in the second degree, and Johns was an accessory before the fact. It is upon the Crown to prove each of these elements if it is to visit Dodge and Johns with complicity in murder by Watson under the second part of the definition.â


	
	In Johns, of course, the focus was on the complicity of an accessory before the fact, the issue being whether that complicity should be determined on the same basis as that of a principal in the second degree. Street CJ and Begg J held that it should. It was on that issue that Lusher J dissented. Relevantly for present purposes, however, Begg J (at 295) held that the directions of the trial judge âconveyed a precise and accurate indication of the issues which arose at the trial.â
	
	
	Street CJ, in his concurring judgment, examined the history of the law relating to an accessory before the fact, including the development of a subjective element in determining the ambit of the criminal responsibility of such an accessory. The Chief Justice concluded, in the following well known passage (at 290):
	


ââ¦ I am of the view that an accessory before the fact bears, as does a principal in the second degree, a criminal liability for an act which was within the contemplation of both himself and the principal in the first degree as an act which might be done in the course of carrying out the primary criminal intention - an act contemplated as a possible incident of the originally planned particular venture.â


	
	This courtâs decision was affirmed by the High Court: Johns v the Queen (1979-80) 143 CLR 108. It is not necessary to examine the judgments in that case, except to note that the passage from the judgment of Street CJ quoted above received the express approval of Stephen J (at 122) and Mason, Murphy and Wilson JJ (at 130-1).
	
	
	R v Sharah (1992) 30 NSWLR 292 was another case of a robbery in which a person was shot dead. The appellant in that matter was involved with a man named Attard in the robbery of a shop. Attard was armed with a loaded sawn-off shotgun. The victims of the robbery were members of a family and, for convenience, are referred to in the judgment by their Christian names. In the course of the robbery Attard wounded one of them, John, by striking his head with the barrel of the gun. Money was taken but there was a struggle, and as the appellant and Attard tried to flee from the scene Attard fired the weapon, killing Nick, who was Johnâs son.
	
	
	The two men were tried on two counts, the murder of Nick and the armed robbery with wounding of John (also s 98 of the Crimes Act). Here also, murder was left on the basis of intent and constructive murder. As to the latter, the Crown case was that the killing of Nick occurred during or immediately after the armed robbery with wounding of John.
	
	
	It is not necessary to examine the grounds of appeal in Sharah. It is sufficient for present purposes to refer to the manner in which Carruthers J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Smart J agreed, set out the elements of constructive murder and armed robbery with wounding in respect of the appellant. As to constructive murder his Honour said (at 297):
	


âAs to felony-murder (upon the assumption that the foundational crime was the offence under s 98) it was incumbent upon the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt:

(i) that there was a common purpose between the appellant and Attard in company to rob John whilst Attard was, to the knowledge of the appellant, armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun;

(ii) that during the course of the armed robbery Attard wounded John and during the course of such armed robbery with wounding or immediately thereafter, Attard discharged the gun causing the death of Nick;

(iii) that the discharge of the gun by Attard during or immediately after the armed robbery with wounding of John, was a contingency which the appellant had in mind, whether or not the gun was fired intentionally and whether or not in furtherance of the common unlawful purpose.â

As to that third element, his Honour referred to Johns and, particularly, the directions of the trial judge set out in the judgment of Begg J at 294-5 (quoted above).


	
	Applying these principles to the present case, to establish Batcheldorâs complicity in the murder it was necessary to show that she contemplated the infliction of actual bodily harm, whether by Walsh or herself, upon the deceased as a possible incident of the kidnapping in which they were jointly involved. It appears to me that, in determining her criminal responsibility for the killing of the deceased, her position is no different from that of the man Dodge in Johns or the appellant in Sharah.
	
	
	Rule 4 applies to this ground, as it does to most of the others. However, the Crown prosecutor in this court raised the decision in Sharah and properly acknowledged that leave under the rule should be granted. It is regrettable that at the trial neither counsel for Batcheldor nor the Crown prosecutor assisted the trial judge by reference to this authority. In this court the Crown prosecutor sought to meet this ground by reliance upon the proviso, to which I shall return.
	
	
	In the course of oral argument there was reference to R v R & G (1995) 63 SASR 417, 79 A Crim R 191, a decision of a bench of five judges of the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal. In that case the court examined the common law of felony murder, which applied in that State at the time of the incident the subject of the proceedings. The leading judgment was delivered by King CJ. The Chief Justice (at 420, 193) expressed the common law rule as it had been formulated in R v Van Beelen (1973) 4 SASR 353 at 403: that âit is murder to cause death in the commission of or in furtherance of the commission of a felony involving violence or danger.â
	
	
	The case at hand arose from a robbery by two men, R & G, both of them armed with knives. In the course of the robbery R fatally stabbed one of the victims. Both were found guilty of murder. The issue for consideration of the court was the basis upon which G might be found guilty of the murder under the felony murder rule.
	
	
	Among the authorities referred to by King CJ (again at 420, 193) was R v Betts & Ridley (1930) 22 Cr App R 148, his Honour noting that it was held in that case âthat a prinicpal in the second degree to a crime of robbery with violence was guilty of murder when the principal in the first degree, contrary to the accessoryâs expectation, inflicted violence to such a degree as to cause death.â His Honour went on to refer to a passage in the judgment of Philp J in R v Solomon [1959] QdR 123 at 126-7:
	


âBy the common law if the victim of robbery, which is a felony involving violence, be killed in the course of the robbery all parties to the robbery are guilty of murder. The probability or possibility that homicide would or would not be done is irrelevant. The fact that the homicide occurred independently of the exercise of the will of one of the accomplices would not exonerate him.â


	
	The court rejected an argument by counsel for G that it should âplace the criminal liability of a principal in the second degree or an accessory before the fact to felony, for a murder committed in the course of the felony, on the basis of the rule as to common purpose laid down in Johnsâ (referring to the High Court decision). King CJ said (at 421, 194):
	


âJohns was decided in accordance with the law of New South Wales. The felony murder rule does not form part of the law of that State. An equivalent rule is enacted by s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) in relation to crimes punishable by penal servitude for life, but it is confined to the commission of the crime âby the accused, or some accomplice with himâ (emphasis added). Section 18 therefore had no application to the factual situation in Johns as the appellant in that case was not with the actual perpetrator but was an accessory before the fact. The restriction of the liability of the accessory to acts which were within his contemplation, has no application in South Australia to a murder committed in the course of the commission of a felony.â


	
	With respect, that was not the reasoning in Johns, either in this court or the High Court. The effect of Johns was to equate for this purpose the position of an accessory before the fact and a principal in the second degree, not to distinguish them by reference to the terms of s 18. Whilst acknowledging the persuasive force of a five judge decision of the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal, the decisions in Johns and Sharah have settled the law in this State.
	
	
	However, the issue does not end there. In Johns the focus was upon the complicity of the secondary parties, especially the accessory before the fact, in the murder. The judgments did not deal in terms with the foundational offence of armed assault with intent to rob with wounding. However, in Sharah Carruthers J did address the offence of armed robbery with wounding, as follows (at 297-8):
	


âIn relation to the s 98 count, it was incumbent upon the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt:

(i) that there was a common purpose between the appellant and Attard in company to rob John whilst Attard was, to the knowledge of the appellant, armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a sawn-off, double-barrelled shotgun;

(ii) that during the course of the armed robbery Attard wounded John;

(iii) that the appellant contemplated that in the carrying out of the common unlawful purpose of armed robbery such wounding might occur.â


	
	This, of course, is in accordance with the statement of principle in the judgment of Street CJ in Johns which I have quoted above. To establish the appellantâs guilt of the armed robbery with wounding it was necessary to establish not just that a wounding occurred, but also that the appellant contemplated a wounding as a possible incident of the criminal enterprise. Of course, if that were established his complicity in the murder (on the basis of constructive murder) would necessarily follow.
	
	
	In many cases of constructive murder arising from an armed robbery with wounding, the wounding charged is the same act as that which caused the death. This was not the case in Sharah. The s 98 count was based upon the injury to John when he was struck by the barrel of the gun. The murder count was based upon the shooting of Nick. It may be for this reason that Carruthers J, in setting out the appropriate directions for constructive murder, included the element that the appellant had in mind the discharge of the weapon as a contingency of the armed robbery. However, it is not apparent that that additional direction was required. The complicity of the appellant in the s 98 offence through his contemplation that someone might be wounded, whoever that person might be, whether it might be one person or more than one, and by whatever means, was sufficient to establish his guilt of murder.
	
	
	In my view, the same principle applies to the present case. An essential ingredient of the offence of specially aggravated kidnapping was the infliction of actual bodily harm upon the deceased. To establish Batcheldorâs complicity in that offence, it was necessary to prove that she contemplated the possibility that actual bodily harm might be occasioned to the deceased, whether by Walsh or herself. Here also, if that were proved her complicity in the murder would be established.
	
	
	I should say that this is an issue which arose in the course of oral argument in this court. The trial judge did not direct the jury in that manner, he was not asked to, and it was not the subject of a ground of appeal. Nevertheless, it is a matter which fairly arose in the course of discussion about Batcheldorâs complicity in the murder and, in my view, should be determined.
	
	
	Accordingly, the deficiency in his Honourâs directions was not in relation to the elements of constructive murder but, rather, in his directions about Batcheldorâs complicity in the specially aggravated kidnapping. Provided the jury had been directed as to the contemplation of harm necessary to establish her guilt of that offence, his Honourâs directions on murder were sufficient. It is on this basis that I would grant leave under r 4 and uphold this ground.
	


The directions as to the element of âin companyâ in the first count (ground 6)


	
	As I have said, the first count alleged an offence under s 86(3) of the Crimes Act. Section 86(1) provides for the basic offence of kidnapping, that is, detaining a person for advantage. Sub-section (2) provides for the aggravated offence, that is, that the offence was committed in company. The trial judge left both of those offences to the jury as available alternative verdicts.
	
	
	As to the offence charged, specially aggravated kidnapping, his Honour set out in written directions the elements of the basic offence:
	


â1.Â Â Â That the appellant detained the deceased;

2.Â Â Â that she did so knowing that he did not consent to that detention; and

3.Â Â Â that she did so with the intention of obtaining an advantage by that detention.â

The written directions explained that these were the elements of the basic offence and that, to establish the offence charged, two further elements would have to be proved:

â4.Â Â Â that the appellant committed the offence in the company of Walsh; and

5.Â Â Â that actual bodily harm was occasioned to the deceased at the time of the detention.â


	
	In oral directions, his Honour explained the notion of being in company as follows:
	


âIf two or more persons are present, and share the same purpose, to detain the alleged victim for advantage, then they will be in company even if the alleged victim is not aware of that other person.

So the fourth element is that you have to be satisfied that the offence was committed by the accused, Lauren Batcheldor, in the company of the accused, Richard James Walsh.â

After the jury had retired, his Honour gave a direction to the same effect in answer to a question from them seeking that the phrase âin companyâ be re-defined.


	
	This ground complains that those directions were inadequate to convey the notion of being in company. Mr Dalton referred to FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182 (reported in part in 224 A Crim R 82), in which RA Hulme J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Schmidt J agreed, considered the issue at [115]-[126]. His Honour reviewed authorities, including the leading judgment of Kirby J (with whom Heydon JA and Greg James J agreed) in R v Button and Griffen [2002] NSWCCA 159, 54 NSWLR 455. RA Hulme J set out the relevant principles from that case at [121]-[122] of FP. His Honour noted that Kirby J extracted from previous authorities certain propositions, and continued:
	


â[121]Â Â Â â¦

Relevantly, those propositions were:

â¢Â Â Â the offenders must share a common purpose to commit the offence in question;

â¢Â Â Â physical presence of one or more other persons is required;

â¢Â Â Â participation in the common purpose, without physical presence, is insufficient; and,

â¢Â Â Â âThe perspective of the victim (being confronted by the combined force or strength [of] two or more persons) is relevant, although not determinative. If two or more persons are present, and share the same purpose, they will be âin companyâ if the victim is unaware of the other personâ.â


	
	Relevantly to the present case, his Honour continued at [122]:
	


â[122]Â Â Â KirbyÂ J then turned to consider what âphysical presenceâ meant. He described this as âan elastic conceptâ and proceeded to give two hypothetical examples. One was of a sexual assault in a large house involving a number of individuals. He said that it would not necessarily mean there was not the required physical presence if the victim was taken into a bedroom by one offender and the door closed; even if the bedroom was upstairs so that there was some distance separating the offender and the other members of the group. There were limits, however, and these were to be determined according to the following test stated by his Honour (at [125]):

The test is the coercive effect of the group. There must be such proximity as would enable the inference that the coercive effect of the group operated, either to embolden or reassure the offender in committing the crime, or to intimidate the victim into submission.â


	
	FP itself was a case of sexual assault in which certain counts were alleged to have been committed in company. RA Hulme J expressed the directions required in that case at [126]:
	


[126]Â Â Â âHaving regard to these authorities, the direction that the trial judge was required to give to the jury in the present case in relation to [the relevant counts] involved the following components:

1.Â Â Â that the alleged co-offenderâ¦had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting;

2.Â Â Â that the applicant shared a common purpose that this would occur; and

3.Â Â Â that the applicant was physically present when it occurred, such presence being sufficiently proximate if (a) it afforded encouragement to the alleged co-offender or (b) it operated to intimidate or coerce the complainant.â


	
	Mr Dalton submitted that a direction about physical presence to the effect of the third point in that paragraph should have been given, and should have been explained by reference to the evidence. He pointed out that, while Batcheldor acknowledged having been present with Walsh and the deceased at Beaton Park, there was no direct evidence admissible against her that at that point she was involved with Walsh in the detention of the deceased. Indeed, the only direct evidence - that of Callaghan, Batcheldor herself and Walsh - was to the contrary. The Crown sought to establish her involvement by inference, primarily from the evidence of witness A.
	
	
	The evidence of witness A about the arrival of the appellants at her home might support the inference that they were together at the park when the deceased got into the Mazda, and her evidence of what occurred thereafter supports the inference that he was detained at that point. Her evidence clearly supports the inference that the deceased was detained in the garage while Batcheldor was upstairs at that home. On the other hand, it is clear from her evidence that Batcheldor was never in the garage. In these circumstances, a matter which the jury had to determine was whether her presence provided encouragement to Walsh or tended to intimidate or coerce the deceased.
	
	
	The effect of the Crown prosecutorâs submission was that that inference was readily available and that the issue of being in company was not central to Batcheldorâs defence case, which was that she had not been involved in a detention at all. His submission was that, âin the rather idiosyncratic circumstancesâ of the case, the directions his Honour gave were adequate. I cannot accept that argument. A finding that the offence was committed in company was necessary to establish the first count, and the jury were not properly instructed about that matter. In my view, the direction for which Mr Dalton contended was essential.
	
	
	Here also, his Honour was not referred to the authority which I have cited and no redirection was sought at the trial by counsel for either appellant or the Crown prosecutor. Rule 4 applies but, in my view, the matter is of sufficient significance to warrant the grant of leave. This ground is made out.
	


Unreasonable verdicts (ground 5)


	
	Mr Dalton argued that the verdicts of guilty of both counts were, in any event, unreasonable. At the trial there were challenges to the credibility of major witnesses. Put shortly, both Karaoglu and Agdiran acknowledged problems with their memory because of drug use, while witness A received the benefit of an indemnity from prosecution for giving her evidence. However, Mr Dalton did not rely on those matters. His submission was that the evidence admissible against Batcheldor, taken at face value, was insufficient to establish her guilt to the requisite standard.
	
	
	Also put shortly, Mr Dalton acknowledged the background of the theft of property from Batcheldorâs home and her interest in finding out who was responsible for it. This might have provided her with a motive to join Walsh in questioning the deceased about the matter and, perhaps, using a measure of intimidation to extract answers from him. However, Mr Dalton argued, the evidence falls short of establishing her participation in the detention of the deceased, nor an anticipation on her part that Walsh might detain and/or assault him.
	
	
	Mr Dalton relied upon the lack of any direct evidence that Batcheldor was involved in the detention of the deceased at Beaton Park, noting that the direct evidence was to the contrary. He also noted the absence of any entry in the phone records of the call which witness A alleged Batcheldor made to her saying they were on their way over. Accepting that the appellants arrived at witness Aâs home at the same time, he said that it was possible that Batcheldor asked witness A to open the electronically controlled door to the garage at the request of Walsh, who had found that he could not get into it.
	
	
	Mr Dalton relied on the evidence that Batcheldor then remained upstairs in the house and did not enter the garage, and that she left before the incident which led to the death of the deceased. The fact that she was at the house for a period, he argued, fell well short of establishing that she was relevantly in company with Walsh and was insufficient to prove her complicity in the detention of the deceased, let alone his death.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Dalton submitted that the evidence of Batcheldorâs actions after the event in moving the deceasedâs car from Beaton Park, obtaining the masks, taking witness A to Wollongong Hospital, providing her car to witness A to pick up Walsh after he had set fire to the Mazda, and having the backpack disposed of, did not necessarily point to her having been involved in either offence as a principal. They were consistent with her being an accessory after the fact.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor in this court put the Crown case in this way:
	



	
	It was Batcheldor who initiated and pursued the enquiries into the break-in at her home, including the visit to the deceasedâs unit on 18 January and the phone calls thereafter.
	
	
	After the visit to the pawn shop, when she came to suspect the deceased of involvement in the break-in, she was obviously angry. She told Mr Agdiran that she was going to smash the deceasedâs place up and told the police that she wanted to go immediately to his house and punch him in the head.
	
	
	She went to the deceasedâs unit not alone, but in the company of Walsh and Karaoglu. The behaviour of the two men towards Mr Small was intimidating, and towards the deceased, when he arrived, was aggressive.
	
	
	On Batcheldorâs evidence, her primary purpose in meeting the deceased at Beaton Park was to pursue her enquiries about the stolen property, not the possible purchase of an Xbox. The effect of the evidence of witness A was that the two appellants left the park, Walsh driving the Mazda in which the deceased was a passenger, and arrived at her home at the same time.
	
	
	Batcheldor remained at witness Aâs home for a period while Walsh and the deceased were in the garage. Witness Aâs evidence conveyed that she was there on the first two occasions that Walsh came upstairs, including the second occasion on which he said that he was going to let the deceased out of the car to have a drink and stretch his legs. This, the Crown prosecutor argued, clearly conveyed that the deceased was detained and was not free to leave.
	
	
	While it was accepted that Batcheldor had left the home at the time the deceased was killed, she returned. The Crown prosecutor argued that her departure was an interruption of her participation in the detention, not the termination of it.
	
	
	Thereafter she took various steps to assist in covering up the crimes. The Crown prosecutor argued that, while these steps of themselves were consistent with her being an accessory after the fact, they had to be viewed in light of the other evidence. Viewed in that way, they supported the conclusion that Batcheldor was involved in both crimes in the manner for which the Crown contended.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown prosecutor relied upon her enquiry of Agdiran whether there were CCTV cameras at Macquarie Pass and at Beaton Park, and her statement to him that it was at Beaton Park that âweâ had met the deceased.
	



	
	I am persuaded by the submissions of the Crown prosecutor that there was evidence supporting the verdicts. It was open to the jury to reject Batcheldorâs evidence insofar as it was inconsistent with the evidence of relevant events in the Crown case. Viewed as a whole, the evidence was capable of establishing that she was a participant in the detention of the deceased, that she was relevantly in company with Walsh in doing so, and that she foresaw the possibility of the infliction of actual bodily harm upon the deceased during that detention. This ground is not made out.
	


The proviso


	
	As I have said, the Crown prosecutor submitted that if ground 8 (relating to his Honourâs directions on constructive murder) was made out, the court should find that no substantial miscarriage of justice resulted and apply the proviso. I reject that submission. The directions the subject of that ground, and of ground 6 (relating to the element of in company), were important and should have been given. Further, while I have found that the evidence was adequate to support the verdicts, it cannot be said that a jury, properly instructed, would inevitably have found her guilty.
	
	
	The two successful grounds are sufficient to warrant an order that Batcheldorâs convictions be set aside and a new trial be had. However, it is appropriate to deal briefly with the other grounds which were not abandoned, even though they were not strongly pressed by Mr Dalton. Rule 4 applies to all of them.
	


Other grounds


	
	Ground 1, insofar as it was pursued, complained that his Honour failed adequately to direct the jury that the evidence of witness B could be used only against Walsh. The particular concern expressed was that the jury might have used that evidence to supplement any deficiency in the evidence admissible against Batcheldor concerning the meeting at Beaton Park. In particular, there was a passing reference in the witnessâ evidence which could have conveyed that Batcheldor had been in a car with Walsh at the park. The Crown prosecutor promptly interrupted the witness, so that no more was said about it. In the course of the witnessâ evidence in chief his Honour clearly directed the jury that his evidence was admissible only against Walsh, as he did again in summing up. No redirection was sought at any stage.
	
	
	Ground 2 was that his Honour should have given a warning under s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 about the evidence of Agdiran and Karaoglu, in the light of their admitted drug use and poor memory. However, these were matters affecting their reliability well within the understanding of ordinary people and they did not call for a judicial warning: R v Baartman [2000] NSWCCA 298, per Kirby J at [62] ff. No such direction was sought.
	
	
	Ground 4 asserted a failure by the Crown prosecutor at the trial to observe the rule in Browne v Dunn (1894) 6 R 67 in cross-examination of Walsh. Put shortly, the complaint was that the Crown prosecutor at the trial had propounded a case that Batcheldor was in company with Walsh when the deceased was detained in Beaton Park without having cross-examined Walsh, whose evidence supported that of Batcheldor, about her involvement. Nor was any direction given to the jury about that matter. The Crown prosecutor in this court pointed out that he was cross-examined briefly on the topic, and that Batcheldor herself was cross-examined extensively about it.
	
	
	This ground also complains of the failure of the Crown prosecutor to lead certain evidence from the crime scene officer, Sgt Debnam, relating to the issue of the Xbox. In the course of submitting to the jury that they should reject Batcheldorâs account of meeting the deceased at Beaton Park for the purpose of purchasing an Xbox, the Crown prosecutor pointed out that Sgt Debnam had examined the deceasedâs car and there was no suggestion that there was an Xbox in it.
	
	
	On appeal Sgt Debnamâs statement was produced, and attached to it were photographs of items in the car, including bags said to be big enough to contain an Xbox. This evidence was not led in chief. Nor, however, was it elicited in cross-examination by Batcheldorâs trial counsel. The Crown prosecutor in this court added that, while Batcheldor had told police in the recorded interview that the deceased had shown her the Xbox at the park, the effect of her evidence at the trial was that there was discussion about an Xbox but she did not say that one was actually produced.
	
	
	No objection was raised about these matters, nor was any direction sought.
	
	
	Ground 7 was that his Honour erred in failing to give a circumstantial evidence direction. Again put shortly, the argument was that the Crown case against Batcheldor was circumstantial, in that it relied upon inferences from the evidence: particularly, but not only, that of witness A. A question necessarily arose whether the conduct of Batcheldor proved by the evidence was susceptible of an innocent explanation, that is, an explanation consistent with her innocence of the crimes charged. Particularly was this so, it was said, in relation to her conduct after the detention and killing, which might be seen as demonstrating no more than her involvement as an accessary after the fact. The conventional circumstantial evidence direction, Mr Dalton submitted, would have enlightened the juryâs approach to these issues.
	
	
	In response, the Crown prosecutor pointed out that the Crown case plainly rested upon conclusions which might be drawn from the evidence, and that his Honour had given the usual direction in general terms about the drawing of inferences. This included the responsibility to determine carefully whether an inference adverse to the accused was justified by the evidence and, in particular, that an inference of guilt of a crime charged could not be drawn unless it was the only inference rationally available in the circumstances. Yet again, no further direction was sought.
	
	
	None of these grounds is of sufficient substance to warrant a grant of leave under rule 4.
	


Orders


	
	In Batcheldorâs case, I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction of each count, and order a new trial.
	


Walshâs appeal


	
	Walsh appeals against his conviction for murder only. Murder had been left to the jury in his case on the basis that he had strangled the deceased with the requisite intent or, alternatively, constructive murder.
	
	
	The appeal relates to the trial judgeâs directions to the jury about constructive murder in his case. The only ground is that his Honour should have directed the jury that, to establish murder on that basis, they had to be satisfied that the act of the appellant causing the death of the deceased was done maliciously.
	
	
	To understand this ground it is necessary to set out most of s 18 of the Crimes Act, providing relevantly:
	


â[18] (1)Â Â Â (a) Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him or her omitted to be done, causing the death charged, was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person, or done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years.

â¦

(2)Â Â Â (a) No act or omission which was not malicious, or for which the accused had lawful cause or excuse, shall be within this section.

â¦â


	
	âMaliciouslyâ had been defined in s 5 of the Crimes Act until its repeal by the Crimes Amendment Act 2007. The section had provided:
	


ââMaliciouslyâ: Every act done of malice, whether against an individual or any corporate body or number of individuals, or done without malice but with indifference to human life or suffering, or with intent to injure some person or persons, or corporate body, in property or otherwise, and in any such case without lawful cause or excuse, or done recklessly or wantonly, shall be taken to have been done maliciously, within the meaning of this Act, and of every indictment and charge where malice is by law an ingredient in the crime.â


	
	Nevertheless, s 18(2)(a) remains unchanged. Clause 65 of Schedule 11 to the Act provides:
	


âThe repeal of section 5 of this Act by the Crimes Amendment Act 2007 does not affect the operation of any provision of this Act (including a repealed provision) that refers to âmaliciousâ or âmaliciouslyâ or of any indictment or charge in which malice is by law an ingredient of the crime.â


	
	In Chen v R [2013] NSWCCA 116, Button J noted at [62] the retention of the concept of malice in s 18(2)(a) even though the statutory definition has been deleted. His Honour added that he knew of no decision of this court as to what the paragraph should now be taken to mean. That is still the case, and this is not the occasion to address it.
	
	
	The bearing of the requirement of malice under s 18(2)(a) on constructive murder was considered in Mraz v The Queen (1955) 93 CLR 493. That was a case of constructive murder, the allegation being that the appellant caused the death of a woman in the course of raping her. In a joint judgment, Williams, Webb and Taylor JJ recorded (at 505) that the trial judge had directed the jury that they had to be satisfied that there was a rape and that the victimâs death had resulted from an act or acts of the appellant. His Honour then referred to s 18(2)(a) and the definition of maliciously in s 5, saying that the jury might take the view that âthe act of sexual intercourse even against consent is not of itself a malicious actâ, it being open to the jury to âentertain the notionâ that rape did not ânecessarily connote an intent to injureâ and might be directed only to the gratification of sexual desire.
	
	
	This was held, both in the Court of Criminal Appeal and the High Court, to have been a misdirection. How that misdirection bore upon the outcome of the appeal is not a matter which need be considered for present purposes. What is relevant is the following passage from the joint judgment (also at 505):
	


âIf upon the evidence the jury was prepared to conclude that the crime of rape had been committed and that the acts of the appellant associated with or done in furtherance of his purpose had caused the death, it was unnecessary that they should embark upon an independent enquiry to ascertain whether those acts were malicious. The very fact that they were so associated or so done established beyond question that they were done âof maliceâ.â


	
	The authority of that pronouncement has not since been called into question: see, for example, the affirmation of it by Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Royall v The Queen (1990-91) 172 CLR 378 at 428.
	
	
	Walshâs case raised an issue of self-defence. In directing the jury on constructive murder, the trial judge explained that they would have to be satisfied that the death of the deceased was the result of a deliberate act of Walsh, not done in self-defence, during or immediately after the commission of the crime of detaining the deceased for advantage in circumstances of special aggravation. Before giving those specific directions, his Honour said:
	


ââ¦ the rationale, or the purpose, behind that particular definition of murder is to include, within the crime of murder, any killing of a person, however caused, during the commission of another very serious crime â¦ .â


	
	In this court Walsh was represented by Mr Lange of counsel, who also had not appeared at the trial. In written submissions he argued that a direction that the act causing death had to have been done maliciously was required by s 18(2)(a). In oral argument he was questioned by the bench about the additional direction which should have been given. He said that the jury should have been told that the act of Walsh causing death had to be âassociated with or done in the furtherance of his purposeâ in the commission of the foundational crime. Those words were extracted from the passage in Mraz cited above.
	
	
	Mr Lange pointed out that, putting aside the allegation of strangulation with the chains, the evidence could not identify what the act causing death was. As I have said, the post-mortem examination of the deceased was unable to determine the cause of death. He also noted that, in sentencing Walsh, the trial judge was not satisfied that the killing was by strangulation with the chains and sentenced on the basis that the death was the result of a deliberate act, without being able to reach any conclusion as to the precise nature of it.
	
	
	Mr Lange argued that his Honourâs direction, in the passage I have quoted, that constructive murder is established by âany killing of a person, however causedâ during the commission of a requisite foundational crime was too broad. It had to be an act connected with the detention of the deceased, either in furtherance of it or associated with it. Indeed, he took us to the passage in the judgment of Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Royall (supra), in which their Honours referred to Mraz as âauthority for the proposition that, in the case of the murder-felony rule, the commission of the felony satisfies any requirement of malice.â That statement, Mr Lange said, is also too wide as it fails to specify the requirement that the act causing death be connected with the relevant felony.
	
	
	In cases of constructive murder it is usually obvious that the act causing death is associated with or in furtherance of the foundational crime. Whether that connection is an essential element was not a matter that was fully argued, with reference to other authority, before us and I do not propose to express a concluded view about it. In the present case I have no doubt that the jury understood, by his Honourâs reference to a deliberate act not done in self-defence, that the issue was an act causing death related to the detention of the deceased. Yet again, no such direction was sought by trial counsel for Walsh (or for Batcheldor or the Crown), no doubt because nothing in the evidence suggested that such a direction was required.
	
	
	As to this ground, I would refuse leave under r 4. The appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Hidden J in relation to the disposition of these appeals in relation to both Ms Batcheldor and Mr Walsh and with his Honourâs reasons.
	
	
	I wish to add some observations about Johns and Sharah. The facts in each case have been summarised in the judgment of Hidden J and need not be repeated. Both concerned a prosecution case put on bases of extended joint criminal enterprise (referred to in the judgments as âcommon purposeâ) and constructive murder (âfelony murderâ). This may explain how a concept relevant to the former came to be imported into the latter, namely that an accessory to constructive murder (either an accessory before the fact or as a principal in the second degree to the foundational offence) must have foreseen the possibility of something occurring that resulted in death.
	
	
	It is important to bear in mind that the foundational offence in Johns was armed assault with intent to rob with wounding (s 98 of the Crimes Act). The case is authority for the proposition that on the facts of that case an accessory before the fact, like a principal in the second degree, must be shown to have contemplated the possibility of the principal offender discharging his weapon in order to be liable for the foundational offence. If so, and regardless of whether the discharge of the weapon was intentional or accidental (but as to the latter, see Penza and Di Maria v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 21 at [167]), it would follow that a participant in either of those capacities would be liable for murder on a felony/constructive murder basis. Without foresight of the possibility of the weapon being discharged, the accessory before the fact and the principal in the second degree would not have foreseen the possibility of a wounding and would be not be guilty of the foundational offence, but merely of assault with intent to rob whilst armed (s 97), an offence that does not qualify as a foundational offence for constructive murder.
	
	
	In Sharah, Carruthers J set out the elements of âfelony murderâ. (Hidden J has quoted them out at [69].) His Honour cited the judgment of Begg J in Johns but added an element over and above those that were approved in Johns. He held that it was necessary for the Crown to prove all of the elements of the foundational offence and that the appellant foresaw a contingency that during or after the commission of that offence (including the wounding) that the gun would be discharged. For convenience I will repeat the third element (Sharah at 297F):
	


â(iii) that the discharge of the gun by Attard during or immediately after the armed robbery with wounding of John, was a contingency which the appellant had in mind, whether or not the gun was fired intentionally and whether or not in furtherance of the common unlawful purpose.â


	
	The NSW Law Reform Commission has questioned how this additional element of knowledge in the accessory came to be accepted when it was not previously part of the common law: NSW Law Reform Commission, Complicity, Report No 129 (December 2010). The formulation of the elements of the constructive murder case set out by Carruthers J in Sharah was quoted and the report continued (at 148-149):
	


â5.37Â Â Â The third element in the constructive murder direction, which was approved in this case, appears to have imported an additional requirement for an application of the constructive murder rule to an accomplice. Previously the rule had, in relation to both the principal and accomplice, required only that the act or omission causing death be connected with the acts forming part of the foundational offence. It had not required any foresight or contemplation, on the part of the accomplice, that the principal would use a weapon in the course of committing or attempting to commit the foundational offence.

5.38Â Â Â Judges in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal have subsequently applied the directions approved in Sharah without criticism, and the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book has also adopted them. In R v Spathis [R v Spathis [2001] NSWCCA 476 [315] (Carruthers AJ, Heydon JA and Smart AJ agreeing)] Acting Justice Carruthers observed that âthe critical question always must be whether the act causing death was within the contemplation of the accessory in his role as a principal in the original criminal enterpriseâ. The historical basis for this direction is unclear. It may be that it was thought appropriate to draw, by analogy, on the approach that had been developed, in relation to joint criminal enterprise liability; or perhaps, that the case was seen as one to which that form of liability applied.â (Footnotes omitted)


	
	The resolution of Ground 8 does not depend upon what was said in Sharah. Like Johns, this is a case in which proof of the liability of Ms Batcheldor for the foundational offence was all that was required to establish the mental element for constructive murder. The Crown conceded that there was a deficiency in the directions given as to the elements of the foundational offence. For the reasons given by Hidden J, I accept that this concession was well-founded.

		19 October 2015",2014-11-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765278,R v Newey [2014] NSWSC 1608,"Judgment
1On 12 November 2014, I heard the application of Colin Michael Newey (the applicant) for bail from this Court. That was with regard to the allegation that on 12 October 1973 he kidnapped, raped and murdered Bronwyn Ann Richardson (to whom I shall refer as the deceased). I stood the matter over for judgment today to give me time to reflect.
2The applicant was charged with those offences on 30 July 2014. He has been in custody since then.
3There is no dispute between the parties that, on Friday 12 October 1973, the deceased was abducted from a street in Albury. Thereafter, she was bashed, sexually assaulted, strangled, and her body thrown into the Murray River. There is a very real dispute whether, at trial, the Crown will be in a position to prove that the accused was the person, or one of the persons, who committed those acts.
4Senior counsel for the applicant has not submitted that the allegation can be characterised as anything other than profoundly serious: Bail Act 2013 (NSW) s 17(3)(b). Nor has she disputed that, if convicted, a sentence of imprisonment for many years would be completely inevitable: Bail Act s 17(3)(h).
Crown case analysis and assessment
5She has submitted, however, that on analysis the Crown case is not a strong one: Bail Act s 17(3)(c). In order to permit me to analyse that contention, I was provided with a statement of facts prepared on 11 November 2014. That document runs for 35 pages of closely typed material, and comprises 258 paragraphs. Yesterday I explained to the parties that my comprehension would be greatly enhanced if, as an alternative, I were provided with a document that set out succinctly the various strands of the Crown case, and thereafter was informed of the response of the applicant to each of those strands. Each party was content with that course, and was content with my focus being on that second document and oral submissions, rather than the lengthy first document.
6The Crown case is a circumstantial one with regard to offences said to have been committed over 40 years before the applicant was arrested. It is noteworthy that there is no scientific evidence, such as DNA or fingerprints for example, that is said to inculpate the applicant in the offences.
7I shall recount the bases of the Crown case of which I was informed, and thereafter recount the response of the applicant to each of them.
8The first basis is that it is alleged that the applicant engaged in conduct after the offence suggestive of consciousness of guilt.
9The first act said to evidence consciousness of guilt is that the applicant gave various accounts of his contact with the deceased on the day of her death. It is said that, in 1976, he had said that he had not seen her after one week before her death. To the contrary, it is also said that later he accepted that he had seen her at lunch on that day.
10The response of senior counsel for the applicant to that contention is that it is accepted that the applicant told a deliberate lie. However, her submission is that it is not uncommon for people to lie for reasons other than consciousness of guilt, especially if they infer that they are suspected of committing a serious crime; indeed, any jury would need to be directed to that effect.
11The second act said to evidence consciousness of guilt is the applicant making a phone call in October 1989 to a police officer said to be designed to implicate others: a Mr Brown and a Mr Martin directly, a Mr Newman indirectly, and also giving information that would lead to a Mr Eames.
12The response of the applicant is as follows. It is said that a person known as ""Witness A"" implicated the applicant with regard to the making of the phone call. But it is said that Witness A only did so many years after the phone call was made. The version of Witness A is that, whilst intoxicated, the applicant bragged of making the call. It is also said that Witness A may well have a motive to falsely implicate the applicant.
13Witness B has also said that the applicant has said that he, the applicant, made the call. But it is said that the version of Witness B as to what the applicant said he, the applicant, had said to the police officer is inconsistent with the evidence of the police officer as to what the caller actually said.
14Mr Eames has also said that he did not make the call, and that the applicant told him that the applicant had done so. It is also the case that, by way of a listening device, a conversation between Mr Eames and Witness A was recorded, in which it seems Mr Eames said that the applicant made the phone call. 
15The response of the applicant is that, many years ago, Mr Eames said in the presence of four detectives that it was indeed Mr Eames who had made the phone call.  In short, the credibility of Mr Eames with regard to the phone call will be very much in dispute.
16The third thing done by the applicant said to show consciousness of guilt is his giving an account of being on a bivouac over the relevant weekend. It is said by the Crown that that was a false alibi, and designed to deflect attention from himself.
17In response it is said that it is actually true that the applicant was camping on that weekend. It is also said that Witness B has given a version contradicting that proposition 15 or 20 years after the weekend in question.  Furthermore, it is said that it can be shown that Witness B is objectively wrong about some details.
18The fourth basis upon which the Crown says that consciousness of guilt can be inferred is that, in an interview with police in 1976, the applicant nominated others with regard to their access to certain motor vehicles, thereby sending the police on something of a wild goose chase.
19In response, senior counsel for the applicant tendered a copy of the typewritten police record of the interview, and it became Exhibit 4 before me. She submitted that one cannot tell whether the applicant was actually actively putting that material forward, or was simply answering the questions that he was asked by police. Furthermore, she submits that there is nothing incorrect, in any event, in what it is said the applicant said in 1976.
20The second basis of the Crown case is that the applicant expressed a sexual interest in the deceased, who was a distant cousin, by making salacious comments about her. In response, counsel for the applicant submits that that material comes from Witness B, and was recounted by that witness in 2012 (when the witness was aged 56 years) and relates to things allegedly said by the applicant when the witness was 17 years of age or younger.
21Finally, it is said that the Crown case will be based upon a process of disproving the out of court statements of Mr Eames and Mr Newman that they saw the crimes committed by Mr Martin and Mr Brown, and the applicant was not present.
22Again, at the risk of a degree of repetition, the response of senior counsel for the applicant to that strand of the Crown case is as follows.
23After the two calls were made to the police officer in 1989, police believed that Mr Eames was the caller. Mr Eames was interviewed in early 1990. In the presence of four detectives, he made full admissions to being the person who made the telephone call. Indeed, he gave an expanded account in which he said that the two perpetrators were Mr Martin and Mr Brown. The caller had said that he, the caller, was with Mr Newman, and the real criminals were Mr Martin and Mr Brown, not the two observers. In short, Mr Eames not only said to the police he made the call, he expanded upon it.
24It seems that, now, the position of Mr Eames is that he was not the caller. The defence case is that Mr Eames, who is still alive, was indeed the caller.
25Furthermore, it is said to be noteworthy that Witness B has said that Mr Eames gave a similar account to Witness B; that is, that he merely got caught up in the crimes of Mr Martin and Mr Brown. That was in a covertly recorded conversation of 2009.
26In short, Mr Eames has previously denied making the call. And as well as that, in the committal hearing of Mr Brown, when the latter was charged with murder, Mr Eames also changed his position about the call.
27Mr Newman, who is deceased, has also given a version that it was Mr Martin (who is also deceased) and Mr Brown who committed these crimes, that there were only four men there, and that the applicant was not one of them.
28That brief overview sets out my understanding of the entirety of the Crown case, along with the response of the applicant to it. In the hearing, I enquired of the solicitor for the Crown whether she would seek to dissuade me from the view that the Crown case should be assessed as not overly strong. She did not seek to do so, and for the purposes of section 17(3)(c), that is the assessment that I make. 
Criminal record of applicant
29Turning to other relevant factors, the applicant was born in April 1953 and is accordingly 61 years of age. He has a criminal record in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, that by no means does him credit: Bail Act s 17(3)(a). 
30In New South Wales, he has been repeatedly convicted of stealing and driving offences. It also seems that, in 1974, he possessed a ""silencer"" and was fined the surprisingly small sum of $40. He has committed break enter and steals, and was sentenced to imprisonment for that offence 40 years ago. It is also noteworthy that in 1984 he was placed on a bond for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and later that year was not before the court with regard to an allegation of assault and various driving offences. In New South Wales, his criminal record concludes in 1984, and recommences with the execution of warrants (presumably for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm and the driving offences) and with him being charged with these offences.
31In Victoria, the applicant was also dealt with for stealing, including with regard to motor vehicles. There are also entries for what is called burglary in Victoria, and what seems to be the equivalent of goods in custody or receiving. That record concludes in 1981.
32In South Australia, he was fined for breaking into premises and stealing. There are also entries for larceny, receiving, and driving offences. There was also a common assault in 1987, for which it seems he received a two month sentence, possibly suspended. In the late 1980s he hindered police, was unlawfully on premises, and committed a driving offence.  There was also a suggestion of a problem with alcohol, in that he was fined for drink driving at the same time. In the early 1990s he continued to steal, and ended up being sentenced in 1992 to serve a balance of parole of 20 days. There was also a suggestion of use of prohibited drugs.
33It is noteworthy that, in 1994, the applicant was convicted of common assault but discharged without penalty. A conviction for arson also invites attention in the same year, although it can be said that it resulted in nothing more than a suspended sentence and community service. Again in 1994 there was a common assault and an allegation of manufacturing a prohibited drug, which again resulted in $150 fine. In 1995 it was said that the applicant had breached the bond with regard to the arson, but it was extended. Eventually he ended up being imprisoned for four months for that offence.
34In 1996 the applicant was dealt with for estreatment of bail, which I infer to be roughly equivalent to a breach of bail.  In 1997 he was dealt with for disorderly behaviour and ordered to perform community service.  In the same year there is a suggestion that he possessed implements that would permit him to administer cannabis. Again, in 1997, with regard to an allegation of common assault, he received neither conviction nor penalty. In 2002 he was convicted of drink driving. In 2005 he was sentenced to community service for a short period for ""unlawful possession"" of an unidentified item. Again in 2007, he was found to be drink driving.  Finally, in July 2014, he was extradited from South Australia to face these charges in New South Wales.
35As I have said, that overview does the applicant no credit whatsoever. It is true that it seems he breached his bail in 1996: Bail Act s 17(3)(f). It is also true that it seems that 30 years ago he was not before a court, and never took steps to resolve those matters. Is also true that there is a very small flavour of violence in the applicant's record: Bail Act s 17(3)(d). Finally, the possession of a silencer 40 years ago is not to be overlooked.
36Having said that, it is noteworthy that the applicant has never been convicted of an offence of serious violence. Unless I am mistaken, none of his matters have been dealt with other than in the Children's Court or the Local Court or their equivalents. He has never been sentenced to anything other than a few weeks or months in prison. His record is suggestive of a man who has had something of a long-standing issue with alcohol and cannabis, and has been for many decades a petty criminal who has unacceptably disrupted the community as a result.
Other considerations
37As I have said, the applicant is aged 61 years. Exhibit 2 demonstrates that he is an ""older frail man"". It is said that he has ""multiple health issues"" and is being treated for cardiac problems, blood pressure and diabetes. It is also said that in the past he has been a heavy user of alcohol, and has been treated for skin infections. Those documents also confirm that the applicant has had a carer since 2006 from whom he has had considerable support, a topic to which I shall turn in more detail in a moment.
38Having said that, his GP has expressed the opinion that ""his health needs could be well met in the prison system"", an opinion that I accept.
39Senior counsel's proposal is that the applicant would go to live in Murray Bridge, South Australia, which I understand to be reasonably close to Adelaide. It is said that he would return to his own Housing Commission home, that being a town in which he has lived for many years. It is also said that he would have a sound community tie, as demonstrated by Exhibit 1, the affidavit of Ms Kim Penny. She explains that she has known the applicant for many years, and that she became his carer six years ago. Apparently she receives payment from the government for doing so. She has said that as carer she would keep track of the medications of the applicant, including his insulin injections. She also takes care of his finances and generally spends about four hours a day with him. It is also said that he gets on well with her children, and indeed they regard him as part of the family. Whilst he has been incarcerated, Ms Penny has continued to look after his affairs.
40Her affidavit concludes by explaining that if the applicant were granted bail she would continue in her role as carer, and would make sure that the applicant attend court and attend at the police station to report.  Finally, she has given in her affidavit a sworn undertaking that she would contact either the local police or the New South Wales police if she became aware that the applicant had breached any of his bail conditions.
41Senior counsel's proposal is that the applicant should be bailed to live at his home in Murray Bridge. During discussion between Bench and Bar table she accepted that, at least as a starting point, he must be inside his home without exception between 9 PM and 7 AM. She also accepted that, again at least as a starting point, the applicant must not go more than 10 kilometres from Murray Bridge Post Office. He must also report to police, she submits, and have nothing to do in the slightest, directly or indirectly, with any prosecution witness.
42The solicitor for the Crown expressed two concerns. The first was the protection of witnesses who may live nearby, though that concern was lessened to a degree when she came to appreciate what senior counsel was proposing with regard to the curfew without exception, the geographical restriction, and the complete prohibition on direct or indirect contact. 
43She also expressed a logistical concern as to whether or not the South Australian police could or would enforce any bail conditions imposed by a New South Wales court whilst the applicant was outside New South Wales. She submitted that it would be preferable for those reasons for the applicant, if he were to be granted bail, to live somewhere in New South Wales.
44In response, senior counsel tendered Exhibit 3, which suggests that the South Australian police are prepared to assist their New South Wales colleagues, and they seek an email address so that that could be promptly and directly done.
45I accept that there are logistical issues about enforcing bail conditions imposed in New South Wales outside New South Wales. But I do not accept that they are insurmountable. In any event, Exhibit 3 shows that the Murray Bridge police are prepared to assist, so long as it is made reasonably practical to do so. And I would have thought that, in the circumstances of this case, and bearing in mind the profound seriousness of the offences with which the applicant has been charged, one can rely upon the Murray Bridge police to take a deep interest in the applicant and keep a very close eye on him.
46Finally, senior counsel has made the following submission as to how the applicant could practically, directly and securely travel, if he were released, from Parklea prison in the outer Western suburbs of Sydney, to a town in South Australia many hundreds of kilometres away. The parties were content for me to receive brief written submissions with regard to those arrangements after I reserved yesterday afternoon. In short, the current proposal is as follows.  Transport will be arranged for the applicant from his current gaol to Sydney airport.  He would fly from there directly to Adelaide airport.  There he would be met by Ms Penny, and travel with her directly to Murray Bridge by car.  
47Contrary to the submission of the solicitor for the Crown, in light of the written assurance of those matters of the solicitor for the applicant, combined with my acceptance of the truthfulness of the contents of Exhibit 1, I do not require documentary proof of those arrangements.  
Determination
48Turning to s 17(2) of the Bail Act, if it were the case that this man were to be granted unconditional bail, I would have no doubt that there would be an unacceptable risk of him failing to appear with regard to these extremely serious allegations that could lead to him spending many years in custody. There is not the slightest question of unconditional bail. The real question is whether, pursuant to ss 19 and 20 of the Bail Act, and having considered all of the factors in s 17(3) of that Act, that unacceptable risk can be sufficiently mitigated by the imposition of bail conditions.
49In short, one is speaking of profoundly serious offences that would inevitably lead on conviction to many years in custody. Having said that, I assess the Crown case as not overly strong and subject to valid question. I say that, of course, assessing a circumstantial case not by way of its individual pieces but rather as a whole.50As well as that, the applicant, although by no means free of criminal convictions, has not shown himself in the past to be a man in the habit of committing serious offences, including serious offences of violence. I also think that it is right to characterise him as a sick old man.  Finally, it can be seen that there are reasonably substantial community ties in the town in which he has lived for many years.
51Having reflected on the matter, I have come to the view that the very strict bail conditions proposed on his behalf do sufficiently mitigate the otherwise unacceptable risk that he would fail to appear in answer to these allegations. It follows that, in accordance with the Bail Act, I am required to grant bail in the following terms to which I shall turn in a moment.
52Finally, I should say that I am aware that one condition that I will impose, namely with regard to not leaving Murray Bridge, is inconsistent with the applicant being able to attend the Local Court at Albury in a month or so.  I do not intend to tarry to debate all of the practical and logistical arrangements that should be put in place for that journey some weeks from now.  Instead, I propose that the solicitor for the applicant approach the Local Court at Albury for a variation of bail well before that date in order to permit the travel of her client for that date, if necessary.
53The applicant is granted conditional bail until his next court appearance on 15 December 2014 at Albury Local Court.

		13 November 2014",2014-11-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765279,Sant v R [2014] NSWCCA 261,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2R A HULME J:  John Sant (the applicant) was sentenced by the Honourable Justice Blanch, Chief Judge of the District Court, on 9 December 2011 in respect of an offence of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine.  His Honour imposed a sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years with effect from 8 June 2010.
3The offence is one that is contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years and/or a fine of $385,000.  Under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) there is also prescribed a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
4The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence on three grounds: assertions of error in sentencing on an erroneous factual basis relating to the period of the offending, in the application of the principles of parity, and in giving inadequate weight to the applicant's ill health and hardship in custody.
Facts
5According to a statement of agreed facts, in October 2009 police began investigating the activities of Manuel Delia and his associates, including Kyle Thompson, in relation to the supply of ""ice"" (methylamphetamine) in the Dubbo and Wellington areas of the State.  The investigation revealed a large operation involving the distribution of the drug on a daily basis directly to users and indirectly by the use of ""runners"".   It was also discovered that Delia was obtaining the drugs from someone in Sydney.
6Nine specific transactions between Delia and the applicant were identified in the agreed facts; the first on 23 March and the last on 8 June 2010.  They involved Delia travelling to Sydney and meeting the applicant.  On these occasions he supplied to Delia amounts of the drug that ranged from one to four ounces at a price of $9,000 per ounce.  On the first occasion an ounce (28g) was supplied which was taken back to Dubbo for cutting and on-supply.  On the subsequent eight occasions the drug was supplied to Delia who immediately went away and sold it to an undercover police officer.  The officer paid $12,500 for the first ounce but paid $11,000 per ounce in the subsequent transactions.  Delia returned to the applicant with the proceeds immediately after each sale.  In all, more than 500g of the drug was supplied to the officer for a total sum of $210,500.  The purity of the drug ranged from 27 to 72 per cent. 
7There were other supplies by the applicant to Delia within the period of the charge.  The agreed facts included:
""On each of the eight occasions that Manuel Delia obtained methylamphetamine from the offender John Sant for on-sale to ""Shane"", he also bought quantities for himself and Kyle Thompson to sell on their return to Dubbo and Wellington. There were also other supplies to Manuel Delia by the accused John Sant on dates between March and May 2010, which did not lead to sales to ""Shane"", as previously referred to in paragraph 4.""
8In ""paragraph 4"" there was reference to Delia travelling to Sydney to purchase methylamphetamine from the applicant approximately twice weekly and on most occasions he was supplied with half an ounce (14g). 
9Telephone intercepts revealed that the applicant obtained methylamphetamine from Anthony McEwan until the latter was arrested on 10 May 2010.
10The applicant was arrested on 8 June 2010 after the final supply by Delia to the officer.  The applicant was found to be in possession of $10,755 in cash, $6,000 of which comprised bank notes used by the officer in a controlled buy a few days earlier. 
Ground 1 - His Honour sentenced the applicant on an erroneous factual basis, namely for a lengthier period of offending than was charged on the indictment
Ground 2 - His Honour erred in his application of the principles of parity
11The submissions for the applicant dealt with these grounds together on the basis that they were interrelated.  That is, the approach the judge took in comparing the sentences he had previously imposed upon related offenders assisted in demonstrating the error asserted under the first ground.
12The Court Attendance Notice specified the charge to which the applicant had pleaded as being that between 23 March and 8 June 2010 he supplied an amount of not less than 600 grams of methylamphetamine which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to this drug (i.e. 250 grams). 
13The statement of agreed facts set out other drug dealing activity before the period particularised in the charge.  That activity related to the drug supply activity of Delia and his associates and referred to the involvement of the applicant as Delia's supplier.  The learned judge summarised some of this in his ex tempore remarks on sentence before referring to the transactions that were the subject of the charge and which I have summarised above.  However, it was submitted, his Honour did not explicitly state an awareness that he was only sentencing the applicant for the transactions that occurred within the charged period and not those that preceded it.   This supported an inference that his Honour erroneously sentenced the applicant for all of the transactions set out in the statement of facts.  The references his Honour made to the offending for which the others were sentenced was said to also support that inference.  It was submitted that the error asserted under Ground 1:
""affected his Honour's assessment of the applicant's offending vis a vis his co-offenders and the application of principles of parity.  The effect of these errors was a mischaracterisation of the applicant's culpability for this offence and a misapplication of parity principles to him."" 
14To make sense of that it is necessary to say something about the sentencing of the other offenders by the same judge which occurred prior to his sentencing of the applicant.  It should be noted that a common feature was that they all received 25 per cent discounts on their sentences on account of early guilty pleas.
Sentencing of Manuel Delia
15Manuel Delia pleaded guilty to five offences involving the supply of methylamphetamine and received a total sentence of 9 years.  The individual offences and sentences were as follows:
Procure minor to supply 12.1.10:  3 years from 8 June 2010
Procure minor to supply 13.1.10:  3 years from 8 June 2010
Supply 21.1.10:  2 years from 8 June 2012
Ongoing supply 17.2.10 - 4.3.10: 3 years from 8 June 2012
Commercial supply 4.3.10 - 8.6.10:  7 years with non-parole period 4 years from 8 June 2012
16According to the judge's remarks on sentence of 29 August 2011, the first four offences involved the supply of the drug in the Dubbo and Wellington region of the State.  
17The commercial supply offence involved the nine specific transactions referred to in the agreed facts in the applicant's case.  But there was no mention in Delia's case that on the eight occasions he acquired drugs from the applicant and immediately sold them to the undercover officer he also received drugs to take back for supply in the Dubbo-Wellington region. There was mention of Delia attending upon the applicant's home on occasions unrelated to supplies to the undercover officer, but there was only mention of three such occasions as opposed to the more regular attendances described in the applicant's agreed facts. 
18Delia had two further offences taken into account at his request on a Form 1 document.  They were offences of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime ($10,000 in cash) and supplying 2.14 grams of methylamphetamine at Dubbo on 8 June 2010.
19Personal circumstances noted in the sentencing remarks included that he was 42 years of age.  He had two sons in a marriage that broke down in 2004.  He had been in his current relationship for the past seven years.  His partner had a daughter and together they had a two year-old son.  He had the benefit of ongoing support from his family.  The judge accepted his claim that he had become depressed when he moved to Dubbo following the breakdown of his marriage and his resignation of membership from the Bandidos motor cycle gang, the latter involving fear of retribution for having done so.  He had then resorted to using drugs and put that forward as an explanation for his offending.  He had expressed remorse to others but there was conjecture as to whether he regretted what he had done as opposed to the predicament in which he had placed himself and his family.  Significantly, he had no previous convictions.  There were opinions of a prison chaplain and a psychologist that he had a low risk of recidivism but the judge noted that he was vulnerable to some extent because he had resorted to drugs when depressed. 
20His Honour regarded Delia's commercial supply offence as being above the ""mid-level"" of seriousness.  The reasons for this assessment were that he was organising others to distribute drugs on his behalf and that it occurred over a period of time.  But also taken into account was that there was a police undercover operation and Delia may have been led into committing a more serious form of the offence, or into continuing it and becoming involved in the supply of larger quantities.
Sentencing of Anthony McEwan
21It was included in the applicant's statement of agreed facts that the police investigation had established that he had obtained drugs for sale from Anthony McEwan.   McEwan was arrested in possession of methylamphetamine on 10 May 2010 after having supplied the applicant that afternoon.  He was in possession of $3,785 which he had obtained from the applicant. 
22McEwan was sentenced by Blanch CJDC on 9 September 2011. He had pleaded guilty to a charge of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine between 19 March and 10 May 2010 and received a 25 percent discount for the early plea. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months. 
23The facts recited by the judge in sentencing McEwan were that he had supplied between 267 and 295g of the drug in the stated period to the applicant who had on-supplied them to Delia.  The judge remarked that the drugs supplied by Delia exceeded the amount supplied by McEwan ""quite significantly"" and it was unclear what the source was aside from the fact that Delia was obtaining them from the applicant.  He said, ""it cannot be said that Mr McEwan ... was involved in all of the operations that Mr Delia was involved in or for that matter, all of the operations that John Sant was involved in"". 
24The recitation of the facts in the sentencing remarks does not make clear how many transactions between McEwan and the applicant were involved.  What is clear, however, is that McEwan supplied less than half the amount that the applicant on-supplied to Delia.
25Offences on a Form 1 document were taken into account but they were not referred to in the sentencing remarks.  However, after sentence was imposed, the prosecutor asked in relation to the Form 1 offences for orders that 16.2g of methylamphetamine be destroyed and that $3,785 be forfeited.  I assume from this that offences relating to the supply of that drug and dealing with the proceeds of crime were involved.
26Personal circumstances of McEwan that were noted included that he was 36 years of age.  His parents were separated and he had a stepfather who had physically abused him. He had become significantly addicted to ""ice"" by about 2005.  He had a conviction in March 2010 for supplying a prohibited drug for which he received a 9 month suspended sentence of imprisonment.  The offence in question thereby constituted a breach of that conditional liberty.  He was sentenced at the same time for offences of possessing a prohibited weapon without a permit and dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime.  He was assessed by a psychologist as having made solid attempts at rehabilitation and his prospects were thought to be ""reasonable"".   A matter specifically taken into account in his favour was his upbringing of his 16 year-old son after his former partner left him when the son was 8 months old.  Also taken into account were testimonials as to his good character.
27However, the judge (rightly) found it necessary to impose a sentence ""that reflects the objective criminality of a significant drug dealing operation, even if it is over a short period of time"".   He assessed the seriousness of the offence as being ""just below mid-level seriousness, largely because it is only just over the commercial quantity and it is over a short period of time"".  Special circumstances were found on the basis of his long-standing drug addiction and chronic depression. 
Sentencing of Kyle Thompson
28Kyle Thompson entered early pleas of guilty to three offences of supplying a prohibited drug (on 25 March, 30 March and 4 June 2010) and an offence of ongoing supply (between 2 February and 4 March 2010).  He was also sentenced by Blanch CJDC on 9 September 2011.
29The sentences imposed were 2 years imprisonment for each of the supply charges and 2 years with a non-parole period of 9 months for the ongoing supply charge.  With partial accumulation, the total effective sentence was one of 4 years with a non-parole component of 2 years 9 months.   The sentences were reduced by 25 percent for early pleas of guilty.
30The judge described ""the key to it all"" as being Mr Delia who he said ran an operation from Dubbo and who came to Sydney to obtain drugs from the present applicant, on occasions bringing Thompson with him.  The evidence disclosed that Thompson and Delia co-operated in the daily distribution of methylamphetamine directly to drug users, using the services of runners.  They co-operated with each other but ran different businesses.  They usually sold bags of 0.25g for $250 but also sold single deals of 0.1g for $50. 
31It seems from the brief description given in the sentencing remarks that the ongoing supply offence involved small street level deals.  The three specific supply offences involved Thompson's involvement with Delia in the supply to an undercover officer of about 28g, 56g and 85g respectively.
32Offences listed on a Form 1 document were taken into account.  They appear to have concerned relatively minor matters related to the activity the subject of the primary charges.
33The judge readily accepted that Thompson's activity was at a lower level than that of Delia.
34Thompson was 25 years of age.  He was a native of the Dubbo-Wellington region.  He began to use amphetamines when he was 18 years old and it escalated to a significant habit.  He gave evidence that his supply activity was motivated by his need to fund his addiction, but the judge found that this provided no excuse given the harm such drugs cause in the community.  A psychologist had assessed his mental capabilities at a lower level and also reported that he had a somewhat antisocial attitude.  It was recommended that he receive assistance in resolving his alcohol and substance abuse problems.  However a Probation and Parole Service officer had reported less optimistically that his ability to commit to a rehabilitation program was questionable in view of his breach of the suspended sentence good behaviour bond.  Support by his partner and family were taken into account. The judge appears to have been dubious about whether Thompson was genuinely remorseful and said there was a question about his rehabilitation prospects.  He also noted that Thompson had a criminal history that included offences of supplying a prohibited drug, dealing with the suspected proceeds of crime and possessing a restricted substance. 
The judge's comparison of the applicant's case with the cases of the others
35The judge said that the applicant's case was:
""not strictly a case where the issue of parity with co-offenders is an issue because this is much more a case involving persons involved up the line of supply of a drug.  However, it is necessary to bear in mind the sentences passed on the other offenders because the general principles of proportionality of sentencing require that there be some advertence to what are appropriate sentences in drug dealing cases and for the various parts played in them.""  
36Senior counsel for the applicant took issue with this, arguing that it was a case for the application of parity principles and querying what his Honour meant by his reference to ""proportionality"" (21.10.14 T3.20).  He cited Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 and Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 and submitted that ""the exercise requires a comparison of the offending behaviour, the offender's background, age, criminal history and general character"" (AWS [29]).  
37Nothing turns on this because I am satisfied that the judge did have regard to all of the objective and subjective facts and circumstances of the cases of Delia, McEwan and Thompson and the sentences that had been imposed.  He did not recite every feature of the other cases but he had a transcript of his remarks on sentence in each of the cases before him as part of the Crown tender bundle and, prior to the oral evidence being given in the defence case, he said that he had read ""the papers"" (POS 4.15). It is apparent that he did not confine his attention to just the objective circumstances of the offending: for example, see in the extract immediately below his reference to Delia not having prior convictions.  Moreover, aside from their respective criminal histories, there was not much else in the subjective cases that served to distinguish the offenders.
38The judge said in respect of Delia:
""So far as the part played by this offender clearly he is further up the line of supply than Delia, although, of course, Delia was distributing the drug in the Dubbo Wellington area.  In Delia's case for the supply charge I sentenced him to seven years with a four year non-parole period.  The total sentence for Delia was nine years with a six year non-parole period but in Delia's case a significant factor in increasing the sentence was the fact that he had involved a juvenile in the distribution of the drug. ... I should mention so far as Delia is concerned that he was a person without a prior criminal history."" 
39In relation to Thompson he said:
""In the case of Thompson, I sentenced him to four years with a non-parole period of two years and nine months.  He was a person who was an assistant to Delia."" 
40And in the case of McEwan he said:
""I also have sentenced the man [McEwan], who supplied during a short period of time and I sentenced him to six years with a non-parole period of three and a half years.  [McEwan] came for sentence in relation to a discrete period between 19 March and 10 May and the amounts of drug involved in his case were 267 grams and 295 grams."" (Emphasis added)
41His Honour concluded this segment of his sentencing remarks as follows:
""It is clear from a review of those cases that this offender is the most culpable in terms of providing significant quantities of methylamphetamine into the community and, accordingly it would be expected in the ordinary course of events that he would get a more severe penalty than Delia for supply and I repeat so far as the supply was concerned Delia's sentence was seven years with a four year non-parole period.  In imposing those sentences I gave discrete sentences for each of the offences.""
Submissions and response
42I have previously referred (at [13]) to the overarching submission made on behalf of the applicant in relation to these grounds.  It was further submitted that in finding that the applicant was ""the most culpable"" and that he should receive a heavier penalty than the others his Honour must have had regard to the earlier transactions that did not form part of the charge period (AWS [21]-[22]).  
43I cannot accept that submission for two reasons.  At the very commencement of his sentencing remarks his Honour recited the terms of the charge, including that it was an offence that was committed ""between 23 March 2010 and 8 June 2010"".  I am not prepared to accept the submission when very soon after having said that he referred to some of the transactions set out in the agreed facts that predated this period that he was oblivious to the fact that they were not part of the charged conduct.
44Senior counsel for the applicant queried why the statement of agreed facts included reference to the earlier transactions given they were not relevant to the applicant's offence and had no idea why it was tendered in that form (21.10.14 T2.41).  The document was signed by the applicant and it was tendered without objection.  The references to the earlier transactions were probably considered to be relevant in explaining how the police came to identify the applicant's involvement in drug dealing.  He was not the initial target of the investigation; Delia was.  It was through monitoring Delia's activities that police became aware that the applicant was his supplier.  It seems to me that the earlier activity described in the agreed facts was intended to provide background information; was understood by counsel then appearing to be there for that purpose; and was also understood by the judge in that way. 
45The second reason I cannot accept the applicant's contention is that the judge twice made specific reference to the sentence imposed upon Delia for his commercial supply offence.  That offence corresponded with the period and much of the activity involved in the applicant's offence.  If the judge had thought that the applicant's offending conduct extended back into February he would have been making a comparison with Delia's ongoing supply offence as well. 
46It was submitted that his Honour's comparison with the sentencing of McEwan supported the proposition that he had taken into account the pre-charge supply activity.  The analysis was that McEwan was sentenced for an offending period of just under two months whereas the applicant was to be sentenced for an offending period of just under three months.  If the earlier supplies were included as part of the offending period, this then increased to just under four months, almost twice the period for which McEwan was sentenced.  In the passage extracted above (at [40]) in which his Honour referred to the sentencing of McEwan, he used the words ""short"" and ""discrete"".  This was said to indicate that his Honour must have believed that the applicant's period was lengthier than the period specified in the charge (AWS [23]-[24]). 
47This analysis and comparison is unsound.  It ignores the fact that the judge referred to the period of McEwan's offending as being ""between 19 March and 10 May"" and his recitation not long before of the period of the charge concerning the applicant as being ""between 23 March 2010 and 8 June 2010"".  Any contention that the objective criminality of McEwan's offence was closer to that of the applicant's is unsound as well.  My earlier review of McEwan's sentencing indicates that he was not the applicant's sole supplier. Further, he was involved in supplying less than half of the drugs that the applicant supplied to Delia.
48The next submission criticised the judge's assessment that the applicant was more culpable than Delia on the basis that Delia's offending was over a longer period and involved other supply activity, including the involvement of a minor (AWS [25]).  This analysis fails as it compares apples with oranges.  I have already indicated the judge's specific reference to, and comparison with, the commercial supply offence committed by Delia.  It would have been wrong to compare relative culpabilities for the commercial supply charge by including Delia's culpability in relation to other offences with which the applicant was not charged.  When the comparison is confined to the commercial supply charge, on any view, as the up-line supplier to Delia the applicant's culpability must have been assessed as greater.  
49Oral submissions for the applicant tended to suggest, implicitly, that the eight supplies by Delia to the undercover officer were something of a joint enterprise:  
""what's happening is this applicant's getting his cut and Delia is getting his cut.  They are both making money ... out of a chain of events with people in the hope to make a profit.  He is pretty much on a par with Mr Delia in terms of the things for which he is actually sentenced.""
50This ignores the agreed facts.  They were to the effect that Delia attended upon the applicant and obtained drugs.  He immediately proceeded to attend upon and supply the undercover officer and then returned to pay the applicant.  At the same time, he was also obtaining drugs for the purpose of supply in Dubbo and Wellington. There is no suggestion that the applicant had any contact with the undercover officer, or that he was even aware who Delia was supplying drugs to. 
51Dealing more specifically with Ground 2, it was submitted that Delia and McEwan were ""charged with the same offence as the applicant and principles of parity had direct relevance. Merely playing a different role or varying degrees of involvement in an enterprise does not preclude the principles of parity where the co-offenders have been charged with the same offence"" (AWS [28]).  But Delia was charged with being, in effect, a customer of the applicant and a supplier to customers the applicant had no involvement with and there is no suggestion in the agreed facts that he even knew who they were.  The same can be said about the relationship between McEwan and the applicant.  And the facts relating to the number of supply transactions and the total quantities involved differed as between the three of them. 
52It was submitted that the applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance with the sentence imposed upon Delia (AWS [33]).  Delia was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment for the offence in common with the applicant whereas the applicant's sentence was 9 years.  The fact that Delia had two offences on a Form 1 to be taken into account does not markedly affect the comparison.   But when regard is had to the greater number of transactions for which the applicant was sentenced, and to his more significant role as the supplier to Delia, there can be no legitimate grievance about the difference.
53When subjective features are factored in, the applicant was found to deserve a lesser sentence than would otherwise have been imposed on account of issues relating to his health.   A countervailing factor was that Delia had the benefit of being a person with no previous convictions.  The applicant had previous convictions including for drug offences although they were quite some time in the past.  They included cultivating cannabis and supplying heroin in the 1980s for which he was not imprisoned.  In 1993 he received a 3 year sentence of imprisonment for possessing a traffickable quantity of an imported drug.  The judge remarked that apart from some driving offences he thereafter remained crime free.  Nevertheless, he also said that this prior gaol sentence meant the applicant ""should have been alerted to the dangers of becoming involved in dealing in drugs and to have done something to avoid it"" (ROS 11). 
54A final submission to deal with related to the manner in which Delia's sentences were structured (AWS [30]-[34]).  Reference was made to Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 303 where Dawson and Gaudron JJ discussed the importance of having regard to ""the actual period to be served"".   I accept, of course, that this is a matter of significance, particularly where the sentence an offender is serving is derived from multiple sentencing exercises.  But I do not believe it has significance in this case.  
55In sentencing Delia, Blanch CJDC complied with the requirements of Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 by first determining the individual sentences before turning to questions of concurrence and accumulation, guided by the principle of totality.  In the course of doing so he determined that the sentence for the commercial supply offence would be one of 7 years but having regard to totality he also determined that it would be concurrent with the supply and ongoing supply sentences which would be accumulated by two years upon the concurrent sentences for the procure minor to supply sentences.
56On the applicant's analysis, this led to a situation in which only 1 year of the non-parole period and 4 years of the total sentence would be solely referrable to the commercial supply offence.  But another way of looking at it is to say that Delia received a sentence of 7 years with a 4 year non-parole period for the commercial supply offence.  He would only be subject to a further 2 years imprisonment for offending conduct not referrable to that offence.  This analysis does not assist the applicant.
Conclusion
57I am not persuaded that it is legitimate for the applicant to be aggrieved that he received a greater sentence than did Delia or either of the other offenders.  An objective view of the differences between the criminality in their corresponding offences and their subjective circumstances renders explicable the differences in the sentences imposed.    I would not uphold either Ground 1 or 2.
Ground 3 - His Honour gave inadequate weight to the applicant's ill health and hardship in custody
58A major focus in the proceedings on sentence was an issue of the applicant's ill health.  It is unnecessary for the determination of this ground to summarise the evidence on this subject in detail.  In short, there was evidence that the applicant was diagnosed with Hepatitis C in 1995, having contracted it in the 1980s.  He had developed advanced liver disease and there were indications of cirrhosis and liver failure.  
59There was a contest as to the ability of Justice Health to provide adequate care and treatment for these conditions whilst the applicant was held in custody.   Reports by Dr Steven Mistilis, an eminent gastroenterologist and hepatologist, and other specialists in this field were tendered.  Dr Mistilis gave oral evidence.  The Crown tendered a report by Professor Andrew Lloyd AM, a professor of medicine and consultant infectious diseases physician.  The applicant was under the care of Professor Lloyd at Long Bay prison. 
60The sentencing judge reviewed the evidence on this subject at relative length in his remarks on sentence (ROS 8.3 - 10.10).  He concluded:
""There can be no doubt that he would be better treated if he were out of the gaol hospital or out of the prison situation.  There can be no doubt that he would receive better treatment if he were allowed to go into a liver unit and I accept the evidence that his chances of survival would be better if he were allowed to do that.  That, of course, is looking at the issue entirely from the offender's point of view.  It does have to be taken into account and it certainly has to be taken into account on the basis that his time in gaol is going to be a lot more difficult because of his health problems."" 
61His Honour referred to some more of the evidence on the subject before continuing:
""I accept that they will not deal with it as well in the gaol situation as would happen if he were not in a gaol situation but that is not a basis for reducing a sentence to something that would be manifestly inadequate or inadequate bearing in mind the circumstances.  Those factors do all have to be weighed together in coming to what is an appropriate sentence.
Can I come back then to the question of proportionality and that involves looking at the other persons that I have sentenced as a result of this police operation and in my view as I have already indicated this offender should receive in the ordinary course of events a much heavier penalty than the other offenders.  However, what has to be borne in mind is his health situation and the difficulties for him in custody and because of that in my view the sentence should be reduced."" (Emphasis added)
62It was submitted that his Honour ""failed to give adequate weight to the matter of the applicant's ill health and the adequacy of medical treatment in prison"".    Further, ""it should have been given greater weight in the application of special circumstances.  The applicant's ill health in this case was significant and should have been given substantial weight on sentence.""
63The short answer to this is that his Honour accepted the state of the applicant's health was as described in the medical evidence; that he would not be treated as well in the custodial environment as he would be in the community; and that his sentence would be reduced as a result.  The extent to which such a reduction was made was primarily a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge.  This Court will be slow to intervene when complaints are made about the ""weight"" that should be given to individual factors in the complex of issues to be considered in a sentencing exercise: see, for example, R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11] (Spigelman CJ) which has been repeatedly cited in this Court for that proposition.
64In Hanania v R [2012] NSWCCA 220 at [33] Button J questioned (without deciding) whether a complaint about weight should be a ground of appeal rather than a particular of a complaint about manifest excess or inadequacy.  The judge said that he would reduce the sentence he otherwise would have imposed.  I am not prepared to conclude that he did not do so.  The sentence is not said to be manifestly excessive.  In these circumstances I am not prepared to conclude that ""inadequate weight"" was given to these matters.
Proposed orders
65I propose the following orders:
1. Leave to appeal granted. 2. Appeal dismissed.
66ADAMSON J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.

		10 November 2014",2014-11-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765305,R v Dennis; R v Elwood [2014] NSWSC 1615,"Judgment
1R A HULME J:  Douglas Dennis and Luke Elwood were arraigned on 11 March 2014, along with Ethan McKellar and Bevan McKellar, on an indictment charging that on 1 May 2011 at Ashmont, a suburb of Wagga Wagga, they murdered Mr G, wounded his son, JG, with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm, and assaulted Mr G with intent to rob him whilst armed with an offensive weapon.  (I cannot mention the full names of the victims because JG was a juvenile at the time: s 15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW)).
2On 9 April 2014 the jury returned the following verdicts:
Ethan McKellar: Guilty of murder, wounding with intent, armed assault with intent to rob.
Bevan McKellar: Guilty of murder, wounding with intent, armed assault with intent to rob.
Douglas Dennis: Not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, not guilty of wounding with intent and of armed assault with intent to rob.
Luke Elwood: Not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, not guilty of wounding with intent, and guilty of armed assault with intent to rob.
3I have already sentenced Ethan and Bevan McKellar: R v Ethan McKellar; R v Bevan McKellar [2014] NSWSC 1243.  I deferred the sentencing of Messrs Dennis and Elwood at the request of their counsel until after I had sentenced the other two upon a reassurance that it was necessary to do so.  I am now aware of what gave rise to this. The delay is nonetheless regrettable.
Facts
4Mr G was a 55-year-old man who lived in Ashmont with his son, JG, who was aged 17.  Mr G was a user of marijuana and he also sold it in small quantities.  JG gave evidence that people would come to the front door and purchase ""a stick"" which was marijuana packed in foil for which they would pay $20.  Bevan McKellar was a customer.  
5The four offenders attended the home of Mr G and JG at about 6.10pm on 1 May 2011.  They had travelled together in a car driven by Douglas Dennis who parked the car some distance away.  The Crown case was that the four went there with an intention to rob Mr G.  It was the case for each of the offenders that they were simply going there to purchase some marijuana.  
6I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that two weapons were brought with the men; a machete and a knife.  There is no question that Ethan McKellar had the knife.  However, there is no evidence that either of the present offenders were aware of this before they arrived at the house.  I am satisfied that Luke Elwood was aware that Ethan McKellar had the machete.  The Crown contended that Mr Elwood said in his police interview he saw Ethan McKellar with a knife after they had arrived at the house but my understanding of his account is that it was a machete about half a metre long that he saw.
7It has been submitted by Ms Manuell SC, and I am prepared to accept, that the jury's acquittal of Douglas Dennis for armed assault with intent to rob means that it was not established that he was a party to any plan to rob and it followed that he was not aware of an offensive weapon being brought to the scene.
8Once they arrived at the address, Bevan McKellar and Douglas Dennis went to the front door while the other two offenders remained in the near vicinity.  There was a knock on the door and when Mr G answered it, the offender Dennis asked him for a ""stick"".  Bevan McKellar punched Mr G to the ground.  JG emerged from his bedroom and saw Bevan McKellar on the threshold before the latter turned and ran.  Mr G got up and pursued him and JG followed.
9JG saw his father trip and fall on the lawn near the unfenced border of the neighbouring property.  He saw Bevan McKellar knee his father ""in the body area"".  JG ran up and punched Bevan to the face and thereby distracted his attention from Mr G. JG then saw Ethan McKellar produce a knife.  There was a short pursuit.  Bevan McKellar shouted to Ethan, ""Kill the cunt"".  JG was then stabbed twice by Ethan McKellar.  Both Douglas Dennis and Luke Elwood were acquitted by the jury in relation to the stabbing of JG and so the criminality of their involvement in the incident must be assessed with the exclusion of this aspect.
10After the stabbing of JG, Bevan and Ethan McKellar returned their attention to Mr G who by this stage was on the ground near the front of the adjoining property.  I infer that the present offenders, Messrs Dennis and Elwood, had some physical interaction with him that resulted in his movement to that location.  There is no conceivable reason for him to have gone to that location of his own volition.
11The four men surrounded Mr G and he was on his hands and knees.  The witness descriptions of what occurred are not entirely reliable given the distance from where they were observing, the speed of events, and the limited lighting conditions.  However, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that members of the group were grabbing at Mr G and kicking him.  I am unable to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that one, or the other, of the present offenders were doing this.  But they were at least parties to the assault by virtue of their presence, surrounding Mr G as he was on the ground.  The assault concluded with Ethan McKellar stabbing Mr G four times.  JG saw his father being stabbed in the back and he yelled out, ""Get off him"".  The men then ran away.
12JG made his way back into the house and called triple 0.  By that stage, his father had made his way back inside the house and was sitting in the kitchen bleeding and obviously in a serious condition.  Neighbours came to assist and the ambulance and police arrived shortly afterwards.  Both Mr G and JG were taken to hospital.
13Dr Cumberlege gave evidence of the ambulance arriving at the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital at 6.44pm.  He examined Mr G and found no sign of life.  His preliminary examination indicated that the most likely cause of death was a stab wound to the chest.  Dr Stephen Wills, forensic pathologist, conducted an autopsy on 3 May 2011.  He described four sharp force injuries.  The principal and fatal injury was described as being a large stab wound to the left side of the back of the chest, penetrating through two ribs and into the upper lobe of the left lung.  There was a further stab wound in the middle of the back penetrating through a rib and entering the chest cavity but not injuring the underlying lung.  A further shallow puncture type mark was found on the front on the left side of the chest and there was also a shallow incised wound on the under surface of the front of the chin.  Dr Wills also described various areas of bruising and abrasions to other parts of the body.
14Dr Cumberlege was involved in the treatment of JG.  He said there were two stabs wounds: one was to the right armpit which was not actively bleeding.  The other was to the back of the chest.  Dr Cumberlege said that both wounds could have been fatal if the patient did not receive emergency treatment, the more so the wound to the back of the chest. Urgent surgery was carried out to repair the wounds.
15The jury found Luke Elwood guilty of both manslaughter and armed assault with intent to rob.  This means that he was a party to a joint enterprise to rob Mr G.  It also means that he foresaw the possibility of some harm, short of grievous bodily harm, being inflicted.  
16The jury found Doulas Dennis guilty of only manslaughter.  This means that he was a party to a joint enterprise to assault Mr G with foresight of the possibility of harm, short of grievous bodily harm, being inflicted. 
17The Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) prescribes maximum penalties of imprisonment for 25 years for manslaughter and 20 years for armed assault with intent to rob.
Objective seriousness of the offences
Armed assault with intent to rob (Luke Elwood only)
18I accept that the jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Luke Elwood was aware of the presence of a weapon; that Mr G was assaulted at the front door of his home; and that there was a joint purpose shared by Luke Elwood with the two McKellars to rob Mr G of what at most would have been a modest quantity of cannabis. 
19Generally speaking (that is without reference to individual culpability) this offence is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for such an offence.  Four men attended the victim's home where three of them were found by the jury to have intended a robbery.  The jury must have been satisfied that those three were aware of the possession by one or the other of them of an offensive weapon.  Their intention was to steal the victim's property.  That there was a multiplicity of offenders and the location was the victim's home serve to elevate the seriousness of the offence.  It was an offence carried out with force of numbers.  The roles of Ethan and Bevan McKellar were greater than that of Luke Elwood.  Ethan McKellar came to the scene with a knife and a machete.  Bevan McKellar initiated the physical assault upon Mr G.  The role of Luke Elwood is significantly less.  The impression I have gained from all of the subjective material I have seen is that he was likely to have been more a follower and very much a subordinate participant.
Manslaughter (both Dennis and Elwood)
20I accepted in sentencing the McKellars that by the time of the events out the front of the neighbour's property, the initial intention to rob Mr G had evaporated.  I accepted that what there occurred was more an expression of the offenders' (i.e. the McKellars') displeasure at the resistance that had been shown by Mr G and his son.  The stabbing of Mr G was not something that was planned but something that occurred relatively quickly.
21I did not accept a suggestion that this was in the nature of ""a robbery gone wrong"".  I accepted the Crown Prosecutor's submission that once a plan to rob became futile, the offenders had the option of leaving; but they remained and engaged in the pointless assault of Mr G.  Luke Elwood engaged in this with prior knowledge that a weapon (a machete) had been brought to the scene.  Both Dennis and Elwood foresaw the possibility of bodily harm being inflicted.
22The starting point in sentencing for the offence of manslaughter is recognition that it involves the unlawful taking of a life.  Features that render this offence more serious than it otherwise might be include that there were multiple assailants.  It was quite cowardly for four relatively young men to be involved in an assault upon an older man who was vulnerable because he was on the ground and surrounded by them.  It is aggravated by having occurred within the environs of Mr G's home.  It involved the use of a weapon.  It occurred in the presence of JG, Mr G's son.  A matter pointing in the opposite direction is that the events happened quite quickly.  
23I assess the objective seriousness of the manslaughter of Mr G, in a general sense, as being in the middle of the range but in terms of physical participation (that is, putting aside the murder/manslaughter distinction) the role of both Messrs Elwood and Dennis was significantly less than that of the McKellars.
Impact upon the deceased's family
24Mr G's daughter and JG provided the Court with victim impact statements that were read aloud in court.  They provide very moving accounts of the profound anguish and grief they have suffered.  The actions of the offenders have caused permanent and severe psychological trauma to entirely innocent people and have affected their lives in so many ways.  Once again, I convey my sincere condolences.
The personal circumstances of Douglas Dennis
25Douglas Dennis was born in Bourke in 1984.  He is one of seven children in a family of Aboriginal heritage.  His upbringing was stable and he had positive familial relationships.  His parents appear to have been law-abiding people who provided as best they could for their children.
26He was educated to Year 11.  He told Dr Andrew Robertson, psychiatrist, that he attended school regularly and did not have any problems there.  He described a shortage of employment opportunities in Bourke but gave a history of helping to train racehorses, working at an Aboriginal cooperative, and doing seasonal work such as cotton chipping and fruit picking.  He was receiving a New Start allowance prior to going into custody following the jury's verdict and had been doing some casual work through an employment agency. 
27Mr Dennis began binge drinking and smoking illicit drugs at around the age of 17.  He used cannabis daily and consumed a carton of beer on a monthly basis.  He told Dr Robertson that he had had some counselling and had attended a few AA meetings in relation to his alcohol problem but they had been of no benefit.  He said that on the afternoon of the offence, he and his co-offenders had been drinking and had consumed two cartons of beer. 
28Mr Dennis has been in a relationship since the age of 18.  He and his partner, Corinne Burford, have seven children ranging in age from 10 months to 14 years.  The eldest is not his natural daughter but he has brought her up as his own.  Ms Burford provided a testimonial in which she described their relationship as having been turbulent at times, marred by incidents of domestic violence that occurred when Mr Dennis had become aggressive under the influence of alcohol and cannabis.  However, she described the relationship as having improved from the beginning of 2010.  She gave up smoking cannabis.  She considered that they had both matured.  He reduced his consumption of both alcohol and drugs.  There had been no incidents of domestic violence since.
29Mr Dennis, Ms Burford and the children moved to Wagga Wagga at the end of 2010.  She had family there and they considered it would provide a better environment to bring up the children.
30He has a criminal history.  Aside from driving and minor matters which are irrelevant, he has been convicted on multiple occasions between 2003 and 2009 for offences of assault, intimidation, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and contravening apprehended domestic violence orders.  The penalties imposed have included fines, good behaviour bonds, suspended sentences of imprisonment and full-time imprisonment.  He was placed on an 18-month good behaviour bond on 9 December 2009.  The fact that he was subject to that bond at the time of commission of the present offence is an aggravating factor.
31Ordinarily, a criminal history of the type that Mr Dennis has acquired would mean that there is a need for significant emphasis to be given to retribution, deterrence and protection of society in the assessment of sentence.  However, given the events which I am about to describe concerning Mr Dennis' life in recent years, those aspects are of much reduced significance.
32Mr Dennis was in custody, bail refused, from 3 May 2011 until 31 August 2012 and then since the jury's verdict on 9 April 2014.  To give credit for this pre-sentence custody his sentence will date from 8 December 2012.
33The history provided to Dr Robertson was to the effect that there had been a marked improvement in Mr Dennis' attitude since he was released on 31 August 2012.  He had not been using drugs and had substantially moderated his alcohol intake.  He did a building course and subsequently worked on building sites.  Ms Burford's testimonial confirms this remarkable turnaround in the offender's life.  She spoke of his involvement in sporting activities and his strong commitment to the children.  Testimonials from a number of other people who have been involved in the offender's life further describe this impressive development.
34A consistent theme that emerges from the testimonials (there were 9) is that the general environment of Bourke is one that is marked by significant social degradation and deprivation, particularly for its indigenous citizens.  Employment opportunities are very limited; drug and alcohol abuse is rife; there is less enthusiasm for completion of secondary education; violence is often witnessed in public places; and domestic violence and child neglect is quite common.  Mr Dennis was shielded from much of this within his family home but undoubtedly witnessed such things within the town.  For a time he succumbed to the excessive use of alcohol and cannabis which led to aggression and, in turn, domestic violence.  However, it seems he has put that behind him and he has become a role model within the Bourke community as a parent and as an advocate against domestic violence.
35Dr Robertson found no sign of any psychiatric disorder and assessed Mr Dennis' intelligence as ""in the average range"".  He considered that prior to his incarceration on 4 May 2011 he was suffering from alcohol dependency.  His criminal history was heavily (or perhaps solely) related to this.  Dr Robertson asked him about the marked change in attitude and behaviour since being released on 31 August 2012 and he agreed that he had ""hit rock bottom"" when he was arrested and charged with murder.  Another way of looking at it, according to the doctor, was that Mr Dennis had undergone a process of delayed maturation or delayed development of a conscience.  He felt quite optimistic for Mr Dennis' prognosis; he said, ""I think that it is perfectly reasonable to expect the improvement in his behaviour to continue"".  
36A Pre-Sentence Report records Mr Dennis speaking about the impact that the offence had had upon his own family.  The author writes that he did not mention the impact on the deceased's family until asked, and then stated, ""I think about him every day"".  He told Dr Robertson that he was sad that the man had been killed and he thinks about it all the time.  One of the authors of the testimonials, Mr Stephen Howarth, said that Mr Dennis had spoken to him on several occasions about feeling significant grief and sadness and how he thought often about the deceased's family.  On balance, I accept that he is remorseful.
37It seems that Mr Dennis' prospects of rehabilitation are quite reasonable.  If he maintains the path he is on now, his days of frequent contact with the criminal justice system may well be past.
38Another issue can be addressed briefly.  It concerns some oral evidence that was given and some material that was tendered today.  It has led me to conclude that Mr Dennis has experienced a significant level of anxiety and stress through being in held in custody and it is something that will endure whilst ever he remains in custody.
The personal circumstances of Luke Elwood
39Luke Elwood was born in Bourke in 1990. He is the third of six children in a family of Aboriginal heritage.  He shared a close bond with his parents.  There was no domestic violence, substance abuse or mistreatment.  His law-abiding parents have been supportive of him through these court proceedings.  He shares a positive relationship with his siblings. 
40Mr Elwood's mother moved with some of the children to Wagga Wagga when he was 13 years old.  She wanted to provide the children with a better lifestyle and be closer to extended family.  He remained in Bourke with his father and one of his sisters.  They kept in contact and visited on occasions.  His mother returned to Bourke in recent times.
41For a time when he was in his mid-teens, Mr Elwood lived in Orange with members of his extended family.  He got along well with both of his cousins, regarding them like a brother and a sister.  Sadly, they suffered from illnesses and died in 2008 and 2012; a matter which caused him significant grief.
42Mr Elwood was educated to part way through Year 9 but left school due to general disinterest.  He attended Bourke TAFE where he completed a course in ""Land and Management"".  His subsequent employment history is limited.  He has done some seasonal fruit picking but has otherwise been unemployed, describing himself as ""young and lazy"".  In recent times, he was motivated to work but bail conditions made that difficult.  He has hopes to work as a shearer once the current matter is resolved.
43Alcohol consumption commenced at about age 15 but has never been regular; more in the nature of binge drinking.  Cannabis use commenced at about the same time and has been more problematic with daily use.  When he was released on bail on 31 August 2012 he abstained for a short time but then resumed regular use.  Also during the period he was on bail he was using Oxycontin regularly and to excess.  He said that his motive was to ""get stoned and block everyone out"".  
44Mr Elwood had no prior criminal history.  This is somewhat surprising for a young man living in Bourke, with all that he would have been exposed to.  It seems to be, at least in part, the product of the good upbringing provided by his parents, particularly his father.  This aspect of his case attracts a significant element of leniency.
45Ms Lynn Orcher, an aunt, gave evidence for Mr Elwood in the trial.  She said that Bourke was a town with high levels of domestic violence, unemployment, poor housing and petty crime.  Children were incarcerated at a very young age.  But she had never known her nephew to be violent; she described him as a ""very soft young man, always has been"".  He was well respected in the community, and was ""very much respectful to all of the community, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal"".  He had good morals that had been passed on from his father.
46Ms Orcher's account of the nature of life in Bourke is consistent with the descriptions provided in the testimonials tendered in the case concerning Mr Dennis that were adopted by counsel for Mr Elwood.
47Ms Orcher's assessment of Mr Elwood's personality is consistent with those conveyed in various testimonials that were tendered in his case this morning.  An aunt, Ms Sandra Edwards, described him as a ""happy-go luck boy"".  His father described him as ""quiet and ... pretty shy with people he doesn't know"".  Mr Stephen Howarth said he was ""a very gentle boy"" and he had watched him develop over many years ""into a respectful, polite young man"".  Mr Clem Edwards described him as ""a lovely boy"" and considered that his involvement in the incident of 1 May 2011 was ""very out of character for him"". 
48In relation to the present matter, he told Ms Kathryn Wakely, forensic psychologist, that he was drunk at the time and that when he later heard that Mr G had died he ""just couldn't believe it"". It was ""something that was not meant to happen"" and he said, ""I feel for them, had a son, daughter and I wouldn't know what to do if that was my father"".  He also expressed empathy for any future grandchildren who would not know their grandfather.
49Mr Elwood was in custody, bail refused, from 3 May 2011 until 31 August 2012 (when he was granted bail) and then since the jury's verdict on 9 April 2014.  To give credit for this pre-sentence custody his sentence will date from 8 December 2012.  I also propose to take into account that the circumstances of his custody have been attended by anxiety and stress for the same reason as applies in Mr Dennis' case.  This will continue for such time as he remains in custody. 
50A test administered by Ms Wakely, the ""Severity of Dependence Scale"" test, indicated no compulsive use of, or psychological dependence upon, alcohol or drugs in the year prior to his arrest.  Another test placed him within the low range of general and violent recidivism.
51Ms Wakely considered that Mr Elwood's significant regular use of cannabis in the past, and his use of Oxycontin whilst he was on bail, called for a period of treatment in order to avoid future development of serious substance dependence and associated difficulties.  Attention to his choice of associates and vocational skills training were also suggested as being useful.  I note that in the custodial history tendered by the Crown Mr Elwood was disciplined last month for an ""offence"" described as ""refuse fail drug sample"" and was ""sentenced"" to 42 days off contact visits.  Further attention to his substance abuse issues is clearly indicated.
52I am satisfied that Luke Elwood has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend, provided that he maintains abstinence from illicit drug use.  I am also satisfied that he is genuinely remorseful.  
Parity 53No question of parity arises in relation to these offenders as compared to the sentencing of Ethan and Bevan McKellar.  The cases concerning each pair of offenders are just so different in terms of offences, objective seriousness, moral culpability and subjective circumstances.
54The sentence to be imposed upon Luke Elwood for the offence of armed assault with intent to rob should be less than that which I imposed upon Ethan and Bevan McKellar because of his lesser role and much more favourable subjective circumstances. 55The sentences to be imposed upon Douglas Dennis and Luke Elwood for the offence of manslaughter should be similar.  There will be some difference because of Mr Elwood's more favourable subjective case, particularly his age and lack of previous convictions.
General matters relating to sentence
56There is a need to have regard to the principle of totality in relation to the sentencing of Luke Elwood, given the need to assess individual sentences for the two offences for which he was found guilty.  It was conceded that there should be some accumulation.  I accept that concession. 57There are special circumstances in the case of both offenders that warrant a reduction of the non-parole component of their sentences.  In Mr Elwood's case there is the need to accumulate sentences so an adjustment needs to be made for that reason alone.  But there is also, in both cases, a need for a longer period of supervision on parole to monitor and assist them to maintain their abstinence from drug use, the issue that is the key to their continued rehabilitation.

		14 November 2014",2014-11-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765317,Briouzguine v R [2014] NSWCCA 264,"Judgment
1GLEESON JA:  The applicant, Alexei Briouzguine, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed in the District Court at Parramatta on 16 August 2013.
2The applicant had pleaded guilty to four drug supply offences covering the period September to December 2010.  Counts 1, 2 and 4 related to the drug 3, 4 methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and count 3 related to the drug 3, 4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy).  Schedule 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (DMT Act) provides, relevantly, that a traffickable quantity for each drug is 0.75 grams; an indictable quantity is 1.25 grams; a commercial quantity is 125 grams (0.125 kg); and a large commercial quantity is 500 grams (0.5 kg).
3After applying a discount of 18% for the pleas of guilty, the applicant was sentenced in accordance with s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) to an aggregate non-parole period of 5 years (commencing on 14 August 2013) with a balance of term of 4 years (expiring 13 August 2022).  
4The sentencing judge recorded (at ROS 21) the following indicative sentences that would have been imposed for each of the four offences had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence:
OffenceMaximum PenaltiesStandard Non-parole periodIndicative SentenceCount 1.  Between 24-27 September 2010 supply not less than an indictable quantity of MDA (100g - 500 ""green maccas"" tablets) contrary to s 25(1) DMT Act15 years imprisonmentNoFixed term 2 yearsCount 2.  On 3 December 2010 supply not less than the large commercial quantity of MDA (2900g - 10,000 tablets ""green maccas"") contrary to s 25(2) DMT ActLife15 years7 years Count 3.  On 14 December 2010 supply not less than the commercial quantity of MDMA (275g - 1100 tablets ""yellow spades"") contrary to s 25(2) DMT Act20 years10 years3 years Count 4.  On 29 December 2010 supply not less than the large commercial quantity of MDA (882g - 3000 tablets ""green maccas"") contrary to s 25(2) DMT ActLife 15 years 4 years 
5In passing sentence on the first count, the sentencing judge was asked to take into account, on a Form 1, pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, three offences on 20 September 2010, being two acts of supply a prohibited drug - methylamphetamine (30.87g) and MDMA (5.63g), and one act of supply not less than an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug - MDA (100g), each contrary to s 25(1) DMT Act.
6In passing sentence on the second count, the sentencing judge was asked to take into account, on a second Form 1, an offence on 3 December 2010 of supply not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug - MDA (290g), contrary to s 25(2) DMT Act.
7In passing sentence on the fourth count, the sentencing judge was asked to take into account, on a third Form 1, six offences, namely, on 29 December 2010 five acts of supply a prohibited drug - methylamphetamine (11.53g); Gammabutyrolactone (109.96g); MDMA (17.5g); 1-Benzylpiperazne (3.33g); and 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenlethylamine (1.55g), each contrary to s 25(1) of the DMT Act; and on 23 February 2011 one act of publish false and misleading material to obtain property (an iPhone) contrary to s 192G(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  
Ground of appeal
8If leave is granted, the sole ground of appeal relied upon by the applicant is:
""1.  His Honour erred in imposing a sentence that was discordant with his findings of fact and which was thereby manifestly excessive.""
9The essential challenge raised by this ground is that, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offences and the applicant's subjective circumstances, a more lenient aggregate sentence should have been imposed.  
10An indicative sentence is not itself amenable to appeal but an ""erroneous approach in the indication of the sentence that would have been imposed for an offence may well reveal error in the aggregate sentence reached"": R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199 at [17] (Grove AJ; Macfarlan JA and McCallum J agreeing).  However, that is not necessarily the case.  In PD v R [2012] NSWCCA 242 at [44] Beech-Jones J (Basten JA and Hall J agreeing) noted that the materiality of any error in an indicative sentence to the overall aggregate sentence would need to be demonstrated before this Court would intervene.  
Circumstances of the offences
11The sentencing judge proceeded on the basis of a statement of agreed facts.  These were summarised in his Honour's reasons.  Given the issues raised on appeal it is appropriate to set out in some detail the nature and extent of the applicant's drug supply operation.
12As will be seen, the applicant's offending involved the supply of significant quantities of drugs, over a period of 4 months, and included a wide range of illicit products.  
Background
13At the time of the offences the applicant was 22 years old and studying engineering at the University of Technology Sydney.
14Around May 2010 the applicant met ""NE"".  They later became involved in drug related activities by supplying each other with drugs they independently sourced.
15The applicant first came to the attention of police on 20 September 2010 when they were called to the KFC at Dural where staff had become concerned about the applicant's behaviour.  Police searched his vehicle and located a number of illegal drugs.  He was subsequently charged with those offences that are set out in the Form 1 that attaches to Count 1.  Tests did not detect any illegal drugs in the applicant's system at the time.  It would appear that he was tested for ""common drugs"" and the drugs he was clearly affected by were not detected.  Although he was charged with offences arising out of the location of these drugs, the Crown conceded before the sentencing judge that the applicant was not required to enter into a bail undertaking.  Consequently, the later offences with which he was subsequently charged were not committed whilst he was subject to a form of conditional liberty.
Count 1: Supply more than indictable quantity of MDA between 24 September and 27 September 2010
16Between these dates NE's phone was intercepted by police.  Telephone conversations and text messages confirmed that the applicant supplied to NE 500 tablets, described as ""green maccas"".  Similar tablets were subsequently supplied by NE to an undercover officer being MDA with a purity of 11%.  Police calculated that the tablets supplied by the applicant to NE during this period weighed at least 100g.  An indictable quantity is 1.25g. 
Form 1 matters attached to Count 1
17When the police searched the applicant's vehicle at KFC Dural on 20 September 2010 they located a plastic bag containing 100 brown tablets marked with a ""dollar sign"".  These were later analysed and found to weigh 30.12g and contained the prohibited drug methylamphetamine.
18In a paper bag police also located a single light blue tablet weighing 0.25g that contained methylamphetamine; a plastic resealable bag containing 2 blue tablets that weighed 0.5g and contained methylamphetamine; numerous empty plastic resealable bags; 1 plastic resealable bag containing 3 blue tablets with a ""McDonalds"" logo (and the light blue tablet detailed above) that weighed 1.02g and contained MDA; and a plastic resealable bag containing 13 light red tablets and 9 white tablets that contained MDMA.  The total weight of tablets containing methylamphetamine was 30.87g.  The traffickable quantity is 3.0g.  The total weight of tablets containing MDMA was 5.63g.  The traffickable quantity is 0.75g.  Two charges of supply a prohibited drug were laid on this date in relation to the supply of MDMA and methylamphetamine.  
19Later, as a result of intercepted telephone material, the police became aware that the applicant had supplied a further 500 ""green macca"" tablets containing MDA and weighing at least 100g on that date.  In consequence on 30 September a third charge was added - supply prohibited drug not less than an indictable quantity.  
Count 2: Supply more than the large commercial quantity of MDA
20On 3 December 2010, NE went to the applicant's home to purchase 1000 tablets.  The applicant showed NE a number of vacuum-sealed packages containing tablets.  At NE's request the applicant took a photograph of NE holding ten bags of tablets.  The bags of tablets located on NE at the time of his arrest contained 1000 tablets each.  Photometric comparison of the tablets depicted in the photograph taken on 3 December and the tablets seized from NE at the time of his arrest confirmed that the tablets were the same.  The tablets seized from NE weighed approximately 0.29g each and contained MDA, and on this basis the 10,000 tablets which the applicant had available for supply to NE weighed at least 2.9kg.  The large commercial quantity for MDA is 0.5kg. 
Form 1 attached to Count 2: Supply MDA on 3 December 2010
21On 20 December 2010, NE supplied an undercover officer with 200 green MDA tablets marked with an 'M' symbol.  These 200 tablets were part of the ""green maccas"" tablets that the applicant had shown him on 3 December 2010.  (The sentencing judge incorrectly referred (at ROS 3) to this supply having occurred on 30 September 2010.)  NE supplied the balance of the tablets supplied to him by the applicant to other customers.  Based on a weight of 0.29g per tablet, the 1000 tablets would weigh 0.290kg.  The commercial quantity for MDA is 0.125kg. 
Count 3: Supply more than commercial quantity of MDMA
22On 14 December 2010, NE obtained 1100 yellow tablets with a ""spade"" symbol from the applicant.  On 16 December 2010 NE supplied the undercover officer with 800 of these tablets. NE supplied the balance of those tablets to other people.
23Those tablets had an average weight of 0.25g and contained MDMA with a purity of 12.5%.  On this basis, the tablets the applicant supplied to NE weighed approximately 0.275kg.  The commercial quantity is 0.125kg. 
Count 4: Supply more than large commercial quantity MDA
24On 29 December 2010, NE purchased a further 3000 green tablets of MDA marked with a McDonald's symbol and later sold 1500 of those to a female undercover officer.  Police then searched NE's vehicle and located another 1000 green MDA tablets marked with an 'M' symbol in a cryovac sealed plastic bag and around 500 green MDA tablets marked with an 'M' symbol in a plastic resealable bag. 
25The tablets seized from NE weighed 0.882kg and contained MDA with a purity of 11%.  The large commercial quantity is 0.5kg.
26The Crown advised the sentencing judge that these tablets were part of those contained in the bags shown by the applicant to NE on 3 December 2010 and formed part of the tablets included in Count 2.  His Honour noted that the Crown quite rightly conceded that the sentences imposed on the applicant for Counts 2 and 4 should be substantially concurrent.  His Honour stated that this was a factor that he gave significance to when applying the principles of totality and proportionality to the overall appropriate sentence.
Form 1 matters attached to Count 4
27On 29 December 2010, police searched a property at Galston where the applicant lived.  In his bedroom police located tablets, liquids, and powders being the following:  
(1)49 tablets containing methylamphetamine with a purity of 2%, giving a weight of 11.53g.  The traffickable quantity is 3.0g.
(2)Four containers of liquid gammabutyrolactone weighing 109.96g.  The traffickable quantity is 30g.  
(3)63 tablets, powder substance, and tablet fragments containing MDMA with a weight of 17.5g.  The purity of 21 of those tablets was found to be 35%.  The purity of 11 of the tablets was found to be 40%.  The traffickable quantity is 0.75g.  
(4)2 tablets and a quantity of powder containing 1-benzylpiperazine, weighing 3.33g.  The traffickable quantity is 3.0g.
(5)6 tablets of 4-bromo-2, 5-dimethoxyphenethylamine with a purity of 2.5% and weight of 1.55g.  The traffickable quantity is 0.3g.
28During the course of the search, police also seized an Apple iPhone from the applicant.  On 23 February 2011 the applicant reported that phone missing to police in order to make an insurance claim for the phone.  This false statement is the basis of the sixth charge on the Form 1.  
29The agreed facts also showed that indicia of supply were found by police during the search on 29 December 2010: three digital scales, four SIM cards, and five mobile telephones.
The applicant's subjective case
30The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge and was cross examined.
31The applicant was aged 22 at the time of the offending and aged 25 at the time of sentence.  His Honour found that the applicant was immature at the time of the offences and that this factor reduced his criminality (at ROS 16).  
32His Honour accepted that the applicant's guilty pleas contained an element of remorse.  He found that the remorse, and the applicant's acknowledgement of responsibility, were genuine through their expression in evidence given by the applicant.  As already mentioned, his Honour gave a discount of 18% for this plea (at ROS 15-16).  
33His Honour found that the applicant was unlikely to reoffend and had good prospects of rehabilitation.  In this regard he took into account the evidence of Mr Olivier, a clinical psychologist, that the applicant had ""made positive changes in his life with regard to work ethics, career plans and social life"", and the report of Dr Furst, a psychiatrist, that the applicant ""has a positive attitude towards future counselling and rehabilitation"".  
34The applicant had no criminal record of any significance and his Honour took this into account as evidence of his good character, noting that the applicant came from a close and supportive family.  His Honour accepted that the applicant's good character was not a factor relied on for the commission of the offences.  
Reasons of the primary judge
35His Honour took into account the maximum penalties and the specified standard non-parole periods (where applicable) as relevant guideposts reflecting the seriousness with which the legislature regards the particular drug supply offences to which the applicant had pleaded guilty.  He specifically noted that the maximum penalty for counts 2 and 4 was life imprisonment and that the specified standard non-parole period was 15 years, and that for count 3 the standard non-parole period was 10 years.  
36His Honour found that the applicant's role did not exhibit criminality of a ""higher order"" associated with that of a principal in an extensive and organised network distributing large quantities of prohibited drugs.  
37His Honour accepted that the applicant's involvement in the offending was initially motivated by the need to obtain funding for his addiction to drugs.  He found that the applicant's involvement later changed as a result of threats by a person who was identified only as ""A"", being the supplier of drugs to a person only identified as ""B"" who supplied drugs to the applicant.  His Honour found that, following his introduction to ""A"", the applicant became the custodian of larger amounts of drugs for which he received a modest weekly amount of money and a small percentage on his sale of any of these drugs.  
38His Honour described the applicant as a facilitator and warehouse man acting under some considerable pressure.  His Honour found that the applicant's storage and supply of the prohibited drugs did not disclose any particular sophistication in organising or planning.
39His Honour found that the applicant fell within the category of a user/dealer and thus his level of criminality was lower than a trafficker motivated by greed.  
40His Honour accepted the evidence of Dr Furst, who diagnosed the applicant as suffering from a ""substance abuse disorder"", that the applicant's addiction made him particularly vulnerable to the intimidation of the unidentified supplier ""A"", and his ability to make rational decisions and moral judgments was significantly influenced by the effects of his escalating drug use and his fear that harm might come to himself or to his family.  Nonetheless his Honour also noted the opinion of Dr Furst that:
""However, there was no suggestion that he was unaware of his actions or their wrongfulness.""
41His Honour found that the applicant's moral culpability was reduced by reason of his suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the offending.  His Honour took this into account in determining that general deterrence, retribution, and denouncement should be given lesser weight in this case.  His Honour accepted that there was a causal relationship between the applicant's mental illness and the offending and that this impacted upon his appreciation of the gravity of the offences.  His Honour also considered that the successful treatment of this illness was a relevant factor for rehabilitation. 
42His Honour found that the financial gain obtained by the applicant was relatively small and was used to support his addictions.
43His Honour concluded that the objective seriousness of the offending was at the lower level relative to each offence.
44His Honour found special circumstances in accordance with s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (although he should be taken to have intended to refer to s 44(2B) since he imposed an aggregate sentence). 
45In considering the issue of totality, his Honour accepted the Crown's concession that in relation to counts 2 and 4 the sentences should be substantially concurrent because the tablets relevant to count 4 were part of those supplied in count 2.
Ground 1:  Manifest excess
46A submission that a sentence is excessive (or inadequate) derives from the last kind of error identified in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505.  It involves a conclusion that is arrived at after an examination of the sentence imposed and the process of reasoning which led to that result: Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6]; Hili v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [75]-[76].  
47As explained in Sheen v R [2011] NSWCCA 259 at [162] per Johnson J (Hall and Price JJ agreeing):
""To establish a ground claiming manifest excess, it is necessary for the Appellant to demonstrate that the sentence under challenge is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [27]. Absent error, the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge merely because (if it be the case) the Court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing Judge exercised his discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15]. Nor is appellate intervention on the ground of manifest excess justified simply because (if it be the case) the result arrived at in the District Court is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases. Intervention is warranted only where error is established in accordance with the principles in House v The King at 505: Hili v The Queen at 538 [58].""
Applicant's submissions
48In the present case the applicant's argument that the sentence is manifestly excessive relied upon what was said to be a ""constellation of factors"" that mark out this case as somewhat unusual, and which called for a more lenient sentence having regard to the objective seriousness of the offences and the applicant's subjective circumstances.  
49The particular factors relied upon by the applicant included that the applicant's role was assessed as low in terms of objective criminality; his involvement was motivated by need not greed; his activities were unsophisticated; and that there was an element of duress in the applicant's offending.  It was also contended that the applicant was not a suitable vehicle to reflect general and personal deterrence.
50The applicant contended that this Court should conclude that intervention is justified for the reasons stated in Hill v R (Hill) [2012] NSWCCA 265 at [24], where Harrison J (Simpson and Adamson JJ agreeing) said on a severity appeal on the ground of manifest excess, that: 
""...the sentence imposed upon the applicant is incongruously at odds with the strong subjective case.""
Crown's submissions
51The Crown emphasised that the applicant must demonstrate that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"": Dinsdale v R at [6].  That had to be established in a context where there is no single ""correct"" sentence, and where judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consistent with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach. The fact that this Court might have exercised its discretion differently is not sufficient to enliven s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) or a conclusion that some other, lesser, sentence is warranted in law: Markarian v The Queen at [26] - [28].
52The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge had carefully identified all of the features which mitigated the applicant's culpability.  This included that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder at the time of the commission of the offences, which the sentencing judge took into account in determining general deterrence.  Nonetheless the Crown emphasised that his Honour had made clear in his remarks (at ROS 17) that he did not completely put to one side the issue of deterrence (both general and specific).  
53The Crown also submitted that there were many distinguishing features between Hill and the present case. 
Consideration
54There are a number of problems with the applicant's approach.  First, it does not give sufficient weight to the regard the sentencing judge was entitled to, and did, give to the facts as found by him, as to which no complaint is made.  
55It is necessary to keep in mind the findings made concerning the applicant's role, the quantity of the drugs, and the number of occasions on which the applicant supplied prohibited drugs.  Although the applicant was described by his Honour as a ""user/dealer"", such a label must not obscure the assessment of what the applicant did: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [19].  The offending conduct was committed over a period of four months, and involved a variety of acts on the part of the applicant which gave rise to serious offences. 
56Secondly, the assessment of penalty for the offences on counts 1, 2 and 4 did not involve a sole focus upon the applicant's activities in supplying the relevant quantity of methylamphetamine or MDA.   In passing sentence on counts 1, 2 and 4, his Honour was asked to take into account (on three Form 1s) 10 other offences, nine of which involved drug supply offences.  
57If these offences had been prosecuted separately on indictment the maximum penalty for each of the drug supply offences on the Form 1 matters attached to counts 1 and 4 would have been imprisonment for 15 years; and the maximum penalty for the offence on the Form 1 attached to count 2 would have been 20 years, with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
58His Honour correctly recognised (at ROS 17) that it was necessary for the Court to take into account the Form 1 matters with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for counts 1, 2 and 4.  As his Honour noted, the Court gives greater weight to personal deterrence, and the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences, when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed.  These elements are entitled to greater weight than they might otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence: Attorney General's Application under s 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [42].
59No complaint has been made, nor could it be made, in relation to the manner in which his Honour took into account the effect on penalty of the 10 Form 1 matters.
60Thirdly, the applicant's complaint that the sentencing judge should have given more weight to his personal circumstances does not establish error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, let alone that the sentence imposed is unreasonable or plainly unjust.  His Honour clearly took into account the applicant's subjective case but was also mindful of the maximum penalties available, the applicable standard non-parole periods and the need for both general and specific deterrence aimed at individuals likeminded to the applicant, and deterrence personal to the applicant himself.  
61The statement of Harrison J in Hill at [24], concerning incongruity between the sentence imposed in that case and the offender's strong subjective circumstances, is not a statement of principle, nor does it assist the applicant in the present case.  
62His Honour's statement, which is set out at [50] above, was prefaced by the words ""There is much to be said for the contention that ..."".  His Honour was simply expressing his general acceptance of a submission as to why the sentence which had been imposed in that case was manifestly excessive.  He went on to find (at [27]), by reference to the specific facts of that case, that the sentencing judge had failed to take into account a material consideration, relevantly matters particularly affecting the offender, and had thereby erroneously given inadequate, and correspondingly improper, consideration to his subjective case.  
63Here, unlike in Hill, the sentencing judge expressly considered and took into account the applicant's subjective circumstances as part of the instinctive synthesis in arriving at the aggregate sentence imposed. 
64Fourthly, the applicant's complaint ignores the legislative guideposts which the sentencing judge properly took into account (at ROS 7).  These reflect the seriousness which the Parliament regards drug supply offences.  On counts 2 and 4 the applicant was facing a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years.  On count 3 the applicant was facing a maximum penalty of 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.  Here also the quantities of drugs were not insignificant.  For count 2 the quantity of MDA (2.9kg) was substantially in excess of the large commercial quantity of 0.5kg.  For count 4 the quantity of MDA (882g) was approximately 75% in excess of the large commercial quantity.  For count 3, the quantity of MDMA (275g) was more than twice the commercial quantity.
65Fifthly, the applicant's complaint ignores an error in the approach adopted by the sentencing judge to the finding of special circumstances.  His Honour concluded (at ROS 20) that 'strict parity' did not apply to the applicant and another offender (referred to as NE), because, he found, they were not strictly co-offenders and because the applicant's criminality was less. Despite this conclusion, which had a favourable impact on the applicant's sentence, he also found (at ROS 20) that the applicant could have had a justifiable sense of grievance if a similar finding in relation to special circumstances ""was not extended to him"".  The result was a considerably lenient approach to a determination of the sentence to be imposed on the applicant.
66A non-parole period is the minimum period of actual incarceration that an offender must spend in full-time custody, having regard to all the elements of punishment, including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of the crime and the offender's subjective circumstances, which justice requires that the offender to serve in custody: Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623 at 628-629 and Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [57].  A finding of special circumstances under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is a finding of fact, on the evidence, which permits an adjustment downwards of the non-parole period which s 44 otherwise requires must not be less than three quarters of the term of the sentence imposed on an offender. 
67Such a finding may rest on a conclusion that there is a need to preserve proper parity with a co-offender, in order to avoid a situation of manifest unfairness.  Such a use of the concept of special circumstances must, however, be justified by the special requirements of a particular sentencing exercise: Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398 at [33].  Disparity will not, however, generally arise simply because the application of s 44 to particular offenders results in different sentences between co-offenders: R v Do [2005] NSWCCA 209 at [18]-[19].  See also Gill v R [2010] NSWCCA 236 at [60]-[62] (McColl JA; Hulme and Latham JJ agreeing).  A finding of special circumstances cannot rest on a justifiable sense of grievance in a case where offenders are not found to be co-offenders to whom the principle of parity applies. 
68In the result, it is apparent that the aggregate sentence imposed on the applicant was not manifestly excessive.  To the contrary, it was lenient, having regard to the gravity of the applicant's offences and the maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods which applied to those offences, notwithstanding his subjective circumstances.
69As mentioned above, the applicant placed particular reliance upon the asserted similarities between the present case and Hill's case.  It is appropriate therefore to say something further about that case.
Hill's case
70In Hill the offender had pleaded guilty to one count of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug - MDA (1750.5g), contrary to s 25(2) of the DMT Act.  The offender's role was found to be that of a ""go-between"" between the seller and the buyer of drugs.  Given the generally unsophisticated nature of the offender's role, the limited financial gain, and the amount of the drug, being significant but of relatively low purity (mainly 3-4%), the sentencing judge assessed the offence at not far below the mid-range of objective seriousness for such offences.  
71The offender was sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment of 6 years, comprising a non-parole period of 4 years with a balance of term of 2 years.  The sentencing judge had found special circumstances and given the offender a 25% discount for his early plea of guilty.  In addition the offender was given a discount of 25% for past and future assistance to authorities.  This meant that arithmetically the starting point of the sentence must have been 12 years.  This Court quashed the original sentence in Hill and imposed a sentence of a non-parole period of 2 years with a balance of term of 1 year.  In resentencing the offender, this Court (at [28]) applied the discounts for the early guilty plea and assistance to the authorities, and the statutory ratio, in the same way as the sentencing judge.  This meant that arithmetically the starting point on resentence must have been 6 years.
72As the Crown correctly contended, there are many distinguishing features between the present case and Hill.  It is sufficient to mention a few of them.  These include:
(1)the offender in Hill was a given a 25% discount for his pleas, together with a 25% discount for past and present assistance, whereas here the applicant was given an 18% discount for his guilty pleas and the applicant gave no such assistance.  To the contrary, the applicant refused, when giving evidence on sentencing, to identify his supplier or his supplier's supplier (Tcpt 28, lines 29-50);
(2)in Hill the drug supply conduct related to four different occasions over a brief period of approximately one month.  This conduct was the subject of one combined charge of supply a prohibited drug not less than the large commercial quantity - MDA (1750.75g), contrary to s 25(2) of the DMT Act.  Here, the applicant's offending related to 14 different occasions over a period of four months involving three counts contrary to s 25(2) of the DMT Act, one count contrary to s 25(1) of the DMT Act, and 10 further matters (on the Form 1s), nine of which involved supply of prohibited drugs contrary to s 25(1) of the DMT Act;
(3)here the large commercial quantity of drugs involved on count 2 (2900g of MDA) significantly exceeded the large commercial quantity in Hill (1750.73g of MDA);
(4)the subjective features of the offender in Hill are also distinguishable from the present applicant.  In Hill the offender had no criminal record of any type and was in a long-term relationship, he had an established work history, he had not used any drugs since his arrest, his prospects of rehabilitation were found to be ""very good"", and there was a finding that he only became involved in the drug supply activities following threats made by others.  By contrast, the applicant commenced his drug dealing before any feeling of intimidation, his prospects of rehabilitation were assessed as ""good"", and his personal use of drugs had continued to some extent after the subject offences.  He had also been subsequently arrested on a drugs possession charge.  
73Whilst acknowledging that sentencing is not directed towards achieving numerical equivalence, counsel for the applicant sought to draw support from the resentencing by this Court of the offender in Hill for the conclusion that the applicant's aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive.  In my view little assistance is to be gained from Hill, having regard to the distinguishing features referred to above.  
Reliance on comparative cases
74The applicant also provided a table of comparative cases (between 2006 and 2013) involving the supply of not less than the large commercial quantity of prohibited drugs, which it was said may provide guidance to this Court.  None of these cases were otherwise elaborated upon in the applicant's written submissions.  It was not contended that this table was either comprehensive or complete.
75In oral submissions counsel for the applicant indicated that he did not propose to take the Court to any of the so-called comparative cases.  Thus the Court was left in the position that no submissions were made with respect to any of these cases.  The limitations of considering so-called comparative cases have been frequently remarked upon by this Court.  
76Most recently in MLP v R [2014] NSWCCA 183 at [41]-[44], Bellew J (Macfarlan JA and Adamson J agreeing) commented upon the difficulties which are prone to arise from comparative exercises based on a limited number of cases presented to the Court as demonstrating some established sentencing range for particular offences.  His Honour's observations bear repeating:
""41  Firstly, consistency in sentencing is not demonstrated by, and does not require, numerical equivalence. What is sought is consistency in the application of the relevant legal principles: Hili v R at [48]-[49]. 
42  Secondly, in seeking consistency, other cases may establish a range of sentences which have been imposed. But the sentences imposed in other cases do not mark the outer bounds of the permissible sentencing discretion. They stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence. What is important are the unifying principles which such sentences reveal and reflect: Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R [2014] HCA 2; 305 ALR 323 at [41]. 
43  Thirdly, the presentation of sentences passed in the form of numerical tables and graphs is of limited use: Hili (supra) at [48]. This is because reference to the lengths of sentences passed says nothing about why the sentences were fixed as they were.
44  Consistent with such statements of principle, this Court has emphasised the need to adopt a careful approach when asked to utilise statistics: R v Nikolovska [2010] NSWCCA 153 at [117] per Kirby J, Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) and Johnson J agreeing. A similarly careful approach is required when the Court is asked to compare a sentence imposed in one case with a sentence imposed in another: RLS v R [2012] NSWCCA 236 at [132] per Bellew J, McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J agreeing. The need to take care in each instance arises, in part, from the fundamental fact that there will inevitably be differences, both in terms of the objective circumstances of offending and the subjective circumstances of the offender, between one case and another."" 
77I have considered the cases to which the Court has been referred by the applicant in which sentences were imposed for drug supply offences involving the large commercial quantity.  The unstated premise of the applicant's reference to these cases seems to be that they demonstrate the harshness of the indicative sentence for count 2, and thus reveal error in the aggregate sentence reached.  
78In my view, these cases do not assist the applicant.  I do not propose to undertake an analysis of each of these cases.  It may be observed that the sentences imposed in a number of the cases referred to in the applicant's table exceeded the sentence imposed on the applicant whilst in others the sentence was lower.  The circumstances of the offending, and the subjective circumstances of each offender, revealed inevitable differences.  The applicant's reliance on these cases wrongly assumes that the wide variety of facts and degree in which the offending can occur readily yields a range.  
79It is sufficient to refer to one of these cases to demonstrate the limited assistance to be derived from these selected cases.  Naim v R (Naim) [2006] NSWCCA 289 involved two drug offences, one of which concerned the supply of the large commercial quantity of prohibited drugs - methylamphetamine (1.24kg).  The objective seriousness of this offending was found to be at the lower end of the range for such an offence.  It is not clear from the reasons in this Court whether there was a finding by the sentencing judge as to the objective seriousness of the second offence of possess a prohibited drug, contrary to s 25(1) of the DMT Act.  The offender was sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 years with a balance of term of 3 years.  An appeal against sentence was dismissed.  
80Whilst the finding as to the objective seriousness of the offending in Naim is similar to the present case, the extent of the offending in the present case was at a greater level in terms of quantities of drugs, the number of offences, and the relatively longer period over which the offences were committed.  On the other hand, the subjective circumstances of the offender in Naim were not as compelling as that of the applicant.  The offender there had prior convictions including a drug conviction and was on a s 9 bond at the time of commission of the relevant offences.  Nonetheless the offender in Naim received a longer non-parole period of 6 years compared to the applicant's non-parole period of 5 years.  On the whole, this case does not assist the applicant.  
Conclusion and orders
81I am not persuaded that the aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour falls outside the range of proper exercise of sentencing discretion in the circumstances of this case.  
82In my view, leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed.  I propose the following orders:
(1)Grant leave to appeal.
(2)Appeal dismissed.
83SCHMIDT J:  I agree with Gleeson JA.
84BELLEW J:  I agree with Gleeson JA.

2765318,R v Sward [2014] NSWCCA 259,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Davies J.
2R A HULME J: I agree with Davies J.

3DAVIES J: The Respondent pleaded guilty to a number of offences in respect of which he was sentenced by Acting Judge Williams in the District Court on 30 May 2014. The offences were these:

(1) Sequences 1 to 4: Sell pistol to person unauthorised to possess it. The maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of ten years.

(2) Sequences 6 and 9: Supply prohibited drug being ecstasy and amphetamine. The maximum penalty is 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units.

(3) Section 166 certificate: False representation resulting in a police investigation. The maximum penalty is 12 months imprisonment and/or a fine of 50 penalty units.

4In addition, there were four offences on a Form 1 attached to Sequence 1. There were two offences of supply a prohibited drug and two offences of agreement to supply a prohibited drug. These offences involved cannabis, ecstasy and amphetamine.

5Judge Williams sentenced him to an aggregate sentence being a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months with an additional term of 2 years, such sentence to commence from 9 October 2012. 

6The indicative sentences were:

Sequences 1 to 4: A non-parole period of 2 years and 5 months with an additional term of 2 years;

Sequences 6 and 9: A non-parole period of 1 year 5 months withan additional term of 1 year.

7The sentence for the offence on the s 166 certificate was 6 months imprisonment to commence 9 October 2012. 

8It should be noted at this point that in his Remarks on Sentence the Sentencing Judge said this:

For each of the firearms offences I would sentence him to four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two and a half years. For each of the supply offences I would sentence him to two and a half years with a non-parole period of one and a half years taking into account the Form 1 matters on the fifth offence. I propose to impose an aggregate sentence and a single non-parole period.

He is therefore convicted of each offence. He is sentenced to a minimum term of two and a half years imprisonment and an additional term of two years. (emphasis added)

9However, the Record of Proceedings signed by the Sentencing Judge provided as follows:

The offender is convicted. Sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment.

I set a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months to commence on 9 October 2012 and to expire on 8 April 2015.

The balance of the term is 2 years to commence on 9 April 2015 and to expire on 8 April 2017.

The individual sentences I would have imposed are as follows:

Sell a pistol to a person not authorised to possess it (seqs 1 - 4)

A non-parole period of 2 years 5 months and a balance of 1 years 6 months.

Form 1 taken into account pursuant to s 32 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: 

Supply a prohibited drug (seq 5)

Supply a prohibited drug (seq 7)

Agree to supply cannabis (seq 8)

Agree to supply amphetamine (seq 10)

Supply a prohibited drug x 2 (seqs 6 and 9)

A non-parole period of 1 year 5 months and a balance of 1 year.

Section 166 Certificate: False representation resulting in a police investigation: A fixed term of 6 months. (emphasis added)


10The parties agreed that the indicative sentences were as shown on the Record of Proceedings.

11It was neither necessary nor desirable for the Sentencing Judge to stipulate a non-parole period for the supply offences since they do not carry a standard non-parole period: s 44(2C) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). One of the purposes of aggregate sentencing was to simplify the sentencing process in cases of multiple offences. No purpose is served by setting non-parole periods or commencement dates for indicative sentences and s 44 relieves a court from the necessity to set a non-parole period for the indicative sentences except in the case of an offence for which a standard non-parole period is stipulated.

Facts concerning the offending

12In May 2012 the police attached to Strike Force Raptor commenced investigations in relation to the Respondent's involvement in the supply of prohibited drugs. During the course of this investigation, police lawfully intercepted the Respondent's mobile phone. On 22 June 2012 the Respondent was recorded negotiating the supply of an ounce (28g) of methylamphetamine and half an ounce of what the Respondent referred to as ""smokeable amphetamine"". That constituted the offence in Sequence 10 which was one of the Form 1 offences. 
13On 24 June 2012 an unnamed male was recorded contacting the Respondent and saying that he would attend at the Respondent's home that night. The Respondent supplied the unnamed male with 28g of methylamphetamine for the price of $1,800. That offence constituted Sequence 9 being one of the supply offences in respect of which the Respondent was sentenced.

14On 12 September 2012 the Respondent was recorded as agreeing to supply half an ounce of methylamphetamine for $1,400 and three pounds (1.36 kg) of cannabis for $3,200 per pound to an unnamed male. The transaction never occurred. Those matters constituted Sequences 7 and 8, both of which were dealt with by way of a Form 1. 

15On 19 September 2012 the Respondent came into possession of 50 pills of MDMA from an unidentified source. That offence constituted Sequence 6 which was the other supply offence for which the Respondent was sentenced.

16The following day, on 20 September 2012 the Respondent was recorded as negotiating the supply of ten MDMA pills to a person called Bagnall at the Campbelltown Bowling Club. Later that afternoon the Respondent met Bagnall and an exchange took place. That offence constituted Sequence 5 and was dealt with by way of the Form 1.

17Sometime between 15 and 17 September 2012 the Respondent agreed to supply four firearms, all handguns, of which the Respondent was the registered owner. These firearms were to be supplied to an unnamed male in exchange for the discharge of a drug debt of approximately $5,000 owed by the Respondent. These offences were Sequences 1 to 4.

18When the Respondent was interviewed in relation to the allegation of supplying firearms to persons unauthorised to possess them he first relayed a fictitious story that he had been to Adelaide to see his brother-in-law. He claimed that when he returned from Adelaide he noticed that his house had been broken into. He found that the safe which contained the firearms was missing from the wall. He contacted the police and the police attended shortly thereafter. 

19When confronted with evidence demonstrating that the guns could not have been stolen in the way he had claimed, the Respondent admitted to selling them to pay off a debt. He had incurred the debt by purchasing drugs. He had acquired the guns within the previous couple of months and had been given a specific list of what to purchase with the money provided to him. The police located the safe when executing a search warrant at Bagnall's home address in Campbelltown. The firearms were not within the safe. 

20Only one firearm has been recovered. The person in whose possession it was found was a member of an outlaw motorcycle gang.

21The false statement about the break in and the theft formed the basis of Sequence 11 which was the offence on the s 166 certificate. 

22When police executed the search warrant at the Respondent's home he made certain admissions regarding the drug supply. The police also found $10,000 in $50 denominations in a black bum bag which the Respondent said was money borrowed from a friend to pay a debt. Other items found were three mobile phones, various amounts of ammunition and a silver set of electronic scales. 

Subjective matters

23The Respondent was born on 4 August 1966 and is now aged 48 years. He commenced work at the age of 15 years and 9 months as a naval recruit. Thereafter he has had a variety of jobs as a storeman, sales supervisor, an installation representative, security guard, driver for Armouruard and then for 12 years or so he operated a franchise for Jim's Mowing and Landscape. 

24In 2011 he fell from a ladder and suffered an injury to his back. He was off work and unpaid for six months before finding work as a driver delivering perishables. He remained in that occupation until his arrest on 9 October 2012 when he went into custody. 

25He married in 1993 and at the time of sentence had two children aged 18 and 13. He and his wife separated in 2006 but they have remained on good terms. 

26For reasons which are said to relate to a mid-life crisis, the Respondent joined the Rebels Motorcycle Club in 2008 and became the President of the Sutherland Chapter. He said he did this because he enjoyed the mateship, going on bike rides, having a few beers and the camaraderie. 

27He claims not to have been involved in illicit drugs until 2011 when he injured his back. He was prescribed some opioid drugs but when those prescriptions ran out he was introduced to methamphetamine which he claimed assisted with his pain management. 

28He denied being a drug dealer but claimed simply to have arranged the supply of drugs for his partner who was a user, for friends and people that he rode with in the Club. He said he was not doing it to make money although he might make a small sum, perhaps $100, by way of a finder's fee. He claimed in his ERISP that he had been doing this for about a year. 

29The Respondent was seen by the psychologist, Tim Watson-Munro, who assessed him some nine months after he went into custody. He assessed him as suffering from Major Depression and an Anxiety Disorder and said that his Substance Abuse Disorder was in partial remission. Mr Watson-Munro said that the Respondent impressed as a genuine man and that impression in conjunction with his expressions of remorse and absence of prior forensic history suggested that with continuing treatment, supervision and support his prognosis was positive. The Sentencing Judge said that he agreed with that assessment.

30The Respondent had only one offence on his criminal record, that of a goods in custody conviction in 1985. 

31The Respondent claimed that he has been de-patched by the Rebels.

Grounds of appeal

32The Crown contended that the sentence was manifestly inadequate and relied upon the following grounds to support that contention.

Ground 1: The learned sentencing Judge erred by failing to assess the
objective seriousness of the offence;

Ground 2: The learned sentencing Judge erred by failing to impose a sentence that reflected the objective seriousness of the offence; 

Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in his approach to setting the aggregate sentences; 

Ground 4: The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to impose a sentence that properly reflected the Form 1 offences; 

Ground 5: The sentencing Judge erred in imposing a sentence in the related summary offence in accordance with section 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act; 

Ground 6: The learned sentencing judged failed to have regard to general deterrence in imposing the aggregate sentence and the aggregate non-parole period; and 

Ground 7: The sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.

Ground 1: The learned sentencing Judge erred by failing to assess the objective seriousness of the offence

Ground 2: The learned sentencing Judge erred by failing to impose a sentence that reflected the objective seriousness of the offence

Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in his approach to setting the aggregate sentences; 

Ground 4: The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to impose a sentence that properly reflected the Form 1 offences;

33The Sentencing Judge said, without distinguishing amongst the offences charged:

I would regard Mr Sward's offending, having regard to all the circumstances, as just below a mid-range of objective seriousness. 


34A little earlier in his Remarks the Sentencing Judge had said:

There can be little doubt that the community regards firearms offences as extremely serious matters, particularly where they are likely to be used in the commission of serious criminal activities. That applies particularly to handguns which are easily concealable but become lethal in the event of a conflict or a perceived insult or a threat or to carry out a criminal offence. It must have been realised by Mr Sward these weapons were not going to be used for any legitimate purpose and at best would constitute a threat to others or at worse fatally harmful.

35His Honour went on to say that the number of weapons involved could not be an aggravating factor for each offence, and the fact that there were four offences closely related in time and circumstance meant that the Court needed to consider the overall criminality particularly as it might affect accumulation and totality. His Honour accepted that the transaction was a one-off transaction. He did not consider the relevant considerations in Mack v R; Mack v R [2009] NSWCCA 216 at [40] applied to the case before him. 

36His Honour concluded by saying:

As far as the firearms offences are concerned I would impose a concurrent sentence, given that the offences occurred at the same time and that there is no objective or subjective difference between any of them. 

37The Respondent submitted that the Sentencing Judge was entitled to consider the objective seriousness of the firearm offences together and that it was open to his Honour to find that the objective seriousness of them was just below mid-range. The Respondent submitted that his Honour in fact referred to the relevant considerations in Mack v R.

38The Respondent submitted further that if the assessment that Mr Sward's offending was just below the mid-range of objective seriousness was a reference also to the drug offences, then it was appropriate given that the amounts of methamphetamine and cannabis were well below the commercial quantities for those drugs. Further, the criminality was correctly assessed in relation to the Respondent's addiction and his supplying of drugs to support his and his partner's habits. 

39The Respondent submitted that accumulation was within the discretion of the Sentencing Judge. Here, the four firearms had been sold at once. In that way the indicative sentence for each was sufficient to reflect the criminality of the offending. Further, given the background to the drug offences and the nature of the firearm offences it was open to his Honour to consider that the indicative sentences should be almost concurrent. In this regard, the Respondent drew attention to his Honour's finding that it was unlikely the Respondent would have become involved criminally with the Rebels had it not been for his partner's addiction to methamphetamine and his own back injury.

40In relation to the Form 1 matters the Respondent submitted that because of the overlap in the sentences for the drugs and firearms it made no difference to which offence the Form 1 related. Most of the matters on the Form 1 concerned agreement to supply only. In any event the two matters which a court takes into account with Form 1 offences, personal deterrence and retribution were not significant in this case. The Respondent had ceased using drugs and was remorseful. He was unlikely to reoffend. Finally, it was submitted that if error was found in relation to the Form 1 offences the error did not result in a sentence that is manifestly inadequate.

41The Crown submitted that the Sentencing Judge was required to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of each of the offences. The Crown said that a reading of the Judge's Remarks led to the conclusion that he made no assessment as to the Respondent's criminality in relation to his drug dealing other than to excuse it. 

42The remainder of the Crown's submissions concerning the objective seriousness of the firearms offences appeared to be directed not so much as a failure to assess the objective seriousness of the offences as a challenge to the assessment made. The submissions point out that the seriousness of the offending must have been greater because of the number of the weapons sold and the fact that the weapons were supplied to members of an outlaw motorcycle gang was an aggravating factor that should have been reflected in the sentence imposed. 

Consideration

43It does not seem to me that the Judge failed to assess the objective seriousness of the offences. If his assessment (set out at [33] above) was an assessment of the objective seriousness of both the firearms and the drug offences, such assessment was within his discretion and the appropriate range of assessment. Indeed, the Respondent accepts that the objective seriousness of the drug offences could be appropriately described as just below the mid-range of objective seriousness. 

44However, I accept the Crown's submission that the indicative sentences for the firearms offences do not properly reflect the objective seriousness of those offences. First, the imposition of four concurrent equal sentences for the supply of four firearms which were prohibited pistols does not take account of the additional criminality in the sale of four of them rather than just one. Further, it was an aggravating factor, not specifically referred to by the Sentencing Judge that the firearms were being sold to members of an outlaw motorcycle gang.

45The Sentencing Judge also failed to adjust the indicative sentence for the first firearms offence nor give consideration to doing so, by reason of the offences on the Form 1. That failure arose from a misapprehension on the Sentencing Judge's part. When indicating the indicative sentences he said that he would sentence the Respondent for the supply offences to two and a half years with a non-parole period of one and a half years ""taking into account the Form 1 matters on the fifth offence"". Counsel for the Crown drew his Honour's attention at the conclusion of the Judge's Remarks on Sentence to the fact that the Form 1 was attached to Sequence 1 being the first count of selling a pistol to a person unauthorised to possess it. 

46The Sentencing Judge then indicated that the Form 1 matters attached to Sequence 1. However, the Sentencing Judge did not then consider whether the sentence for Sequence 1 should be increased in accordance with the guideline judgment Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146. That judgment made clear that the two elements to be given greater weight when Form 1 offences are involved are personal deterrence and retribution. 

47Despite the Respondent's submission, personal deterrence was of some significance in this matter. The four offences on the Form1 were all offences of supply or agreement to supply prohibited drugs. The Respondent may have ceased using drugs but that is principally because he has been in custody since his arrest in October 2012. Although the Sentencing Judge found that the Respondent was unlikely to re-offend he also found that the Respondent would need a considerable amount of professional assistance both before and after his release to deal with drug and personal issues. 

48The Sentencing Judge made no reference to personal deterrence or retribution in his Remarks. Indeed, apart from identifying the offences on the Form 1 at the beginning of his Remarks his Honour said nothing more about that offending apart from the fact that the Form 1 offences were taken into account in indicating the sentences for the drug supply offences.

49In failing to adjust the indicative sentences for the number of weapons sold and by reason of the Form 1 offences, the Sentencing Judge has erred in the ways identified in grounds, 2, 3 and 4. 

Ground 5: The sentencing Judge erred in imposing a sentence in the related summary offence in accordance with section 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act

50The Crown submitted that the Sentencing Judge was required to deal with the offence on the s 166 certificate pursuant to the provisions of ss 166 to 168 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Those sections impose a maximum two year period of imprisonment. The Crown submitted that whilst the Sentencing Judge indicated a fixed term of six months for the s 166 offence because that offence was included in the aggregate sentence which exceeded two years, the restriction in s 168 Criminal Procedure Act, was exceeded. 

51Because of the insignificant role the sentence for the s 166 offence played in the sentencing process, this is not the appropriate case to determine whether an offence on the s 166 certificate can be included in an aggregate sentence that exceeds two years. In any event, there is some indication that the Sentencing Judge did not include this offence in the aggregate sentence. Having identified the indicative sentences for the firearm offences and the supply offences his Honour proceeded to impose an aggregate sentence. He then noted the date the Respondent would be eligible for parole and the period of the additional term and added:

In regards to the s 166 certificate he is sentenced to six months imprisonment to date from 9 October 2012. 

52It seems to me that the better view of his Honour's approach is that he was not including the s 166 offence within the aggregate sentence. However, if an error was made, it does not go to the manifest inadequacy of the sentences imposed.

53This ground fails.

Ground 6: The learned sentencing judged failed to have regard to general deterrence in imposing the aggregate sentence and the aggregate non-parole period

Ground 7: The sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate

54The Crown submitted that the Sentencing Judge made no reference to the importance of general deterrence in relation either to the firearm offences or drug supply offences. It submitted that the aggregate sentence imposed does not reflect the importance of general deterrence particularly in the firearms offences.

55The Crown further submitted that it is clear from the indicative sentences and the aggregate sentence imposed that the Sentencing Judge did not have sufficient regard either to the maximum penalty or the standard non-parole period as legislative guideposts. The Crown submitted that too much weight was given to the Respondent's good character and subjective considerations. 

56The Crown accepted that the Sentencing Judge had material available to him to enable a finding of special circumstances but submitted that the finding of special circumstances did not permit a court to reduce a non-parole period below that which was necessary to reflect the purposes of sentencing. In the present case the reduction of the statutory ratio to 55% was not appropriate to the offending.

57The Respondent submitted that whilst the Sentencing Judge did not refer specifically to general deterrence in his Remarks on Sentence he did not disregard it. The Respondent pointed in particular to the passage in the Remarks which is set out at [33] above. 

58The Respondent drew attention to the harsh custodial conditions he had endured when he was placed in strict protection from March 2013 to January 2014. That was a matter taken into account by the Sentencing Judge. The Respondent submitted further that the Sentencing Judge was entitled to place some weight on the material in Mr Watson-Munro's report and in the fact that the Respondent was genuinely remorseful and unlikely to re-offend.

59The Respondent submitted that his Honour's approach appeared to be a consideration of totality when identifying the indicative sentences although the Respondent acknowledged that that was contrary to what Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 requires. . 

Consideration
60The effect of the indicative sentences is that his Honour accumulated the supply offences by only a non-parole period of 1 month and an additional term of 6 months. Although the need for the sale of the weapons by the Respondent arose from a drug debt he had accumulated, there was no other connection between his legal possession of the weapons and their sale on the one hand and the continuing supply of drugs by him on the other. A greater accumulation was indicated with the result that the aggregate sentence should have been increased.

61In circumstances where the maximum penalty for the firearms offences was 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years, and the maximum penalty for the supply offences was 15 years, it is difficult to see how the Sentencing Judge has used those guideposts in reaching the sentence that he ultimately imposed. 

62It may be accepted that the Respondent was himself a user of drugs, as was his partner, and that he was not a high level supplier. Nevertheless, the supply offences must be seen in the light of his admission that he had been dealing for a year, that multiple drugs were involved and that other objects found when his house was searched indicated a regular involvement in the supply of drugs.

63Whilst acknowledging the subjective matters in the Respondent's favour, it cannot be overlooked that it was by reason of his good character that he was able to access legitimately the weapons he ultimately on-sold to a person that he knew was a member of an outlaw motorcycle gang. Three of those weapons are still at large within the criminal community.

64In my opinion, the aggregate sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. It was below the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offences consistently with sentencing standards.

Crown appeals and the residual discretion
65The Respondent submitted that if the Court finds that the sentence is manifestly inadequate, the residual discretion not to intervene should be exercised. The Respondent points to the fact that he has served more than two years of his two and a half year non-parole period. The appeal is affecting his application for C3 classification which would allow him to do work release. He had not previously offended and he is participating in the recovery program for his addictive behaviour. He pointed also to his continuing suffering from depression and anxiety. He said that he is still concerned for his safety in prison from members of outlaw motorcycle groups. 

66In my opinion, the residual discretion should not be exercised to dismiss the Crown appeal. Nothing in the conduct of the Crown would justify the exercise of the discretion against increasing the sentence. The appeal was brought promptly. Most of the time served occurred before the Respondent was sentenced.

67The prevalence of firearms in the criminal community and amongst outlaw motorcycle groups continues to be of considerable concern in the community. It is necessary for this Court to emphasise the seriousness of firearms offences including those with which the Respondent was convicted. This Court needs to stress that when sentencing for these offences judges should have due regard to the guideposts of the maximum penalty and any standard non-parole period provided. Both general and specific deterrence are significant considerations for these offences. 

68The manifest inadequacy in the present case has been magnified by the knowledge of the Respondent that the guns were being purchased by a member of an outlaw motorcycle gang. 

Re-sentence

69There were tendered on the Respondent's behalf two affidavits. The first was by the Respondent himself sworn 17 October 2014 and the second by his solicitor sworn 21 October 2014. The solicitor's affidavit annexed a Certificate of Appreciation by Corrective Services for his assistance and support with Dawn De Loas's 2014 NAIDOC event. The second was a transcript of his academic record with Western Sydney TAFE being an introductory certificate in Access to Work and Training. 

70The affidavit of the Respondent provided information on the time he spent in protection as well as the limitations on telephone and other access to friends and family. He referred to the fact that he was taking Avanza for depression, to the continuing fear he has for his safety and to the extra stress arising from this appeal.

71Bearing in mind this further material, I propose the following sentence: a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing 9 October 2012 and expiring 8 April 2017 with an additional term of 2 years 6 months expiring 8 October 2019.

72The indicative sentences are these:

Sequence 1 and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 - a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months with an additional term of 1 year 9 months;

Sequences 2, 3 and 4 - a non-parole period of 3 years with an additional term of 1 year 6 months for each offence;

Sequences 6 and 9 - an indicative term of 4 years for each offence;

S 166 certificate: 6 months imprisonment commencing 9 October 2012.
73I would find special circumstances by reason of his custodial arrangements and his need for ongoing rehabilitation with drug issues.

Conclusion

74I propose the following orders:

1. Uphold Crown appeal;

2. Quash the aggregate sentence imposed by Acting Judge Williams on 30 May 2014;

3. In lieu on Sequences 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 9 and taking into account the offences on a Form 1, the Respondent is sentenced to an aggregate sentence consisting of a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 9 October 2012 and expiring 8 April 2017 with an additional term of 2 years 6 months expiring 8 October 2019.

4. In respect of the offence on the s 166 certificate, confirm the sentence of 6 months imprisonment commencing 9 October 2012.

		14 November 2014",2014-11-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765333,Madden v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 291,"Judgment
1THE COURT:  Christopher Madden was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment alleging two counts of dealing with property that subsequently became an instrument of crime, contrary to s 193D(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.  By notice of motion filed 17 June 2014, an application was made to have the indictment permanently stayed.  During the hearing of the motion, the application was varied orally so as to seek an order quashing count 2 on the basis that ""it does not make out an offence known to law"".
2The application was heard by Syme DCJ on 7 July 2014 and determined on 14 July 2014.  Her Honour granted the application in respect of count 1 but dismissed the application to quash count 2.
3On 20 November 2014, the Court dismissed an application under s 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 for leave to appeal against that part of the judgment refusing the application, reserving our reasons.  These are our reasons for refusing leave.  
4Section 193D(1) of the Crimes Act provides:
""If: (a) a person deals with property intending that the property will become an instrument of crime, and
(b) the property subsequently becomes an instrument of crime,
the person is guilty of an offence.""
The offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years.
""Property"" is defined in s 193D(5) as follows:
""Property"" means money or other valuables.
5The charges against the applicant arose out of the shooting murder of Darko Janceski in April 2012.  The Crown case is that the deceased was shot three times by a male riding a blue Yamaha motorcycle.  Matthew Wiggins has been charged with the deceased's murder.
6The Crown alleges that the applicant purchased the motorcycle for use by Wiggins in the murder.  The motorcycle was purchased with cash.  The cash transaction was the subject of count 1 on the indictment, which is the count that has been permanently stayed by Judge Syme.  The Crown has not challenged that part of her Honour's judgment.
7The Crown case in respect of count 2 is summarised in the Crown case statement as follows:
""Further, on the 28 March 2012 or at some other time before the shooting (14 April 2012) the accused dealt with the motorcycle such that it came into the possession of Wiggins.  At the time that the accused dealt with the motorcycle he intended that it would become an instrument of crime and it subsequently became an instrument of crime.""
8The issue raised by the application for leave to appeal is whether a motorcycle is capable of being ""property"" within the meaning of s 193D (""money or other valuables"").  Mr Lange, who appears for the applicant, noted that the expression ""other valuables"" is not defined in the legislation and is not the subject of any relevant authority.  In that circumstance, he turned to the Oxford English Dictionary, which defines the word ""valuable"", when used as a noun, as follows:
""A valuable article or thing; Esp. a small item of personal property.  Usu. in pl.""
9Mr Lange submitted that, as reflected in that dictionary definition, the term ""valuables"" is used in common parlance to mean ""a small item of personal property"".  The burden of the submission was that a motorcycle is not capable of meeting the definition of ""other valuables"" because it is not a small item of personal property.
10Apart from resort to the dictionary, the applicant put forward two principal reasons for construing the term ""valuables"" in a narrower sense than contended for by the Crown.  First, it was noted that, at the time s 193D was enacted, the different expression ""valuable thing"" was used in a number of offence provisions in the Crimes Act.  For example, the offence of ""obtaining money etc by deception"" contrary to s 178BA(1) provided:
""Whosever by any deception dishonestly obtains for himself or herself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever shall be liable to imprisonment for five years.""
11The offences of ""being an agent obtaining advances on the property of a principal"" contrary to s 170; ""obtaining money etc by false or misleading statements"" contrary to s 178BB and ""obtaining money etc by wilfully false representation"" contrary to s 527A similarly included the expression ""valuable thing"" (each of those sections has now been repealed but they were in force at the time s 193D came into force).  Mr Lange submitted that the legislature must accordingly have intended, in deliberately choosing a different expression to define the term ""property"" in s 193D(5), that a different meaning should be given to that expression.
12Secondly, Mr Lange noted that the 2005 amendments (the Confiscation of Proceedings of Crime Amendment Act 2005) were passed against the background of cognate Commonwealth legislation.  The offences in the Commonwealth Act are in similar terms but the definition of property is much broader.
13Section 400.1(2) of the Criminal Code (C'th)1995 defined property as meaning ""real or personal property of every description, whether situated in Australia or elsewhere and whether tangible or intangible, and includes an interest in any such real or personal property"".  Subsection (2) expanded this definition by providing, ""To avoid doubt, a reference in this Division to money or other property includes a reference to financial instruments, cards and other objects that represent money or can be exchanged for money, whether or not they have intrinsic value.""  
14Mr Lange submitted that, since the New South Wales legislature did not adopt the Commonwealth approach, it may be inferred that the definition under the New South Wales Act was deliberately narrower.
15Finally, Mr Lange noted that, when construing a penal statute, any ambiguity must be resolved against the imposition of criminal liability:  Murphy v Farmer [1988] HCA 31; (1988) 165 CLR 19 at 29 per Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ.
16Essentially the same arguments were put and rejected in the Court below.  The judge said:
""[23] The applicant submits that the restricted definition of property restricts the meaning that can be given to the phrase ""money or other valuables"". They also argue and point to the observation in Milne's case the Full Court observed that ""purposive construction"" does not justify expanding the scope of a criminal offence beyond its textual limits.
[24] This is an appealing argument but requires an acceptance of the term ""valuables"" as being confined to a small item of personal property.  While the dictionary definition includes this as an example in common usage, this is by way of example only, and nowhere is it suggested that there is a size limit on an item of value, only that an item is capable of being valued.  This is demonstrably true of the motorbike in question.
[25] I accept without question the observation of the High Court in Milne's case that in the absence of other assistance, interpretation of words should take into account the ordinary meaning of the words without resort to extended meanings.  By the same token there should not be unnecessary and artificial restriction in the interpretation based on an antiquated understanding of language.  If the legislature meant that valuables were confined to items of a particular size or weight or value they would have said so.  No doubt they had this in mind when they decided to place a different definition on property when they drafted s 193.""
17As correctly noted by her Honour, there is nothing in the legislation to suggest that the words of the section are to be read down so as to impose a size limit on the kind of item that may be the subject of a charge under s 193D.  The difficulty with the applicant's argument is that, even if parliament intended that the term ""other valuables"" should have some meaning different from the term ""valuable thing"", there is no suggestion that the size of the thing matters.  To construe the section in that way could lead to absurd results.     
18The Court was accordingly of the view that the application did not disclose sufficient prospects of success to warrant a grant of leave.  For those reasons, leave was refused.

		03 December 2014",2014-11-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765335,JB - Application for inquiry into conviction pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal & Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 1714,"DECISION
1R A HULME J:  An application has been made pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) for an inquiry into the conviction of JB (the applicant) for murder.  He seeks referral of the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) pursuant to s 79(1)(b).  
2JB cannot be named because he was a child at the relevant time: s 15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW).
3JB was found guilty by a jury on 10 September 2009 of the murder of Edward Spowart in the early hours of 21 April 2008.  He was unsuccessful in appealing against his conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal: JB v R [2012] NSWCCA 12; 83 NSWLR 153.  He was unsuccessful in seeking special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia: JB v The Queen [2013] HCATrans 28.
4The statutory and procedural aspects attending an application under Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act were conveniently set out in detail by Johnson J in Application of Peter James Holland under s.78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 at [2]-[19].
5The present application is based upon material discovered subsequent to the exhaustion of the avenues of appeal (""the material"").  It relates to the evidence of an important prosecution witness in the applicant's trial; raises questions about compliance with the prosecution's duty of disclosure; and raises questions about whether the applicant's solicitor at trial, and on appeal had a conflict of interest.
6The application was supported by detailed written submissions by Mr Tim Game SC and Ms G Bashir SC filed on 8 August 2014.  The Attorney General has provided written submissions in reply prepared by the Crown Advocate, Ms N Adams SC, and Ms A Bonnor filed on 4 September 2014.  The matter was referred to me for consideration on 13 November 2014.
7There is no need to review in any detail the evidence in the trial or the manner in which the Crown and defence cases were put.  It is sufficient to say that a significant aspect of the Crown case was the contention that the applicant made admissions at a police station following his arrest.  The admissions were said to have been made to a support person, Shawn Clayton, who was present because the applicant was a vulnerable person because of his age (he was 15).  The Crown relied upon other aspects arising from the evidence but its case was put to the jury on the basis that a verdict of guilty could be returned on the evidence of the alleged admission alone.
8The Attorney General concedes there should be a referral.  The written submissions succinctly set out three broad issues revealed by the material:
[Quotation from paragraphs five to eight of Attorney General's written submissions redacted]

9As the written submissions make clear, within each of those issues there are quite a number of subsidiary issues.  I have come to the view that the matter should be determined with some urgency in the light of further submissions that were filed by senior counsel for the applicant on 5 September 2014.  Accordingly I do not propose to provide detailed reasons which are not generally required in relation to this administrative task and certainly not in this case where there is no controversy as to the outcome.
10I confirm that I have read and considered the entirety of the material provided in support of the application.  There are a number of questions about the integrity of the trial process that led to the jury's verdict. I am left with a sense of unease or disquiet about the applicant's conviction.
11I refer the whole of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.

		02 December 2014",2014-11-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765336,R v Peridot [2014] NSWDC 261,"Judgment


	
	Samuel Peridot faces two charges brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Director accuses him of assaulting his wife, Lisa Peridot, on 21 or 22 August 2013. The assault was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, it is claimed. The second charge is one of sexual intercourse with Lisa Peridot without her consent knowing that she was not consenting. The Director says that occurred on 16Â October 2013.
	
	
	Mr S Hughes of Counsel, the Crown Prosecutor, is proposing to tender four pieces of evidence against Mr Peridot. All of that evidence will come from his primary witness, the alleged victim Lisa Peridot. Mr A Miller of Counsel, who appears for Mr Peridot, objects to those four pieces of evidence.
	
	
	I should say briefly what they are. The first piece of evidence concerns an earlier occasion when the couple were having consensual sexual intercourse. I should add that they had known each other since 2004 and were married in 2009 and a son was born to them in 2012. The first incident was said to have occurred in 2007. During the consensual intercourse Lisa Peridot says that Mr Peridot slapped her repeatedly on her face and that she had to cry out, âStop, stop, stopâ. She added information about his behaviour during their consensual sexual encounters as being ârough, but not aggressiveâ.
	
	
	The second piece of evidence concerns Lisa Peridotâs observations about MrÂ Peridotâ behaviour since 2011. She says that she noticed a âbehavioural patternâ. She described it as Samuel Peridot becoming âvery aggressive during our sexual experiencesâ after they have had an argument. She says that he âwill become very rough and not take the fact that he is hurting me into account at allâ.
	
	
	In the third piece of evidence Lisa Peridot claimed that in 2013 she and Mr Peridot were arguing over a new phone that she had been given. She said that he âtook this phone forcibly from my handâ and held it over a jug of water. He then poured water over her side of the bed and made her sleep in it, followed by confiscating the phone.
	
	
	The fourth piece of evidence also comes from Lisa Peridot. She claimed that Samuel Peridot threw a bedside lamp at her after she said something which annoyed him. It did not hit her.
	
	
	Mr Miller argues that all of those pieces of evidence should be rejected because their âprobative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudiceâ to his client under sÂ 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. He argues that the slapping incident during sexual intercourse around 2007 was some six years before the alleged happening of the events contained in the indictment. It occurred before they were married. There is no suggestion that it recurred and its probative value is slight for an event which occurred in 2013.
	
	
	In respect of the second piece of evidence he argues that it is in general and unspecific terms, thereby limiting again its probative value.
	
	
	In respect of the third and fourth pieces of evidence MrÂ Miller argues that they are claimed examples of intimidation, not of physical violence. They are therefore different in nature to the allegations in the indictment.
	
	
	All of the evidence, he argues, lacks probative value but would be unfairly prejudicial to his client and lead the jury to a process of reasoning whereby the jury might conclude that his client has a propensity to violence. He makes this submission because the evidence is not tendered as tendency evidence therefore its use in that way would be impermissible and, indeed, unfairly prejudicial to his client.
	
	
	Mr Hughes responds that it is important to focus on the purpose of the tender of the evidence. It is tendered to put the events which are claimed to amount to the counts in the indictment into their proper context, which includes the history of the relationship between the complainant and the accused. He argues that the purpose of the tender will be made clear to the jury, including how it is not to be used. Directions that I might give will make it clear that it is not tendered as tendency evidence. He argues that it is especially important in this case.
	
	
	The claimed sexual assault, according to the complainant, occurred during the course of an episode of sexual encounter which lasted over some three hours. Mr Hughes points out that the jury may well be inclined to the view that the complainant must have consented if the encounter lasted as long as that. Tendering the evidence of the three previous incidents, including a sexual encounter, will help to explain why, on the prosecution case, the encounter might have lasted that long, despite her claim that she withdrew her consent at some stage. It will help to explain, he argued, why the complainant behaved as she did. In addition, after the claimed sexual assault, Ms Peridot did not make any formal complaint for some two days. The evidence concerning the history of the relationship between her and Mr Peridot will assist in explaining why there may have been that delay.
	
	
	In response to Mr Millerâs criticism of the nature of the intimidation claims being different to actual violence Mr Hughes argues that to the mind of MsÂ Peridot that distinction may be lost. The point is that she was in a relationship which, on her account, involved intimidation and physical violence being perpetrated on her on specific occasions by Mr Peridot.
	
	
	In response to Mr Millerâs argument that the 2007 incident is too remote in time, Mr Hughes argued that it goes to prove a longstanding and entrenched behaviour relating to intimidation. In addition, if that evidence is not led then the alleged assault occasioning actual bodily harm and the alleged sexual assault may be considered to be inexplicable by the jury. They may appropriately consider that they were isolated events which would not reflect the complainantâs account that there had been previous episodes of physical violence and intimidation within the context of sexual relations, as well as not in the context of sexual relations.
	
	
	Subject to one exception, to my mind the probative value of the first, third and fourth pieces of evidence which Mr Hughes proposes to tender is very high for the reasons that he has given. The potential unfair prejudice would be appropriately dealt with by the basis of the tender being made clear to the jury by Mr Hughes and by directions from me, making the distinction clear. The High Court of Australia has made it clear that criminal trials operate on the assumption that juries will follow and comply with directions given by a trial judge.
	
	
	The exception I have referred to is the second piece of evidence which MrÂ Hughes proposes to tender. It is contained in para 12 of exhibitÂ VD B. To my mind Mr Miller has a point that the present terms of that proposed evidence is fairly general. I think that it is so general that its probative value, compared to the other pieces of evidence, is at present too low. When I say it is too low I would regard it as too low to warrant admission into evidence given that it will have inevitably some prejudicial effect, although that may not be unfair.
	
	
	I have invited Mr Hughes to obtain more particulars from Ms Peridot about the contents of that paragraph and supply those to Mr Miller. If need be I will rule on any objection Mr Miller makes but if the particulars are more specific than the present paragraph in the statement then I would regard the probative value of evidence to that effect as increased sufficiently for me not to reject it.
	
	
	Mr Miller has made an application in the interests of his client for me to order a separate trial in respect of each of the counts.
	
	
	As I said there are two charges in the indictment. The first is an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Ms Peridot says that that occurred late on 21 or early 22 August 2013. The baby woke up. They were both in the babyâs room. Mr Peridot apparently intended to sleep on the floor in that room. Ms Peridot pushed the door closed, with him outside. She goes on to say this -
	


âSamuel must have been walking towards the door at the time, as at that point the bedroom door burst open. Samuel then placed both of his hands around my neck in a strangle position where his arms were out straight and his hands were around my neck with his thumbs placed on the front of my throat. Samuel was using his momentum to drive me across the room with his hands still around my throat.â

Ms Peridot said she was driven back onto the babyâs cot. She got out of the room and got hold of her mobile phone to call the police. MsÂ Peridot got to the phone first. She was trying to unlock it when, she said -

âSamuel grabbed a hold of my wrist. I then began to struggle with Samuel over the phone. I canât recall how, but during the struggle with Samuel, I had a chunk of skin taken from my thumb. Samuel twisted my arm whilst he was still tightly holding onto my wrist. It was in the position of a police wrist lock. I felt immediate pain in my wrist and I felt Samuel prying the phone from my hand.â


	
	The allegation of sexual intercourse without consent knowing that MsÂ Peridot was not consenting is said to have occurred some seven weeks later, on 16 October 2013. They both went to bed on that evening and - I infer from exhibit VD B, a statement by Ms Peridot - that they commenced to engage in sex consensually. At one stage whilst he was lying on top of her and she was lying on her back, she says that âSamuel grabbed my legs and pushed them up. My legs were almost straight.â She describes herself as âpretty much bent in halfâ. She said that he âthrust his erect penis into my vagina with such force as to hurt meâ. It âcaused severe sharp pain in both my vagina as well as my internal abdomen areaâ. She said that he carried on for some minutes. She said that she âwas in so much pain that I began to plead with him. I was crying and there was mucous running from my nose and down my faceâ. She said she could not move. She said that during âmy pleadingâ Samuel just said âShh Shhâ as well as âShut upâ. She said she was pinned down by him and could not move. She said she was in âa lot of pain and I was afraid at this timeâ. She said that she let out a series of involuntary single âyelpsâ, but âSamuel seemed not to care and just kept on thrusting his penis into my vaginaâ. She said the incident lasted about three hours.
	
	
	Mr Miller argues that his client would be prejudiced or embarrassed in his defence by reason of the fact that he is charged with these two offences in the same indictment and that I should order a separate trial for each of the counts in the indictment. He relies on sÂ 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	On the other hand Mr Hughes, relying on sÂ 29 of the same Act, argues that the two offences âarise out of the same set of circumstancesâ or, alternatively, that âthe offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar characterâ.
	
	
	Mr Miller points out that, despite that provision, I may not hear the two offences together if I am âof the opinion that the matters ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justiceâ. Again Mr Miller points to what he says is a contrast between the two alleged offences. The assault occasioning actual bodily harm is an allegation of an unprovoked physical attack clearly without consent, whereas the sexual offence charge seems to involve consensual sex initially but developing into non-consensual sex with knowledge claimed on the part of his client. He acknowledges that both can be classified as domestic violence, but he argues that they are not of a similar character. Although they may have occurred in the same place, the home of Mr and Ms Peridot, they are not the same type of offence.
	
	
	Again Mr Miller urges that the risk of hearing the cases together is that the jury may use evidence about the assault occasioning actual bodily harm to reach a view about his client which they may improperly use in considering the other offence. He points to the prejudice that his client may experience in his helpful written submissions in para 8 of MFI 1.
	
	
	Mr Hughes points to the law about juries following directions of trial judges. He argues that the events are not far apart in time - being about sevenÂ weeks - and that they both involve claimed domestic violence and occurred in the same context, namely between a husband and wife in the matrimonial home. He argues that the evidence of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm would also be admissible on the sexual assault count on the same basis as the other pieces of evidence I earlier referred to. It provides a context in which the claimed assault occurred and points to the history of the relationship between the parties. They may explain aspects of the behaviour of MsÂ Peridot.
	
	
	I am not of the opinion that Mr Peridot would be prejudiced or embarrassed in his defence by reason of being charged with both offences in the same indictment. The basis of that is the clear distinction between the two events, but the relevance of the first event to the second event in the way I have described. The only sort of prejudice or embarrassment may be impermissible reasoning which the jury may embark upon based upon the factors outlined by Mr Miller in para 8 of his written submissions. To my mind careful and clear directions about the use that the evidence may be put to, and may not be put to, will avoid any such prejudice or embarrassment.
	
	
	I am also of the opinion that the two alleged offences are part of a series of offences of a similar character. They are similar in that they both involve alleged physical violence in a domestic context between a married couple in the matrimonial home.
	
	
	For those reasons I reject Mr Millerâs application for me to order a separate trial in respect of the two counts.
	
	
	Finally Mr Miller has sought leave to cross-examine the complainant, MsÂ Peridot, about two occasions of consensual sexual intercourse which occurred the night before and the night after the claimed sexual assault. He points out, in his helpful written submissions (MFI 2) about this specific aspect, that there will be evidence from a medical practitioner who examined Ms Peridot and found no abnormality on genital examination. He argues that the three occasions of sexual intercourse - the night before, the night after and the night in the middle where the assault is said to have occurred - are âhighly relevant in relation to seeking an opinionâ from the medical practitioner.
	
	
	However, s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act stands in his way because evidence disclosing that the complainant may have taken part in other sexual activity is inadmissible. Mr Miller asks me to form the opinion that the inadmissibility provision does not apply because under s 293(4)(a) the evidence which he proposes to lead would be of sexual activity between his client and the complainant Ms Peridot âat or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offenceâ and âis of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committedâ. I think Mr Miller is right in that submission.
	
	
	The probative value of the proposed cross-examination about other sexual activity around the time of the alleged assault is high. But it needs to be so high that it will outweigh any âdistress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission.â Mr Miller addresses that, pointing out correctly that Ms Peridotâ statements include a good amount of detail of the sexual relations between her and his client. I think in that context any distress, humiliation or embarrassment arising from cross-examination about the other episodes would not outweigh the high probative value which Mr Miller expects to obtain from the cross-examination. In addition, I accept Mr Millerâs argument that the prosecution case itself will include evidence about sexual activity between Mr and Ms Peridot. I have already given an example and Mr Miller argues that his client âmight be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implicationâ.
	
	
	For that reason it seems to me that Mr Miller should have leave to cross-examine Ms Peridot in relation to any activity specifically led in evidence by the prosecution. That is in addition to the permission to cross-examine about the sexual activity the nights before and after the claimed sexual assault.
	
	
	I also need to give leave to Mr Hughes to lead evidence from MsÂ Peridot regarding the sexual relationship between her and the accused, Mr Peridot. I propose to grant that leave under s 293(4)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act because it ârelates to relationship that was existing or recent at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, being a relationship between the accused person and the complainant.â
	
	
	In accordance with s 293(8) of the Criminal Procedure Act the nature and scope of the evidence admissible is that contained in VD B and VD C which are statements by Ms Peridot. I would permit that to be supplemented by further particulars provided in respect of para 12 of exhibit VD B and it would also include cross-examination by Mr Miller of any sexual encounter between his client and Ms Peridot on 15 and 17 October 2013.

		12 February 2015",2014-11-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765352,Adam v R [2014] NSWCCA 265,"Judgment
1MEAGHER JA: I agree with Schmidt J.
2FULLERTON J: I agree with Schmidt J.  
3SCHMIDT J:  The applicant, Richard Adam, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Madgwick ADCJ on 20 February 2014 as being manifestly excessive.  
4The applicant had pleaded guilty to two offences under s 52AB (1) and (2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), of failing to stop and assist after a vehicle impact, committed on 2 April 2011.  That impact caused the death of Mr Quang Mai and grievous bodily harm to Mr Liem Thanh Le.  
5After a 25% discount for his plea, a total aggregate sentence of 32 months was imposed on the applicant, with a non-parole period of 20 months and an additional term of 12 months.  The maximum penalty for the s 52AB(1) offence was 10 years imprisonment and for the s 52AB(2) offence, 7 years.
Grounds of appeal
6The one ground of appeal pressed was:
""The sentence imposed by the Sentencing Judge was manifestly excessive having regard to the following matters:(a) That given the circumstances under which the applicant fell to be sentenced he failed to take into account as a matter in mitigation that the s 52AB charges could have been dealt with summarily.(b) By taking into account that the applicant had avoided prosecution for negligent driving occasioning death as a relevant sentencing factor.(c) By taking into account negligent driving causing death as part of the applicant's criminality for the s 52AB offence.(d) That no distinction was to be drawn in terms of assessment of objective seriousness of an offence under s 52AB where the nature of the driving involved negligent rather than dangerous driving.""

7To make out his case the applicant had to show that his sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust (see Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [3] and [22], discussed Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33] and Sheen v R [2011] NSWCCA 259; 215 A Crim R 208 at [162]).  For the reasons which follow, I am of the view that while the applicant must be given leave to appeal, his appeal must be dismissed because he has not shown that the sentence is either unreasonable or plainly unjust. 
The agreed facts and other evidence
8The applicant was initially charged with the two s 52AB offences for which he was sentenced, as well as two offences under s 52A, one of dangerous driving occasioning death and the other of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm.  He was granted bail and pleaded guilty to the s 52AB offences in the Local Court in April 2013, having indicated that plea in February on the basis that the dangerous driving charges would be withdrawn.  They were, in fact, committed for trial in the District Court, but were later withdrawn in September 2013, after a statement of facts was agreed in relation to the s 52AB offences.  It was there agreed that the applicant's driving had been negligent, but no further charges were laid in relation to his driving.
9The two s 52AB offences were concerned with the impact which occurred on 2 April 2011, when the applicant failed to stop and render assistance.  The applicant was then driving north in a street at Fairfield at about 11.30pm.  The speed limit was 60km per hour.  Witnesses described his vehicle to have been travelling at well over the speed limit.  Expert examination by Mr Lennon, a physicist specialising in collision reconstruction, determined that the likely speed of the applicant's vehicle was within the middle of the range of 73km to 97km per hour.    
10Another vehicle in which Mr Quang Mai and Mr Liem Thanh Le were then travelling together with the driver and another passenger, had stopped at a T-intersection and then turned left.  That vehicle had almost completed its turn when the front passenger side of the car which the applicant was driving, collided with the rear driver's side of the turning vehicle.  The force of the impact pushed the turning vehicle forward, causing it to spin, with the result that it mounted the kerb and collided with a tree and a low brick fence.  It stopped nearly 40 metres from the collision site.  The vehicle was severely damaged, Mr Liem Thanh Le was critically injured and Mr Quang Mai was killed.
11As the result of the impact, the applicant's vehicle crossed onto the wrong side of the street and came to rest some 35 metres from the collision point.  The applicant got out of his vehicle and left the scene without rendering aid to any of the four occupants in the other car.  When police and emergency services attended, they found the driver's door of his car open, the engine running, loud music playing, front airbags deployed and blood on the front console.  That blood was later analysed and found to be the applicant's blood.  There was insufficient blood for drug or alcohol analysis to be undertaken.  The applicant's mobile phone was found on the driver's seat.  It had not been used to make or receive calls around the time of the collision.
12Police shortly afterwards made contact with the registered owner of the vehicle, the applicant's mother, who lived nearby.   She and the applicant's wife conveyed to them that the vehicle had been taken by a stranger, who had threatened the mother and taken the car without her consent.
13The applicant only approached police on the morning of 6 April, when he was arrested and taken to Liverpool Hospital for treatment.  He was then found to be suffering injuries consistent with his head having struck the windscreen of a vehicle.
14It was agreed that the applicant caused the collision by driving at a speed of between 73km and 97km per hour and failing to keep a proper lookout; that the driver of the other vehicle did not cause or contribute to the collision; that the applicant's driving in the circumstances was negligent; and that the Crown could not prove that his driving was dangerous in the circumstances.
15The applicant gave evidence on sentencing to explain why he had left the scene of the accident.  His Honour did not accept his account, which was to the effect that he had disturbed someone at his mother's house, who he believed had killed his mother; that he had followed that person in the car; that he had gone to his brother's house in a confused state after the accident; and that on the following day, he had approached a solicitor, who was interstate and who had advised him not to approach police until his return.  The hearing was adjourned to give the applicant the opportunity to call corroborative evidence from the solicitor.  The solicitor was not called at the adjourned hearing.
The applicant's case on appeal 
16At the sentencing hearing the Crown had conceded that the prosecution could not establish the dangerous driving offences with which the applicant had been charged.  He had never been charged with negligent driving offences, although it was an agreed fact that his driving had been negligent.  The Crown submitted that in the result, there would be no error in his Honour taking into account the negligent driving as part of the applicant's criminality.  The applicant took no issue with that submission.  
17On appeal, however, the applicant's case was that his Honour had erred in taking negligent driving into account in sentencing him and further that his Honour had also erred in not taking into account that if he had been charged with an offence of negligent driving occasioning death/grievous bodily harm under s 42(1) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management Act) 1999 (NSW), then the appropriate charge for failing to stop after an impact was an offence under s 70(1) of that Act.  The maximum penalty for that offence was only 30 penalty units and/or 18 months imprisonment (in the case of a first offence).
18It was submitted that the s 52AB offences were ""tethered to"" dangerous driving and that the facts known to police, even at an early stage, had warranted the laying of charges of negligent driving, not dangerous driving.  His Honour had erred in not having regard to the maximum penalty imposed for an offence under s 70 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act, which was ""tethered to"" negligent driving occasioning death or grievous bodily harm under s 42(1) of that Act.  In the result, absent the dangerous driving charge, the maximum penalty of 18 months in the Local Court ought to have been taken into account on sentencing for these s 52AB offences.  
19Further, the applicant contended that his Honour had erred in not taking into account by way of mitigation the maximum penalty for the s 52AB offences, if they had been prosecuted in the Local Court.  The s 52AB offences were not Table 1 offences under Schedule 1 to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and so had been committed to the District Court, while the applicant still faced the dangerous driving charges.  Those charges were not finally pursued, but the Director elected to have the s 52AB offences dealt with by the District Court.  It was submitted that after the dangerous driving charges were withdrawn, the s 52AB charges could have been dealt with summarily had the Director elected.  In that event the maximum penalty for those offences would also have been 18 months. 
20In those circumstances it was submitted that on sentencing his Honour ought to have taken into account the maximum penalty in the Local Court, as discussed in McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94.  There reference was made to Johnson J's judgment in R v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 where  his Honour observed at [29] - [30]:  
""29  It is a well-established sentencing principle that a court dealing on indictment with a matter which was capable of summary disposal may have regard to that fact on sentence: R v Sandford (1994) 72 A Crim R 160 at 195; R v Griggs (1999) 109 A Crim R 484 at 485-6; Crombie, at paragraph 16; Doan, at 123ff (paragraph 35ff); R v LPY (2002) 135 A Crim R 237 at 240. But it is not a universal rule (Sandford, at 195) nor a factor which operates universally to reduce sentence (Doan, [[2000] 50 NSWLR 115] at 124). In some circumstances, the Court may conclude that the offender's criminality was too serious to be dealt with in the Local Court and that the matter was properly before the District Court: R v Hanslow [2004] NSWCCA 163 at paragraph 21. The significance of the loss of a chance to be dealt with in the Local Court will vary from case to case: R v Depoma [2003] NSWCCA 382 at paragraph 13. 
30  The maximum penalty for an offence under s.59(1) Crimes Act 1900 is imprisonment for five years. When disposed of summarily in the Local Court, the maximum sentence is imprisonment for two years or a fine of 50 penalty units or both: s.268(2)(a) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. These provisions prescribe the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court and not the maximum penalty for any offence triable within that jurisdiction: Doan at 123 (paragraph 35). Magistrates must not regard the jurisdictional limit as some form of maximum sentence reserved for a worst case: Re Attorney-General's Application under s.37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 2 of 2002) (2002) 137 A Crim R 196 at 204 (paragraph 27). A judge in the District Court is not bound by the jurisdictional limit imposed on the Local Court when dealing with an offence on indictment which was capable of summary disposal, but may have regard to that limit when the case is one which could appropriately have been disposed of in the Local Court: Crombie, at paragraph 16; LPY, at 240 ....""

21Further, at the sentencing hearing the parties had advanced submissions as to the nature of the offences created by s 52AB.  Madgwick ADCJ was referred to the Second Reading Speech, NSW Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 21 September 2005 at 18124, which described the purpose of the newly created offence.  It was there said:""Assistance may save a life, minimise injury, improve the prospect of recovery, alleviate suffering and preserve the dignity of the injured or deceased.  Failure to stop and assist in serious accidents should invite significant punishment... What is required is for the person to stop and take steps to assist directly or obtain expert help by contacting police or emergency services to ensure that professional expert assistance is obtained at the earliest opportunity. The action of drivers fleeing may thwart police in their ability to identify the drivers and collect necessary evidence. The presence of drivers at the scene ensures that the investigation is at no disadvantage.""

22In his sentencing remarks his Honour observed as to the purpose of the offences:""The offences appear to have two rationales. First, to provide that whatever may be the position in relation to not needing to attempt to be a good Samaritan in relation to injuries sustained by others generally, that is not the position when one has been the driver of a motor vehicle and there has been an impact and one knows, or ought to know, that there has been death or serious injury to another person.
The other rationale is to seek to ensure that a person seriously at fault cannot profit by fleeing the scene and avoiding being charged with dangerous driving causing death of a person or grievous bodily harm to a person.""
23On appeal the applicant complained that his Honour had wrongly regarded him as having taken steps to avoid prosecution for negligent driving occasioning death as a matter of aggravation, when assessing the objective seriousness of the offences for which he was being sentenced.  
24It was also submitted that his Honour's approach had resulted in negligent driving, an irrelevant matter, being taken into account on sentence.  That was revealed by his Honour's observations that:""The prisoner was travelling at least 13 kilometres over the speed limit and may well have been travelling at a speed in excess of that. Whether or not his driving could ever have been proved to amount to dangerous driving, it is clear that his inattention or judgment as he was driving were, in the case of inattention, of a high order and, in relation to his judgment, lacking to a quite substantial degree.""
25It was submitted in the alternative that if the nature of the driving which caused the impact was a relevant consideration, negligent driving was a fact in mitigation of penalty, given that the impact was not caused by dangerous driving.
The nature of s 52AB offences - Ground 1(d)
26The case advanced on appeal raises the proper construction of s 52AB of the Crimes Act.  Contrary to the applicant's case, the offences created by s 52AB of the Crimes Act are not ""tethered to"" the offence of dangerous driving created by s 52A, despite the reference there made to s 52A.  The section provides:""52AB    Offence of failing to stop and assist after vehicle impact causing death or grievous bodily harm(1)   A person is guilty of an offence if:(a)   a vehicle being driven by the person is involved in an impact occasioning the death of another person, and(b)   the person knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the vehicle has been involved in an impact occasioning the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, another person, and(c)   the person fails to stop and give any assistance that may be necessary and that it is in his or her power to give.Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 10 years.(2)   A person is guilty of an offence if:(a)   a vehicle being driven by the person is involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm to another person, and(b)   the person knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the vehicle has been involved in an impact occasioning the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, another person, and(c)   the person fails to stop and give any assistance that may be necessary and that it is in his or her power to give.Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 7 years.
(3)   The provisions of section 52A (5) and (6) (which prescribe circumstances in which a vehicle is taken to be involved in an impact) apply for the purposes of this section in the same way as they apply for the purposes of section 52A.
(4)   In this section, vehicle has the same meaning as it has in section 52A.""
27Grievous bodily harm is defined in s 3 of the Crimes Act to include:""(a)   the destruction (other than in the course of a medical procedure) of the foetus of a pregnant woman, whether or not the woman suffers any other harm, and(b)   any permanent or serious disfiguring of the person, and(c)   any grievous bodily disease (in which case a reference to the infliction of grievous bodily harm includes a reference to causing a person to contract a grievous bodily disease).""
28A driver who is involved in an impact caught by s 52AB, that is an impact which occasions either the death of another person or grievous bodily harm to another person, who fails to stop and give assistance that may be necessary and that it is in his or her power to give, commits an offence under s 52AB, if he or she:
""knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the vehicle has been involved in an impact occasioning the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, another person"".  
29It is the failure to stop, the driver having that knowledge, which is the gravamen of the s 52AB offences, not the nature of the driving which caused the impact, as Price J discussed  in Shumack v R [2008] NSWCCA 311; 191 A Crim R 513 at [32] - [33]. 
30It is the consequences of the impact itself, namely either death in the case of s 52AB(1), or grievous bodily harm in the case of the s 52AB(2) offence, which determines whether the offence falls within s 52A(1) or s 52A(2) and the resulting maximum penalty which applies, respectively 10 or 7 years.   An impact which causes injury which does not result in either death or injury which falls within the statutory definition of grievous bodily harm, cannot give rise to a s 52AB offence.
31In a case where a driver failed to stop and give assistance after an impact which causes  less serious injury, it was the offence created by  s 70 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act (see now s 146 of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW)) which arose for consideration.  Section 70 relevantly  provided:""70    Offence of failing to stop and assist after impact causing injury(1)   A person is guilty of an offence if:(a)   a vehicle or horse being driven or ridden by the person on a road or road related area is involved in an impact occasioning the death of, or injury to, another person, and(b)   the person knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the vehicle or horse has been involved in an impact occasioning injury to another person, and(c)   the person fails to stop and give any assistance that may be necessary and that it is in his or her power to give.Maximum penalty: 30 penalty units or imprisonment for 18 months or both (in the case of a first offence) or 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years or both (in the case of a second or subsequent offence).(2)   .... ""

32A s 70 offence was committed, in the case of the driver of a vehicle,  by failing to stop and assist if the driver knew or reasonably ought to have known that the vehicle had ""been involved in an impact occasioning injury to another person"".  Such injury includes injuries which do not fall within the definition of ""grievous bodily harm"".  That offence was, however, also not concerned with the nature of the driving which caused the impact which caused such injury, but with the failure to stop and give assistance. 
33The elements of the three offences created by these two statutory schemes are thus different.  They are each concerned with the conduct of the driver of a vehicle after an impact which causes death or injury.  They do not depend on the nature of the offender's driving before the impact, which is the subject of different offences altogether.
34An offence under s 70 was undoubtedly a less serious offence than either of the two s 52AB offences, as the respective maximum penalties for the three offences reveal: 18 months for the s 70 offence, as opposed to 10 years in the case of death, and 7 years in the case of grievous bodily harm, for the s 52AB offences.  The penalties imposed for the s 52AB offences are similar to the penalties imposed for dangerous driving offences under s 52A of the Crimes Act.  That is an indication of the seriousness which the Legislature considers s 52AB offences to have.  It does not, however, tether the s 52AB offences to cases where it is dangerous, rather than negligent driving which has resulted in an impact which caused either death or grievous bodily harm.  Nor is negligent driving a mitigating factor to be taken into account in sentencing such an offence.
35It is the consequences of an impact and what the offender knew or ought reasonably to have known about those consequences, when he or she failed to stop and render assistance, with which the s 52AB offences are concerned.  That is irrespective of whether those consequences were the result of dangerous, negligent or even safe driving.  That does not mean, however, that the offender's driving is irrelevant to the sentencing exercise.  
36Unquestionably what a person knows or ought reasonably to have known about a particular impact, will depend upon what he or she knows about both the cause and the nature of the impact, at the time that he or she fails to stop and give assistance.  In the case of the driver of the vehicle which caused the impact, the way in which he or she was driving when it occurred, will be relevant both to determining what he or she knew or ought to have known about the impact and assessing the gravity of the offence. 
37It follows that the applicant's negligent driving was not only an agreed fact on sentencing, there was also no error in the attention which his Honour paid to that fact in the sentencing exercise. 
Failing to take into account that the s 52AB charge could have been dealt with summarily - Ground 1(a)
38The offence with which a person is charged and where it is pursued are prosecutorial decisions.  Understandably, given the nature of the consequences of the impact which the applicant caused for Mr Quang Mai and Mr Liem Thanh Le, the applicant did not advance a case on sentencing that he ought to have been charged with an offence under s 70.  On the agreed facts it was the more serious s 52AB offences of which he was guilty.  They were the offences to which he entered a plea and for which he was being sentenced.  A contrary case cannot be advanced for the first time on appeal.
39In any event, it is for a prosecutor alone to decide what charge is to be preferred.  It is for the accused person to decide whether to plead guilty to that charge and it is for the sentencing judge to impose a sentence for the charge to which the plea has been entered (see GAS v R [2004] HCA 22; 217 CLR 198 at [28] - [30]).  As discussed in Elias v The Queen; Issa v The Queen [2013] HCA 31; 248 CLR 483 at [36] ""[c]onsideration of different offences for which an offender might have been convicted is merely a distraction.""  That is because, as the plurality observed at [34]:""34  It may be accepted that the prosecutor's selection of the charge is capable of having a bearing on the sentence. Commonly this will be the case where the prosecution has a discretion in determining whether to proceed summarily or on indictment. However, the separation of functions does not permit the court to canvass the exercise of the prosecutor's discretion in a case in which it considers a less serious offence to be more appropriate any more than when the court considers a more serious charge to be more appropriate. In this context, the observations of Dawson and McHugh JJ in their joint reasons in Maxwell v The Queen bear repeating [Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501 at 514]:
""No doubt a court may, if it thinks it desirable to do so, express its view upon the appropriateness of a charge or the acceptance of a plea and no doubt its view will be accorded great weight. But if a court does express such a view, it should recognise that in doing so it is doing no more than attempting to influence the exercise of a discretion which is not any part of its own function and that it may be speaking in ignorance of matters which have properly motivated the decision of the prosecuting authority.""

40It follows that the prosecutor's decision to bring charges under s 52AB cannot be criticised, as the applicant sought to do on appeal.  That he could have been charged with an offence under s 70, was not a relevant consideration in this sentencing exercise.  
41Furthermore, given the agreed facts in relation to the speed at which the applicant must have been driving when he struck the vehicle in which Mr Quang Mai and Mr Liem Thanh Le were travelling; the impact which the applicant caused, which resulted in the other vehicle being pushed a very considerable distance, spinning it around so that it ended up on the other side of the road and hitting a fence and a tree and the applicant's vehicle being pushed to the wrong side of the road before coming to a stop, 35 metres from the collision point; the results of that impact, namely the death of a person and grievous injuries to another; the prosecutorial decisions to charge the applicant under s 52AB and to pursue those charges in the District Court, were entirely understandable.  
42The agreed facts also explain why the applicant entered pleas to the two s 52AB charges, namely, the circumstances of the accident, including the speed at which the applicant was driving and the consequences of the impact.  On those facts there can have been no doubt that at the time when he failed to stop and render assistance, the applicant knew or ought reasonably to have known that the impact he had caused had resulted in the death or grievous bodily harm to occupants of the vehicle which he had struck.  
43That conclusion is reinforced by a consideration of the applicant's conduct after the impact, not only absconding without rendering any assistance to those who so plainly needed help, but coming forward only some four days later.  The explanation which the applicant advanced for that conduct at the sentencing hearing was understandably not accepted.  There was no challenge to that conclusion on appeal.  
44At the sentencing hearing a suspended sentence or an intensive correction order was pressed for the applicant as an appropriate sentence for these offences.  
45Madgwick ADCJ then indicated why he considered that a custodial sentence was necessary, observing that the offences involved an element of callousness; that they were moderately serious; that the applicant had avoided prosecution for an offence of negligent driving causing death; and that the fact that he had not gone to police for four days after the impact had made the offences more serious.  
46It was also submitted to be relevant to consider that the s 52AB offences could have been dealt with summarily.  His Honour also then indicated that he took the view that the maximum penalty available in the Local Court would not reflect an appropriate sentence for the applicant's offences.  
47There was no error in that approach.  As explained by Johnson J in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at [112] ""[u]nless it is plainly wrong that the offence is in the District Court, it is difficult to see how an offender can succeed on a ground of appeal which claims that a relevant factor has not been taken into account by the sentencing Judge.""
48Here, not only was the theoretical possibility that these offences could have been prosecuted in the Local Court raised at the sentencing hearing, concessions were then properly made for the applicant, given the death and grievous bodily harm caused by the impact, that this was not a matter which his Honour had to take into account when assessing penalty and that there was nothing inappropriate in this matter having been brought before the District Court.  His Honour's approach in the circumstances was open and accorded with Johnson J's approach in El Masri, quoted above.
The relevance of the applicant not having been charged with negligent driving - Grounds 1(b) and (c) 
49The applicant was originally charged with dangerous driving.  Those charges were finally not pursued.  He entered a plea to the s 52AB offences and it became an agreed fact on sentencing that his driving was negligent.  His negligent driving was a matter which the Crown submitted, without objection, could be taken into account in the sentencing exercise.  The applicant's counsel also made submissions as to the nature of the applicant's driving and that of the other driver, agreeing with his Honour that the applicant's driving had not been one of the worst cases of negligent driving.
50In the face of the case advanced on sentencing, it is too late on appeal to advance a case that the applicant's driving having been negligent was not relevant to the sentencing exercise.  His Honour did not fall into error in taking that fact into account, as he did.  He did not take into account as an aggravating matter, that the applicant had avoided prosecution for dangerous driving, as the applicant submitted.
51In his sentencing remarks his Honour also observed that had the applicant been convicted after a defended trial, the objective seriousness of the offences would have required a sentence of between 4 and 5 years to be imposed, notwithstanding relevant subjective circumstances, which included the applicant's mental condition.  
52After a discount of 25% for an early plea, consideration of the applicant's remorse and his difficult personal circumstances and a finding of special circumstances, his Honour imposed a 2 year head sentence for the s 52AB(1) offence and a sentence of 18 months for the s 52AB(2) offence.  The maximum penalties were respectively 10 and 7 years.  His Honour accumulated the sentences with the result a sentence totalling 2 years, 8 months, with a non-parole period of 20 months and a balance of term of 12 months was imposed.  
53On the evidence, his Honour was not only correct in taking the view that these serious offences should not have been dealt with summarily and had to result in a custodial sentence, but his assessment of the seriousness of the  offending was properly reflected in the sentence imposed.  That sentence was not manifestly excessive, but open on the evidence and the cases advanced by both parties at the sentence hearing.  The agreed facts and the applicant's evidence well revealed the seriousness of these offences, notwithstanding that the driving which caused the impact which preceded the offending for which he was being sentenced was agreed to have been negligent, rather than dangerous.  
54No error has been shown in his Honour's approach or in the conclusions reached.  Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed.
Orders
55I would grant leave to appeal but order that the appeal be dismissed.

		20 November 2014",2014-11-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765354,R v Warren Drake [2014] NSWDC 252,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The offender appears for sentence in relation to eight counts on an indictment. In respect of three counts on the indictment, counts 7, 8 and 9 there are also a series of offences set out on the Form 1 which I will detail below which will be taken into account in sentencing for each of those principal charges. The offender is also to be sentenced for the breach of the bond pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that was for a period of twelve months. The offender has been in custody since 9 August 2012.
	


Background


	
	Clearly one of the issues in these proceedings concerns the prospects of the offenderâs rehabilitation in the light of his prior criminal history and in particular his actions and offences set against the timing of an earlier trial on charges involving substantially similar matters. It is, therefore, appropriate that I set out in these remarks matters relevant to that trial which will become relevant in my overall consideration of the sentence of the terms particularly the principles of totality.
	


Prior criminal trial


	
	The offender was tried in Bega District Court before a jury and Judge Haesler SC in August/September 2011 on one count of sexual intercourse with a child, TJ, between the ages of 10 and 14. I have been provided with a copy of the remarks on sentence of Judge Haesler SC dated 19 December 2011. His Honour referred to the fact that the offender, in that trial, ran a defence which was essentially that he did not know the complainantâs age. The jury there clearly rejected that defence and, as his Honour noted, clearly accepted the evidence of the complainant. That resulted presumably from the juryâs consideration of the offenderâs prior knowledge and involvement with the young girl, their own individual history from an early age and their family history.
	
	
	It is also clear from his Honourâs remarks that the offender had a romantic attachment to the complainant in that case and indeed âtook things far more seriously than TJ, the complainantâ.
	
	
	The charges in the trial were brought under s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is one of 16 years imprisonment.
	
	
	His Honour also found that the criminality involved fell towards the lower end of the spectrum. He was influenced by the pre-sentence report as well as the associated psychologistâs report which seems to be that the offender had been placed in a category of âlow to moderate risk relative to other male sex offendersâ. His Honour also found that the offender was at that time a young man who had been working for a very long time.
	
	
	âHe is well-established in the community and is starting a new and proper relationship. He has excellent prospects and he is unlikely to re-offendâ.
	
	
	The offender was sentenced on 19 December 2011 and required to enter the bond imposed under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for 12 months. He was also placed on a Commonwealth bond to be of good behaviour for 18 months. All the offences for which the offender is to be sentenced for his breach are of that s 12 bond. There is also another bond for 18 months on which I propose to take no action.
	
	
	That optimism of Judge Haesler SC proved to be unfounded and in a very short time. The evidence before Judge Haesler is clearly different from the evidence before me in these proceedings. As a result of that conviction the offender was placed on the Child Protection Registrar in accordance with the Child Protection Registration Act NSW 2000. His registration on that Child Protection Registrar was updated apparently after the birth of his child on 4 July 2012.
	
	
	Further reports were sent to his primary address at Tregear, New South Wales. This Registrar becomes relevant in relation to some of the Form 1 offences.
	


Timing of subsequent offences


	
	The sexual intercourse with the complainant TJ, then aged 13 years, with which that trial was concerned occurred on 17 October 2009. In March 2010 the offender commenced treatment in the Sex Offender Treatment Program. It is clear that the offences involving the complainant NP occurred in the period March to July 2012. The sexual intercourse with NP took place between 5 and 10 April 2012.
	
	
	Further, the charge of possessing child abuse material, being photos of her, occurred in the period June to July 2012. In addition, the grooming charge was under s 66E(b) subs 3 occurred in the period April to May 2012.
	
	
	The further charge of grooming brought under s 66E(b)(3) involving BT occurred in May 2012. What this indicates, and will be dealt with later in my consideration of the appropriate sentence, is a course of consistent criminal conduct in the light of a very recent criminal trial involving young girls by essentially the same methods of grooming and communication.
	


Facts in relation to each of the charges.

OFFENCE 1


	
	This count involves sexual intercourse by way of digital penetration of NP. At that time she was 14 years and 7 months old. During the course of the subsequent police interview she said that she had been in a relationship with the offender for approximately four months. The act of digital penetration occurred in western Sydney in New South Wales between 5 and 10 April 2012.
	


OFFENCE 2


	
	This charge of grooming involved conduct between the offender and NP between 12 March 2012 and 13 July 2012 in which he exposed her to indecent material with the intention of making it easier to procure her for unlawful sexual activity. In brief, the facts set out how the offender and NP came to communicate on Facebook. It seems that after about two weeks of Facebook communication as well as SMS texts being sent they first met in person. NP and her sister went with her sisterâs boyfriend and the offender to the river at Jamison. During the course of the trip the offender, who was driving the car, put his hand up NPâs jeans. She was seated in the front passengerâs seat. He then put his hands down her pants and touched her vagina with his fingers inserted in her vagina. He moved his fingers inside and around her vagina for approximately two minutes.
	
	
	On 3 August 2012 NPâs mother, Debbie, took NPâs mobile phone to the Mount Druitt Police Station. Police accessed the phone and retrieved 27 photographs, 10 of which showed the offender in various stages of undress and in some cases he had his hands on his penis.
	


OFFENCE 3


	
	On 9 August 2012 police conducted surveillance of the offender in his car. They searched his car and seized a black iPhone. They found various child abuse images on the iPhone. Those included images of NP in a folder on the phone labelled âSlutsâ. Those images were classified in accordance with the CTS Scale.
	


OFFENCE 4


	
	The complainant in this instance, TS, was 14 at the time the offence occurred. She met the offender through friends and they subsequently began text messaging each other. The police recovered 157 sexual explicit text messages sent between the complainant and the offender between 10 May 2011 and 20 September 2011 which is set out in the agreed facts. During that time the offender asked for photographs of the complainant.
	


OFFENCE 5


	
	The offending the subject of this count occurred between 28 April 2012 and 2 May 2012. The complainant SM and the offender began communicating after the offender randomly added her as a friend on Facebook. During the course of private message conversations the offender obtained her number and they communicated via a text message. She was interviewed by the JIRT team on 16 August 2012. The offender offered to buy her credit for her phone in exchange for a photograph of herself. An examination of the offenderâs phone revealed a photo of the complainant in a black bra and underwear. One Facebook message from the offender reads: âOk well when I get to Central Iâll bye (sic) you credit Ok bub so do you want to make love or naâ. The complainant subsequently blocked him and deleted him as a friend on Facebook. When asked in his ERISP the offender agreed he was on way to a Probation and Parole mandated Child Sex Offenderâs Program near Central Station and that when he did get to Central Station he did ultimately buy credit for SMâs phone.
	


OFFENCE 6


	
	Again, the complainant BT and the offender began communicating after the offender randomly added her on Facebook. Communication took place between 14 May 2012 and 21 May 2012. The complainant went to the same school as NP and was 14 at the time which she disclosed to the offender the day he added her as one of his Facebook friends. The offender said he was 21.
	
	
	In a message the night after he added her the offender sent a message saying, âI shore (sic) do I wanna date but u donât lolâ¦ and my cock is 7 inch if you wanted to know whatâ to which the complainant replied, âOâ¦oâ. The next day the offender offered to buy her credit to which the complainant replied, âNeahh my daddy will get itâ. On 20 May 2012 he asked the complainant if she wanted to meet up, repeating the request the next day. The complainant refused.
	


OFFENCE 7


	
	The offender failed to inform police that he changed his residential address after he moved in with the mother of his child and her family. In a surveillance operation on 31 July 2012, 2 August 2012 and 9 August 2012 in the very early hours of the morning the offenderâs car was parked at the new address. The offenderâs girlfriend at the time recalled that he had been living with her since April 2012 and moved all his belongings to the new address from his parentâs home.
	
	
	There are various matters taken into account on a Form 1A in relation to Count 7. Those relate to the provision of false information by virtue of not supplying police with a telephone number and residential address, failing to comply with reporting obligations, not informing police of the Facebook account three charges and failing to comply with reporting obligations, not informing the police of internet service providers relating to the mobile number at 52 Ball Street, Colyton and computers accessed at work under a particular Hotmail address.
	


OFFENCE 8


	
	This offence relates to the offenderâs regular unsupervised contact with children, in particular NP. This unsupervised contact is in breach of his Child Protection Registrar obligations.
	
	
	The matters taken into account on the Form 1B in relation to count 8 are fail to comply with reporting obligations, having regular unsupervised contact with NP, having regular unsupervised contact with a child (SM) via internet and mobile phone and regular unsupervised contact with a child (BT) via internet and mobile phone.
	


OFFENCE 9


	
	Offence 9 was one of attempting to actively communicate with a child under the age of 14 by writing a letter to EB requesting to see his six month old son. On 17 September 2012 when the offender was in custody he was made the subject of an interim prohibition order pursuant to s 7 of the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition) Orders Act 2004 (NSW). The offender is and was prohibited from a variety of conducts involving he communication or association with children under 14 years of age, the care of any person under 18 years of age, not travelling outside New South Wales without informing the New South Wales Police and not to access any social media or email.
	
	
	On 16 November 2012, some two months after being subject to the order, the offender went to the house of his ex-girlfriend and young son. In contravention of the order the offender left a note in the letterbox saying, âL itâs Warren can you plz call me on a number just to see our son for a little bitt hanks I am out BTWâ.
	
	
	Form 1C attached to count 9 included the matters of remaining in the company of a three month old child (JC) on 13 December 2012 by reporting on bail to a Police Station and another charge of being in the company of a child under the age of 14 years, his three year old niece, on 14 December 2012.
	


Evidence on Sentence Proceedings

Offenderâs personal details and circumstances


	
	The offender was born on 13 December 1989, he is nearly 23 years of age. On his account he grew up in a large supportive and close family as the third youngest of six children. Mr Drake identifies as an Aboriginal man. In his interview with Dr Seidler, the offender described a positive relationship with both parents although his father could be, using his words, âpretty nasty at times regarding discipline.â All the offenderâs siblings bar one have been in trouble with the law at various stages including serving time in custody. The offender offered that his exposure to antisocial and negative influence may be responsible for this behaviour.
	
	
	The family have resided in Department of Housing accommodation for a lengthy period of time despite his parents maintaining employment. The offender reported no history of significant substance abuse nor a personal history of abuse and presented an unremarkable medical history. The offenderâs early schooling was also largely unremarkable, however, he acknowledged that he did not fit in well at high school and was unhappy although he had friends has not teased or bullied to any great degree. The offender told Dr Seilder that his behaviour at high school was problematic and that he was suspended on eight occasions for fighting with other students. He subsequently left school in Year 9.
	
	
	He completed a Certificate III in Landscaping and Horticulture and has been in various forms of unskilled labour since he was 15. His longest period of employment is four years as a sheet metal worker which is commendable. He has expressed the desire to return to welding work in the future.
	
	
	With regard to his friends, the offender told Dr Seidler that he has a lot of friends, many of whom he has known over the long term and about half of whom are engaged in antisocial behaviours. He stated that although he goes out socially he does not like going out drinking and spends time with his family.
	
	
	Since losing his virginity aged 16 the offender has had about eight sexual partners with whom he was in a relationship with and three serious relationships. The offender acknowledged that in his most recent relationship he was not that faithful. His offending behaviour and incarceration contributed to its breakdown. The offender would like to play a role in the life of his son from this relationship, however, obviously that has its constraints at the present time.
	


Prospects of Rehabilitation


	
	I have particular concerns about the rehabilitation of this offender. I have been given various reports, particularly the pre-sentence report for the specific purpose of this assessment, exhibit 7, dated 15 July 2014 as well as the associated treatment summary and risk management report of 13 May 2013 and the report of Dr Seidler from Lennings Seidler Collins, psychologists, of 22 April 2014, exhibit 10. It is clear from the report of Dr Seidler that the offender has a somewhat distorted idea of consent and boundaries. His view in April 2014 when he was interviewed was that he still thought that the degree of physical enjoyment of the girls involved would determine their capacity to consent and enjoy sexual behaviour. Clearly such views need to be addressed along with the offenderâs present apparent predilection for contacting young girls who do not have the capacity for consent.
	
	
	A common feature of these reports is that the offender seems to be part of a group which is a moderate to high risk of re-offending. Defence counsel, Mr Ozen, submitted that these classifications by statistical grouping are generalisations and that any consequential specific categorisation of this offender may lead to an injustice. Defence counsel also points out that some of the common comments of the various experts referred to the offenderâs âflat affectâ in his conversation with the experts and his borderline verbal intelligence. He also submits that the report of Dr Seidler in paragraph 69 is to the effect that the offender will respond and has the capacity to make important changes in his life.
	
	
	Mr Ozen has submitted that in this regard I should be wary of not taking full account of the offenderâs familial and indigenous background. He further submits that the offender in this category may well be subject to cultural and linguistic constraints which should not be misinterpreted. I agree with those submissions and I will take them into account.
	
	
	The Crown in response pointed out that there are other denials by the offender of his culpability in criminality which did not indicate full co-operation with the police.
	
	
	In the light of the submissions made I have in the intervening period reviewed the reports to which I have referred. The thrust of all the independent evidence before me is that the offender is a person who is at significant risk of re-offending. Notwithstanding that risk categorisation I am still faced with a very young man who despite previous appearances in this Court has not engaged in any meaningful rehabilitation or treatment. That is a live consideration when determining an appropriate sentence and the offenderâs prospects of re-offending: R v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 citing with approval King CJâs remarks in Yardley v Betts (1979) 22 SASR 108 at 44.
	


Delay


	
	Defence counsel also refers to the fact that the offender has been in custody now for some two years and three months. These delays were not the fault of the offender and occurred because the matter came before Court on three occasions at least in 2014. At one stage it was agreed that the matter should go over because there was a need for a call-up procedure to be followed. There were also two subsequent appearances, one of which meant that the matter was not reached which is becoming an increasingly common circumstance in this Court with the resources that it has. There were also apparently delays in finalising some remarks on sentence and various other reports which needed to be presented to this Court. The effect of this delay has had ramifications for the offenderâs participation in courses within the custodial environment.
	
	
	This delay has meant a degree of injustice for the offender in circumstances where there have been no delays brought by him or his legal representatives it would seem. The financial cutbacks imposed by the government across the Justice portfolio meant that offenders generally are kept on longer and longer periods of remand with the associated lack of certainty as well as the inability to fix the rehabilitation courses to the extent that they were available and also have not been the subject of cutbacks.
	
	
	I will take that delay into account in determining the overall sentence, the exercise of discretion to fix the commencement date of sentence and in my consideration the need for a partial accumulation of the sentences against the background of the principles of totality.
	


Impact on the victim


	
	A Victim Impact Statement from Ms NP has been tendered. In my view the matters set out are consistent with a response which might be expected from a young girl of those years suffering embarrassment and humiliation not only from the acts themselves but from her ongoing dealings with the police and her mother. Apart from those matters, which are of importance, I see no evidence of any substantial ongoing harm being caused to Ms NP. There does not seem to be any breach of a position of authority or trust by the offender, indeed, it seems that NP accompanied Mr Drake willingly on the occasion when the digital intercourse took place nor was it the subject of any kind of resistance from her it would seem. This is a feature similar to that of the offence to which the offender was tried and convicted. However, given her age there is no consent nor legal capacity to consent and that is something which Mr Drake needs to come to accept.
	


Offender: family


	
	The offender did not give evidence, however, his mother did. Mrs Drake told the Court that the offender came from a large family with six children, four of whom, not including the offender have been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder Syndrome.
	
	
	The offender lived with his mother until he moved out with another person with whom he was then in a relationship. He was then aged 22. Mrs Drake said that she was aware of the charges and the issues which had arisen from the prior trial matter. She said that she was aware of some of the offenderâs relationships including that with Elizabeth, the mother of his child, B, who was born in March 2012.
	
	
	She had a limited awareness of his other relationships other than her perception that there were numerous such relationships. She was not aware of his practice of sending inappropriate communications to young girls. She is also not aware of his use of pornography from the age of 13 which involvement appears to have continued thereafter.
	
	
	Mrs Drake said and I accept, that she visited the offender since he has been in custody bail refused from 9 August 2012. She has visited twice a week, every week since that time.
	
	
	Mrs Drake expressed the offender has regretted what he had done. The offender, himself, as I have noted did not give evidence and that expression of remorse cannot be tested. From the hearsay evidence that I have including from Mrs Drake and to the extent that it is set out in the psychologistâs report what appears to be distressing the offender the most his is inability to contact his son and the ongoing restrictions which have been placed on him. While I have no doubt of Mrs Drakeâs love for her son and the genuineness of her current desire to provide a home for him on upon his release I am concerned about whether she is likely to exercise effective supervision of him in the event that (as appears likely) he returns to live with her. Mrs Drake did not know that there were further conditions in place resulting from his previous convictions, for example, with his Internet usage or phone usage. Indeed, it appears that the offender confirmed at the time that there were no other conditions.
	
	
	Mrs Drake seems motivated to âprotect him from himselfâ. She considered that although he had the build of a man he is really just a boy and he needed her to make him understand things fully and adequately. The Agreed Facts and communication sent by the offender to the complainants support the motherâs conclusion and indicates a level of immaturity on the part of Mr Drake.
	
	
	A necessary part of the offenderâs rehabilitation will involve his interaction with his family particularly his brother and siblings. It is submitted that the fact that the offenderâs mother and family are now fully apprised of the seriousness of his conduct and the ongoing restrictions that are placed on his behaviour give renewed confidence that the offenderâs family will be of positive assistance to the offender in the future. However, I have some reservations in accepting that particularly given the frequency of Mr Drakeâs offending and the rapidity with which it occurred after his criminal trial.
	


Consideration


	
	What was involved in all these cases was a series of sexual offences involving either pre-adolescent or adolescent girls whom the offender attempted to contact through the use of electronic or mobile phone contact. The offender clearly set up a Facebook account including his name and photographs of himself. There does not seem to have been any or any significant attempt at deception in terms of his own identity or his age.
	
	
	The extent of the offenderâs actions became apparent as a result of the complaint made by Ms NP when she spoke to her mother and her mother took her to the police station. The complaints involving the other three victims, whose names are listed, seem to have been the result of private messaging and other conversations. It is clear that the offender generally tried to entice young girls to participate with him further in email or text conversations by extending credit to their respect phone accounts. One of those matters involving Ms M occurred on 30 April 2012 which is the same day that he, the offender, was attending a Sex Offenderâs Program in Surry Hills. In my view that is a matter which gives support to the Crownâs submission that there has been a superficial engagement by Mr Drake to the extent of disregarding the messages he was getting in those programs or treating it with contempt. Whatever his views were as to the co-operation with respect to the victims, and it is clear that he regards them as having been willing participants in conversations with him, he must have known the criminality of what had occurred given his previous trial and conviction for similarly offending behaviour.
	
	
	All the offences occurred in a relatively short period after the offender had been involved in a long trial where he was found guilty and was the subject to the sentencing process and the sentence itself by the District Court. There could have been no doubt that the offender was aware of the criminality of his conduct. However, it also highlights the need for this offender to undertake prolonged and intensive rehabilitation.
	
	
	There does not seem to have been any manipulation or pressure by him on any of the victims nor does there seem to have been any commercial or other widespread for the dissemination of the material involving the complainantsâ photographs or that of the offender himself. None of the counts involve acts of the offender which mean that there would be widespread embarrassment of any of the complainants as is sometimes the case with messages of pictures particularly amongst people of this age. That is to the offenderâs credit. I find that any photographs obtained from the complainants were simply obtained and retained for his own pleasure. What was involved is a consistent and persistent contact with young girls by electronic means with the clear intention of meeting up with them or maintaining contact with them or storing explicit images of them. Neither the prior court proceedings nor the subsequent contact with the various probation and treatment authorities seems to have made much difference to him.
	
	
	Following the trial the offender was placed on a suspended sentence with the appropriate bond conditions, however, it seems he did not engage with any particular course of treatment. It is evident that the offender needs to engage in such treatment if he is to become a functioning member of society.
	


Assessment of criminality of each count


	
	Against the background of the matters I have set out and following submissions I find in relation to each count that the criminality is in the following range:
	
	
	In terms of Count 1 with NP I find the criminality is between low and mid-range. I base this finding particularly on the fact that the offence occurred in circumstances where, for at least the majority of the time, the offender and the complainant were present with others. There was no force or violence which occurred and there does not seem to have been any lasting consequences to the complainant over and above her association with the acts involved and her subsequent experience with her mother and the police.
	
	
	I find in relation to the remainder of the counts with the exception of Count 7, the criminality involved has been of low range in relation to each of these accounts.
	
	
	In relation to Count 7 what was involved is a serious breach of the Child Registrar requirements. There are important policy considerations in relation to law enforcement and community safety generally. Sentences imposed for breach of these requirements need to be specially marked where, as here, the offender clearly understands the requirements on him. His account or excuse as to why he did not comply with this requirement is that he felt pressure from his girlfriend not to report changes in his address because of her embarrassment about living with him at the time. While that explanation is perhaps understandable there should be no doubt in the mind of anybody involved in these areas of law enforcement that there needs to be strict compliance.
	


Purposes of sentencing


	
	I have had regard to the various, and at times overlapping, purposes of sentencing as set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the principles expressed in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476. . There is no attempt to rank the overlapping and sometimes conflicting purposes of sentencing in s 3A: Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120 at 20.
	


Consideration of sentencing options


	
	In terms of sentencing options, I am satisfied by reason of the facts, in particular the ages of the complainants and circumstances in which the actions took place as well as the personal circumstances of the offender and the matters set out above that the final option to be considered by any sentencing judge, namely, imprisonment, is the only option which will properly meet the purposes of sentencing. That is particularly the case here given the requirements of personal and general deterrence in the context of Mr Drakeâs rehabilitation. All the offences except one were committed while he was on a bond.
	
	
	The total sentence imposed needs to be seen against the fact that the offender has been in custody since 9 August 2012 arising from the breach of bond for the suspended sentence.
	


Consideration of totality


	
	Totality is one of the most important issues in this particular sentence proceeding, here the offender as I have said has been in custody since 9 August 2012. The sentence for imprisonment which was suspended was one of twelve months. That was a separate sentence arising out of a trial involving totally separate circumstances and a different but again young complainant. Considerable leniency was extended to the offender for the reasons set out by Judge Haesler SC. That leniency was abused by the offender and within a very short period. In my view having regard to the matters set out in the remarks on sentence and the surrounding circumstances, the appropriate sentence for the breach of the suspended sentence is a non-parole period of eight months with a parole period of four months. To take into account principles of totality I will commence the sentences for the offences committed whilst on the bond from 9 April 2013, eight months after the date the offender went into custody.
	
	
	Counts 1, 2, 3 and 8 all involved NP. Acts of intercourse involving young girls should be the subject of a penalty which marks the principles of general deterrence. Here also the requirements of specific or personal deterrence need to be borne in mind with this offender. This is particularly the case given the similarity of the offences in Count 1 and a number of the offences.
	
	
	The other concerning factor is the rapidity with which the other offences occurred after the earlier sentence and the offenderâs involvement with the Probation Service and the Sex Offenders Program.
	
	
	The sentence imposed on Count 1 should be largely accumulated in that what is involved is an entirely separate kind of criminality from those involved in Counts 2, 3 and 8. Count 1 involved an act of digital penetration with a young 14 year old girl who was, as far as the offender concerned, a willing participant in what had occurred. Although a young man, the offender was much older than the complainant.
	
	
	The sentences on Counts 2, 3 and 8 should be served concurrently. They involve essentially the same complaint of NP and arise out of the same method of communication and indeed the same relationship. They should be dealt with together to avoid a crushing sentence on the offender. There is some leniency to the offender in this approach.
	
	
	Counts 4, 5 and 6 involve SM and BT. Each of these offences represent an attempt by the offender to initiate and pursue electronic forms of communication with different young girls for sexual purposes, whilst nothing actually came of them that sensation of activity was not brought about by the offender.
	
	
	The sentences in relation to counts 4, 5 and 6 should be the subject of the same sentence. They will be served concurrently. The one common element is that the grooming of each complainant was clearly contemplated by the offender. Further, that he took steps to contact them repeatedly at a time when he must have known that he was restricted from such activities for those purposes.
	
	
	Counts 7 and 9. They (as with Count 8) involve offences against the Sex Offender Registration and supervision schemes. While the breaches are not significant the Form 1 offences indicate there are a number of related breaches over a period of time. The purposes of sentencing need to include as an aspect of specific deterrence the message to the offender that these schemes are to be strictly complied with.
	
	
	The sentences on Counts 7 and 9 should be the subject of concurrent sentences. They essentially relate to the same kinds of criminality concerned with the offenderâs reporting obligations and his compliance with the various Registration schemes.
	


Plea of guilty


	
	The Crown accepts, and I find it appropriate, there should be a discount on the sentence which otherwise would have been appropriate in the order of 25%. Timing of the plea meant that the complainants did not have to give evidence at the trial but were also spared of detail conferences with police and staff.
	
	
	The offender did not give evidence although I note there is no statutory requirement that the offender must give evidence before remorse can be taken into account: Butters v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 1. In Alverez v R; Farache v R [2011] NSWCCA 33, Buddin J said:
	


""It is important to emphasise that the court was not taken to any decision in which it has been authoritatively stated that an offender will only be entitled to the benefit of a finding of remorse in the event that he or she gives sworn evidence to that effect...Indeed it would be surprising if there was any such authority because it is readily apparent that an offender may, in some circumstances, demonstrate remorse by either words or conduct without giving sworn evidence...There are other types of conduct on the part of an offender which may well also be indicative of remorse"".


	
	To the extent relevant, there is some remorse reflected in the plea, however, that needs to be balanced against the impression gleaned from the various reports as to the offenderâs belief in his responsibility for criminal conduct involving young girls. Mr Ozen sought that there be an additional discount in respect of remorse and contrition inherent in the plea and as to what was said to be evident from Mrs Drake when she gave her evidence of what she observed the offenderâs reaction to have been while he has been in gaol. I do not think that there should be any further discount available to the offender than that contained in the 25% plea discount for the plea of guilty, in particular the timing of these repeat offences means the offender is not entitled to any leniency which otherwise would be extended to him particularly because of his age and the absence of prior convictions before the trial matter.
	


Special circumstances


	
	The offender is aged 23. He is still comparatively a very young man. This is his first time in custody and he has spent most of his time since August 2012 on limited association due to the nature of these offences.
	
	
	Mr Drake identifies as having an indigenous background. He comes from a supportive family but there is little indication or evidence that that family has been able to influence him to the extent of controlling his contact with young girls for clearly sexual purposes. In my view it is appropriate that there be a finding of special circumstances having regard particularly to his age and his need for long term supervision in circumstances which will require close scrutiny of both his contacts and his communications, in particular any electronic or telephone communication. That is likely to cause inconvenience to him but that is not necessarily the price that he will have to pay for the methods he has adopted in grooming young girls for sexual purposes over the period of time I have set out.
	
	
	I will be recommending as part of his parole conditions that any recommendations made following any participation by him in Cubit Program or any other sex offender program within the custodial environment be the subject of supervision by New South Wales Community Corrections. I will adjust the statutory ratio such that the total period of imprisonment is 60% of the total sentence on all charges. To ensure that there is no doubt about this matter I will specifically note that the adjustment to one of 60% applies to the total sentence imposed and that of the actual period of imprisonment in all the charges.
	


Forms 1


	
	I have taken into account the offences contained in the various Forms 1, being 1A, 1B and1C and in the way set out in the Act and the relevant authorities. In that way the sentences for Count 7, 8 and 9 reflect the additional criminality involved in the Form 1 offences.
	


Transparency of sentence


	
	On Count 1 the offender should be sentenced to a head sentence which would otherwise be imposed of three years and four monthsâ imprisonment to which would be applied the discount of 25% resulting in a head sentence of two years and six months. Applying my finding of special circumstances of two-thirds, that would mean the period of non-parole period imprisonment would be one of 18 months.
	
	
	Counts 2 and 3 involving Ms NP should be the subject of a concurrent term of three monthsâ imprisonment for each offence. Count 8 should be the subject of a fixed term of two monthsâ imprisonment. The sentence on these three counts should be served concurrently with the sentence on Count 1.
	
	
	With respect to the sentences for the matters involving the other three complainants, counts 4, 5 and 6 should be each of the order of a fixed term of three months imprisonment for each offence. The sentence in relation to count 7 should be the order of a fixed term of two months imprisonment and the sentence in relation to count 9 should be the order of a fixed term of one month imprisonment. Those two sentences are to be served concurrently.
	


Totality


	
	Turning back and considering the total sentence thereby to be imposed is one of the head sentence of two years and six months imprisonment and a non-parole period of one year and eight months imprisonment. I am satisfied that this is a proper total sentence.
	


Sentence

Commencement date


	
	The defence submits and the Crown accepts that the sentence should be backdated to commence on the 9 August 2012. Taking into account the breach of the suspended sentence, it appears that the offender was on a short period of bail which the Crown does not seek to be added to the overall sentence. The sentence will be backdated according to 9 August 2012 and that includes the sentence for the breach of bond attached to the s 12 suspended sentence.
	


Sentence


	
	You are convicted on each of those counts.
	
	
	In relation to each of the counts I impose the following sentence.
	
	
	For the breach of the s 12 bond I direct that the s 12 bond be revoked. The offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of eight months imprisonment commencing 9 August 2012 and expiring 8 April 2013, a balance of term of four months. The head sentence is twelve months, expiring 8 August 2013. So that is the suspended sentence that Judge Haesler SC imposed.
	
	
	In relation to breach of the Commonwealth bond I direct that no action be taken.
	
	
	In relation to Offence 1, that is the sexual intercourse involving NP, for which the maximum penalty is one of 10 years imprisonment. You are sentenced to a head sentence of two years and six months commencing on 9 April 2013 and expiring on 8 October 2015 consisting of a non-parole period of imprisonment of one year and six months commencing on 9 April 2013 and expiring on 8 October 2014.
	
	
	Offence 2, the grooming of NP, for which the maximum penalty is one of 12 years imprisonment. You are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of three months commencing on 9 February 2014 and expiring on 8 May 2014.
	
	
	Again, in relation to possess child abuse material for NP, a fixed term of imprisonment of three months commencing on 9 February 2014 and expiring on 8 May 2014.
	
	
	In relation to Count 4, in relation to the complainant PS, a fixed term of imprisonment of three months commencing on 9 July 2014 and expiring on 8 October 2014.
	
	
	Offence 5, that is the one involving CS for which the maximum penalty is also 12 years imprisonment, you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of three months commencing on 9 July 2014 expiring on 8 October 2014.
	
	
	In relation to Count 6, re LT, a fixed term of imprisonment of three months commencing on 9 July 2014 and expiring on 8 October 2014.
	
	
	In relation to Offence 7, not informing the police of your current residential address, taking into account Form 1A, I fix a term of imprisonment of two months commencing on 9 October 2014 and expiring on 8 December 2014.
	
	
	For Offence 8, in relation to regular unsupervised contact with NP, taking into account Form 1B, you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two months commencing on 9 February 2014 and expiring on 8 April 2014.
	
	
	For Offence 9, that of writing to EB requesting to see your son, taking into account Form 1C, again a fixed term of imprisonment of one month commencing on 9 October 2014 and expiring 8 November 214.
	
	
	So the overall effect of the sentence will be that you will be released from custody on 8 December 2014. Do you understand that?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: That is the operative date as far as you are concerned.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: That will mean that you will be home in time for Christmas. I want you to bear this in mind Mr Drake, on one view I have dealt with you very leniently because I am concerned that you are a young man who was out of control when you were but that you need to be fully aware that that has got to stop. You were dealt with very leniently indeed by Judge Haesler SC in this Court in my view and you abused that leniency and that opportunity pretty quickly.
	
	
	On 8 December 2014 I recommend the offenderâs release to parole subject to the following conditions:
	
	
	To maintain and observe such conditions:
	



	
	as may be imposed upon him by those conducting the CUBIT programme or any other sex offenders program, in particular to notify Community Corrections of his address or any address that you occupy;
	
	
	comply with any requirements as to the use of electronic or telephonic communications including Facebook and the operation of any mobile phone and that he notify Community Corrections of the address;
	
	
	That he attend within 14 days of his release to parole any one of the following services as may be recommended by Community Corrections:
	



	
	Forensic Psychology Services Pty Ltd at Surry Hills;
	
	
	Pastoral Counselling Institute; or
	
	
	NSW Commission for Children and Young Peopleâs Child Sex Offender Counsellor Accreditation Service
	


And comply with any recommendations of that service.

		14 January 2015",2014-11-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765358,Executors of the Estate of the late Valerie Marshall Olsen v Second East Holdings Pty Ltd t/as Sotheby's Australia [2014] NSWSC 1675,"EX TEMPORE Judgment (revised)
1These proceedings concern a painting made by the celebrated artist Dr John Olsen in 1964 called ""The Mother"". 
2The plaintiffs, Mr Tim Olsen and Ms Louise Olsen are the executors of the estate of Dr Olsen's late wife, Mrs Valerie Olsen.  Mrs Olsen died in 2011.
3The defendant, Second East Auction Holdings Pty Ltd trading as Sotheby's Australia (""Sotheby's"") is an art auction house.  Sotheby's is in possession of the painting on behalf of a client who has entrusted the painting with Sotheby's for sale. 
4The plaintiffs claim that their mother was, and her estate now is, the owner of the painting.  The plaintiffs wish to bring an action in conversion against the person in possession of the painting (that is evidently Sotheby's client) to seek delivery up of the painting. 
5Mr Tim Olsen (""Mr Olsen""), who was only two years of age when the painting was made, says he first saw the painting in July 2014 when a business acquaintance of his drew his attention to the fact that Sotheby's was auctioning the painting for sale.  Thereafter, correspondence was exchanged between the plaintiffs' solicitor and Sotheby's solicitor.  It is not necessary for present purposes to set out the detail of that correspondence.  Suffice to say that the plaintiffs demanded that Sotheby's disclose the provenance of the painting and that Sotheby's refused to do so. 
6The plaintiffs have now commenced these proceedings seeking an order under Uniform Civil Procedure Rules r 5.2, by way of preliminary discovery.
7In substance, what the plaintiffs seek is an order that an officer of Sotheby's attend and be examined as to the identity of the vendor of the painting; that is, the identity of the client who has placed the painting in Sotheby's possession for sale. 
8It would be a serious matter for such an order to be made. Although there is undoubted power in the Court to make such an order, in the circumstances of this case that order would oblige Sotheby's to disclose the identity of its client who, for any number of reasons, may not wish that his, her or its identity be disclosed. 
9The matter before me today is an application by the plaintiffs for interlocutory relief.  The plaintiffs seek an injunction restraining Sotheby's from disposing, selling or in any way transferring the painting until further order. 
10The urgency of the application is that the plaintiffs had sought an undertaking from Sotheby's that it not dispose of the painting, that undertaking has not been forthcoming, and that there is at least a prospect of the painting being submitted for sale in the very near future absent restraint. 
11In order to gain such relief, the plaintiffs must show that there is a prima facie case or a serious question to be tried that Mrs Olsen owned, and her estate now owns, the painting. 
12The evidence adduced in support of that proposition is slender indeed.
13The plaintiffs draw attention to an inscription, on the rear of the painting's canvas which reads: ""For my darling Valerie, John Olsen '64"".  Mr O'Neill, who appeared for the plaintiffs, submitted that it should be inferred from the inscription that Dr Olsen gave the painting to Mrs Olsen as a gift in 1964.  So much can be accepted.  It does not follow, however, that Mrs Olsen remained the owner of the painting nor that the estate now owns the painting. 
14Mr Olsen gives evidence of what he ""understood"" from ""various conversations with my father and my mother"".  He does not set out the terms or even the substance of those conversations.  He says the effect of conversations was that the painting had been done on an ""Hors d'Commerce"" basis; that is, as I understand, on the basis that it would not be sold. 
15Mr Olsen also deposes to a conversation with his mother where he said she said:
""There was a painting that John did for me when Louise was born that disappeared and it has constantly worried me throughout my life."" 
16Mr Olsen does not say when this conversation took place.  
17The plaintiffs also point to a label which appears to be attached to the back of the painting which is headed ""Commonwealth Festival Exhibition, Nottingham 1966"".  Mr Olsen gives evidence about that as follows: 
""From the photographs of the back of the Painting it appears that the Painting was loaned to the 1967 Nottingham Commonwealth Exhibition and Festival which took place in the United Kingdom. 
I am unable to contact the Nottingham Commonwealth Exhibition and Festival to obtain details about the handling of the Painting as to the best of my knowledge the festival no longer exists"". 
18Mr Olsen also annexes to his affidavit a letter written by his father, Dr Olsen, on 4 August 2014 which is addressed ""To Whom It May Concern"" and which states:""I have no memory of selling this painting as it was a gift to my wife Valerie, and I therefore require a provenance.""  
19Despite the fact that this controversy has been brewing since July 2014, no evidence has been adduced from the only person likely to have any direct knowledge of the matter, Dr Olsen himself.  Dr Olsen is elderly, but I am told in good health and living in the Southern Highlands.  It is true that this application has been brought on urgently.  But there is not even any evidence on information and belief as to what more Dr Olsen could say about this matter. 
20Mr O'Neill points to observations made by Mr David Stein, a painting conservator:
""The painting was previously rolled and has been recently restretched onto a new wooden strainer...[t]here is no apparent surface coating, and no surface dirt or dust.""
21The implication of that evidence is, as I understand it, that the painting has been, until reasonably recently, stored in a rolled up manner.
22However, there is no evidence that, until this year, the painting has ever been reported stolen, despite the fact almost 50 years have elapsed since it ""disappeared"".  There is no evidence at all before me of the circumstances in which the painting went to Nottingham.  There is no evidence before me as to when or in what circumstance in which it ""disappeared"", or what steps were taken to recover it since then.  There is no evidence as to what, if anything, was done by Dr Olsen, or Mrs Olsen, or anyone else concerning the painting's whereabouts for the 47 years that have passed since the Nottingham exhibition. 
23In those circumstances, I am not satisfied the plaintiffs have established a prima facie case or serious question such as would warrant the grant of an interlocutory injunction. 
24I do however propose to the give the plaintiffs a chance to adduce further evidence from Dr Olsen, and seek to renew this application in the light of that evidence. 
25Accordingly, I stand the matter over to the Duty Judge on 26 November 2014.
26I reserve the costs of today.

2765383,Finch v R [2014] NSWCCA 278,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2ADMAS J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

3R A HULME J: Stephen John Finch (the applicant) applied for leave to appeal in respect of sentences imposed upon him in the District Court by his Honour Judge Berman SC on 12 April 2013. 

4For an offence of supplying methylamphetamine contrary to s 25(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years dating from 25 November 2012. For an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of lysergide, commonly known as LSD, contrary to s 25(2) of the same Act, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years dating from 25 November 2013. 

5The overall sentence was one of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. 

6His Honour also dealt with an offence of possession of an unregistered firearm (an air rifle) that was before him on a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). The applicant was convicted but no penalty was imposed pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). In sentencing the applicant for the offence of supplying LSD, the judge also took into account at the applicant's request four further offences listed on a Form 1 document: possession of cannabis leaf; possession of cannabis resin; not keeping a firearm safely; and possession of ammunition.

Facts

7The applicant had pleaded not guilty to the drug supply offences but was found guilty after a jury trial. 

8The learned sentencing judge recited the facts and the findings that he made as follows:

""Police went to Mr Finch's [home at Pindimar (Port Stephens)] on 1 September 2010 after having received a tip off from an associate of Mr Finch's. ... [They found] a large number of various types of drugs in various locations throughout Mr Finch's premises. In particular there were substantial quantities of methylamphetamine in four locations and LSD both in liquid form and impregnated into perforated cardboard sheets.

Because of the quantities involved, the jury verdicts on the two counts do not establish necessarily that the offender was in possession for the purposes of supply of all of the methylamphetamine and LSD found in his premises. It is for me to make findings consistent with the jury's verdict as to the factual basis on which I will sentence him. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Finch was in possession of all of the methylamphetamine and all of the LSD found in his premises and given of course the deeming provision I will sentence him on the basis that he was in possession of those drugs for the purposes of supply.

When police went into Mr Finch's home they saw him in the process of attempting to conceal a plastic container containing 18.6 grams of methylamphetamine behind a bookshelf. Further searching revealed a small quantity of methylamphetamine in a film canister found in the drawer of a coffee table and three separate packages of methylamphetamine found within an ice cream container located by police in Mr Finch's laundry. These separate packages contained methylamphetamine weighing 47 grams, 52.8 grams and 19.2 grams. Thus the total amount of methylamphetamine in Mr Finch's possession for the purposes of supply was well over 100 grams.

The quantities involved in the LSD charge are not as easily determined. This is because some of the LSD was contained in cardboard sheets. Although the cardboard which had been impregnated with LSD was clearly a substance containing a prohibited drug within the meaning of the admixture provisions of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, in assessing the seriousness of the offender's conduct and when comparing it to other offenders, account must be taken of the weight of the cardboard. There was of course no cardboard involved in the remainder of the LSD which was found. That was found to be in vials or ampoules which contained a liquid with LSD in it, the total weight of the liquid being almost 100 grams or almost fifty times a large commercial quantity. [Counsel for the applicant] relies on the circumstance that the purity of LSD in that liquid was, he said, low, but I simply do not know how much is required to give an effect to a drug user. I simply do not know whether most liquid LSD is of that purity or lower or higher.""

9The judge referred to other matters relevant to an assessment of the seriousness of the offences:

Caution is required in sentencing for drug supply offences in focussing too much on the quantities involved. That is particularly the case where LSD is involved. The large commercial quantity for this drug is about the same as half a teaspoon of sugar. Being in possession for supply of 50 times the large commercial quantity specified by the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act of LSD cannot be equated with an offence involving 50 times the large commercial quantity prescribed for a drug like heroin (namely 50 kgs).

Despite this, the offences, especially the LSD offence, were ""serious indeed"".

There were no trappings of excessive wealth.

But there were many things revealed in the trial that were consistent with the applicant being a person who dealt in drugs much more often than he had said in his evidence. There was a video surveillance system at his home. Various notebooks found by the police contained recordings of drug sales.

The applicant said in his evidence at the trial that the drugs had been delivered to him by a person identified as ""CJ"" shortly before the police executed the search warrant. He claimed that CJ had ""loaded him up"" because of the criminal charges that CJ was facing. 

10In relation to the last matter, the judge said that he was nevertheless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant well knew what CJ had left at his home; the applicant was in possession of all of it; and he intended to supply the drugs, not return them to CJ as he had claimed. His Honour continued:

""In other words, in the offender's favour, I am going to sentence him on the basis that CJ did in effect load him up by maximising the quantities of drugs he left behind with Mr Finch but I repeat yet again Mr Finch well knew about those quantities, was in possession of them and intended to supply all of those drugs.""

11His Honour concluded that the LSD supply offence ""was a matter of considerable seriousness"".

Personal circumstances of the applicant and other matters relevant to sentence

12The applicant was aged 45 at the time of the offences and 47 at the time of sentence. 

13The judge noted that he had prior convictions, including for cultivating cannabis and driving whilst under the influence of a drug. There were other offences but nothing approaching the seriousness of the offences for which he stood for sentence. 

14A report by Dr Anthony Slowiaczek, psychiatrist, related how the applicant had been diagnosed with ADHD in February 2003. The doctor thought he had suffered from this condition since childhood. He prescribed Dexamphetamine which the applicant had since taken on a regular basis.

15The judge noted the evidence that the prison authorities were reluctant to allow an amphetamine-based drug to be prescribed to an inmate: ""I have got no doubt that Mr Finch will find it difficult to receive his medication in custody. There may be times when he does but he will find things harder.""

16His Honour also considered that the applicant's mental condition was relevant in assessing the effect of the delay between the applicant's arrest in September 2010 and his sentencing in April 2013. He accepted that uncertainty as to the ultimate outcome must have affected the applicant deeply.

17There were also reports by Mr Tim Watson-Munro, psychologist, relating to the applicant's three children: twins aged 15 and an older brother aged 18 at the time of sentence. The applicant had been the sole carer for the children since his marriage to their mother broke down in 2003. He had a very close relationship with them and they had been devastated by his arrest. They had been required to move to Sydney to live with their mother. Mr Watson-Munro found that they were experiencing considerable symptoms of depression and anxiety and had been adversely affected in a variety of ways. One had even been moved to consider suicide.

18There was an impressive array of character references and the applicant's daughter gave oral evidence. 

19The judge had the following to say about the last two mentioned issues:

""He came to Court today supported by many friends and family. Tendered to me was a very impressive list of references attesting to his kindness and concern for others in the community. According to those references Mr Finch was a man of good character in many different ways. Many people in those references spoke of specific examples of kindness that Mr Finch showed to those in need of help. I have to say that not many of us could marshal such an impressive array of references from people who all speak of his character in glowing terms, as I said, in particular his kindness and generosity to others in need of a helping hand. Most of the references also refer to the fact that Mr Finch is a good father to his four children. He has been a single parent to his three sons for most of their lives. He is entitled to be very proud of what he did for his children. They are missing him greatly. What Mr Finch is not entitled to be proud of is the fact that he has risked their welfare by committing these most serious offences.

Tendered today were three reports of Mr Tim Watson-Munro ... [concerning] Mr Finch's three sons. There is no doubt that they will be hurt by the circumstance that Mr Finch must necessarily spend a lengthy time in gaol. Unfortunately, such hardship is commonplace, many single parents are sent to gaol for offences and many people are thus harmed. [Counsel for the applicant] did not suggest that I would find that the hardship to the three boys was exceptional but did ask me to take it into account as part of the general mix of subjective matters which I will do. In particular, I have no doubt that Mr Finch feels deeply ashamed and guilty that it was his misconduct which has hurt his three boys. He knows full well that it is he who has deprived them of his care. He knows full well that he only has himself to blame for the predicament that they now find themselves in.

Sentencing someone from such a close family shows how the devastation of losing a family member to a gaol sentence spreads like a ripple in a pond, but I do have to say that similar devastation occurs when families lose members to the terrible scourge of drug use. That is why these offences are so serious.""

20The judge was satisfied that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. The sentence to be imposed would, however, have ""a significant personal deterrent to him ever doing anything like this in the future"". 

21His Honour rejected a submission that general deterrence was of less significance in relation to the supply of LSD because there was evidence that the market for this substance in the community was less than for other prohibited drugs: ""General deterrence is needed for all drug supplies whether or not a particular drug is supplied commonly or rarely"". 

22The judge concluded his sentencing remarks by reiterating the maximum penalties and, in respect of the LSD offence, the standard non-parole period that had been prescribed by Parliament: ""the legislature thus gives guidance to sentencing judges which we must not ignore"". 

Grounds of appeal

1. The sentence is manifestly excessive.

2. The sentencing Judge erred in failing to have regard to relevant mitigating factors in:

(a) Determining the overall penalty; and 

(b) in assessing the extent to which he would depart from the standard non-parole period.

Submissions

23The submissions in support of ground 2 raise matters that are said to support the proposition that the sentence is manifestly excessive. Accordingly there is no need to deal with the grounds separately. 

24Ms Francis, counsel for the applicant in this Court, made plain that the sole focus of the application was the sentence for the large commercial supply of LSD. There was no complaint about the sentence for the methylamphetamine supply offence nor with the one year period of accumulation upon it of the LSD sentence.

25The submissions for the applicant identified a number of factors, related to both the objective seriousness of the offence and various favourable subjective matters, that supported the proposition that the sentence was manifestly excessive.

26As to the objective seriousness of the offence, it was submitted that there was an absence of planning, premeditation and organised criminal activity. These are features commonly found in cases of large commercial drug supply and so their absence in this case was a matter of significant mitigation. Allied with the absence of these factors was the fact that the applicant came into possession of the drugs by them being foisted upon him; he did not acquire them by choice and nor did he pay any money for them; and, whilst there was no challenge to the judge's finding that the applicant possessed all of the drugs for the purpose of supply, there was no evidence of how he might have effected such supply or inevitability that he would have supplied them.

27It was submitted that all of these matters pointed to a lower level of objective seriousness and moral culpability than was reflected in the sentence imposed.

28As to the applicant's subjective case, the submissions focussed upon the applicant's mental condition, his good character (as established by ""the extraordinary character references"") and the evidence concerning his children. It was accepted that ""the sentencing judge acknowledged that the applicant's mental health frailties would be exacerbated on account of the stress associated with his being estranged from his children"". But it was submitted that the impact upon the children was ""quite exceptional"" and the associated anxiety upon the applicant, being in custody and not receiving his medication, was a very significant factor on sentence. The psychological condition of the children was something that rendered being in custody more onerous.

29It was included in the written submissions that ""the sentencing judge was silent as to the amelioration of the application of general deterrence having regard to the applicant's mental illness"". There is no ground of appeal contending that this was erroneous; it may merely have been an observation. If error was contended, the short answer is that the judge was not asked to ameliorate the application of general deterrence on that basis and the evidence did not mandate that he should.

30The overall submission for the applicant was that, having regard to all of the above matters, ""a sentence of nine years imprisonment is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of unpremeditated offending committed in the context of a rash acquiescence in the manipulative conduct of the person who had historically supplied the applicant with drugs"". 

Consideration

31Most of the matters to which counsel drew attention were dealt with in one way or another by the judge in the course of his sentencing remarks. He recounted the facts of the applicant's offending in a way that the applicant does not now challenge. Explicit in the narrative is the way the applicant came to be in possession of the drugs and implicit in it is that there was no planning, premeditation or organised criminal activity. The judge did not say anything to suggest how, when, where or to who the applicant might have sought to supply the drugs. He determined that the offences were ""serious"" simply on the basis of the quantities of the drugs involved, of which the applicant was aware, and that his purpose after he came into possession of them was to supply them. The evidence did not support any further findings and none were made.

32The judge was also obviously fully cognisant of the favourable aspects of the applicant's subjective case. His Honour was clearly impressed by the force of the evidence as to his prior good character. He acknowledged that the children ""will be hurt by the circumstance that [their father] must necessarily spend a lengthy time in gaol"". He accepted that the applicant ""will find things harder"" on account of his ADHD condition and the difficulties in receiving medication in gaol. 

33I am not persuaded that the sentencing judge erred by overlooking some matter that rendered the offences less serious or by falling to have regard to relevant mitigating subjective factors in the assessment of sentence. Ground 2 fails.

34The applicant's case boils down to the question whether, when regard is had to all of the circumstances of the case, the sentence for the large commercial supply offence is manifestly excessive. Is it unreasonable or plainly unjust? 

35The case is somewhat unusual as Ms Francis sought to characterise it. If there is a precedent for someone being sentenced for a large commercial drug supply offence after having been gifted the drugs and then being informed against by the giver I am unaware of it. However, that is not all there is to it. The applicant tried but failed to persuade the jury at his trial that he was only a temporary custodian of the drugs for CJ. The jury's verdict required that he be sentenced for being in possession of significant quantities of prohibited drugs and that the purpose of such possession was to supply them to another or others.

36The circumstances could be described as truly exceptional if the offender was an innocent where matters of prohibited drugs are concerned. But that is not a description to which the applicant could aspire. He admitted to having been a regular user of drugs. The judge referred to the police having found written records of past drug transactions, albeit they involved (according to the applicant) small quantities of cannabis. The judge considered that the applicant had sought to minimise the level of his past drug dealing. He noted that the applicant's home was equipped with a video surveillance system.

37Ms Francis submitted that the criminality involved in the two offences was more comparable than the differential in the individual sentences suggested. In other words, the sentence for the LSD offence should have been closer to that for the methylamphetamine offence. She argued that this indicated that the judge had given inappropriate prominence to the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period prescribed for large commercial supply offences.

38I am not persuaded that the sentences disclose error in that respect. There was a significant differential in the maximum penalties for the two offences, life imprisonment for count one and 15 years for count two, and so one might expect that to be reflected in the sentences passed. If there is anything erroneous in the differential, it is equally open to argue that the applicant was fortunate that the sentence for count two was not higher. Two years for possessing for the purpose of supply over 100g of methylamphetamine is a relatively modest sentence.

39The sentencing judge was conscious of the need for a strong element of general deterrence to be factored into the assessment of drug supply sentences. The quantity of the drugs involved in this case was relevant (although, rightly, the sentencing judge did not regard this as determinative). There was well over 100g of methylamphetamine (the traffickable quantity is 2g and the commercial quantity is 250g) and there was more than 50 times the large commercial quantity of LSD. 

40Notwithstanding that the applicant had quite a compelling subjective case to mitigate the level of punishment to be imposed, I am not persuaded that the sentence of 8 years for the LSD offence and the overall sentence of 9 years for the two offences is manifestly excessive.

Orders

41I propose the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.

2765387,Legault v R [2014] NSWCCA 271,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Adams J and R A Hulme J.

2By contending that the sentence was manifestly excessive the applicant was submitting that it was unreasonable and plainly unjust: Hili v R; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [59].

3Because of the reliance placed on sentencing statistics in this case it must be emphasised that appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate is not justified simply because the result is materially different from sentences imposed in other cases: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [58]. Such statistics can do no more than provide a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 205 A Crim R 1 at [303]-[305].

4In the present case each of Adams J and R A Hulme J have set out the factors relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence and the applicant's subjective circumstances. Taking all those factors into account I agree that the sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive.

5I agree with the orders proposed by Adams J. 

6ADAMS J:

Introduction

7The applicant was convicted on his plea of guilty on 13 March 2013 on one count of importing a commercial quantity of methamphetamine on 26 October 2012 contrary to subsection 307.1(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and sentenced to a term of 9 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 6 years to date from 26 October 2012. The learned sentencing judge applied a discount of 25 per cent to reflect the assistance afforded by the plea of guilty so that the starting point for the sentence was a head sentence of 12 years and 6 months, the result being rounded down slightly. The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment and/or 7500 penalty units. 

8The applicant appeals on the single ground that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 

Facts

9The applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings. The facts surrounding the commission of the offence are set out in the reasons of the learned sentencing judge and were not controversial. The following is largely drawn from that account. On 26 October 2012 the applicant arrived at Mascot International Airport from Vancouver. On enquiry by a customs officer he said, in effect, he was travelling as a tourist. When his suitcase was x-rayed a false bottom was disclosed containing irregular packages which, on scanning, returned a positive result for methylamphetamine. The packages contained a white crystalline substance weighing just over 2,780 grams, the pure weight of amphetamine being 2,033.9 grams. The commercial quantity stipulated for this drug is 750 grams. The applicant was arrested just before 4pm and declined to take part in an interview which, as his Honour observed, was his right. 

10The applicant's DNA was not found on the contents of the suitcase or on either of the packages concealed in it. Although it appeared that someone had, as the sentencing judge said, ""gone to a lot of trouble preparing the suitcase and hiding the drugs and endeavouring to avoid detection. It does not appear that the [applicant] was involved in that process at least"". The applicant was travelling with a person listed as his emergency contact who was also carrying packages of drugs concealed in a false bottom in her suitcase. The applicant's Canadian passport had been issued on 12 July 2012. This fact and that he was travelling with an accomplice also carrying drugs showed that there had been a substantial level of pre-planning and organisation in relation to the venture generally, although his Honour did not regard the applicant as responsible for this. 

11The applicant told a psychologist whose report was tendered on his behalf that he had incurred debts for the purchase of drugs and feared reprisals if he did not repay the money, and accepted the opportunity offered to repay his debt by transporting the luggage to Australia. He said that he would have been beaten up had he not repaid his drug debt and feared that physical assault might have rendered him a paraplegic. The sentencing judge noted, in respect of the applicant's statement about his motivation for the offence, that it was basically a self-serving statement and thus one to which little weight could be attached. He accepted the applicant needed money for one reason or another.

Prior criminal record

12The applicant, who was 29 years of age as at the date of the offence, had been convicted in the juvenile court in 1997 and 2000, receiving probation for assault with a weapon, theft of higher than an amount of $5,000, theft with breaking and entering and criminal harassment. Other entries included, in May 2003, theft in an amount less than $5,000 and damage in an amount less than $5,000 for which he was fined and placed on probation. In 2003 he also was placed on probation for the possession of substances with intent of trafficking and, in 2005, breaking and entering with intent. His Honour said of this record that it denied the applicant ""leniency that would otherwise be available to a person who had an unblemished record"". No issue was taken with this categorisation. 

Subjective features

13The following personal history is taken from the psychologist's report. The applicant stopped attending school at the age of 15 after he had been seriously assaulted with an axe, requiring him to spend something over six weeks in hospital and six months in a physical rehabilitation program, needing to occasionally take morphine medication to manage the pain of his back. The neighbourhood in which he grew up was a violent one and the applicant had witnessed a stabbing when he was aged six or seven and also someone being shot dead at this time. The psychologist thought the applicant gave a psychologically plausible account of his history and concluded that his psychosocial development was impeded by learning problems at school and severely impaired by the assault he suffered at the age of 15 which left him with chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder. The applicant said he coped with his distress by smoking marijuana and relying to some extent on methamphetamines and ecstasy. He entered into a relationship which, however, became strained and broke down about three months before the offence. He said that, after this, his psychological health deteriorated and his use of illicit drugs increased. He told the psychologist that he was sorry for transporting drugs and it was good that the officer apprehended him. He said, ""I made a mistake"". He expressed a goal of improving himself in gaol by remaining abstinent from drugs, and learning English and work skills. The applicant has a young son, born in 2008 with whom he talks from time to time by telephone, and finds the separation stressful. 

14A psychiatric report of March 2008 confirmed the details of the attack on the applicant and the resulting continuing physical and psychological problems. His permanent deficits were estimated at 15 per cent of (as I take it) normal functioning. 

15The sentencing judge mentioned other subjective material which supported the submission (accepted by his Honour) that the applicant had good prospects for rehabilitation. His Honour accepted that the applicant had been seriously assaulted at about the age of 15 with consequential post-traumatic stress disorder. He did not accept that the applicant's mental state contributed to his undertaking the offence or that it rendered him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. On the other hand, his Honour accepted that the applicant's gaol time would be more onerous because of his mental condition. The offence was committed for financial gain. It appears that his Honour did not accept as reliable the applicant's statement of remorse to the psychologist, stating that he did not find any evidence of remorse and attributing his plea of guilty to the fact that he was caught red-handed. 

16The sentencing judge took into account the hardship to the applicant by virtue of his isolation from his son and his mother. 

Submissions

17Mr Corish of counsel for the applicant did not dispute the findings of fact made by the sentencing judge both as to the objective circumstances of the offence and the applicant's subjective circumstances. However, he submitted that his Honour was in error in considering that the non-parole period of 6 years ""is the minimum that could possibly accommodate the gravity of the offence"". He submitted that the statistics relating to sentences for the applicant's offence and a number of judgments in this Court indicated, taken together with the circumstances, that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 

18Mr Corish referred to several judgments in this Court and one in the District Court. In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 205 A Crim R 1 McClellan CJ at CL considered the sentences imposed in a large number of cases concerned with offences of the present kind, dividing them helpfully (if I may say so) into four categories. The fourth group was as follows - 

""[215] In this group the head sentences range from 6.25 years through to 8 years, while the non-parole periods range from around 3 to 4.5 years. The cases are roughly split between those in which the offenders pleaded guilty and those in which they pleaded not guilty. Quantities of drugs range from 1 kg to 30 kg and offenders occupy roles variously described as instigators, overseers, collectors and couriers. Many offenders in this group had good antecedents and no prior convictions.""

It was submitted by Mr Corish that the applicant fell within this category, indeed towards the lower end of it given that he pleaded guilty, had a quantity of drugs close to the lower end of the specified range and occupied a role which could not be fairly described as rising to that of instigator or overseer. Although the sentencing judge eschewed describing his role, in this context he would plainly have been a courier. On the other hand, as Mr Corish concedes, the plaintiff did not enjoy unblemished antecedents. 

19Mr Corish referred us to Speer v R [2004] NSWCCA 118, where the appellant had been sentenced to imprisonment for 16 years with a non-parole period of 10 years on his plea of guilty for importing a commercial quantity of heroin, the gross of which was almost 3.5 kilograms of which a little over 2.5 kilograms was pure heroin. The commercial quantity is 1.5 kilograms. The maximum penalty is the same as for the present case. The circumstances of the offence were similar to this case, the applicant having brought into Mascot Airport a suitcase within the walls of which the heroin was found. The case needed to be dismantled in order to retrieve the packages. It was conceded by the Crown that Speer was a courier and his involvement was at ""a fairly low level"". The plea was late and, accordingly, the discount allowed by the Court on resentencing was 10 per cent. This Court substituted a sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.

20The other case pointed to by Mr Corish is R v Basri [2009] NSWDC 398. Ms Basri brought 3.04 kilograms of a heroin mixture, containing 1.88 kilograms of pure heroin to Australia concealed in a suitcase. She assisted police in a controlled delivery of the heroin. Her role was that of a courier. Ms Basri was 39 years of age at the time of sentence, having been convicted following trial. She may have suffered some level of traumatic brain injury with long-lasting sequelae, with intellectual functioning assessed as being in the extremely low range (in the eighth percentile). The sentencing judge was sceptical that her level of intellectual impoverishment was quite so extreme given evidence that she was able to function well above the capacity of persons at the assessed level. She had no prior criminal convictions. The sentencing judge thought her contrition, though imperfect, existed at some level and prospects of rehabilitation were good. The starting point for her sentence was 7 Â½ years imprisonment, reduced by a 30 per cent discount for assistance. The non-parole period was 3 years and 3 months. Mr Corish submitted that the applicant should have received a sentence less severe than this (I assume in respect of the starting point). 

21The JIRS statistics relating to sentences for this offence were tendered in the sentencing proceedings. At that time they showed that 9 of 15 offenders (60%) were sentenced to terms of 7 years or less with terms of 9 (1 offender), 10 (3 offenders) and 15 years (2 offenders) being imposed on the offender each. Twelve offenders were sentenced to non-parole periods of 5 years or less with only three offenders being sentenced to non-parole periods of greater than 6 years. On the appeal, Mr Corish tendered the then current version (to 30 June 2014) which dealt with 33 cases of importing commercial quantities of methamphetamine. He submitted it was significant that the table showed 54% of offenders received a non-parole period of 4 years or less. I note that thirty-three per cent of non-parole periods were 6 years or more and the same percentage of overall sentences were of 10 years imprisonment or more. Mr Corish accepted that the statistics have limited utility but submitted that they provide some support for his contention, in substance, that the sentence here was excessive in that they showed most offenders received lighter sentences than the applicant. 

22It should be noted that the statistics for importations of commercial quantities of all border controlled drugs or plants (the most appropriate category) as at 30 June 2014 (86 cases), the percentage of non-parole periods of six years or more is 45% and that of overall sentences of 10 years or more was 42%, with only 35% of non-parole periods being 4 years or less. The latest table (100 offenders) shows this trend to have continued as at 30 September 2014. 

23Mr Corish also submitted that, although he accepted the applicant's history of mental and physical issues did not of itself reduce the need for general deterrence, it did reduce his moral culpability.

24The Crown prosecutor submitted that the sentence was within the judge's discretion and cited, inter alia, R v Otto [2005] NSWCCA 333; (2005) 157 A Crim R 525 (importation of 3025.5 grams of cocaine, 2136.8 grams pure cocaine - commercial quantity 2 kilograms - resulting in a sentence, after 25% discount, of 10 years 6 months, and a 7 years non-parole period). He contended that the statistics did not demonstrate that the sentence under appeal was outside the sentencing discretion. 

Consideration

25It is true that there are cases where the difference between the sentence imposed and the statistical range of a significant number of offences of the same kind is so marked as to at least raise the question whether the particular sentence is within the discretionary range or confirm a conclusion drawn otherwise that the sentence is excessive (or, for that matter, unjustifiably lenient). The statistics here are only capable of real (if limited) significance if Mr Corish made good his contention that the applicant's offence was objectively well within the lower end of criminality and there were significantly favourable subjective features. Certainly, he was no or little more than a courier but the quantity of drugs he carried into Australia was considerable, whilst his subjective features were only marginally favourable. Furthermore, the lack of information about the underlying cases at all events must give the statistics only very limited utility. Also, considerable care needs to be taken when comparing non-parole periods, since the reasons for determining non-parole periods will vary significantly and somewhat unpredictably from case to case. In the result, it seems to me that the statistics relied on by Mr Corish do not raise any question mark about the severity of the applicant's sentence.

26So far as Speer is concerned, it appears that the Court accepted that Speer was remorseful and his prospects of rehabilitation were good. It also needs to be borne in mind that a commercial quantity of heroin is stipulated at 1.5 kilograms so that Speer's importation was very much at the lower end of this category whilst the commercial quantity of methamphetamine is half this amount, namely 0.75 kilograms. The fourth category listed in McClellan CJ at CL's judgment in de la Rosa shows no more than there are cases in which sentences for importing commercial quantities of drugs are less than that imposed on this applicant.

27Given the sentencing judge's conclusion, which was open, that the applicant's mental condition did not contribute in a material way to the commission of the offence and the lack of any evidence that his physical condition did so, the submission that either reduced his moral culpability cannot be accepted. Even if it should have been given some weight, that would not have indicated, in my view, that the sentence was excessive.

Conclusion 

28Although I would agree that the sentence imposed on the applicant is severe and above the mean statistical range for importing a commercial quantity of methamphetamine, I am not satisfied that it was so severe as to demonstrate that the sentencing judge's discretion miscarried. Accordingly, I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but the appeal be dismissed.

29R A HULME J: I am grateful for the summary of all of the facts and circumstances of the case provided in the judgment of Adams J.

30As I understand the case for the applicant, it is contended that the sentence is manifestly excessive when regard is had to the criminality being at the ""lower end of the range"" for this type of offence and the applicant's subjective circumstances (physical and mental ill health, early plea of guilty, and more onerous custodial conditions). The reliance upon statistics and other cases was not said to establish the conclusion of manifest excess but to confirm it.

31This is a case involving the importation of almost three times the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. I appreciate that the upper end of the commercial range is infinite but 2033.9 grams of the drug is not insignificant. The sentencing judge found that the planning and organisation that went into the venture ""must have been quite substantial"". He accepted that the offence was committed for ""substantial financial gain"". I do not accept the applicant's characterisation of such an offence as being at the ""lower end of the range"".

32The sentencing judge made a number of favourable findings as to the applicant's subjective circumstances. There is no contention of patent error. An allowance of 25 per cent was made for the early plea of guilty. However, there was no evidence of remorse and the applicant was disentitled to leniency on account of his criminal history. He was, however, found to have ""fair"" to ""good"" rehabilitation prospects. There was no assertion that the judge was in error in finding that general deterrence and the need to impose adequate punishment were significant considerations.

33Counsel accepted that the statistics and the cases to which reference was made do not, on their own, make good the contention that the sentence is manifestly excessive. I have come to the view that the applicant has failed at the first level of the argument which was put in terms that the sentence was ""self-evidently excessive"".

34I agree with orders proposed by Adams J.

2765388,Khoury v R [2014] NSWCCA 272,"Judgment
1BATHURST CJ:  I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of Adams J and R A Hulme J in draft.
2I agree with R A Hulme J that Messrs Nehme and Bayeh were engaged in the same criminal enterprise as the applicant.  However, as each of Adams J and R A Hulme J have said, nothing turns on this fact.
3Subject to that matter I agree with the reasons of Adams J.  I also agree with the orders with which he proposes.4ADAMS J:  
Introduction
5The applicant was sentenced on 8 February 2013, having pleaded guilty to two offences as follows - 
Count 1 - That on 27 March 2009, with intent to obtain a financial advantage for Chanti Pty Limited, he made a false statement to the Office of Fair Trading in relation to the sale of consignment vehicles contrary to s 178BB(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (now repealed which carried a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment).  A Form 1 matter was taken into account in relation to this count (giving another false statement on 9 April 2008).
Count 2 - That between 6 October 2008 and 23 April 2009, being a director of Chanti Pty Limited, trading as ""European Car Specialists"", he did defraud persons in their dealings with that company contrary to s 176A of the Crimes Act 1900 (now repealed, which carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.
In respect of count 1, taking into account the Form 1, he was sentenced to a term of 12 months' imprisonment commencing on 8 February 2013 with a non-parole period of 6 months.  In respect of count 2 he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 8 August 2013.  
6Sentenced at the same time as the applicant were two of his employees, Najib Nehme and Danny Bayeh each of whom had pleaded guilty to a single count of being an accessory after the fact to the applicant's count 2 offence, carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of five years.  Neither Nehme nor Bayeh was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  Bayeh was sentenced to a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) to be of good behaviour for 3 years; Nehme was sentenced to a bond under s 9 to be of good behaviour for 2 years and additionally ordered to pay $40,000 compensation.  
7The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his sentences on two grounds.  The first ground is that he has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the sentences imposed upon Nehme and Bayeh, and the second ground that the applicant's sentences are manifestly excessive when his bad health, as revealed in fresh evidence admitted on the appeal, is taken into account.  
Facts
8The facts were agreed for the purposes of sentence.  The following account is largely taken from the learned sentencing judge's account of them.  The offences occurred in connection with a car dealership known as European Car Specialists operated by Chanti Pty Limited (Chanti), of which the applicant was the sole director and shareholder.  Nehme was the ""dealer principal"" of the firm, Bayeh was the applicant's nephew and the general manager of the firm.  Each were employees acting under the direction of the applicant in respect of their offences.  The applicant's offences occurred in connection with the sale of nine vehicles on the consignment, Bayeh and Nehme being involved after the event in four of the nine transactions.  
9There were two groups of victims, the first being the owners who left their cars under consignment for sale at an agreed amount and the second the people who bought (other) cars which had been consigned for sale but which were subject to third party financing encumbrances of which they had no knowledge and were not informed when they bought the cars.  As to the first group, the cars also were encumbered to financial institutions which were to be paid out and the balance accounted for to the owners on sale, but this was not done.  The applicant's role in the nine transactions was to decide that the proceeds of sale would not be paid to the owners (or to the financiers) but be diverted to other purposes of the company.  
10So far as the transactions in which they were involved were concerned, Bayeh and Nehme assisted the applicant by making false assertions to customers about the progress of the sales, which delayed the detection of the applicant's frauds.  In respect of the offences in count 1 and on the Form 1, the applicant was required as a licensed motor dealer to operate a trust account, and lodge a licensing annual statement and an auditor's report about the operation of the trust account with the Department of Fair Trading if he sold any cars on consignment.  Chanti did not operate a trust account.  On both 10 April 2008 and 1 April 2009 the applicant, as director of Chanti, lodged the licensing annual statements, each stating that no cars had been sold on consignment during the previous 12 months.  Each statement was false and made with the intent of obtaining the financial advantage of not having to deposit the proceeds of the sales of the consignment cars into a trust account.  
11It is not necessary to detail how each of the frauds occurred; essentially, the applicant simply pocketed the proceeds of sale.  The total sum appropriated by the applicant amounted, on the sentencing judge's calculations, to approximately $1.3 million.  It is necessary, however, to specify the acts alleged against Nehme and Bayeh separately.  One of the cars brought in for sale on consignment was a Ferrari which was purchased by Nehme for $50,000 less than the $650,000 minimum sale price, the applicant appropriating the purchase price.  Nehme did not tell the owner that he had bought the car and, in an email to him after he had bought it implied the car was still unsold and there was a potential buyer.  The car was returned to its owner by police in due course.  Nehme's next act as accessory after the fact occurred when he told a victim who had brought in a BMW for sale on consignment some three months after it had been sold to another person and the proceeds taken by the applicant, in effect that the vehicle was still unsold and requested a payout figure, ultimately telling the victim that the car had been sold and the balance outstanding would be repaid to the financier which, of course, did not occur.  The victim discovered the fraud when another monthly payment was debited from his account.  The third transaction in respect of which Nehme was an accessory after the fact involved a Mercedes consigned to the firm for sale.  When the owner saw that his car was no longer on the lot (having been sold by Nehme but the proceeds not accounted for by the applicant) he became suspicious and asked Nehme for his car back until the buyer was ready to complete the purchase.  Nehme told him there was a buyer willing to place a $50,000 deposit on the car but needed finance and that the car was in storage.  Some three months after it had been sold he told the owner it had been sold and that payment to the owner's financier would be finalised.  The owner made enquiries on the due date but was, in effect, brushed off, though it is not said this was by Nehme.  Lastly, Nehme was an accessory after the fact to the applicant's fraud in relation to the sale on consignment of a Lexus.  When the owner contacted Nehme about two weeks after the vehicle had been sold, he told her the buyer was waiting for finance, in effect, putting her off.  After a week, the owner began calling Nehme but did not make contact until about two weeks later when Nehme said he would call her back.  He did not do so and, when the victim went to the dealership the following week, she was met by the liquidators.  The proceeds of the sale were taken by the applicant.  
12So far as Bayeh is concerned he told the owner of a vehicle placed with the applicant on consignment a week or so after it was sold that he had a buyer who was organising finance and the vehicle was in storage pending the sale, obtaining documents from the owner based on that false statement and sending emails having the effect of putting her off.  In the second transaction involving him, after a Mercedes Benz placed with the applicant's firm on consignment was sold Bayeh made statements to the owner over a number of days, in effect putting him off about the sale which was for less than the owner had agreed.  Thirdly, he purchased a vehicle placed on consignment and did not tell the owner, whom he saw on a number of occasions, that he had bought the car and had encumbered it to a financier in order to enable him to do so.  Lastly, a vehicle on consignment was sold but the owner put off by Bayeh with various excuses about the purchaser needing finance and making a number of excuses as to why the sale price was not forthcoming.  The applicant had taken the money realised from these sales and not accounted for it to the owners.
Comparative culpability
13The accessories did not obtain any of the proceeds of sale.  As identified by counsel for the applicant in this Court, Mr Wendler, the only benefit they obtained was that their employment lasted longer than it otherwise would have because the money was used to prolong the life of the business, from which the applicant, as the learned sentencing judge said, derived status and an income.  The sentencing judge rejected the evidence of the applicant that he did not tell his employees to lie to the car owners or the buyers and did not believe that he involved them in his offending behaviour.  However, her Honour accepted that the applicant also had the interests of his employees in mind by enabling the business to continue.  Mr Wendler accepted (as was at all events apparent) that not only was the applicant the one who profited but the employees acted under his direction as the instigator of the offences.  Furthermore, Bayeh at 38 years and Nehme at 35 years of age were both significantly younger men.  
14Mr Wendler submitted that the applicant could not have successfully achieved his frauds without the connivance of the employees who dealt with the customers involved in the nine transactions, putting them off when they made enquiries about their vehicles.  He submitted that Nehme and Bayeh were, in substance, co-offenders with the applicant and almost as guilty as he was.
Subjective cases
15The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant's business was affected by the global financial crisis in mid to late 2008 and sales decreased dramatically with a consequence that he found it difficult to pay loans he had obtained to expand the business and continue paying his employees.  He was also very depressed as a result of his marriage having ended in 2007 and he was diagnosed with major depression with alcohol and marijuana abuse.  Her Honour accepted that to some extent these factors affected the applicant's thinking and decision making at the time of the offences.  Her Honour also accepted that the applicant was a man of good character who had lost his business.  He had made a substantial contribution to the work of a charity for which he performed volunteer work.  He was remorseful and ashamed of his offences.  The offences were out of character and he had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to reoffend.  
16Bayeh and Nehme were also of good character whose prospects for rehabilitation were good.  
Parity
17The circumstances of the present case do not call for any discussion of the authorities dealing with the issue of parity.  They were helpfully (if I may say so with respect) set out in Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 by Campbell JA at [53] and following.  Of particular point in this case is the observation by Howie J as follows -
""[245]  The principle of parity should not be confined to a consideration of the sentences imposed upon co-offenders in the strict sense, that is persons involved in and charged with the very same crime. There is nothing in the decisions of the High Court that so confine it. Where the courts have stated that the principle of parity applies only to co-offenders, it has usually been in situations where the applicant has sought to use the principle for an illegitimate purpose by seeking to compare the sentence imposed upon the applicant with a sentence imposed upon another offender who was not engaged in the offence committed by the applicant. 
[246]  The principle, whether it is called parity or proportionality or relativity between sentences, should be applied to bring about a just result in the sentences imposed upon persons who have been engaged in the same criminal enterprise regardless of the charges that have actually been laid against the offenders. However, I agree with Campbell JA that the principle is subject to the limits stated in [203] of his judgment.""
18It seems to me that a difficulty here for the applicant is that neither Nehme nor Bayeh were ""engaged in the offence committed"" by him or, ""engaged in the same criminal enterprise"".  Although, as a matter of fact, the delaying tactics undertaken by Nehme and Bayeh prevented the early disclosure of the applicant's offences, and to that extent perhaps facilitated them, they were not participants in his fraudulent conduct.  I would not go so far as to state that the sentences imposed on Nehme and Bayeh are, in principle, incapable of giving rise to issues of parity but it is not necessary to decide this point in light of the conclusion I have drawn about the outcome of the appeal so far as this ground is concerned.  
19In my view, the objective circumstances of the applicant's offences together with his instigating the accessorial offences committed by Nehme and Bayeh demonstrate such a marked difference in criminal culpability that, accepting the principles of parity apply, the difference in dispositions between the applicant on the one hand and Nehme and Bayeh on the other was well open to the sentencing judge in the exercise of her discretion.  Bayeh and Nehme were not parties to the frauds of the applicant.  What they did put off the time for his obligation to account.  It is of considerable significance that the offence committed by Bayeh and Nehme carried a maximum term of half of that applying to the principal offence for which the applicant was sentenced.  Furthermore, the number of offences to which they were accessories was less than half the number committed by the applicant.  There is no reasonable basis for the applicant to have a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the sentences imposed upon Nehme and Bayeh.  Accordingly, I would dismiss this ground of appeal.    
The applicant's medical condition
20No suggestion of any heart problem had been raised in the sentencing proceedings, although the applicant had been experiencing shortness of breath for some months.  An increase in this symptom after incarceration led to the applicant's being referred to a cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr Kumud Dhital who operated on him on 16 August 2013 after a chest x-ray and subsequent CT scan confirmed a severe aortic regurgitation (leaking of the aortic valve) with associated enlargement of the ascending aorta and an enlarged heart.  He needed further surgery a few days later to repair a complication arising from this major cardiac surgery.  The resilience of the heart to a leaky aortic valve may initially give rise to no signs or symptoms, which develop as the leak gets worse, as in the applicant's case.  Dr Dhital reported that the enlarged aorta was likely to have been present for several years.  Indeed, the accompanying murmur should have been obvious on routine clinical examination for quite some time prior to February 2013.
21The affidavits relating to the applicant's medical condition were tendered in accordance with the course conveniently stated in Iglesias v R [2006] NSWCCA 261 at [10] per McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Hulme and Hall JJ agreed), that where a medical condition which existed at the time of sentencing has later been found to be extremely serious, fresh evidence about it may be received and, in appropriate circumstances, cause this Court to intervene and resentence.    
22So far as future care is concerned, Dr Dhital noted that the applicant had several ongoing medical issues - 
(i) hypertension which requires medication and regular review by his general practitioner;
(ii) he has a mechanical aortic valve that requires life-long and careful anti coagulation (blood thinning) with daily Warfarin therapy. A lapse in appropriate control can lead to devastating consequences, namely that of bleeding if the blood is too thin and clotting with malfunction of the valve if the blood is not thin enough;
(iii) he is known to have mild-to-moderate leak of his mitral valve that needs timely surveillance, with a clinical examination and echocardiography (6 monthly initially). Similarly his enlarged left ventricle also requires regular checkups;
(iv) he remains under surveillance for his past diagnosis of bladder cancer;
(v) he needs regular review of his polymyalgia rheumatica to determine the dosage of steroids he, needs to be on. Chronic steroid use also needs regular checkups to assess the presence and degree of problems that may arise from such therapy;
(vi) his diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea also will require surveillance.
23Dr Dhital expressed the opinion (though, as he candidly admitted, he was not ""wholly knowledgeable"" about the quality of medical care in prison), that the applicant is ""more likely to receive better, timely, targeted and individualised care if he were to be out of prison"".   
24The applicant relied on an affidavit which criticised the quality of his care in prison but this was contradicted by reports of Dr Jacques Ette and Dr K Suresh Badami of the Justice Health & Forensic Mental Health Network, responsible for the applicant's medical care.  I am unpersuaded that the applicant's care is inadequate to any material degree although I readily accept that it is a matter of anxiety for him that he cannot consult a doctor when he feels he needs to.  It seems to me that the Court should proceed on the basis that he will be treated in accordance with the high duty of care assumed by the State by virtue of his imprisonment.  
25The question thus arises whether the applicant's period of incarceration would be more onerous than it was considered to be when he was sentenced and, if so, whether any reduction in his sentence or, at least the non-parole period, is justified.  As will have been noted from the summary of Dr Dhital's prognosis, essentially the problems (self-evidently considerable) from which the applicant suffers do not of themselves make his imprisonment significantly more onerous in a physical sense.  The applicant's non-parole period was reduced on the basis of a finding by the sentencing judge that his psychiatric condition would make his experience of custody more difficult.  I am not persuaded that the applicant's anxiety about his medical condition renders his incarceration significantly more onerous than was thought by the sentencing judge to be the case. 
Conclusion
26I propose that leave to appeal be granted and the appeal dismissed.
27R A HULME J:  I differ with Adams J only insofar as his Honour regards Messrs Nehme and Bayeh as not being ""engaged in the same criminal enterprise"" as the applicant.  There was only one criminal enterprise (defrauding customers of the applicant's business) and Messrs Nehme and Bayeh were involved in it, albeit in a different way to the applicant.
28However, as Adams J has pointed out, nothing turns on this.  The criminal culpability of Messrs Nehme and Bayeh was at a level so far below that of the applicant's that, viewed objectively, the applicant could not be regarded as having a legitimate sense of grievance about the disparity of the sentences: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [31].
29I agree with the orders proposed by Adams J.

2765389,Application by Jens Grandt Mosegaard pursuant to s 78(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 1661,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  Jens Mosegaard applies pursuant to s 78(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 for an inquiry into his convictions for sexual assault.  In my opinion, there is no doubt or question as to Mr Mosegaard's guilt, as to mitigating circumstances, or as to any part of the evidence in the case.  There is in my view no basis for taking either of the courses for which s 79(1) (a) and (b) of the Act respectively provide.  My reasons for coming to that conclusion are set out below.
Background
2Mr Mosegaard stood trial before Hock DCJ and a jury on an indictment containing three counts as follows:
Count 1:  On 8 March 2003 at Newtown in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with (""AG"") without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting to the sexual intercourse, and at the time of the commission of the offence, did maliciously inflict actual bodily harm on (""AG""). (s 61J(1) Crimes Act 1900)
Count 2:  On 8 March 2003 at Newtown in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with (""AG"") without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting to the sexual intercourse, and immediately after the time of the commission of the offence, did maliciously inflict actual bodily harm on (""AG""). (s 61J(1) Crimes Act 1900)
Count 3:  On 8 March 2003 at Newtown in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with (""AG"") without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting to the sexual intercourse."" (s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900).
3Mr Mosegaard was acquitted of count one but convicted of counts two and three.  On count 3 he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 years and 4 months, with a non-parole period of 7 years, to commence on 8 March 2003.  That non-parole period expired on 7 March 2010.  In respect of count two he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 11 years, with a non-parole period of 8 years, to commence on 8 March 2004. That non-parole period expired on 7 March 2012.
4The particulars of these counts upon which the Crown relied at trial were as follows:
Count 1:  That the appellant without consent forced his penis into the mouth of the complainant, at the time causing her actual bodily harm. The bodily harm was bruising to the complainant's upper arm.
Count 2:  That the appellant without consent put his penis into the mouth of the complainant, immediately after causing her actual bodily harm. The bodily harm was the injury to the complainant's lip.
Count 3:  That the appellant without consent had penile vaginal intercourse of the complainant and immediately before that caused her actual bodily harm. The bodily harm was injury to the complainant's thighs.
5Mr Mosegaard appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  That Court by majority dismissed the appeal: see Regina v Mosegaard [2005] NSWCCA 361.
6McClellan CJ at CL presided.  His Honour recited the facts in some considerable detail at [8] - [58].  His Honour also set out in similar detail the version of the facts upon which Mr Mosegaard relied for the purposes of his appeal at [59] - [88].   I have had particular regard to these matters in considering the present application although, as they are now a matter of public record and permanently accessible on this Court's Caselaw website, it is unnecessary for present purposes to reproduce them here.
7No application was made to the High Court of Australia for special leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal.
8Mr Mosegaard's application for a review of his convictions specifies the following grounds:
(1)Incontrovertible proof (of his innocence).
(2)Police corruption involving -
(a)Systematic tampering of witnesses;
(b)Destruction of (crucial) CCTV footage; and
(c)Blood sample tampering.
(3)Collusion/incompetence of his legal counsel.
(4)Judge(s) corruption/incompetence.
9In support of his application Mr Mosegaard has provided a comprehensive and detailed handwritten submission, complete with diagrams and other pertinent references.  It will be necessary to refer to some of this material later in more detail.
The legislative scheme
10Mr Mosegaard's application falls to be considered under Part 7 of the Act.  Sections 78 and 79 are important.  They are relevantly as follows:
""78 Applications to Supreme Court 
(1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.
(2)...
79 Consideration of applications 
(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion: 
(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or 
(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case. 
(3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:  (a) it appears that the matter: 
(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or 
(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or 
(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or 
(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and 
(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action. 
(3A) ...
(4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application. 
(5) ... ""
11The authorities establish that an inquiry into a conviction may only be conducted if it appears that there is doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances or as to any part of the evidence in the case at the trial.  This Court may also exercise a discretion to refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application for review if it appears that ""the matter"" has been fully dealt with in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction, or previously under Part 7 or its predecessor.
12The relevant test remains that as explained by Hope JA in Varley v The Attorney-General in and for the State of New South Wales (1987) 8 NSWLR 30; (1987) 24 A Crim R 413 at 48 as follows:
""To initiate an inquiry... a doubt must arise as to the guilt of the plaintiff.  This doubt need not be shown to the satisfaction of the Governor or the Court to be well-founded; that is a matter for the inquiry.  To adopt the language of Nagle CJ at CL in Varley v The Attorney-General of New South Wales (at 12), 'the section envisages the placing of any material before a Judge of the Supreme Court (Supreme Court Act 1970, s 40)... or, in a petition, before the Governor... 'which might cause him, for want of a better word 'unease' in allowing a conviction to stand''.  The Court or Governor will then, upon this material, decide (in the case of the Governor presumably upon advice) whether the discretion to direct an inquiry which the section confers should be exercised or not.  If an inquiry is directed, the question for consideration and report by the justice is, in the words of Lee J in his report on the conviction of Alexander McLeod-Lindsay (at 9) 'whether the doubt predicated is well-founded or not'.""
Grounds in support of the application
Incontrovertible proof of innocence
13Mr Mosegaard contends that the sexual acts with which he was charged and for which he was convicted were physically impossible.  It is clear from his submissions and the accompanying diagrams that he maintains that it was anatomically impossible for him, or by implication for anyone in his position, to have assaulted the complainant in accordance with that description.  In particular, Mr Mosegaard maintains that it would have been impossible for him to have inserted his penis into the complainant's mouth whilst he was seated upon her chest with his knees restraining her upper arms.  He further contends that the complainant's description of how he was alleged to have used his knees to hold down her thighs whilst simultaneously using his hands to hold her hands against her shoulders would not have permitted him to force his penis into her vagina.  Mr Mosegaard also complains that it was not physically possible for him to have forced the complainant's mouth open by pulling her hair back.
14Mr Mosegaard did not raise the issue of physical impossibility either at his trial or on appeal.  The issue on both occasions was relevantly whether or not the complainant had consented to the sexual acts in question.  Written submissions proffered on behalf of Mr Mosegaard at the appeal expressly acknowledged that the accounts given by him and the complainant ""were similar in terms of the physical outcome, in terms of sexual intercourse and injuries to the complainant"".  Those submissions also made it clear that the only live issue was that of consent.  So much is apparent as well from what was said by the Chief Judge at [88] and [124] in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  That was relevantly as follows:
""[88] The appellant's case was that the sexual encounter was consensual in all respects, including the so-called 'rough sex' in all of its forms. 
...
[124] ... The appellant says the complainant consented to sexual activity involving acts of violence and degradation...""
15In the face of the way in which Mr Mosegaard conducted the case at trial and on appeal, and even with the benefit of his further detailed submissions on the first ground, it does not appear to me that there is any doubt or question as to his guilt, or as to any part of the evidence in the case concerned with the acts giving rise to the convictions. Without intending to limit the force of that conclusion, it also seems to me that the matter has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction and in the proceedings on appeal from that conviction as well.  
16Mr Mosegaard did not ever contend at his trial or on appeal that any of the acts that constituted the sexual conduct complained of were physically impossible.  As the Chief Judge observed in any event, Mr Mosegaard's detailed evidence given at the trial was for the most part consistent with the complainant's description of the same events.  The point of difference between the complainant and Mr Mosegaard went to the issue of consent.  This application is not accompanied by any attempt by Mr Mosegaard to resile from or alter his evidence at trial, which he adhered to on appeal, and which included an admission that consensual penile vaginal sexual intercourse had taken place.  Mr Mosegaard's contentions now, that the sexual acts that constituted the offences upon which he was convicted were physically impossible to perform, are wholly inconsistent with the way in which his defence was conducted at trial and were never raised in the Court of Criminal Appeal.
17Moreover, even notwithstanding the above, the contentions advanced by Mr Mosegaard patently do not withstand scrutiny.  He seeks to characterise the way in which the complainant described what happened to her upon an inflexible and overly literal interpretation or understanding of that description.  It patently ignores any realistic appreciation or understanding of the events she describes.  Mr Mosegaard's attempt to confine and refine the complainant's version of events to the point of physiological and anatomical detail is an obviously disingenuous attempt to cast doubt upon her evidence.  Not only is it unsupported by any expert opinion, a fact that is not to be weighed against Mr Mosegaard in his current circumstances, but it flies in the face of common sense and the experiences of life.
18A simple example is sufficient.  Mr Mosegaard contends that his penis could not have reached the complainant's mouth if he was kneeling upon her upper arms.  He relies in this respect upon the description contained in paragraph 23 of the complainant's statement as follows:
""Jens pushed me down onto his bed. The bed was partly made up but the sheets were all scrunched up.  He held me down with both of my arms up around my head.
He said, 'I just want to have sex with you and then you can go.'
I said, 'Leave me alone.  I don't want to do this.'
Jens sat on top of me and I struggled against him.  He put one knee on each of my upper arms and held them down against the bed.  I could barely move.  He started to force his penis into my mouth but I clenched my teeth together and closed my mouth.  I moved my head around quickly so that he could not get at my mouth.  He put his hand over my mouth and nose and held it there.  I could not breathe at all.  I tried to scream but could make no noise. It was almost until the point of suffocation and then he took his hand off my mouth.  I gasped for breath by opening my mouth. When I opened it, he forced his penis into my mouth.  I started to cry and I said, 'No.' and 'Let go of me.'""
19A moment's consideration of this description makes it clear that it does not confine Mr Mosegaard to a kneeling position with his back perpendicular to the complainant.  That is the position depicted in Mr Mosegaard's hand drawn diagrams contained in his submissions.  However, it is obviously inherent in what the complainant describes that her assailant was bending forward towards her.  The complainant's clearly adventitious failure to refer to that fact in terms is an unexceptional omission in the circumstances.  It is necessarily inherent and implicit in what she said took place that her description did not recite every physical position or motion that was involved.  Mr Mosegaard's self-serving drawing of himself does not take account of this simple but obvious fact.
20In short, nothing that the complainant described is physically impossible.  Mr Mosegaard's application is unassisted by his contentions that it was.
Police corruption
21Mr Mosegaard raises a series of allegations concerning perceived failings and corrupt actions on the part of certain named police officers who were concerned with the investigation of the complaints of sexual assault made against him.  He alleges that Constable Gorman, who was the officer in charge of the police investigation, had repeatedly told a number of witnesses that a serious assault had taken place and that this contaminated their evidence.  This led to ""the innocent sound of children playing"" corruptly becoming ""sounds of a woman 'they knew' was being assaulted"".
22As the Chief Judge observed in the Court of Criminal Appeal, the complainant's evidence was supported by several witnesses.  His Honour referred to them at some length.  Two of the witnesses gave evidence that what they heard sounded childlike, but all other witnesses gave evidence to the effect that what they heard sounded like a woman or girl in distress.  The matter was raised by defence counsel at the trial and was clearly before the jury for consideration.
23Relevantly for present purposes, this issue was not raised at trial or on appeal.  That is not an absolute impediment to it being raised now, but it influences the force of the contentions about it to a considerable extent.  Mr Mosegaard did not allege that the evidence of any witness had been contaminated or tampered with by Constable Gorman.  This is apparent from her cross-examination by defence counsel at the trial.  It was never suggested to her that she approached or otherwise interfered with the evidence of any witness in the Crown case.  She was asked about her meetings with the complainant but was not challenged about whether or not the complainant's evidence was discussed.
24The force of Mr Mosegaard's contentions in the present context must also be considered in the light of the issues at his trial.  The pivotal issue was whether or not the complainant consented to the sexual acts that occurred.  None of the witnesses concerned was an eye witness to these events.
25The references to alleged police corruption are of recent origin.  They are no more than latter day unsupported dogmatic assertions.  They do not give rise to any relevant doubt or question.
26With respect to the alleged destruction of CCTV footage, Mr Mosegaard contends that what was shown supports the suggestion that the complainant propositioned him inside the Crown Hotel prior to the alleged assaults.  The CCTV footage in question is said to record events from within the hotel early on the morning of 8 March 2003, prior to the complainant and Mr Mosegaard proceeding to their shared accommodation in Newtown where the offences took place.  The absence of CCTV footage from inside the hotel was neither a specific ground of appeal nor a particular of an allegation of impropriety raised against Constable Gorman at the trial or on appeal.  The complainant denied at the trial under cross-examination that she had been flirting with Mr Mosegaard.  He gave evidence that she did.  The issue was therefore squarely before the jury at the trial.
27The evidence may well have been relevant at the trial upon the issue of consent.  However, whatever its probative force or significance might then have been, the allegation that I am asked to consider is that the footage was destroyed as the result of police corruption.  There is no evidence of any sort that supports that allegation.  Once again Mr Mosegaard asserts it as a fact but is unable to point to any associated facts or circumstances that lend support to it.
28The same can be said with respect to Mr Mosegaard's concerns regarding alleged sample tampering.  Mr Mosegaard alleges that Constable Gorman tampered with blood and urine samples but provides no material to substantiate the allegation.  It is also unclear to precisely which forensic issue the allegation is directed.  Constable Gorman was not cross-examined about this at the trial, consent being the point of difference between the complainant and Mr Mosegaard.  I am unable to discern the existence of any doubt or question as to Mr Mosegaard's guilt that is or appears to be based upon this allegation.
29Nor is the issue advanced favourably to Mr Mosegaard by his associated complaint that he did not receive a copy of the urinalysis report. The defence was served with a certificate issued by the Department of Analytical Laboratories dated 24 February 2004 that was ultimately tendered by the Crown at the trial.  No controversy concerning that certificate developed at that time.
Collusion of lawyers
30Mr Mosegaard makes three separate complaints against his former legal representatives.  The first concerns a Legal Aid solicitor who withdrew from the case approximately three months before the trial.  The second concerns the barrister who appeared at the trial and who is alleged to have disregarded Mr Mosegaard's instructions in several nominated respects.  The third is concerned with the Senior Public Defender who appeared for Mr Mosegaard in the appeal.  Mr Mosegaard asserts that his senior counsel did not follow his instructions and that this resulted in a deliberate perversion of the course of justice.
31The first complaint is that the Legal Aid lawyer did not obtain the ""crucial"" CCTV footage from the Crown Hotel.  This has been referred to earlier.  The evidence of Constable Gorman was to the effect that the film had been requested but that it was not available because of technical difficulties.  It is however difficult to understand the nature of Mr Mosegaard's concerns when regard is paid to the fact that the lawyer concerned ceased to be involved with his case long before the trial on the one hand or, for reasons similar to those already considered, the forensic significance of the lost film could only have been marginal on the other hand.
32The material available to me for the purposes of this application does not include the whole of the trial transcript.  It is limited only to those portions that Mr Mosegaard has supplied in support of his submissions.  None touches the conduct of counsel.  It is however otherwise clear that no ground of appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal alleged either incompetence, or what Mr Mosegaard would wish now to characterise as disobedience, of counsel.  If the complaints that Mr Mosegaard now wishes to propound are to be given any favourable attention on this application it could only be if they were identified by reference to specific points in the transcript and were accompanied by an explanation of why they did not emerge as matters of significance on appeal.
33The Senior Public Defender is also criticised by Mr Mosegaard for failing to argue as a ground of appeal that the acts of sexual conduct with which he was charged were physically impossible and that he was the subject of police corruption.  For the same reasons that these issues are unconvincing as matters in themselves, they are also insufficient to raise a doubt or question concerning the convictions as part of a collateral attack on a legal representative.  It seems highly likely that experienced counsel would in any event have been professionally disinclined to propound any frail argument about physical impossibility as being inimical to Mr Mosegaard's interests.  I am however not called upon in this application to offer an opinion on that issue.
Judicial incompetence34I have had particular regard to Mr Mosegaard's submissions in this category of complaint.  None of the allegations is supported by any factual material or specificity.  Mr Mosegaard's submissions commence with the bald assertion that ""generally all of the judges (bail, trial, appeal etc.) failed to do anything about an obvious miscarriage of justice"".  He thereafter proceeds only to criticise the trial judge, despite the width of his opening remarks.35When examined it clearly emerges that any complaints that Mr Mosegaard now expounds concerning her Honour were matters that were capable of being formulated as points or grounds of appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal. (In referring to them in that context I am not to be taken as expressing a view that any of Mr Mosegaard's complaints could have been formulated as, or amounted to, meritorious grounds of appeal). 
36If Mr Mosegaard had complaints about the scope or content of the trial judge's directions, evidentiary rulings or her summing up, it was open to him to propound them on appeal.  He failed to do so.  I am not satisfied that any doubt or question attends Mr Mosegaard's convictions by reason of any complaint he appears to be making about the trial judge or any other (unspecified) judicial officer.
Conclusions
37In summary, none of the matters propounded by Mr Mosegaard in this application provides any basis to doubt or to question his guilt or his convictions.  He has identified no mitigating circumstances.  This application should be dismissed.
Order
38The application of Jens Grandt Mosegaard made pursuant to s 78(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 for an inquiry into his convictions for sexual assault is dismissed.

		24 November 2014",2014-11-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765396,R v Kerry Forrest [2014] NSWSC 1680,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR:Â  After a trial before me, sitting without a jury, the offender, Kerry Forrest, was found guilty of murder. The victim was an 84 year old man, William Adamson. She administered to him a large dose of a morphine based pain killer, MS-Contin, a prescription medication which she took, causing his death from morphine toxicity. The Crown case against her was circumstantial, and in my written reasons for my verdict I examined it in some detail: R v Forrest [2014] NSWSC 612. For the purpose of sentence it is sufficient to refer to my salient findings.

2In about September 2009, Ms Forrest secured a position as a carer for Mr Adamson, then a widower, and she moved in to his home at Kareela. Mr Adamson did not seek a carer for health reasons. He was reasonably fit for his age and was mentally alert. He was a retired real estate agent and property developer, who at the time was trying to market a water saving device he had invented called the Rainsaver. He selected Ms Forrest as his carer because she had administrative and computer skills which he did not, and she could assist him in his marketing project. 

3Put shortly, over the ensuing months she became involved in his financial affairs to the point where effectively she controlled them. Their relationship was a friendly one and he trusted her.

4In February 2010, the Kareela home was put up for sale. Ostensibly, the plan was to use the proceeds to build an investment home on land which Ms Forrest owned at Bundanoon. Mr Adamson was a willing party to this scheme. However, Ms Forrest came to control the process of the sale, and to exclude Mr Adamson from it, by manipulative behaviour which I need not recount.

5Settlement of the sale took place on 12 April 2010. Again put shortly, Ms Forrest misappropriated the proceeds of the sale, having already dissipated the deposit paid by the purchasers, which had been released earlier. In large part this money was spent on her gambling on poker machines at a number of clubs over a period of months, during which she sustained very large losses. Clearly, this was a serious breach of the trust Mr Adamson had reposed in her. I am satisfied that she planned to misappropriate the proceeds of the sale from an early stage, and indulged in deceitful and manipulative behaviour to that end. 

6On 12 April 2010, after settlement of the sale of the home, Ms Forrest and Mr Adamson checked into a motel at Campbelltown. On the Friday of that week, 16 April, he was found dead in the motel room. Towards 11pm that night, Ms Forrest had called the 000 emergency line, apparently distressed, telling the operator that Mr Adamson was unresponsive and was not breathing. When ambulance officers arrived shortly thereafter, not only was he dead but he appeared to have been so for some time. I think it likely that she administered the MS-Contin tablets to him by crushing them and putting them in his food. When she did so is unclear, but it was probably on the Thursday or the Wednesday. 

7She attempted in a variety of ways to cover her tracks. Earlier on the Friday evening she tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade her own general practitioner to come to the motel room, in the hope that that doctor would certify the death as one of natural causes. Eventually, she had no choice but to call 000, but what she said conveyed that she believed he might be alive. When questioned by police that night and early the following morning, she maintained her story about the circumstances in which she made the 000 call, giving a detailed account of her movements on the Friday and the days preceding it which was false. 

8After the event she tried, unsuccessfully, to arrange for the cremation of Mr Adamson without the knowledge of his family. News of the death came to his sisters and to his stepson from other sources. The stepson, John Adamson, made contact with her, and she lied to him about the circumstances of his father's death. It was not until 14 February 2011, after what must have been a lengthy and painstaking investigation, that she was arrested and charged with the murder.

9This was premeditated murder. As I observed in my reasons for my verdict, Ms Forrest misappropriated Mr Adamson's money and killed him to prevent that misappropriation being exposed. Whether she had ever intended to use the proceeds of the sale of the home to develop the property at Bundanoon I cannot say. What I can say is that, if she did, she did not intend Mr Adamson to share the benefits of that investment with her. 

10Ms Forrest was 50 years old at the time of the murder, and is now 55. She has a criminal history of offences of dishonesty, most of it old and of no present significance. However, on 10 February 2013, while in custody in relation to this matter, she was convicted of an offence of obtaining money by deception committed over a period of 3 months in early 2009, when she fraudulently drew cheques totalling a substantial sum of money on the account of her then employer.

11A pre-sentence report reveals that she had a disrupted and unhappy childhood, with little contact with her parents, who separated when she was an infant. She was raised mainly by her paternal grandparents, who are now deceased. She was married for 26 years, and has 2 adult daughters. The marriage was turbulent and her husband could be physically violent. Nevertheless, they remained on speaking terms. After the breakdown of her marriage she was in another relationship for some years prior to her contact with Mr Adamson.

12She was educated to Year 12 standard, but had not been in full-time employment for a long time. During her marriage her husband had been the main breadwinner. More recently she had received a disability support pension, supplemented by a carer's allowance while she was with Mr Adamson.

13She had a longstanding gambling problem with poker machines. She would sometimes spend long hours at a club, and it would appear that she tried to hide the extent of her addiction from those who were close to her. She told the author of the report that the gambling enabled her to take her mind off problems at home.

14The major issue in Ms Forrest's subjective case is the state of her health. On 9 May 2013 I refused her application for a permanent stay of the trial because of her illness, and in the course of my judgment I reviewed the medical evidence available at that time: R v Forrest [2013] NSWSC 527 at [4]-[14]. I have received updated medical reports for the purpose of sentence.

15She has cancer of the cervix, detected late in 2012. She has undergone treatment by way of radiotherapy at Prince of Wales Hospital under the care of Associate Professor Michael Jackson. She suffers a complex of other conditions, most importantly a left hydronephrosis, which is an effect of the cancer. It is the result of pressure of the tumour upon the ureter, causing difficulty passing urine, and has been treated by the insertion of ureteric stents. She suffers significant pain and discomfort. Unrelated to the cancer, she has a thrombus at the left common femoral vein, treated by anticoagulant medication. She has been diagnosed with chronic regional pain syndrome, and is in a wheelchair.

16When I heard the application for a permanent stay last year, I received evidence from Associate Professor Jackson and from an obstetrician and gynaecologist, Dr John Schmidt, engaged by Ms Forrest's solicitor. It is not necessary to review their evidence now, except to note that Dr Schmidt considered her prognosis as a result of the cancer as ""dismal"" and thought it unlikely that she would survive beyond 2 years. Associate Professor Jackson was less pessimistic, noting prognosis as ""always very difficult."" He suggested, tentatively, that her chance of being ""alive and well at 2 years"" was in the range of 25-30%. He added that there was ""some possibility"" that she would survive for 5 years.

17In a report of 3 November 2014, Associate Professor Jackson noted that she had been admitted recently to Prince of Wales Hospital, having collapsed in gaol because of low haemoglobin. She was managed by the palliative care team. He did not feel that any further radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgical intervention was likely to improve her situation, noting that she had been resistant to suggestions for investigation or medical treatment. He reported that it was still difficult to give an accurate prognosis, but noted that her cancer remains incurable. His best estimate of her life expectancy was ""in the region of 6 to 18 months."" 

18I also have recent reports from Dr Rosanne Moses, palliative care specialist at Prince of Wales Hospital, consistent with Associate Professor Jackson's report, and of Dr Suresh Badami of Justice Health, concerning her management at present. She is currently being managed at Long Bay Prison Hospital, with access to Prince of Wales Hospital should treatment there be necessary. At present no further treatment is planned, and there is to be a gradual reduction of opioid analgesia and the substitution of methadone over a period of time.

19I have also received a letter from the Reverend Peter Baines, a chaplain at Long Bay Correctional Centre, who has had contact with Ms Forrest. He described the accommodation at Long Bay Hospital as ""necessarily basic"", because of security requirements, with very little privacy. He noted that Ms Forrest is usually the only female patient in the medical surgical unit, and is not able to converse with other (male) patients. The staff do not have time to converse with her other than in carrying out their normal duties. He described the unit as ""an extremely lonely place"" for her, noting that, apart from visits by family members and contact with him, there is ""little other scope for nurturing interaction."" In addition, her mobility is limited as she is wheelchair bound. 

20It is well established that the state of health of an offender is relevant to sentence but that, generally, it will be a factor in mitigation only when it appears that imprisonment will be a greater burden on the offender because of it or where there is a serious risk that imprisonment might adversely affect it. The authorities were reviewed by Rothman J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and James J agreed, in Anastasiou v R [2010] NSWCCA 100, at [22]-[24]. 

21It was also recognised in that decision that there may be cases where the appropriate determinate sentence for an offence might result in an offender spending the rest of his or her life in custody. So much was also recognised in Goebel-McGregor v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 390, per James J (with whom Hislop J and I agreed) at [128]. Anastasiou was a case involving an offender with a terminal illness. Goebel-McGregor involved the sentencing of an elderly offender for murder. 

22In cases of that kind, particularly those involving a terminal illness, it is open to the Executive Government to allow an offender early release in the exercise of the prerogative of mercy, preserved by s 102 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and by s 270 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999. By s 160 of the latter Act, the State Parole Authority also has the power to direct the early release of a prisoner if it is satisfied that it is necessary to do so because of ""exceptional extenuating circumstances.""

23Of course, it is not within my power to exercise either of those discretions. I must sentence Ms Forrest according to accepted principles, having regard to the gravity of her crime and the need for general deterrence, and taking into account her subjective case. The inevitable result is a sentence with a minimum custodial term extending well beyond her life expectancy. 

24For obvious reasons, her crime is objectively very serious. I have regard to her background and her limited criminal history. I also take into account her illness in accordance with the authority to which I have referred. It appears that her condition is being managed appropriately. However, it is clear from the Reverend Baines' letter that it does have a deleterious effect upon the conditions of her custody. That is normally an important matter, justifying a significant measure of leniency. I must take it into account, on the basis that it will endure indefinitely, although I am conscious that there is an area of unreality in doing so, given her prognosis.

25I have regard to the standard non-parole period for murder of 20 years in accordance with the law as it now stands. Having regard to the competing factors to which I have referred, I have decided that the appropriate sentence is imprisonment for 25 years with a non-parole period of 19 years. That non-parole period is a little more than 75% of the sentence, which is the usual proportion. However, I shall backdate the sentence to the date Ms Forrest was taken into custody for this matter, 14 February 2011, leaving out of account a short sentence she served while in custody for the offence of obtaining money by deception to which I have referred.

26Kerry Forrest, for the murder of William Adamson you are sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 19 years, commencing on 14 February 2011 and expiring on 13 February 2030, and a balance of term of 6 years, commencing on 14 February 2030 and expiring on 13 February 2036.

27I express my deepest sympathy to the family of William Adamson in their loss.

2765406,R v WILLIAMS; R v ROBERTS [2014] NSWDC 374,"sentence

INTRODUCTION


	
	HIS HONOUR: Two men appear before me for sentence today. They are Shaun Roberts who was born on 8 April 1991 and Matthew Thomas Williams who was born on 13Â January 1981.
	
	
	Mr Roberts and Mr Williams have a number of offences which are common to each other, but they are also for sentence in relation to offences which were committed by them either with other people or by themselves, but certainly not with each other.
	
	
	The Crown very helpfully prepared chronologies in relation to both offenders which provides some assistance in mapping out the particular matters with which I am concerned and I will just work through the framework of those matters now.
	
	
	Shaun Roberts is for sentence in respect first in time of an armed robbery contrary to sÂ 97(1) Crimes Act 1900 committed at Mount Pritchard. That offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. He and MrÂ Williams both appear today for sentence in relation to an armed robbery with a dangerous weapon committed on 30 August 2013 at St Helens Park. This is an offence committed on, as I said, 30 August 2013, it carries a maximum penalty of 25 yearsâ imprisonment, according to the Crownâs coversheet it has no standard non-parole period, it is a common offence to MrÂ Roberts and Mr Williams.
	
	
	There is a Form 1 matter common to both offenders of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company contrary to sÂ 59(2) Crimes Act 1900, upon a victim who was a customer at the business where the armed robbery was committed.
	
	
	The offenders have two offences committed in the late hours of 30Â August 2013 or the early hours of 31 August 2013 that are both on FormsÂ 1 relevant to each other, relating to the taking and or being carried in a conveyance knowing it was stolen or unlawfully obtained at Campbelltown, and the larceny of New South Wales vehicle registration plates at Murrumbateman, a small town in the Barton Highway between Yass and Canberra.
	
	
	The two offenders then have commonly with each other two offences of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, again contrary to sÂ 97(2) Crimes Act 1900 committed at Tumut. These matters came to the Court for sentence in circumstances where the initial charge had a plethora of particulars which required several other concurrent armed robberies with a dangerous weapon to be placed on a Form 1, for each offender in respect of contemporaneous offending.
	
	
	The offender Mr Roberts was arrested in relation for the Tumut offences on 31 August 2013. His parole was then revoked in circumstances I will outline shortly.
	
	
	Mr Williams was not arrested at that time. In fact, he remained at large until 17Â October 2013. That led to the situation where he committed two other offences which were offences contrary to sÂ 112(2) Crimes Act 1900 which each carry a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment but each have a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment. One offence was an aggravated breaking entering and commit a serious indictable offence to wit stealing in company which is count 1 or sequence 1 of those charges. The second matter is an attempted break and enter and commit serious indictable offence in company, the serious indictable offence being stealing, committed on premises close to the premises which were actually broken into.
	
	
	Mr Williams also has two matters, as I understand it, on a sÂ 166 certificate. One matter of taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner and the other matter of being unlicensed.
	
	
	The facts of all the matters with which I am concerned I will deal with in a moment but, as I said, it can be seen that the offender Mr Roberts committed an armed robbery before he committed crimes in conjunction or in company with Mr Williams. Then, after Mr Roberts was arrested, Mr Williams committed other crimes which naturally Mr Roberts could not participate in, amongst other reasons because he was in custody.
	
	
	The offenders were before me in Wagga in respect of the offences committed at Tumut which I will deal with in a moment. In respect of those offences at Tumut, the way the matter was ultimately dealt with was by the filing of an ex officio indictment with a single armed robbery in respect of each of the premises where robberies occurred, which were adjoining premises. In respect of each offender other armed robberies which were committed at the same time were placed on a Form 1 reflecting the reality of the number of people that were robbed by the offenders.
	
	
	As to the issue of appropriate discounts for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty, I will deal with that matter later.
	
	
	Not only are the number of charges, the way in which charges are to be dealt with by the Court taking into account matters on a Form 1 and approaching offences in relation to Mr Williams on a sÂ 166 certificate complicated, but the presentence custody situation of both offenders is complicated as well.
	
	
	When Mr Williams was arrested on 17 October 2014 he was charged with other offences which have subsequently been dealt with in the Local Court. He was also, as I would understand it, charged with the outstanding offences that I am concerned with directly, either on that date or subsequent dates. He remained in custody unsentenced until either 30 March or 1 April, it is a little unclear given the conflicting information I have been provided.
	
	
	He was, as I would understand the criminal history, sentenced on 1 April to 14 months imprisonment in the Local Court in respect of various offences. The total sentence thus expiring, having been ordered to commence on 30Â March 2014, on 19 May 2015 with an effective non-parole period of nine months expiring, as I understand the matter, in December 2015.
	
	
	The calculation of the learned Crown Prosecutor, at the time that I was provided with relevant sentence summaries, was that the prisoner had spent five months 14 days or 165 days in custody, solely referable to one or all of the matters with which I am now directly concerned. I was informed Mr Williams was not on parole or subject to conditional liberty at the time of the offending.
	
	
	Mr Roberts committed the offences with which I am concerned whilst on parole in respect of an offence or armed robbery which sentence commenced on 16 October 2010 and was ordered for a period of three years nine months imprisonment with a non-parole period that permitted the prisonerâs effective release to parole on 15 April 2013. When arrested in relation to the Tumut matters Mr Robertsâ parole was revoked. I need not go into the details of that, but the revocation was effective from the date he came back into custody on 31Â August 2013 and he served the balance of parole to be served which expired on 15 July 2014. The learned Crown Prosecutor calculated as at the last date the matter was before me, which was 10 October 2014, that the period of time spent in custody other than serving balance of parole was two months and 26 days. It is now a further, as I would calculate it, one month and 18 days since the matter was last before me.
	
	
	With both Mr Roberts and Mr Williams I have taken into account all times spent in custody directly referrable to these matters in their various ways, but I am also required in a range of ways to have regard to terms spent in custody in relation to other matters, whether it be by reason of serving sentences of imprisonment or serving out the balance of parole that had been revoked, in order to calculate a commencement date for the relevant sentences to be imposed.
	
	
	I have already outlined to the prisoners what the sentences are, they each have different commencement dates. But in summary the way I have approached the matter is, in the case of Mr Roberts, order a commencement date on 1 March for the effective sentence, although some sentences are partially accumulative upon others, to represent a sentence commencing during the period of time that he served his balance of parole to give effect to totality of sentencing.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Williams I have to take a different approach and give respect to the non-parole period fixed by the learned Magistrate. Thus, I have calculated a commencement date of that non-parole period notionally from the date he came back into custody, and that non-parole period ânotionallyâ expiring on 17 July, although the Magistrate of course ordered it to expire later this year. The times required to be served for that nonâparole period can be directly referrable to that sentence and I can commence the sentences I impose to give effect to any remaining time in custody not counting the non-parole period fixed by the Magistrate.
	
	
	I will deal with each of the offences, but I will start with just working my way through the joint offending of the two prisoners and then come back to the different offences, or the other offences, that are not jointly committed by the two of them.
	


FACTS OF THE OFFENDING


	
	The first offending jointly committed by the two of them, as I said earlier, was the armed robbery and the assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company committed on 30 August 2013. This is the armed robbery that is an offence contrary to sÂ 97(2) Crimes Act.
	
	
	The prisoners robbed a man called Fadi Azzi of property particularised in the Court Attendance Notice. Mr Azzi was working at a service station in StÂ HelensÂ Park for his brother-in-law. About 7.20am a male customer called McFarlan entered the shop to purchase some items, after which the two prisoners entered with a co-offender who has never been identified. MrÂ Roberts was wearing a stocking over his head and had an antique firearm in his possession and threatened to shoot Mr McFarlan and pointing the gun at MrÂ Azzi. Mr Williams held a 15 centimetre long knife and also threatened MrÂ McFarlan and threatened Mr Azzi.
	
	
	Mr McFarlan was struck on the right side of his face and the three offenders variously threatened the occupants of the business premises with MrÂ Roberts going behind the counter, cornering Mr Azzi in that area, hitting him on the top of the head with the gun and then punching him in the face. He ultimately removed MrÂ Azziâs mobile phone and his wallet which had $210 in cash as well as some other property within it.
	
	
	While this was occurring, Mr Williams grabbed the cash drawer from the cash register emptying it into a backpack. Another man entered the premises. MrÂ Roberts threatened him with a firearm and that person left but rang tripleâ0.
	
	
	The three men, after stealing various property from the store, left the business, but outside the store confronted another man who was alighting from his vehicle. Mr Roberts said, âI want your car,â to which the occupant of the car replied, âGet fucked. Youâre not having it,â and closed the door. The three offenders then ran and jumped into a Nissan hatchback parked nearby and drove it away. It was ultimately set alight. They then ran off.
	
	
	Police arrived and various investigations were undertaken, including inspection of CCTV footage, the recovery of some stockings that were worn on the head of at least two of the offenders, and other items. In abandoned premises nearby Mr Azziâs wallet was located and ultimately the DNA profile of Mr Williams was detected on items that were examined by police. The victim, Mr Azzi, suffered swelling and a bump to his head and bleeding from the mouth and Mr McFarlan suffered from redness and a graze to his right cheek.
	
	
	The property taken included the cash in Mr Azziâs wallet, $790 from the cash tray, a number of items of merchandise, including cigarettes and chocolates totalling $1,026 in value.
	
	
	Sometime later the same day or perhaps early in the morning, it does not really matter, the offenders were involved in the taking of a motor vehicle being a Nissan Pulsar SSS which they, in company with two other men, ultimately drove to Tumut. The stolen number plates that I referred to was stolen from a car at Murrumbateman on the way to Tumut, presumably to disguise the true identity of the Nissan Pulsar.
	
	
	The prisoners were in company with two men called Faletau and Kinchela. They went to two properties at 18 and 20 Dalhunty Street, Tumut. It seems clear, as I discussed with Mr King who appears for MrÂ Williams, that at least Mr Williams would have known the occupants and it would appear that he believed that there were people within either one of the premises who could provide him or his colleagues with drugs.
	
	
	At premises at 18 Dalhunty Street, Tumut there were three people, Troy Newlind, Amanda Robb and Ebony McKnight. The prisoner Roberts, MrÂ Williams and Mr Faletau went into those premises and after some small talk the victims were threatened with the replica firearm which on this occasion was held by Mr Faletau. I point out there is evidence before me that the replica firearm was incapable of discharging a projectile, but of course the victims did not know that. Notwithstanding the fact that it could not discharge a projectile, it was relevantly a dangerous weapon.
	
	
	Mr Williams threatened one of the women with a vacuum cleaner stem and Mr Roberts removed a flat bar with a handle on it out of his sleeve and hit MrÂ Newlind striking him on the right leg. After striking Mr Newlind a number of times, cash and mobile phones were demanded and the three men obtained four mobile phones, $330 in cash and a Sony 14.1 megapixel camera. MrÂ Newlind suffered soreness to the neck, jaw, spine, hip and right leg but suffered no permanent or serious injury.
	
	
	The three offenders then moved to the next house, 20 Dalhunty Street, outside of which, before they went into 18 Dalhunty Street, Mr Williams had spoken to one of the occupants. This house was occupied by a number of people, including a woman called Pamela Blomley, Sam Lubke and Timothy Gorman. The prisoner Williams and perhaps others in the group were known to the occupants. There were also some other people in the house at the time, Michael Blomley, Mitchell Harris and Joshua Barton. There turned out to be a small child in the premises of which the prisoners were unaware until too late.
	
	
	Mr Roberts, Mr Williams and Mr Faletau forced their way into the house. They were obviously still armed with the weapons they had used in the house next door. Mr Williams punched Barton to the face with both fists. MsÂ Blomley yelled out âIâve got a kid hereâ and Mr Williams said, âI donât give a shit.â MrÂ Roberts struck Harris with an iron bar to the right knee and demands were made for property with the bar being held, being placed, against the neck of MrÂ Gorman. Mr Faletau again used the firearm to threaten the occupants and various items of property were taken, although a woman in the premises escaped with her five year old child.
	
	
	Mr Gorman believed that Blomley, when threatened, was going to be shot so he grabbed the bar held by Roberts and pushed it away. Mr Roberts said to Faletau, âShoot him. Shoot him, bro.â Gorman thence armed himself with a garden hoe and confronted Mr Roberts and there was something of a struggle. In the meantime, Mr Williams and Mr Faletau ran out to the motor vehicle, as later did MrÂ Roberts, and they drove away. None of this brings any credit upon MrÂ Williams or Mr Roberts, whatever state of intoxication from drugs they were in at the time.
	
	
	Gorman suffered some contusions to the throat and the shoulders. MrÂ Barton suffered a laceration to the inside of his mouth. MrÂ Harris suffered soreness to his right knee. As a result of this robbery six mobile phones, one camera and only $20 in cash were stolen. I say âonly $20 in cash were stolenâ somewhat sarcastically, because one wonders why all the violence for such a small amount of money and small amount of property.
	
	
	Later that day, Mr Faletau and Mr Roberts were arrested in Tumut. Williams and Mr Kinchela ran away and, of course as I said, MrÂ Williams was not arrested until midâOctober. The replica firearm and the iron bar were found and all mobile phones and the cameras and some of the money was recovered.
	
	
	Mr Roberts told the police without saying much else that he had only ârobbed a druggieâ as if to excuse his behaviour. One wonders what he would have felt if he had been treated the same way by a group of men. In any event, Mr Kinchella was arrested on 4 September 2013, and as I said earlier, MrÂ Williams apparently was arrested after a police pursuit.
	
	
	Just dealing with Mr Williams for the moment. The other offences with which I am concerned in his case were the aggravated breaking and enter, or attempted breaking and enter, committed by him on 22 September 2013 when he was effectively on the run, so to speak, in relation to at least the Tumut offences. The prisoner broke into a property in company with another person at Leumeah, the property belonging to a man by the name of Bradley Napper. The breaking occurred at about 2.30pm in the afternoon and the prisoner and his unnamed co-offender stole a range of property, including PlayStations, cameras, jewellery, backpacks, bottles of perfume, a suitcase, an iPhone and other personal items, including a laptop that contained photographs of the victimâs honeymoon which were never recovered. The property stolen totalled $3,225 in value.
	
	
	In the same unit complex two men apparently attempted to break into another property by trying kick open the door. This unit identified specifically in the facts was the subject of some closed-circuit television coverage and the offenders were shown on that system endeavouring to force their way into the premises.
	
	
	On 21 September, or early 22 September, a Holden Commodore was stolen outside a residence in Ruse. This prisoner Mr Williams was identified on CCTV footage on particular days driving the motor vehicle. He was an unlicensed driver. That motor vehicle was recovered on 24 September and ultimately the prisonerâs latent fingerprints were found linking him to commission of the breaking, entering and stealing offence.
	
	
	Mr Roberts has an additional charge of armed robbery, as I said earlier, pursuant to sÂ 97(1) Crimes Act committed on 27 August before he embarked upon the joint criminal enterprises with Mr Williams. As with all the other offences, for sentence today, this was an offence committed whilst on parole for armed robbery. In relation to this offence it was committed at MountÂ Pritchard at a local newsagency and involved ultimately the theft of $1,700 in cash and numerous packets of cigarettes. Whilst the prisoner was armed with a screwdriver he attended upon the premises of the newsagency around 5.20am, shortly after it opened, and was in company with Kinchela who was I understand it is the co-accused in the later offending at Tumut. There was another person involved too who has not been identified.
	
	
	The prisoner entered the premises with a hood pulled over his head to avoid identification. One man was armed with a tyre brace. He was the person who approached the victim. The prisoner and Mr Kinchela threatened a female victim, the male having left after initially being threatened, as I understand the facts. Mr Kinchela and the prisoner threatened a female who was standing near the counter and told her to open the till. The facts suggest that the male partner of the female had in fact been taken outside the premises. The female victim pressed the security alarm and then went around the corner. She screamed. The prisoner and his co-offender tried to open the cash register without success. One of the offenders ripped the cash register from the counter and placed it on the floor in front of the counter where it was later collected by Kinchela and the prisoner. Mr Kinchella also took a large number of cigarettes from the shelves. Some of these items were dropped as the men left the premises. The total value of cigarettes taken was just in excess of $1,400 and as I said earlier, $1,700 in cash was removed from the premises.
	
	
	On 2 September police attended a residence that was associated with Kinchela and found the cash tray in the roof of the premises. Mr Robertsâ fingerprints were identified from latent impressions found on the remains of the register that were located. Another search of other premises on 6 September reveal items of clothing related to this robbery, including clothing that was detected to have the DNA profile of Mr Roberts and of course one item of clothing had some prescription for medication in the name of the offender in it.
	


CRIMINAL HISTORIES OF THE PRISONERS


	
	So far as their criminal histories are concerned, Mr Roberts first appeared in the Childrenâs Court in 2007 and has a range of appearances in the Childrenâs Court subsequently for property offences, particularly, breaking, entering and stealing offences, four offences of violence, including a finding of guilt in relation to an offence of reckless wounding for which he was sentenced to a 12 month control order with a non-parole period of two months, and other offending. He was given various orders over the years he appeared in the Childrenâs Court, including probation, orders to perform community service and control orders.
	
	
	As an adult in 2010 he appeared at the Local Court. He was convicted of common assault and affray, and ultimately imprisoned in total to seven months imprisonment with a non-parole period of one month and three days.
	
	
	In August 2011 he appeared at the Campbelltown District Court and was convicted of the armed robbery to which I referred earlier. The term of imprisonment as I said was three years nine months with a non-parole period of two years and six months commencing on 16 October 2010, hence his release to parole, as I said earlier, in April 2013.
	
	
	Since coming into custody after his arrest in relation to the current matters he has a number of matters of failing to perform or failing objectively prescribed urinalysis and other infractions.
	
	
	Mr Williamsâ record extends over a longer period of course than MrÂ Roberts because he is over 10 years older. He, likewise, has a number of appearances in the Childrenâs Court for offences of dishonesty, assault, affray, robbery, assault police and various street offences.
	
	
	As an adult he has findings of guilt. Shortly after turning 18 at Gundagai Local Court and at Tumut Local Court for various offences, including intimidating a police officer, damaging property, breaking, entering and stealing, taking and driving a vehicle without consent, stealing a motor vehicle, driving in a manner dangerous to the public, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, these convictions are recorded over a period of time between 2000 and 2006 and he received various forms of penalty, including a term of imprisonment for 18 months in relation to the taking of a motor vehicle in 2000, and another sentence of 12 months with a non-parole period of nine months for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, which sentence was imposed in 2006.
	
	
	He also had a finding of guilt against him for a crime of wounding for which he was sentence to two years imprisonment which was suspended on him entering a sÂ 12 bond. This was an order made in the District Court and could well have been made by me, however, I have no recollection of the offender.
	
	
	At the same time he was convicted of entering a building and committing an indictable offence for which he received a term of imprisonment of 18 months suspended pursuant to sÂ 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. These offences were committed on 23 August 2002.
	
	
	Between 2006 and 2010 there was effectively a break in his offending, although there was some minor offending in 2009 in one sense. He was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm which of course can be a very serious offence, but was given a community service order.
	
	
	He then started to reappear at Court more frequently in 2011 and 2012. In 2011 he was placed on a sÂ 9, then, after committing the offences with which I am directly concerned, he appeared in the Local Court this year in relation to a number of offences, including driving under the influence of alcohol and other drug, possessing implements to enter and drive a conveyance, taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner, and driving recklessly in the course of a police pursuit for which he received various terms of imprisonment that total effectively 14Â months with an effective non-parole period of nine months due to expire on 29Â December 2014. I have already referred to that matter.
	


PRE-SENTENCE REPORTS


	
	Each of the prisoners has had tendered in respect of them a presentence report. The presentence reports contain a deal of information about the background of each of the offenders and other matters. I will deal with their respective backgrounds when I come to matters raised in their own cases, but in relation to Mr Roberts it said that his previous release to parole supervision in 2010, parole supervision as part of a Childrenâs Court order, reflected unsatisfactory performance. He was referred to the Getting SMART program to address substance abuse issues but had to be withdrawn from that program because he attended affected by cannabis and refused to participate. He is said to have failed to engage in any recommended interventions. He was released to parole again, as I pointed out, on 15 April 2013 for the armed robbery matter. A breach report was submitted on 25 June 2013 due to his poor reporting and a positive urinalysis. A warning letter was sent by the Parole Authority on 5 July. A further breach report was submitted on 20 August due to the prisoner continuing to abuse illicit substances and his failure to comply with directions to undertake an assessment for residential rehabilitation program. Revocation of his parole was recommended but, as can be seen from what I said earlier, his criminal activities overtook all these events because he embarked upon that course of conduct between 27 August and 31 August that I have earlier outlined.
	
	
	He gave some details of his background consistent with the evidence contained within his statement to the Court and his fatherâs evidence and he confirmed to the Community Corrections Officer that drug abuse, antisocial peers and other influences have affected his conduct.
	
	
	He is a father of two children, a son aged three and a daughter aged four months, although his relationship with the mother was âon and offâ and there is little evidence of his parenting skills in the activities with which I am concerned. He has had limited experience in employment, or only one period of extended employment being nine months as a factory hand.
	
	
	I will address the matters relating to his education shortly but he was when arrested on a Newstart Allowance.
	
	
	He reported a heavy use of illicit substances, including methylamphetamines and heroin, claiming that he would spend âup to $10,000 per weekâ on these drugs. Where he would find money to maintain an addiction of $10,000 a week worth of prohibited drugs is not disclosed by him in any material he has provided to me. His mental health, however, has been unstable as understood by the Community Corrections and he said in relation to his offending in respect of the current matters that he was âmessed up at the timeâ and that his actions were âquite stupidâ.
	
	
	He is at a medium to high risk of reoffending with a raft of matters that need to be addressed, including education, his leisure time, his companions, his alcohol and drug problems, his emotional personal problems and most importantly his attitude and orientation.
	
	
	With regard to his prison performance it is not entirely positive, as I have earlier foreshadowed and whilst he acknowledges he needs to undertake treatment to address his drug and alcohol problems, particularly drug problems, he is in a position of âprotectionâ at the moment, or at the time of the making of the report, which he is not prepared to leave to undertake those programs. The assessment of the Community Corrections is that:
	


âDespite his apparent insight into the correlation between his drug abuse and offending the prisoner has previously demonstrated a poor commitment to addressing this issue when last released to parole supervision and presented as tentative when discussing possible treatment within a custodial environment.â


	
	Although he has the continued support of his family, it is obvious that his health issues, particularly his mental health issues, and his drug dependency will require very close monitoring on his release eventually and there is a need for him to address various aspects of his conduct, including anger management, drug and alcohol dependency and also to ensure that he gets proper psychological and mental treatment.
	
	
	Mr Williamsâ report in relation to supervision is somewhat more favourable. The report from the Community Corrections Service notes that his previous periods of supervision have been generally satisfactory. In fact in 2003 when on suspended sentences his positive response led to premature, or early, termination of his supervision.
	
	
	Another period of supervision in 2006 led to entry into Oolong House which program he successfully completed, as he successfully completed a community service order.
	
	
	Whilst in custody his conduct has been satisfactory. There have been a few infractions. He has been employed within the Parklea Correctional Centre and is regarded as a good worker.
	
	
	He has an upbringing in a small Aboriginal community between Tumut and Gundagai. His parents separated when he was quite young due to problems caused by alcohol abuse and domestic violence, this account is supported by his mother. His father died in December 2012, although his father apparently had little contact with him. He had what he described as a good childhood and is well regarded by his mother and supported by her. His is the father of five children from two relationships and he has children aged between 13 and 1. Four of his children, as I understand it, live in the Campbelltown area and his relationship with his partner has suffered because of his illicit substance abuse.
	
	
	He has had little formal education, but in 2003 he completed a Certificate in Conservation and Land Management and was employed by the Local Aboriginal Lands Council and in 2006. He obtained employment as a traffic controller, but was made redundant in 2011/12. This was the period during which there was substantial dropping away of his offending and it would seem that the employment opportunity provided considerable stability to his life.
	
	
	On losing that employment, through no fault of his own, he went back to drug abuse, particularly the use of methylamphetamine with a long history of abuse of alcohol and prohibited drugs before that. It was the use of amphetamines that ultimately led to his involvement in the escapade with his co-accused.
	
	
	He acknowledged that the main purpose of the offending was to obtain money for illicit substances and he said that he was endeavouring in Tumut at least to obtain money and valuables from them for that purpose but it was, he described an âafterthoughtâ to his initial approach for the purposes of obtaining drugs.
	
	
	The prisonerâs categorisation of the offending at Tumut was that it was a âdrug deal gone wrongâ. The facts reveal to me nothing of the sort, with respect. But having said that he acknowledges that the victims were entitled to be safe in their own home. He acknowledged their actions would have caused them considerable distress and he offered an apology which was categorised as âinsincereâ because he believed the victims were involved in criminal activities, particularly as illicit substances could be obtained from the premises.
	
	
	The prisoner is a medium to high risk of reoffending. He particularly needs assistance in relation to addressing his drug problems and his predisposition to violence. He appeared before the Community Corrections Officer as despondent and hopeless ruminating upon lost opportunities and upon the effect upon his family. He had insight as to how his actions may have affected the victims, but as I said countered that âempathyâ by minimising his conduct towards the people at Tumut by reason of what he believed to be their own criminal activities. The views of the prisoner in relation to the victim on 30 August at StÂ Helens are not known.
	


MR ROBERTSâ CASE


	
	With regard to Mr Roberts there is a body of evidence that touches upon his mental health issues which are complicated. There is a report by DrÂ Olav Nielssen dated 1 August 2014 which was tendered on the last occasion. There does not seem to be a great deal of information in the report to reflect his understanding or assessment of some of the records that were provided to me, particularly what appears to be a patient summary from an Aboriginal Medical Service in the Campbelltown area.
	
	
	I have read through that document. It commences in 2004 and comes through to just before the prisonerâs return to custody in 2013, contains many extensive notes of medication provided to the prisoner and various medical ailments, including assessment of conditions reflected in Dr Nielssenâs report in a very general way. The report from the medical centre in the Campbelltown area notes that on 19 June 2013 whilst he was on parole he reported to the doctor or the medical attendant that he was back on âopioidsâ again and he confessed that he had continued his addiction to âBup (sic) and heroinâ in gaol and he used drugs, amongst other reasons, because it was âfunâ, but also because life was âoverwhelming at timesâ.
	
	
	He had been introduced to a methadone program but had abandoned that, it would appear, according to the notes available to this Court. I have the progress notes that appear to have been prepared in relation to the prisonerâs care in Corrective Services as well. Those notes reflect that he has been recommended early this year for entry to the methadone program in custody. He gives histories in those notes relating to his use of prohibited drugs in the past and presentations in the past of psychosis.
	
	
	Dr Nielssenâs report covers much material that I have already outlined. I do not propose to repeat matters that have already been the subject of comment from the evidence but he reflects upon treatment for mental health conditions whilst in Juvenile Justice care where he was diagnosed with âschizophreniaâ and treated with a range of âantipsychotic medicationsâ.
	
	
	He has been receiving antidepressant and antipsychotic medication in custody from time to time. He said that he had on occasions had hallucinations and also heard voices, and said that he understood and recognised those as not ârealâ, but had difficulty controlling them.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen spoke to the prisonerâs father and confirmed the history that the father gave evidence about to me. He noted the prisonerâs âsymptoms of mental illnessâ and understood that something was not right with his son. He noted that on an occasion that the prisoner came back from custody he âcame home with 20 different pillsâ and he believed that when he came out of gaol the first time he thought that something was really wrong because he came out âten times worse offâ. He said that during his recent period of liberty, that is the last time he was on parole, the prisoner was agitated and could not relax.
	
	
	After a mental state examination he noted the prisonerâs capacity for brief and direct answers and other matters, reflecting that the prisonerâs intelligence would be estimated to be in the normal range. The doctor expressed the opinion that the prisoner had a chronic psychotic illness, to wit schizophrenia, which was currently in remission. He said there was little in the way of residual signs of schizophrenia during the recent interview and that his symptoms of delusional beliefs and the like were well controlled on a standard dose of medication. This was consistent with a less severe and treatment responsive form of psychotic illness. He also had a diagnosis of the prisoner of substance abuse disorder having regard to his history of abuse of drugs. He also noted the role of drug use in triggering psychotic illness. He thought that the prisoner had largely recovered from an acute or the acute phase of mental illness and would remain well provided he had adequate attention to his medication.
	
	
	I mentioned earlier the prisoner provided a statement to the Court setting out details of his background. He was subjected to, confirmed by his father, racial abuse as a child in the Campbelltown area. This led to a number of changes of school. He also suffered abuse based upon his race in local sport and he was accomplished at particular sports, particularly rugby league but as his father said in his evidence, basically had to abandon his sporting ambitions because of his treatment. He gave details in his statement of the medications he had taken over the years. He claimed that he had been told some time ago that he had HepatitisÂ C but in fact that was a false alarm. He does not believe he has that. He gave details of his drug use and his current protective custody. He has been stood over by another inmate and was in protective custody at Junee which has restricted his access to programs which I have taken into account.
	
	
	He said so far as the offences are concerned that:
	


âThe stress of my life at the time led to the crime spree. I was living with my mum. I had to support my family and kids. I had no job or income and I was using drugs.â


	
	He said that he was âfried on drugsâ and he acknowledged the fear that may have or did cause the victims and would hope to improve in the future.
	
	
	The fatherâs evidence, as I said, supported the account of the prisoner in his statement and he reflected upon the prisonerâs treatment at school, the changes of school and the disillusionment with study, being placed in a special school but one that did not encourage any type of academic achievement. It was in these circumstances that he came into contact with what the father described as âantisocial peersâ and was ultimately recruited by older people to participate in a ring of children who were stealing from shopping centres. He noted upon his career as a promising footballer and how racism had turned him away from sport. He said that he and his wife did their very best but they could not overcome the problems that were created for their son by his treatment at school and outside of school.
	
	
	I accept the evidence of the father and I accept the account given by the prisoner. This evidence in its own way demonstrates the corruptive and pervasive characteristic of racism and highlights the deleterious effect it has on individuals, discouraging educational attainment, encouraging dissociation from family and the community and leading to a life which is described in the submissions as a life of âsocial exclusionsâ, or isolation from the mainstream or even oneâs own community.
	


MR WILLIAMSâ CASE


	
	With regard to Mr Williams, apart from the presentence report, I have a psychologistâs report and it provides a great deal more detail about his background. He attended the Brungle Public School which is a very small school attached to the Aboriginal community at Brungle. I am very familiar with Brungle, I have been there a number of times. In fact I have lived on âErambieâ at Cowra (an Aboriginal âmissionâ) and I knew many people in Cowra who had family in Brungle. It is a very impoverished disadvantaged community.
	
	
	He reflected upon his employment history to the psychologist and I have already mentioned those matters. He gave some history in his account to the psychologist of mental illness within his family, including his father and people within his community who had committed suicide and selfâharmed. He recalled a history of anxiety and panic attacks beginning in 2000 and he sometimes heard a womanâs voice telling him to open his eyes and lower his voice. He has never been diagnosed by a medical practitioner with a major mental illness, although he probably has exhibited a number of symptoms consistent with a psychotic reaction to drugs that he has been taking. He has a history of abuse of crystal methamphetamine from about five years ago which has culminated in the current offending.
	
	
	His history of offending has involved association with peers who themselves were regular offenders and he relates his offending in the past and in the present as largely connected to his associations and his use of drugs. He said of his use of methylamphetamine, and I quote from the report âWhen on ice, youâre not a member of society anymore, lost all morals, everything I stood for went out the window.â He would like to undertake a rehabilitation program.
	
	
	The psychologist undertook a number of psychometric tests. He has a moderate level of depression, anxiety and stress. So far as his dependence on illegal substance his score is beyond the threshold required for psychological dependence/compulsive use of illicit substances.
	
	
	With regard to intelligence his score was reasonably good. His score on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition, was between 86 and 97 on verbal and nonâverbal scales. This places him within the average range.
	
	
	So far as the assessment of the prisoner is concerned the psychologist noted a positive outlook for the future, realistic about his need to gain formal assistance. He reported endeavours to avoid use of substances whilst in custody and it was noted that the prisoner would have symptoms of anxiety and depression and stress naturally exacerbated by his circumstances in custody.
	
	
	It was recommended that he participate in a rehabilitation program on his release from custody and this will be a matter for the Parole Authority. Odyssey House was recommended by the author and also he would benefit from Community Offender Services naturally enough and would require some psychotherapy.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF MR WILLIAMS


	
	In relation to the submissions, I will deal firstly with the submissions that were put by Mr King. Mr King in his usual skilful way gave a fair and balanced assessment of the material available. He accepted that although the prisoner played a different role than his co-accused in the Tumut robberies, ultimately their roles were equal, particularly given their involvement in a joint criminal enterprise in which they jointly took advantage of the actions of the other.
	
	
	He made submissions about the dangerous weapon which I have already referred to and made submissions of the level of seriousness of the offending given that the fact that the weapon was not capable by discharge of inflicting serious harm.
	
	
	It was acknowledged in relation to matters of aggravation, there was the threatened use of weapons, the fact that the prisoner and his co-accused were inâcompany, the use of force, although causing limited injury, limited planning and that it was not a feature of any of the common offences between his client and the co-accused that planning was an aggravating factor.
	
	
	The Crown had later submitted and had provided to Mr King written submissions that the planning was more extensive than Mr King was submitting, on the basis that the planning extended back to the taking of the motor vehicle and the stealing of the number plates. This is a submission that I do not accept but I will deal with that shortly.
	
	
	Mr King pointed to the fact the prisoner knew the people involved and had a reasonable expectation of the fact that there may be drugs available at the premises he attended, although he noted of course that a number of people were robbed within their own home which is an aggravating factor.
	
	
	It was acknowledged by him that the victim was vulnerable in the armed robbery of the service station. There was the use of violence, but again, there was not planning such as to make that an aggravation. He said that in relation to the break enter matters on 22 September 2013, including by that description the attempted breaking and entering, the circumstance of aggravation was that the people were âinâcompanyâ. This is a circumstance of aggravation on the facts of this case at the lower end of the range of aggravations that may be pleaded. I agree with that submission. There was no one home, there was no violence. I understand that there are circumstances of aggravation that would be more serious than the ones with which I am concerned.
	
	
	Emphasis was placed upon his prospects of rehabilitation, and particularly I was taken to paraÂ 36 and 37 of the psychologistâs report which reflect upon his future plans, particularly rehabilitation programs outside of gaol and cooperation with the Community Corrections service which I have already noted. It was also noted that his extended period of time of employment between 2006 and 2011 had led to considerable stability and a marked reduction in his offending.
	
	
	It was noted that he had come from a background of considerable disadvantage and had many events occur in his early life that deprived him of opportunities that people ordinarily would expect to be available to them.
	
	
	He submitted that one might divine what he described as some âblueâskyâ any future prospects.
	
	
	It was submitted and I rightly take it into account the issue of totality of sentencing as discussed by the High Court for example in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly in the majority judgment at [45] and the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment of [2000] of Hammoud. I need to take into account the sentencing at the Local Court which I have done in the manner I have foreshadowed. It was submitted that I should find special circumstances.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF MR ROBERTS


	
	Dealing with the submissions on behalf of Mr Roberts, there were extensive submissions that were tendered and many of the oral submissions focussed on those written submissions.
	
	
	The primary submission made on behalf of Mr Roberts, that he was profoundly affected by racism from his early years and that the evidence revealed taunting and abuse and violent pursuit that led to acts of selfâharm and the prisoner âspiralling out of controlâ falling into a pattern of drug use, criminality and psychosis.
	
	
	The issue of racism and its affect upon him was reflected in a number of studies, the copies of which were provided to me and about which there was specific submissions made. One such study from 2011, published in the Medical Journal of Australia, entitled âRacism as a Determinative Social and Emotional Wellbeing for Aboriginal Australian Youthâ, concluded that there was a nexus between the experience of racism and the development of anxiety, depression, suicide risk and overall poor mental health for victims of it.
	
	
	These findings were consistent with studies internationally and what were âcrossâsectional studiesâ in Australia. Late adolescence and early childhood were identified as a time of heightened vulnerability to psychological stress resulting from experiences of racism.
	
	
	It was argued in submissions that the racism suffered by the prisoner can be taken to be a form of âsocial exclusionâ which has been the subject of a number of studies in the United States, including a study from 2007 in âThe Journal of Personality and Social Psychologyâ, the learned authors identified in the written submissions, and another study âThe Inner Dimension of Social Exclusion: Intelligent Thought and SelfâRegulation Among Rejected Personsâ, from âThe Journal of Personality and Social Psychologyâ. These various articles and others, with learned authors such as Professors Twenge and Baumeister, were the subject of comment by his Honour Rothman J in the sentencing of Mr Lewis for murder earlier this year ([2014] NSWSC 1127).
	
	
	These studies to which his Honour referred observe that âself-regulation and a cognition instead of emotion were the most important in a process of change as a response to social exclusionâ.
	
	
	Baumeister and others said in one of the articles:
	


âIt rejected or excluded people. Exhibit poor selfâregulation in many spheres. They also show impairments in intelligent thought, though these are limited to forms of thought that are linked to selfâregulation (i.e., thinking processes that depend on effortful control by the selfâs executive functioning).â


	
	The learned authors and others point out that patterns of behaviour across a number of groups within the United States show, âhigh aggression, self-defeating behaviours, reduced prosocial contributions to society as a whole, and ... impaired self-regulationâ, arising from social exclusion caused by racism.
	
	
	In referring to these studies Rothman J concluded that:
	


âIn the way that Fernando principles had been taken into account in sentencing Aboriginal people in particular circumstances the matters identified by Baumeister and his colleagues may be used to mitigate or fashion an appropriate sentence, but not so as to impose a sentence that does not reflect the seriousness of the offence.â (Lewis at [41] - [43])


	
	It was submitted that the behaviour of the prisoner mirrored the outcomes of studies identified in the judgment of Rothman J, including high aggression, selfâdefeating behaviours, reduced prosocial contributions, inappropriate acceptance seeking and impaired selfâregulation. These were reflected by the commission of offences, drug use, criminality, self-harm, suicide ideation, limited positive work in the community, falling in with older criminals and the like. It was submitted that racism that the prisoner suffered as a child amounted to independent subject matter that could be considered in mitigation of the sentence imposed being a foundation for âdescent into drug addiction and criminality.â
	
	
	Reference was also made to the decision of Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37, noting the observations of the High Court at [43] - [44], that the experience of growing up in an environment of alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person for life as will the effects of profound childhood deprivation.
	
	
	Observations may also be cited from the case of Munda v Western Australia ([2013] HCA 38) concerning the disinhibiting and emotionally neutralising effect of an environment of deprivation.
	
	
	Reliance was also made upon the observations of Simpson J in RÂ vÂ Millwood [2012], particularly at [69], that a dysfunctional childhood and a lack of opportunity has a bearing upon the assessment of the moral responsibility of an offender. A tragic and dysfunctional upbringing was a relevant consideration in mitigation, although limited, similar to the approach taken by Wood J, as he then was, in R v Fernando ((1992) 76 AÂ CrimÂ R 58).
	
	
	These matters I accept. I will come back to Bugmy and Munda shortly, but in the context of what has been submitted in the context of Mr Roberts it could well be said of course, in fact in one sense more so, that these observations have applicability to Mr Williams, coming from the unstable community in which he grew up as opposed to the more stable domestic circumstances of Mr Roberts.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Roberts it was submitted the history of early drug use following upon alcohol use graduating through methylamphetamine by the age of 17 or 18 set the scene for an understanding of the circumstances of the commission of crimes to obtain money to obtain drugs (SSÂ vÂ R [2009] NSWCCA 114). The occurrence of drug addiction at a very young age has been recognised as an exception to the general rule laid down in the matters discussed by Wood J in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, particularly (at [273]) when his Honour discussed, if I might call them, the qualifications to the general proposition that drug use or addiction does not mitigate sentence in the sentencing for armed robbery matters.
	
	
	Of course I am mindful of what sÂ 21A(5AA) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 states about prohibiting use of âselfâinduced induced intoxicationâ at the time of the offence as mitigation. That provision, as was pointed out in submissions, does not specifically concern itself with the context in which particular offending may occur.
	
	
	Reference was also made to the observations of McClellan J in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [177]. In that case his Honour specifically summarised the principles that relate to the sentencing of an offender suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems.
	
	
	The many cases that his Honour cited were summarised by him in the following manner:
	


âWhere a state of a personâs mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way the offenderâs moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently, the need to denounce the crime may be reduced for the reduction of sentence.â


	
	His Honour said that it may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which might otherwise have been imposed. It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced. It may reduce or eliminate the significance of personal deterrence. It may conversely mean, as Gleeson CJ points out in Engert, that greater emphasis may be required to be given on protection of the community because of the danger that that person represents. Here it is submitted that the prisoner is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and that custody in its various forms will be onerous for him given his history of selfâharm. Also, his moral culpability is less and the need for specific deterrence is moderated by what is said to be success in treatment and maintaining his illness. I accept these submissions to varying degrees.
	
	
	It is submitted further that he is entitled to the benefit of recognition of his contrition and remorse following upon his pleas of guilty. It is common ground to both offenders of course that their pleas of guilty are matters that will lead to substantial discounts to recognise the utilitarian benefit of their pleas.
	
	
	Mr King had submitted that his client was entitled to a discount of 25%, as I understood the submission of counsel for Mr Roberts. In my view and in accordance with the guideline judgment each of the offenders should receive such a discount.
	
	
	Submissions were made about the issue of the time already spend in custody and I was taken to the decision of Simpson J in (Callaghan (2006) 160Â AÂ CrimÂ R 145) and the need for consideration of totality of criminality.
	
	
	It was also submitted that I should make a finding of special circumstances including having regard to the relative youth of the prisoner, his circumstances of custody, the avoidance of institutionalisation and the need for particular supervision and guidance in a range of areas. In relation to the issue of institutionalisation I was taken to the decision of Jackson v R [2010] NSWCCA 162, particularly at [25]. It was ultimately submitted I should not impose a crushing sentence.
	
	
	As I said, most of those matters that I have summarised from the written submissions were repeated in the oral submissions and there is very little to add to what has already been quoted but I have taken all submissions into account from the parties.
	


CROWNâS SUBMISSIONS


	
	The Crown provided some helpful summaries which went through what he had pointed to be aggravating and mitigating factors arising under sÂ 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In relation to Mr Williams the Crown emphasised that he was involved in what it described as a âtravelling road showâ of criminal activity and it was in this context that the planning issue that it raised was to be considered. It noted the use of firearms that were in the possession of the offenders for a lengthy period of time, the possession of a metal bar, the stealing of number plates in Murrumbateman to which I referred and the use of what was effectively a stolen motor vehicle for the commission of the crime. It was said that this reflected upon the degree of planning, particularly in relation to the armed robberies at Tumut.
	
	
	It was submitted by the Crown that an inference of preplanning could be had from these matters. But, as I pointed out to the Crown, if it was to be found as a matter of aggravation it would be a matter that I would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about. I have a reasonable doubt that the taking of the number plates or the taking of the car were part of a plan to commit armed robberies, let alone the armed robberies at Tumut, to which I am particularly concerned.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Roberts, the Crownâs specific oral submissions that it was not a matter of considering the issue of sentencing of Aboriginal people, it was a matter of considering the issue of disadvantage in general. Ultimately, though, the Crown conceded that racism may be regarded as a relevant matter in the way in which the defence submitted its effect was to be considered. But it reduced, it was submitted, because drug use was the primary course of the offending.
	
	
	It must be fairly said that the interrelationship between the conditions for âsocial exclusionâ and dependence on drugs is clearly demonstrated, it seems to me, anecdotally let alone without regard to the learned writings of Judges superior to me or learned authors in Australia or the United States. The correlation between drug abuse and disadvantage is overwhelmingly established by the parade of human suffering and misery that comes through the doors of these Courts in most of the cases we hear.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the Justice Health records and the presentation of the prisoner in custody after his release and submitted that the medical records were relevant to assessing his prospects of rehabilitation. It noted from these records that he seemed to have limited insight in relation to his situation and this was a matter that would cause the Court to have a pause in considering that he had real prospects of rehabilitation.
	


SUBMISSIONS IN REPLY


	
	In reply it was conceded that whilst there is evidence to which the Crown referred that could be taken into account in relation to Mr Roberts in relation to his prospects of rehabilitation, there was still the issue of his youth and his mental illness that were pertinent to assessing these matters and also the issue of special circumstances.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	With the helpful summaries that were provided by the learned Crown, I wish to deal with some of the matters that arise under sÂ 21A. Certainly I accept, as I must, in relation to the robbery at St Helens Park that, common to both offenders, was the actual and threatened use of weapons, the fact that the offenders were in company and that Mr Azzi was a vulnerable person.
	
	
	The Crown would submit that there were multiple acts. Theoretically that may be so, arising under sÂ 21A(2)(m), but I cannot conclude that it is an aggravating factor. The planning aspect of that offence was neutral.
	
	
	With regard to both offenders in relation to the Tumut offences, the actual and threatened use of weapons in company in the home of the victims clearly are aggravating factors, there can be no dispute about that, but I have earlier indicated that I could not conclude that planning is an aggravating factor in those matters.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Robertsâ involvement in the earlier armed robbery on 27Â August, the fact is that the offence was committed in company and that the victim was vulnerable, allowing for the fact that there was another employee was present, as it was the early hours of the morning and the people in the shop were confronted by armed persons, albeit armed with screwdrivers, not dangerous weapons or knives capable of inflicting serious injury. With regard to Mr Roberts, of course, a common aggravating factor is the breach of conditional liberty on parole for armed robbery.
	
	
	If one wanted a model for the complexities and subtleties of sentencing one could not go past the challenge that this sentencing exercise has presented, not only in respect of each offender has there been a need to pay close attention to the concept of totality of sentencing given the number of offences over the varying periods of time committed by each of the offenders but there are also many other issues, some of which I have already addressed above.
	
	
	These include taking into account matters on a Form 1 as arise in relation to the armed robbery on 30Â August common to both men. I do so in accordance with the guideline judgment from 2002 of the Court of Criminal Appeal. There the learned Chief Justice discussed the issue of matters being taken into account on a FormÂ 1 and pointed out that where matters are to be taken into account on a FormÂ 1 depending upon which matters they are, there is a need to give close attention to the communities entitlement to extract retribution where greater weight would be given to personal deterrence the entire point of the process it was said was usually to impose a longer sentence, or to alter the nature of the sentence that would be imposed if the principal offence had stood alone.
	
	
	Of course, as the Court pointed out, the process of sentencing is concerned with the principal sentence and discreet recognition of the effect of the FormÂ 1 matters is not required. There are matters which limit the effect of matters on a Form 1 in the sentencing exercise, the express provisions of the Act, the maximum penalty for the primary offence and of course the principle of totality.
	
	
	Rarely is it appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the effect of the sentence for a principal offence taking into account FormÂ 1 matters. In general terms I refer to the various observations of the Chief Justice between [18] and [43] of that judgment.
	
	
	Of course in each sentencing exercise there is a need to have regard to the various purposes of sentencing set out in sÂ 3A of the âSentencing Procedureâ Act acknowledging them, as the High Court famously said in Veen (No 2) in 1988, that the four purposes of sentencing that the majority of that decision identified (which are now included, amongst the more numerous purposes of sentencing in sÂ 3A of the Act) were âguidepostsâ that sometimes pointed in opposite directions.
	
	
	So far as Mr Williamsâ breaking, entering matters the primary aggravation is of course pleaded in the charge and, of course, an aggravating factor that is an element of the offence is not to be taken into account additionally under sÂ 21A of the Act.
	
	
	With regard to the offending of the offenders I have ultimately concluded that mitigating factors that arise are that none of the offences were part of a planned or organised criminal activity, the pleas of guilty of each of the accused as acknowledged by the Crown.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept some expressions of remorse by MrÂ Williams, albeit that the weight to be given to that is somewhat leavened by the observations of a Community Corrections officer, the pleas of guilty of course reflect some remorse on the part of that prisoner as well. With regard to Mr Roberts his expressions of remorse are more clear, although only marginally so.
	
	
	Of course I cannot find as mitigating factors that either of the offenders had no significant record, were persons of good character or are unlikely to reoffend. I do not believe I can conclude that they necessarily have âgood prospects of rehabilitationâ as a mitigating factor, but having said that, in both offenders, there is some âblue skyâ to use the words of Mr King.
	
	
	As to sÂ 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in each offendersâ case I have made a finding of special circumstances, of necessity it arises from the various partial accumulations of sentence but in my view there is in each case a need for an extensive period of supervision to assist them to adjust to community living and to receive appropriate direction and supervision in relation to a raft of matters that are worthy of professional assistance.
	
	
	Of course sÂ 5 of the Act falls away because there is no other penalty other than imprisonment that can be imposed.
	
	
	The two prisoners, as I have pointed out, have a number of common offences. These matters and other aspects of the sentences exercise require consideration of parity principles or the principle of âequal justiceâ.
	
	
	My task has been somewhat more complicated because at the âheel of the huntâ, about which I do not complain now but was somewhat less than happy about it at 9.30 this morning, I have received material in relation to a coâoffender who was apparently sentenced on 13 November, I would have much appreciated this material to be made available to me before the last few days when I had spare moments preparing these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	The matter I am referring to is that in respect of the offence on 27Â August for which Mr Roberts is to be sentenced a co-offender MrÂ Kinchela has been sentenced by his Honour Judge Conlon at the Wollongong District Court. In relation to that matter I have the facts, I have Mr Kinchelaâs criminal history, I have material from the State Parole Authority setting out details of his failings on parole and other matters which apparently were taken into account by his Honour Judge Conlon. I do not have his Honourâs remarks on sentence. What I have is the sentence imposed which is a total sentence of four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. I have no idea what particular case was run on behalf of Mr Kinchela. I have taken into account his Honourâs sentence as best I can, given the paucity of information.
	
	
	One matter I should point to in relation to what I do know about MrÂ Kinchela in the context of sentencing Mr Roberts for the same offence is that Mr Kinchela is two years older, he has what can fairly be said to be a lengthier criminal history. He too was on parole in relation to an offence of robbery in company for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of over four years. He was in breach of his parole in relation to that matter at the time of the offending, as was Mr Roberts. I note in relation to Mr Kinchelaâs criminal history that he has a number of terms of imprisonment imposed upon him, much greater than the number of terms of imprisonment that have been imposed upon Mr Roberts to this point.
	
	
	Speaking of that matter and the sentencing of Mr Williams it is to be noted that where offenders are to be sentenced in relation to common offences the penalties imposed upon each should be such as not to give rise to a âjustifiable sense of grievanceâ as was discussed by the High Court in the 1984 decision Lowe v R. The complexities of that term came to bear in subsequent decisions where for example an otherwise appropriate sentence may be not excessive but may be found subsequently, sometimes years after the event, to be excessive because of a subsequent sentence imposed upon a co-offender who was more leniently dealt with. The concept of the âparity of sentencingâ has to some extend morphed into the concept of âequal justiceâ which as I may have mentioned earlier in various places has been described as a âfundamental aspect of the exercise of judicial powerâ.
	
	
	Rothman J, to whom IÂ referred earlier as the Judge in the decision of Lewis adopting what could be called âBaumeisterâ reasoning about which he has written an article (âThe impact of Bugmy and Munda on sentencing of Aboriginal and other offendersâ: VolÂ 26 No 23, Judicial Officersâ Bulletin April 2014) addressed the matter of equal justice in the context of parity of sentencing in the decision of Jimmy v R (2010) 77 NSWLR 540, particularly at [254] - [266].
	
	
	His Honour followed upon the observations of Dawson and Gaudron JJ concerning âequal justiceâ in parity of sentencing in the High Court judgment of Postiglione v R and Aristotelian principles of equality. In the context of equal justice arise also consideration of sentencing principles concerned with the treatment of Aboriginal offenders too, particularly in the context of the sentencing of offenders who are products of their own unique social or personal circumstances, such as Mr Williams coming from a community outside of Tumut riven with complex social and economic issues of disadvantage, discrimination and dysfunction, and Mr Roberts growing up in a more stable environment in Western Sydney, but subject to racism and bullying leading to what has been described as social isolation and the consequent impact upon his social and emotional wellbeing, an impairment of the selfâregulationing and his capacity for prosocial behaviour.
	
	
	Not only is the spirit of what I may call Fernando principles alive in each sentencing exercise here, allowing of course for some important factual distinctions between the circumstances of Mr Fernando in Brewarrina and the crimes and the social conditions of the crimes of these offenders committing offences to obtain resources and money to buy drugs, but more pertinently are the general principles discussed by the High Court in the two decisions earlier referred to of Bugmy and Munda. Reference in those decisions was made to Fernando, the decision of Eames JA (Victoria) in Fuller-Cust, Neal and other cases. All these cases point to consideration of the social circumstances of Aboriginal offenders and their varying ways as being relevant to the assessment of moral culpability of the particular offender (see Bugmy at [40] - [52]) and I have taken that into account here.
	
	
	In the context of the narrow issue of parity there are a raft of competing considerations. Although each of the offenders in relation to their common offences performed different roles they actively participated in specific joint criminal enterprise to which they have pleaded guilty. So far as the objective facts are concerned making allowance for their different roles, the different level of threats, the different weapons and their different actions the objective seriousness of each of their offences is very much the same.
	
	
	I am very mindful of the fact that Mr Williams was more likely to have had knowledge of the victims of the Tumut robberies as a source of purchase of drugs but that could only be of some of the victims in any event. He may have led the way in introductions and other vocalised participation but also MrÂ Roberts was an active and enthusiastic follower or participant and in those offences there is ultimately very little to distinguish them.
	
	
	I am not assisted in sentencing the two prisoners in understanding how the dividend of their criminal activities was divided. But one could reasonably assume that it was divided equally between themselves and the other participants.
	
	
	Subjectively, of course, there are many significant differences between the two offenders, the differences in age of course are an important matter. Some of the differences, however, cancel each other out to the extent where the offending is common.
	
	
	Mr Williams does not have any prior findings of guilt in relation to armed robbery, although, he does have a finding of guilt in relation to robbery many years before.
	
	
	Both of them, as I have earlier said, have criminal histories that disentitle them to any particular leniency, but not criminal histories that constitute aggravating factors pursuant to sÂ 21A(2) of the Act. The criminal histories, of course, have got to be seen in the context of their personal and social backgrounds.
	
	
	On the other hand, in a short period of time, Mr Roberts developed a formidable record, and a significant distinction between he and Mr Williams is the fact that Mr Roberts committed his offending whilst subject to parole, and MrÂ Williams was not subject to conditional liberty.
	
	
	I bear in mind also Mr Roberts has committed the armed robbery of 27Â August before committing the robberies which were common to him and MrÂ Williams. On the other hand, Mr Williams has a criminal history that is concerned with a longer period of time. Mr Williams also went on to commit the other crimes while Mr Roberts was in custody.
	
	
	Mr Roberts has certain mental health problems which are more significant than the circumstances of MrÂ Williams. Mr Roberts has produced objective evidence of his medication and treatment for his health problems over a long period of time, adding support for the contentions of his counsel as to the corrosive effects of what is described as social isolation.
	
	
	On the other hand, Mr Williams has had the opportunity of employment in his midâ20s and has provided for him a settled lifestyle and has demonstrated his capacity to lead a law-abiding life. I have already pointed out that that was disrupted through no fault of his.
	
	
	Mr Roberts has had almost no employment opportunity and has really spiralled out of control since leaving school. Even his settled parents and his partner have not been able to help him in that regard. I note, of course, MrÂ Roberts has an extra armed robbery matter for sentence.
	
	
	Mr Williams has other offending, itself serious, carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years with a standard non-parole period of five years. I also note Mr Williams was subsequently involved in a police pursuit which led to a substantial sentence.
	
	
	In relation to the armed robbery matters I have had regard to the decision of Henry which I have earlier cited and particularly the guideline pointed out by his Honour by reference to categories of case which are âsufficiently common for the purposes of determining a guidelineâ set out at [162]. I am also mindful of matters of what could be called aggravation or other matters, the intensity of which will vary reflecting upon the appropriateness of the guideline summarised by his Honour at [170].
	
	
	With regard to the offences Mr Williams faces, in respect of which there is a standard non-parole period, I am mindful of the terms of sÂ 54A(2) of the Act which provides that in fixing a non-parole period for an offence that has the standard non-parole period, as I am obliged to do, the Court is in that sentencing exercise to note that the standard non-parole period identified represents the standard non-parole period taking into account only the objective factors. In determining where the offence fits in the range of seriousness, s 54B(2) provides that the standard non-parole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by a Court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender, without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for the offender. In this regard of course I note the decision of Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120, where the majority of the High Court held, leading to the statutory regime we now have, that consistent with âMarkarian principlesâ the standard non-parole period was but one of many matters to be taken into account in determining the appropriate non-parole period. Here the relevant offence is below the meddle range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	With regard to both offenders, of course, there are different considerations in relation to the commencement dates of their sentences. In sentencing the offenders, not only is the seriousness of the offending, the interests of the victims and the varying aggravating factors as identified by the parties to be taken into account. But I am required also to have regard to the interests of the individual offenders in the way in which those matters have been discussed in cases such as Blackman and Walters, from 2001, where Wood J adopted what had been said by King J in Yardley & Betts v R in 1978 relating to the protection of the community being enhanced by the reformation of offenders.
	
	
	I also am aware of the obiter observations of Wood J in Moffitt v R (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 to which counsel for the accused Roberts referred, and particularly what his Honour said in pp 120 â 121, where his Honour identified matters relevant to the consideration of a finding of special circumstances, there considering of course sÂ 9 of the Sentencing Act 1989, the predecessor to the current sÂ 44, particularly risks of institutionalisation, the youth of offenders and the like.
	
	
	I have also taken into account the observations of Simpson J in R v Callaghan for the need to avoid doubleâdipping in fixing an appropriate sentence where a breach of conditional liberty has been taken into account, and also as I have earlier pointed out, making an assessment of the moral culpability of the offenders have regard to all relevant circumstances.
	
	
	Although both offenders, for either obvious, or different reasons, require different commencement dates for their sentence, and whilst I have decided ultimately that the total sentence to be imposed upon Mr Roberts will be slightly less than that imposed upon Mr Williams, the differences between their respective sentences is relatively marginal. The most compelling matters that warrant an adjustment in favour of Mr Roberts are his comparative youth and the significance of the matters identified in submission arising from the summary of relevant principles in De La Rosa, given the more convincing evidence of the presence of mental health issues in the background of the prisoner Mr Roberts.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	I am sorry to take so long, gentlemen, it must have been excruciating for you but there are many things to be addressed. If you donât address them, people complain and thus they have to be given their appropriate attention.
	
	
	Mr Roberts, would you mind standing up first, please, if you do not mind?
	
	
	In relation to the offence of armed robbery committed at Mount Pritchard, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years and six months to date from 1 March 2014 and to expire, on my calculation, on 31Â August 2017. In relation to that offence I decline to fix a non-parole period for obvious reasons because that sentence will be absorbed into other sentences.
	
	
	In relation to the offence committed on 30 August 2013 you are convicted. Taking into account the matter on the FormÂ 1 you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of two years and nine months from 1 March 2015 expiring, on my calculation, on 30 November 2017 the balance of sentence expiring on 28/02/2019. The balance of the sentence being one year and three months is to expire on 28/02/2019. The total sentence of imprisonment is four years. I find special circumstances. You will be eligible for release to parole on 30/11/2017.
	
	
	In relation to the offences committed at Tumut, it is the robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, taking into account the matters on the FormÂ 1, given the close relationship of all those offences to one another, noting all that has been said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to taking matters into account on a FormÂ 1 but also the very intimate relationship of the matters on the FormÂ 1 to the principal offending, I propose to impose concurrent sentences for each of those matters. You are sentenced in respect of each count to a term of imprisonment by way of non parole period of two years to date from 1 March 2016 to expire on 28 February 2018. In relation to each of those sentences I fix a balance of sentence of three years and three months. That is a total sentence, on my calculation, of five years and three months. The starting point of that sentence was seven years with a discount of 25%.
	
	
	You can take a seat, thank you very much.
	
	
	Mr Williams, do you mind standing thanks very much.
	
	
	In relation to the offences of aggravated breaking and entering, and attempted aggravated breaking and entering, or however it is specifically described in the Court Attendance Notice, you are convicted in each matter.
	
	
	In respect of the breaking and entering offence you are sentenced to three years imprisonment to date from 17 July 2014. That acknowledges the nine month non-parole period fixed by the Magistrate. That sentence will expire on 16 July 2017. In relation to that offence, because I am required under law to fix a non-parole period I fix a non-parole period of one year to date from 17 July 2014, to expire on 16 July 2015.
	
	
	In relation to count 2, the attempted offence as it is called, I give you a lesser sentence. You are sentenced to two years imprisonment, that shall date from 17 July 2014 and expire on 16 July 2016, 16, not 17. I fix in relation to that offence a non-parole period of one year to date from 17 July 2014 and expiring on 16 July 2015.
	
	
	In relation to the sÂ 116 certificate, Madam Crown, I am right, there are two related offences, one of take and drive a conveyance, the other of unlicensed driving?
	
	
	SMITH: Thatâs correct, your Honour, and in relation to the backup offences Iâd ask that they be dismissed.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I am happy to do that, I will dismiss the backup charge, itâs a malicious damage charge, isnât it, from memory?
	
	
	SMITH: Thatâs correct, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I havenât got the certificate. I couldnât find the certificate when I was sorting this out early this morning.
	
	
	In relation to the take and drive vehicle matter, you are sentenced to six months imprisonment, that will date from 17 July 2014, expire on 16Â July 2015.
	
	
	In relation to the drive whilst unlicensed pursuant to sÂ 10A you are convicted without penalty.
	
	
	In relation to the armed robbery matter committed on 30 August, that is with a dangerous weapon, taking into account the matter on the FormÂ 1 you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of nonâparole period of three years and three months to commence on 7Â July 2015. That period of non-parole will expire on 16 October 2018. In relation to that offence I fix a balance of sentence of one year three months to date from the expiry of your non-parole period, that balance of sentence will expire on 16Â January 2020.
	
	
	In relation to the matters in Tumut, likewise, I fix concurrent sentences taking into account the matters on the FormÂ 1. In respect of counts 1 and 2 you are convicted. In respect of each matter you are sentenced to a non-parole period on each offence to two years and five months to date from 17Â July 2016. That non-parole period will expire on 16 December 2018. On my calculation that leaves a balance of sentence in relation to each offence of three years and seven months. That balance of sentence on my calculation will expire on 16 July 2022.
	
	
	You will be eligible for release to parole on 16 December 2018; and MrÂ Roberts will be eligible for release to parole, on my calculation, on 28Â February 2018, and the differences between your sentences I trust I have explained.
	
	
	Madam Crown, are there any technical matters?
	
	
	SMITH: Your Honour, in relation to the offender Roberts, in respect of the very first sentence that you imposed at Mount Pritchard, if your Honour could just please give me the dates in relation to that because I think I mistranscribed them?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: As I have noted it in handwriting, and I hope I said it the way I have written it out in hand, three years six months imprisonment dating from 1Â March 2014, expiring on my calculation 31 August 2017.
	
	
	SMITH: Thank you, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: That is taking into account the four year sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Conlon, in relation to the other offender, making allowance for the paucity of information and all the rest.
	
	
	SMITH: Thank you, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: What I know of the others criminal history and the fact they were both on parole.
	
	
	STYLES: Your Honour, just one matter, for the record I made a note, your Honour may or may not have said this but in respect of--
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I am sure I said it and Iâm sure itâs wrong but you tell me what Iâve said?
	
	
	STYLES: In respect of the offence for Mr Roberts on 30 August 2013 at StÂ HelensÂ Park.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes.
	
	
	STYLES: Your Honour, I think said that the penalty was expiring in 2007 which fairly obviously on my interpretation was 30 November 2017.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: No. No. Just let me double-check my figures. Two years nine months from 1 March 2015 expiring on 2017.
	
	
	STYLES: Yes, I think you might have expressed 2007.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thatâs what I have written, 2017. If it slipped out â2007â that is an obvious error and the balance of sentence expiring on 28 February 2019. The fixing of the non-parole period for that is to permit the accumulation of the other sentence.
	
	
	STYLES: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: But the overall effective sentence in your clientâs case will be seven years three months with an effective non-parole period of four years reflecting a finding of special circumstances on a range of basis, and likewise in relation to Mr Williams, a finding of special circumstances on a range of basis but effectively for him a total sentence of eight years with a non-parole period of four years five months but different commencement dates.
	
	
	STYLES: Your Honour, just for the prisoners who I fear we may not be able to see before they get shipped, can your Honour just repeat the ultimate possible release dates?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I am going to do that.
	
	
	STYLES: Thank you, your Honour. I have nothing other technical to add.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: This is just a barrage of words for your client and Mr Kingâs client, I understand all that, itâs a barrage of words that might be expressed in shorter detail by another judge, I donât know, but certainly requires attention to many issues that if not mentioned will be the subject of complaint.
	
	
	Mr Williams, in your case, you are going to be eligible for parole on 16Â December 2018, that is going to be in about four yearsâ time, just over four yearsâ time, do you understand that?
	
	
	And in your case Mr Williams, you are going to be eligible for parole on 28Â February 2018.
	
	
	OFFENDER WILLIAMS: I am sorry your Honour, whoâs that, who was that for, you said Mr Williams twice?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Sorry. Mr Roberts. Mr Roberts is eligible for parole on 28Â February 2018. So youâre eligible for parole about nine and a half months after Mr Robertsâ is eligible for parole. But your sentence starts a bit later because of that non-parole period fixed by the Magistrate and it will be a matter for the Parole Authority whether you are released to parole at that time. I canât come downstairs with you and explain it all to you again, Iâm afraid, I donât mean that unkindly but Iâm hoping you will understand in your case the total sentence imposed is eight years with a non-parole period of four years five months, and in the case of Mr Roberts it is a total sentence of seven years three months with a non-parole period of four years with different commencing dates.
	
	
	Thank you, you are excused. Thank you, gentlemen, very much. Thank you to the Corrective Services Officers.

		18 January 2016",2014-11-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765407,R v Habib [2014] NSWDC 324,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Families and friendships fracture for various reasons, but, often enough, money is involved. In this case a dispute over money led to the offender attacking his cousin with a knife. Fortunately his cousin sustained only a very minor injury but the offender never the less faces being sent to gaol for his violent conduct on 9 March 2013.
	
	
	A dispute arose between Sleimen Chidiac the offenderâs cousin and the offender over some tiling work done at a Westfield Shopping Centre. The evidence established that there was some court proceedings which were resolved in Mr Chidiacâs favour, but the offender continued to maintain and continued to believe that Mr Chidiac owed him a considerable sum of money. Tension simmered for some-time with the dispute being kept on the boil by the circumstance that Mr Chidiac would often drive past the offenderâs premises and exchange words with him on his way to visit his brother who lived near the offender.
	
	
	I am satisfied despite the submissions to the contrary by the Crown that the offender has established on the balance of probabilities that Mr Chidiac would yell things out to him as he drove past the premises where the offender often was, it being the location of his home and the attached convenience store which he ran with his wife.
	
	
	Matters came to a head on the evening of 9 March 2013. We know a lot of what happened that day because it was filmed by closed circuit television cameras installed in the offenderâs premises. The offender was sitting on an upturned milk crate out the front of the supermarket. Mr Chidiac drove past with his children in the car. Words were exchanged, as was usually the case, but this time the offenderâs anger boiled over, he was seen on the CCTV footage to go inside his supermarket and arm himself with a knife which was kept under the counter. He then partially secreted the knife before heading down the road towards Mr Chidiac. The offenderâs wife, no doubt alarmed at what she had seen her husband do, tried to prevent him from approaching Mr Chidiac. She stood in front of her husband, but he pushed past her because he was not to be deterred. When he got to Mr Chidiac the offender raised the knife above his head and brought it down towards Mr Chidiac intending to stab him. Fortunately Mr Chidiac was able to grab the offenderâs arm and he suffered only a very minor abrasion. Other members of Mr Chidiacâs family arrived on the scene and they too got involved attempting to take the knife away from the offender so that he could not stab Mr Chidiac. Eventually they succeeded.
	
	
	I of course will sentence Mr Habib, consistent with the juryâs verdict, on the basis that he attempted and thus intended to wound his cousin with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. It is important to understand this fundamental matter. I am not going to sentence Mr Habib on the basis that he merely intended to threaten his cousin or that he intended some injury less than grievous bodily harm. Submissions made to me today on behalf of Mr Habib get close to overlooking the fundamental nature of the guilty verdict returned by the jury.
	
	
	Somehow in the course of the struggle for the knife the offender himself was injured. Most significantly he suffered injury to his left eye and he has lost the sight in that eye. Mr Russell suggested that this occurred as a result of gratuitous violence on the part of Mr Chidiac and his family members. I reject that submission entirely. I am satisfied that the offender was injured accidentally in the course of the struggle over the knife after he attempted to stab his cousin, whether he would not let go of it because he was genuinely afraid for his own safety is beside the point. Mr Chidiacâs family were aware that he had just attempted to stab Mr Chidiac and, they were aware that the offender was refusing to let go of the knife. In those circumstances one can easily understand why there would be a violent struggle. It is unfortunate that in the course of that struggle over possession of the knife the offender was injured as significantly as he was.
	
	
	Also injured in the course of the struggle was Ms Noelle Chidiac, Mr Sleimen Chidiacâs wife. She suffered a minor wound to her thumb. The offender faced a charge in relation to that injury but the jury acquitted him, no doubt on the basis that at the time the wound was occasioned the offender was unable to control the movements of his knife.
	
	
	The jury verdict was entirely appropriate and indeed any other outcome would have been perverse. The offenderâs case, a case that he maintains in evidence even today, was that he merely wanted to frighten Mr Chidiac. But, as the jury verdict indicates, he wanted to do much more than that, he intended to wound Mr Chidiac thereby occasioning him grievous bodily harm, a serious offence which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.
	
	
	That of course is not to overlook the fact Mr Habib the offender did not succeed in wounding or causing grievous bodily harm to his cousin. He is not to be sentenced as though he had achieved his objective, even though of course, it was no change of mind on the offenderâs part which led to the absence of serious injury to Mr Chidiac.
	
	
	The offender is now 49 years of age and a man of otherwise good character. That good character can be looked at in both positive and negative terms. In a positive sense many people speak highly of him and he has achieved a great deal. In a negative sense he has no previous convictions. He has never before been violent and never before acted in a way which would lead to harm to another person. I am satisfied this offence is very much an isolated one. The offender has good prospects for rehabilitation and there needs to be little component of personal deterrence built into the sentence that I will shortly announce.
	
	
	The offender was born in Lebanon to a poor, hard working family who farmed the land. He is one of nine children. He was married in Lebanon when he was 19 and first came to Australia when he was 28, for two reasons: Lebanon was undergoing significant conflict at the time; and there was work available in Australia. He came to Australia on a work visa, immediately found work, and became a permanent resident, before his wife joined him in this country. He and his wife attempted for many years to have a child and it was only after considerable efforts that they were rewarded with the birth of their son. I will return later to the circumstances of the offenderâs son in a short time.
	
	
	The offender has maintained the family tradition of being a hard worker. He developed skills as a tile and stone polisher while in Lebanon and continued to follow that trade in Australia. He and his wife also run a mixed business shop. The pre-sentence report prepared after interviewing the offender suggests that he did the buying and the stocking of the shop while his wife generally operated it.
	
	
	There is evidence that Mr Russell relies on as to the consequences to the offenderâs wife, son and business in the event that he is sent to full time gaol. The offenderâs son, now 8 years of age, has reacted badly to the events which have occurred since the 9 March 2013. He is very anxious at the prospect of his father going to gaol, he often wakes in the middle of the night believing that his father is gone and screams out for his father. The psychologist report says Charbel is very attached to his father and any separation will likely cause further exasperation of his condition.
	
	
	The offenderâs wife relies on his assistance in running the shop, her English skills are poor and I accept that both she and the business will suffer in the event that the offender is incarcerated.
	
	
	On the other hand the law is clear. I can only take into account hardship to third parties in circumstances which are exceptional. I regret to say that the circumstances I have described are far from exceptional, indeed they are commonplace when bread winners and fathers are sent to gaol. Many children with a close relationship to a parent suffer when that parent goes to gaol for offences that person has committed. Many spouses who are assisted in the running of a business also suffer when a wrongdoer goes to gaol. In this case I cannot take the hardship to third parties into account, except as part of the general mix of subjective factors. One of those subjective factors will of course be that the offender will know that it is his wrongdoing, even if he is not prepared to admit the extent of it, which has led to his son, wife and business suffering as a result of his incarceration.
	
	
	One matter which I will take into account very much in the offenderâs favour is of course the extra curial punishment occasioned to the offender through the loss of sight of one of his eyes. An ophthalmic surgeonâs report was tendered. The sight in Mr Habibâs injured eye was described as extremely poor with him only vaguely perceiving light in that eye. Various doctors have recommended to the offender that the injured eye is removed in order to reduce the risk of sympathetic ophthalmia, a condition whereby an otherwise healthy eye begins to lose sight because of an injury to the other eye. The offender has resisted accepting that advice. Fortunately his good eye is, at present, functioning well. It is hard to overestimate the consequence for the offender of having lost the sight in one eye. All aspects of his life will have suffered since 9 March 2013. It is a very significant price to pay for his offending on that date.
	
	
	The offender pleaded not guilty. He of course is not to be punished for that, but it does indicate a lack of real remorse for what he did. That lack of real remorse continues to this day, although the offender said that he made a mistake in carrying the knife he still refuses to admit that he intended to stab his cousin and apparently says that he is sorry only because he did not know how it was going to have such a destructive effect on his family. He makes bizarre suggestions that somehow he was lured into a trap with the group who attempted to disarm him, having hidden themselves from view before he approached.
	
	
	Ordinarily this lack of remorse would be a significant part in me assessing the prospects of the offenderâs rehabilitation, but as I have already said, and this is so even despite the lack of real remorse, I am satisfied he does have good prospects for rehabilitation. In a way it is understandable that he might focus on what has happened to him rather than the consequences for his cousin and his cousinâs family.
	
	
	The offence was clearly unplanned, it was obvious on the CCTV footage that the offender was simply enjoying a quiet evening with a couple of friends outside his shop when his cousin drove past. His decision to go and get the knife and head after his cousin whilst armed with that weapon was clearly a spur of the moment decision.
	
	
	He did have the opportunity to turn around after his wife attempted to persuade him to desist, but as is clear and as I already mentioned, he was not to be deterred.
	
	
	I find also on the balance of probabilities that the offence was provoked by Mr Chidiacâs comments to the offender as he drove past the offenderâs shop.
	
	
	Mr Russell has helpfully provided me with a number of cases where people were sentenced for offences involving what was described in earlier times as malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. It is to be noted that, and this is stating the obvious, no other case is ever truly comparable. However, I am able to take note of the differences between the case before me and the cases to which Mr Russell referred and I have found assistance in those cases, taking into account of course that the offender did not plead guilty and was convicted of an attempt rather than the completed offence as two of the most obvious differences between cases relied on by Mr Russell and the present.
	
	
	It was Mr Russellâs submission that I should deal with this matter by means of an intensive corrections order or a suspended sentence of imprisonment. Implicit in that submission is of course the concession that a sentence of imprisonment was required. Quite clearly I have no hesitation in accepting that concession. The next step in the process is to consider the length of the appropriate sentence of imprisonment and only if the sentence is such that there are alternatives to full time imprisonment do I need to consider whether one of those alternatives should be adopted.
	
	
	It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that an offender needs to be sentenced for the objective gravity of their conduct. Even though the offender was through no decision of his own unsuccessful in actually stabbing his cousin, his conduct was gravely criminal. To take a large knife, wander down the street and attempt to stab someone with that knife in an attempt to cause grievous bodily harm is of course criminality of a very serious order.
	
	
	General deterrence is of prime importance. Often enough various members of the community decide that they will resolve disputes and they will respond to provocation with violence and weapons. In far too many cases people are significantly injured and indeed even killed by such actions. Thus where a person is convicted of an offence of attempting to wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, unless there are unusual circumstances, a sentence must be imposed which would go at least some way to deterring others who may be tempted to do what the offender attempted to do that night. I have decided on a sentence of imprisonment which is such that no alternatives to full time imprisonment arise.
	
	
	The offender is sentenced to imprisonment, I set a non-parole period of 18 months to date 20 November 2014 and a head sentence of three years, the non-parole period will expire on 19 May 2016 on which day the offender is to be released to parole.

2765415,Ramandious v Habashy [2014] NSWDC 237,"Judgment

1These are reasons for rulings on the form and capacity of imputations pleaded, in accordance with my obligation to provide reasons for such orders: Ahmed v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 11.

2The plaintiff, a priest of the Coptic Orthodox Church, brings proceedings for defamation for two publications by the Arabic language newspaper ""Egypt today"". 

3The nature of the rulings requires the setting out of each of the matters complained of in full. The text of the first matter complained of, accepting the somewhat idiosyncratic numbering and grammar, is as follows:

(1) We request clarification from the Diocese of Sydney

(2) We notify the valued readers that everything published on this page is either documented or copied from other sites. Our opinion, however, appears between brackets starting with the word [Comment...]

(3) Firstly, we require clarification from the Diocese of Sydney...

(4) On 27/2/2014 Father Georgious Ramandious was again attending one of the protestant [sic] meetings. The only thing left for him it to take his Coptic Orthodoc congregation along to those meetings.

(4A) We would then close down our churches or sell them; we would never need to purchase churches or donate for their continuity in our Coptic community, since priests attend protestant churches. The priest no longer needs to hold the Godly mass handed down from our early fathers; chanting two or three hymns would suffice.

(5) Didn't Jesus Christ say, ""Woe to the person through whom stumbles come""? If you caused people to stumble, what would you do to implement Jesus [sic] commandment?

(5A) The recklessness by the diocese and the irresponsible behaviours constitute the start of disintegration and collapse of the Coptic Church in Sydney-Australia [sic].

(6) Secondly: we require clarification from the Diocese of Sydney regarding an article published in Al-Ahram Al Jadid Newspaper on 17/2/2014. We mean the article entitled ""Sydney Copts Request Pope Tawadros Detain their Bishop in Cairo"". The valued readers can access the full article online. The article discussed many issues in detail, in part the following: 1-The reconciliation conference the Bishop attended with terrorist Muslim Borthers Association that has strong ties with Hamas organisation in Gaza and Sinai. 2-Ordaining Father Youssef, his relative as a priest without the knowledge of the congregations of Saint Mary's and Saint Mina's Cathedral. 3-The second file concerns the three Coptic schools the Bishop would like to regain management over; they appeal to him because of financial gains and government assistance bestowed on them. The schools are still new and he presently keeps trying to achieve his goal.""

4The imputations pleaded to arise from this publication are:

(a)Imputation 6(a): The plaintiff is a traitor to the Coptic Orthodox Church because he attended and supported the rival Protestant Church. According to the letter from the solicitors for the defendants of 4 November 2014, this imputation is not challenged; the complaint is that it does not differ in substance from imputation 6(c);

(b)Imputation 6(b): The plaintiff proposes to close down and destroy the Coptic Orthodox Church. The defendants challenge form (particularly ""proposes"") and capacity;

(c)Imputation 6(c): The plaintiff is disloyal.The defendants submit this imputation does not differ in substance from imputation 6(a);

(d)Imputation 6(d): The plaintiff should be defrocked. The defendants complain this is rhetorical and does not differ in substance from imputation 6(f);

(e)Imputation 6(e): The plaintiff is a disgrace to the Coptic Orthodox Church. The defendants challenge form and capacity;

(f)Imputation 6(f): The plaintiff should be excommunicated.The defendants raise the same objections as to imputation 6(d).

5The text of the second matter complained of is as follows:

(1) A Plan to convert the Coptic Church in [sic]

(2) Egypt to a Protestant Church within 20 years [sic]

(2C) Where are you Father Georgious?

(3) Protestants don't have priesthood. They reject the rest of the sacraments and the rest of the Orthodox doctrine.

(4) They have also removed Holy Scriptures that were cited in the Jewish Old Testament and acknowledged by all Catholic and Orthodox churches including the Coptic Church. Those are Tobit, Judith, Joshua son of Sirach, Baruch, Book of Wisdom, First Maccabees, Second Maccabees; they also removed the rest of Daniel's book. They printed the Bible excluding those scriptures.

(5) Jesus Christ himself spoke to Jews during the Feast of Dedication (John 10:22 - 25) ""at that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem; it was winter.""

(6) The strange thing is that the Feast of Dedication was not at all mentioned in any books of the Bible, but, it was mentioned in one of the books Protestants removed; it was the book of the First Maccabees (1st Maccabees 4:59). The Maccabees were the first to celebrate the Feast of Dedication, which meant the renovation and reconstruction of the Temple. They removed the idols' sanctuary created by the Seleucids to replace the Temple of Solomon. Having defeated the Seleucids, they renovated the Temple and resumed offering sacrifices. This was the Feast Jesus Christ took part in at the Temple; to date, it is regarded by the Jewish people as a popular national celebration.

(7) The Feast did not exist before the Maccabees; however, since Jesus Christ celebrated it, the First and Second Maccabees books shall be considerered inspired scriptures, even though they were subsequently omitted by the Protestants.

(8) The Four Gospel writers quoted some verses from the other canonical scriptures omitted by Protestants, including (Tobit 4:10, 7, 11) (compare Luke 14: 14, 14). Scores of other quotes used by the disciples and apostles of Christ in the Bible were omitted by Protestants. If the disciples did not believe in those scriptures, why would they mention and cite them in the New Testament? This is proof that Protestantism is against Christian faith.

(9) [Protestantism is relatively a [sic] new sect (they omitted the books 16 centuries after the beginning of Christianity)!!]. By doing this they fell under the weight of the verse, ""if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the Holy City, which are written in this book."" (Revelation 22:19).

(10) I would have liked Father Georgious Ramandious to be one of St Mark's lion cubs, strongly defending the Orthodox faith with an article on the subject. However, he let the attackers attack the church's doctrine. He visited their churches wearing his religious Coptic garb, not caring what impact his visit would leave on the ignorant and lay Coptic people.

(11) Father Georgious did this while knowing that Protestants don't believe in the priesthood, the laying of hands and the Orthodox doctrine as a whole.

(12) If he did not know, this would have been a serious problem; being a priest and not knowing the simplest of conflicts between us and them.

(13) There is also another problem, for he attended protestant meetings in Blacktown, meaning that he encouraged people not from his church to go to the Protestants, because there are some lay and ignorant Copts who are indecisive in their faith; when they attend a Coptic mass, they say, ""We are Orthodox"", and again they say, ""We are Protestants"" when they attend the Protestant one.

(13A) They are like chameleons; they change colour and camouflage to blend in with their surroundings. Others proclaim openly that they are Orthodox, despite being Protestants in their heart and soul.

(14) Biased rumours that aim to destroy the Coptic Church were circulated. Those rumours spread that his Holiness, Pope Tawadros, teamed up with the Protestants. In fact, this is not true, it's a rumour spread by Protestants in our church to draw the public to their church. They are a fifth column that crept into our midst.

(14A) We respond with the Apostle Paul [sic] words in his epistle to the Galatians, where he said: ""But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema"". (Galatians 1:8: the New King James Version). He then repeated the same expression, saying: ""As we have said before, so say I now again, if any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema (denounced)"". Those Protestants preach to us other than what we received from the fathers, so what are they then?

(15) I heard the rumour claiming that the Pople came to an agreement with Protestants from a person I sent with a letter to Bishop Daniel regarding Father Georgious.

(16) We ask Bishop Daniel, Father Georgious and others from the fifth column to show us either a written order issued by the Pope or a signed decision of Pope Tawadros to unite the Church with Protestants, or even a decision by the Holy Synod to unite in faith with Protestants.

(17) Moreover, it would be preposterous for me to pray at a mosque if I see the Pope attending the Azhar for a matter. We raise the question here, ""Has the Diocese of Sydney United with the Protestants without our knowledge, like it reconciled with the Muslim Brothers?""

(18) The Coptic Church is bleeding heavily. I hope Pope Tawadros personally responsible for what is happening and will happen, because he insisted on Bishop Daniel's return to Sydney, and disregarded His Holiness Pope Shenouda's wisdom in keeping him away. 

(19) Egyptians were able to topple down Mubarak the dictator, and Mursi and terrorist who ruined Egypt and the lives of Egyptians.

(20) So, how long will Bishop Daniel remain in his position to manage the Diocese of Sydney in a twisted manner on financial and spiritual levels?

(21) We requested clarification from the Diocese of Sydney regarding the money that was collected outside the churches and where it was.

(22) We also requested clarification regarding Priest Georgiouss [sic] regular attendance at Protestant churches and requested investigating his knowledge on the doctrine. Was he inclined to Protestants? We suggested discussing with him the extent of his knowledge of the orthodox doctrine!! And other questions that we do not know the answer to.

(23) However, it appears that the Diocese is feigning sleep and overlooking breaches committed by that priest, despite Bishop Daniel previously attacking other priests without legitimate reasons. We wonder why discrimination was shown in the treatment of this priest in comparison to other priests.

(24) Bishop Bakhomious stopped Pries Iskandar Andrawos in Egypt because he always attended Protestant churches. Howeve, what did Bishop Daniel do in regards [sic] to Priest Georgious who always attends Protestant churches in Australia? O Diocese, we want an answer!

(25) The Diocese probably kept quiet and did not issue a statement for the following reasons: the Diocese might have been ashamed of the behaviour of that priest; it might have been protecting him; he might have had more authority than the Diocese; or maybe the Diocese accepted his behaviour and encouraged him. The readers might be able to add more reasons that did not cross my mind. 2//4/2014.

(26) Loose thinking in Sydney Diocese.The Diocese of Sydney has fallen into loose thinking saying that there is no difference between Orthodox and Protestant. This thinking spreads among those entrusted with the service and servants at Sunday Schools; its contagion even affected some priests.

(2A) [sic] His Grace Bishoy Exposes the Protestant Plan...We are now, in the Diocese of Sydney, witnessing the practical execution of a plan, mentioned previously by his Grace Bishop Bishoy, while he was the Secretary and the Head of the Doctrine in the Holy Synod in 2009. The plan is to convert the Orthodoc Church in Egypt to a Protestant Church within 20 years. The Bishop declared that the plan aims primarily to convert Orthodox to Protestants. The Holy Sydnod's Secretary disclosed that some priests have adopted the Protestant ideology. Egypt witnessed clandestine meetings and movements where activists published books with their personal interpretations of the Gospel. Interpretations of the disciples, Nicaean Fathers or the Fathers of the early Church were not cited.

(2B) The annual Conference of Doctrine Confirmation in Egypt witnessed a plan to invade the Orthodox Church and convert it to a Protestant Church that year. His Grace pointed out that this plan would not be executed by foreign hands but by insiders. His Grace Bishoy revealed that some priests have adopted Protestant ideology. He indicated that the Church took ecumenical action against a priest; that he was banned from teaching because he refused to comply after we explained to him the dangers of the Anglican ideology.

(27) A General and Important WarningThe newspaper allows writers full freedom to express their opinions, therefore contents [sic] of published articles don't necessarily reflect the newspaper's opinion. They primarily express the opinions of their authors. The newspaper fully respects the opinions and counter opinions.Handwritten words: Even when lying, slandering and abusing??? 5/3/2014

6The imputations pleaded to arise are as follows:

(a)Imputation 9(a): The plaintiff is a traitor to the Coptic Orthodox Church because he attended and supported the rival Protestant Church. The defendants submit this does not differ in substance from imputation 9(c).

(b)Imputation 9(b): The plaintiff proposes to close down and destroy the Coptic Orthodox Church. The defendants challenge form (""proposes"") and capacity.

(c)Imputation 9(c): The plaintiff is disloyal. The defendants submit that this imputation does not differ in substance from imputation 9(a).

(d)Imputation 9(d): The plaintiff should be defrocked. The defendants challenge form and capacity and say this imputation does not differ in substance from imputation 9(h).

(e)Imputation 9(e): The plaintiff serves and assists the Protestant Church against his own Coptic Orthodox Church. The defendants submit this does not differ in substance from imputation 9(a);

(f)Imputation 9(f): The plaintiff is a fifth columnist. The defendants challenge form and capacity and submit this imputation does not differ in substance from imputation 9(a);

(g)Imputation 9(g): The plaintiff is a disgrace to the Orthodox Coptic Church. The defendants complain this imputation is rhetorical.

(h)Imputation 9(h): The plaintiff should be excommunicated. The defendants submit this imputation is not conveyed and/or that it does not differ in substance from being defrocked. 

7The matters complained of make serious allegations and are capable of conveying defamatory meanings of and concerning the plaintiff. The question is whether the plaintiff has adequately distilled those imputations in terms of form and capacity of the imputations pleaded.

Principles applicable to the striking out of imputations

Capacity

8The standard by which issues of law raised in a separate trial on capacity was most recently explained in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227:

""[134] That standard by which the issue of law raised by the separate trial was to be determined was addressed in Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 52; (2005) 79 ALJR 1716 (""Favell"") where the plurality (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Heydon JJ, Kirby J generally agreeing) approved the following statement by McPherson JA in the Court of Appeal:

Whether or not [the pleading] ought to and will be struck out [as disclosing no cause of action] is ultimately a matter for the discretion of the judge who hears the application. Such a step is not to be undertaken lightly but only, it has been said, with great caution. In the end, however, it depends on the degree of assurance with which the requisite conclusion is or can be arrived at. The fact that reasonable minds may possibly differ about whether or not the material is capable of a defamatory meaning is a strong, perhaps an insuperable, reason for not exercising the discretion to strike out. But once the conclusion is firmly reached, there is no justification for delaying or avoiding that step [at] whatever stage it falls to be taken. (Emphasis added)

[135] Accordingly, the capacity determination is ""an exercise in generosity not parsimony""; while it involves a ""matter of impression ... the impression is not of what the words mean but of what a jury could sensibly think they meant"": Berezovsky (at [16]) per Sedley LJ delivering the judgment of the court. Implicit in Sedley LJ's observation, is that the question of course is ""what a jury could sensibly think [the words] meant"" to the ordinary reasonable reader.

[136] One reason ""great caution"" is mandated at the capacity stage, is because the conclusion which necessarily underpins a determination that the matter complained of is not capable of conveying the pleaded imputations is that ""no reader could reasonably understand the words to bear any meaning outside the range delimited ... by the judge; and that it would be 'perverse' for any jury to do so"": Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe SPRL [2003] EWCA Civ 1694; [2004] EMLR 89 (""Jameel"") (at [9]) per Simon Brown LJ (Mummery and Mance LJJ agreeing).

[137] Thus, the focus should be on the fact that the decision deprives the plaintiff of the opportunity to present his or her case to the jury, the importance of whose constitutional role in this area as representatives of the community is frequently emphasised: see John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Rivkin [2003] HCA 50 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1657 (""Rivkin"") (at [2]) per Gleeson CJ (who also agreed with Callinan J); (at [184]) per Callinan J. The significance of the jury's role warrants the application of a ""high threshold of exclusion"": Jameel (at [14]) per Simon Brown LJ

[138] In Favell (at [14]-[15]), the plurality appeared to apply a capacity test which asked whether challenged imputations ""could reasonably be found by a jury"". This is the test adopted in this court: see Marsden (at 164) per Hunt CJ at CL (Mason P and Handley JA agreeing); Griffith v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 300 (at [19](a)); Malcolm v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 254; (2007) Aust Torts Reports 81-915 (at [14]) per Beazley JA (Basten JA and McClellan CJ at CL agreeing). It is consistent with the test applied when determining generally whether a case should be left to a jury: see Naxakis v Western General Hospital [1999] HCA 22; (1999) 197 CLR 269 (at [16]) per Gaudron J; (at [45]) per McHugh J; (at [66]-[67]) per Kirby J; cf Gleeson CJ (at [1]); Callinan J (at [117]-[123]). Naxakis concerned the test to be applied when directing a jury at the close of evidence to enter a verdict in favour of the defendant. Whether or not the Naxakis approach is strictly that which should be applied at a capacity determination was not argued. In any event the court is bound to follow Marsden.""

Defamatory meaning

9Only in an extreme and obvious case would the issue of defamatory meaning be withdrawn from the tribunal of fact at trial: Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton [2009] HCA 16; Bik v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd [1973] 2 NSWLR 473.

Form of imputations

10Where the basis of the objection is one of form, the requirement is that the imputation must specify the act or condition allegedly attributed to the plaintiff by the matter complained of with sufficient clarity to enable the defendants to know the case they have to meet: Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135.

11As is often the case with applications of this kind, the principal problems with the plaintiff's imputations were not issues of capacity or defamatory meaning, but failure to distil a clear defamatory meaning, failure to differ in substance from each other and pleading imputations which are inconsistent and/or should be pleaded as a fallback to each other. This case is another example of poorly drafted imputations where the generosity of the test for capacity is conflated with an entitlement to plead imputations that are defective as to form. The objections made, and the plaintiff's responses, both conflated issues of form and capacity, when these are two quite different objections.

The imputations the subject of challenge 

12The imputations which are challenged are as follows:

Imputation 6(b)

13Mrs Barnett submitted that the use of the word ""propose"" amounted to saying that there was a possibility or probability that such a course would be taken, and that an imputation to this effect had been struck out by McCallum J in Alex v Gridneff [2013] NSWSC 2025. Counsel for the plaintiff agreed that the use of the word ""proposes"" was impermissible, and was granted leave to replead.

Imputation 6(a) and 6(c)

14The defendants do not challenge imputation 6(a); their complaint is that imputation 6(c) covered similar ground, but that one was worse than the other, in circumstances where they were true alternates. Being disloyal should be pleaded as a lesser imputation to being a traitor, which the parties agreed was the more serious imputation.

15If being a traitor is a more serious form of being disloyal, a fall-back imputation is the appropriate step to take: Kelly v Fairfax Media Publications [2012] NSWSC 690 at [15]-[16]. As for the alternate submission that both imputations cannot arise at the same time, the same fall-back pleading procedure would be still required (Feros v West Sydney Radio Pty Ltd (New South Wales Court of Appeal, Moffitt P, Reynolds and Samuels JJA, 22 June 1982), although as a matter of logic it is hard to see how a person can be a traitor without being disloyal. Whether the imputations are questions of degree, or are inconsistent but separate stings, they should be pleaded as fall-back imputations.

16Accordingly, imputations 6(a) and 6(c) must be pleaded as fall-backs.

Imputations 6(d) and 6(f)

17Leaving aside the rhetorical use of the word ""should"", which is a question of form, the defendants submit that this is one of those rare cases where an imputation should be struck out on a capacity basis. Where does the matter complained of state, or even infer, that by attending Church of England services, the plaintiff deserves to be not only defrocked, but excommunicated?

18Counsel for the plaintiff conceded in argument that the imputation of deserving excommunication was not conveyed, but argued that an imputation that the plaintiff should be defrocked was capable arising from the general tenor of the publication.

19I do not accept this submission. The only reference to the plaintiff is in paragraph 4, where it refers to him ""again"" attending a Church of England service. The matter complained of clearly says that the authors want clarification about what is occurring, but goes no further than being critical of the diocese on the basis that they are ""irresponsibly"" not preventing this conduct. 

20Neither of these imputations is capable of being conveyed.

Imputation 6(e) 

21In Lucas v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 950 at [26] Levine J stated:

""[26] As to imputation 6(e); it is submitted that this does not differ in substance from imputation (b). I agree. Imputation (e) is really a rhetorical flourish and, in my view, it adds nothing to the substance of the first three imputations which, without questioning their meaning in any sense, contain all the elements of ""disgrace"" and ignominy attendant on being convicted of such offences. Imputations (d) and (e) will be struck out.""

22For the same reasons here, an imputation that the plaintiff is a ""disgrace"" is a mere rhetorical flourish, in that it could mean anything.

Imputations 9(a) and 9(c)

23Although the text of this publication is stronger, the issue of whether the imputation conveyed is one of being a traitor or mere disloyalty is an issue of form, and I make the same ruling.

Imputation 9(b)

24Counsel for the plaintiff made the same concession as to form in relation to the word ""proposes"".

Imputation 9(d) and 9(h)

25Although the matter complained of contains considerable criticism of the plaintiff, it stops well short of stating, or even inferring, that he should be defrocked. Counsel for the plaintiff conceded that, even though this publication is couched in stronger language, an imputation of deserving excommunication is not conveyed.

Imputation 9(e)

26Imputation 9(e) was withdrawn during argument.

Imputation 9(f)

27Leave to replead this imputation was granted during argument.

Imputation 9(g)

28Conformably with my ruling concerning imputation 6(e), this imputation is struck out.

Costs

29The defendants have been successful in relation to the objections that were taken, and the plaintiff should pay the defendants' costs.

Orders

(1)Grant leave to the plaintiff to amend imputation 6(b) to replace ""proposes"" with ""intends"" and hold that an imputation to this effect is capable of being conveyed.

(2)Imputation 6(c) is to be pleaded as a fall-back to imputation 6(a).

(3)Imputations 6(d), 6(e) and 6(f) are struck out.

(4)In relation to imputation 9(b), grant leave to the plaintiff to amend ""plans"" in place of ""proposes"" and hold that an imputation so pleaded is capable of being conveyed.

(5)Imputation 9(c) is to be pleaded as a fall-back to imputation 9(a).

(6)Imputations 9(d), 9(g) and 9(h) are struck out.

(7)Imputation 9(e) is withdrawn.

(8)Imputation 9(f) is struck out with leave to replead.

(9)Plaintiff to file an Amended Statement of Claim in 14 days.

(10)Matter stood over to Friday 19 December 2014 for further directions.

(11)Plaintiff pay the defendants' costs.

		16 December 2014",2014-11-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765416,R v Brandon Sharpley [2014] NSWDC 253,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: Brandon Sharpley, the offender, is a 19 year old Aboriginal man from Walgett. He was 18 years old at the time of the offences for which he is to be sentenced. The offences occurred in Walgett, the town in which the offender was born and which he and his family resided. He grew up in Namoi Village which is one of two Aboriginal communities located close to Walgett.
	
	
	The matters for which he is to be sentenced are two offences of aggravated break enter and steal committed in the early hours of 11 December 2013. The premises broken into was a local shop called âGourmet Foodsâ. The property stolen on both occasions was a quantity of soft drink and Powerade.
	
	
	On 12 September 2014 sitting at Coonamble District Court I sentenced his co-offender and cousin, Brett Sharpley, for the same two offences. With respect to the first offence Brett Sharpley was dealt with by way of a s 9 bond for a period of two years. For the second offence Brett Sharpley was ordered to perform 100 hours of community service work. During those proceedings I received unchallenged evidence with respect to the socio-economic conditions pertaining to the Walgett Aboriginal community.
	
	
	Whilst on that occasion this offender was not present, Mr Day, his solicitor, appeared on his behalf and I gave him leave to adduce evidence from Mr Trindall, the field officer for the Aboriginal Legal Service. That evidence was tendered in this offenderâs case.
	
	
	At about 12.40am on 11 December 2013 this offender, together with his cousin, Brett Sharpley, broke into the gourmet food takeaway shop in Walgett by kicking the door of the storage room. They took a carton of 24 cans of Lift soft drink valued at $18. Their attendance on that occasion was captured on CCTV. They made no attempt to disguise themselves or hide their identity.
	
	
	About an hour later, at 1.40am, the two offenders returned with juveniles who will be referred to as MH and JT. They again accessed the storage room for about five minutes, each taking a carton of Powerade drinks valued at $40 each. Once again none of the offenders attempted to disguise themselves or cover their faces. The CCTV footage depicts the offenders and as I understand it depicts a dog with distinctive markings observed to be walking with the group.
	
	
	Upon discovering the storeroom door open and the missing stock the police were called. Subsequent to their attendance the police viewed the CCTV footage and one of the officers identified Brett Sharpley. When the police attended Brett Sharpleyâs home they found clothing consistent with that worn by him on the CCTV footage.
	
	
	When I heard the matter with respect to Brett Sharpley I was also informed that the police observed at Brett Sharpleyâs home the dog that was depicted on the CCTV footage at the time of the first break enter and steal.
	
	
	Police received information that this offender was involved in both offences. He was arrested for these matters on 5 February 2014. In his interview with police he made full and frank admissions with respect to his involvement in the offences. He cooperated fully with the police and told them the names of others involved. The police formed a view that he was remorseful for his actions.
	
	
	He pleaded guilty at Walgett Local Court on 29 April 2014 to the two counts of aggravated break enter and steal contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act. Each carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of five years. The two legislative guideposts indicate that offences of this type are normally considered as very serious criminal conduct requiring significant weight to be given to general and specific deterrence.
	
	
	For the reasons set out below I am satisfied that both offences committed by this offender are at the very lowest range of objective seriousness. I am not satisfied that the objective seriousness of the criminality that I have to deal with on this particular occasion is such as to satisfy me that no alternative penalty to imprisonment is appropriate.
	


OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS


	
	In assessing the objective seriousness of these offences I have had regard to the guideline judgement in R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327. Although the Court of Criminal Appeal declined to specify a sentencing range in that case it did consider the seriousness of the offence of break enter and steal and identified a number of factors that if present enhanced the observed objective seriousness of such offences. I am not satisfied that any of those factors exist in the present case so as to aggravate the objective seriousness of the offences. I will in due course deal with the fact the offender was on conditional liberty.
	
	
	These offences did not involve, in my view, a level of planning that would be sufficient to amount to a planned or organised criminal activity as prescribed by s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	With respect to the first offence of break enter and steal the evidence before me is that this offender, together with his cousin were walking past the shop at a time when they were intoxicated and decided impulsively to kick in the door, enter the shop and steal some soft drink. I repeat they made no attempt to conceal their identity. There is no evidence before me to suggest any level of planning beyond that inherent in the commission of the offence and I accept that it was impulsive conduct on this offenderâs part.
	
	
	The offender decided to return to the shop with his cousin and two others about one hour after the first offence. I accept that there was a degree of deliberation involved in making the decision to return for a second time to steal further soft drink. To this extent the second offence is slightly more objectively serious than the first, however, I am not satisfied that the second offence involved any level of planning or organisation sufficient to amount to an aggravating factor.
	
	
	On the second occasion the offender returned to the shop with his co-offenders and re-entered the storeroom to take more soft drink or Powerade. Once again there was no attempt to disguise himself or conceal his identity in anyway. There is nothing that points to any degree of sophistication or organisation with respect to the commission of the second offence. I am not satisfied that the offence was accompanied by any degree of vandalism, although there was some damage it was not significant.
	
	
	Although each offence related to an incursion on the same premises I must be careful not to treat this as an aggravating factor in circumstances where the Crown has charged two distinct offences for each entry into the premises. I am not of the view that in these circumstances the aggravating factor identified in Ponfield as repeat incursions operates to enhance the objective seriousness of the offences.
	
	
	The property stolen amounted to $18 worth of Lift soft drink and four boxes of Powerade valued at approximately $40 each box. In Hejazi v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 282 the Court held that financial gain is not necessarily an inherent element of an offence of break enter and steal citing as an example offences where the break enter and steal is affected to steal items of sentimental value. In the present case the value of the items stolen was very low. The offences involved young men stealing soft drink. There is no evidence that they intended to make a profit by selling the items. All the evidence points to an opportunistic theft to obtain soft drink to be consumed by the offenders. I am not satisfied that the motivation involved is such as to increase the moral culpability of this offender.
	
	
	Having considered the factors identified in the guideline judgment and the matters relating to s 21A I find that the first offence falls at the very bottom of the range of objective seriousness and the second offence is also at the bottom of the range, although slightly more objectively seriousness by virtue of a degree of deliberation that must have necessarily been involved in going back to the same shop on the second occasion.
	
	
	I have taken into account that both offences are aggravated by the fact that I have been informed, and it is accepted, that the offender was on conditional liberty, being on bail for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm that I have been informed was subsequently dismissed.
	


SUBJECTIVE CASE


	
	Earlier in these remarks I referred to the evidence of Mr Trindall on the last occasion the matter was before me. He has been employed as a field officer with the Aboriginal Legal Service since 2006. He is based in Walgett and has lived in that community for approximately 35 years. In 1998 he was employed with the New South Wales Police Service as a community liaison officer. In that capacity he witnesses first-hand the extent of the devastating effect of alcohol abuse and violence on members of his community.
	
	
	In 2004 he left the police force to manage property for the Aboriginal Land Council. He was also the chairperson of the Walgett Community Working Group and was able to confirm the finding of the Walgett Gamilaroi Working Community in 2005 identifying the following main issues facing the community:
	



	
	Racism and stereotyping of Aboriginal people.
	
	
	Inequality and lack of opportunity.
	
	
	Lack of resources and poor living conditions.
	
	
	Welfare mentality.
	
	
	Difficulty in accessing services.
	
	
	Low levels of literacy and numeracy throughout the community.
	
	
	Low student retention and achievement rates and high rates of truancy with the education system and unacceptably high levels of criminal activity and anti-social behaviour.
	



	
	There is little before me to suggest that these problems are showing any signs of abating. Mr Trindall gave evidence before me on the last occasion that he had long-standing and first-hand experience of the problems and difficulties faced by the community in Walgett, both in his personal capacity and his professional capacity. He identified severe social deprivation including domestic violence, violence generally, substance abuse, unemployment and significant levels of illiteracy, particularly amongst the young. He gave evidence on the last occasion that in the course of his employment as a field officer for the Aboriginal Legal Service he had come across a number of young Aboriginal people who were unable to spell their surnames.
	
	
	I repeat the remarks that I made when sentencing Brett Sharpley. This level of illiteracy in twenty first century Australia, a first world country, is a cause of considerable concern and provides further insight into the entranced disadvantages inherent in some Aboriginal communities.
	
	
	The level of substance abuse and violence coupled with the lack of opportunity gives rise to a sense of hopelessness and disempowerment amongst some members of the local community that cannot be ignored when assessing the moral culpability in the individualâs case. This offenderâs history of deprivation and exposure to alcohol abuse, violence and the lack of opportunity to thrive in such an environment is intrinsically connected to his current predicament.
	
	
	With specific reference to this offender, Mr Trindall was asked about whether he was aware of what his upbringing was like. He responded,
	


âWell I know that there was a lot more domestic violence in Brandonâs life than what there was in Brettâs. Brett had a fair bit of domestic violence, he had a fair bit of alcohol but in Brandonâs life, because as I go back to being with police, I donât know how many times Iâve called at their house in domestic relationship. Brandonâs father has been in four different relationships, I think heâs got children to four different women.â


	
	Mr Trindall was asked about the housing conditions and he responded,
	


âThe housing conditions, well Brandon was lucky because when Lisa and Brandonâs dad and that grew up they lived in tin shacks on Namoi and, but the housing conditions are not that bad. Theyâve got pretty fair houses over there, stilt, up on 10 feet stilts above the ground because the flood waters go through there and theyâre pretty modern houses.â


	
	He was asked about his experience in dealing with the Sharpley family, particularly on Brandonâs side, particularly when he was working with the New South Wales Police as to the care that was being shown to the children and he responded:
	


âItâs always been the same. When thereâs no grog around the care is 110%. Now Iâve lived at Namoi Village in the tin shacks when me and my wife first got married and Friday afternoon it was nothing to see 10, 15, 20 kids coming to our house and sleep on a dirt floor because of the alcohol that was around the rest of the community. And well there was no alcohol in our house so theyâd all come to our house and sleep. So itâs you know, it hasnât changed, itâs still the same today.â


	
	The offender gave evidence before me today. He is 19 years old and he confirmed that he grew up in Namoi Village, Walgett. His parents separated when he was either five or six years old. The separation was a result of domestic violence in the home which he witnessed. His mother moved to Bathurst and he did not see her again until he was about 13.
	
	
	He gave evidence that he got on well with his father except when his father was intoxicated. He told me during his evidence that when his father drank he did so to excess and did shameful things that made the offender ashamed.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence that he experienced learning difficulties at school and is barely literate. He left school halfway through year 10 and has had very little by way of employment since. His interests are football and fishing and he has a strong attachment to his siblings, intending to reside with his older brother, Damien, in Bathurst on his release. He gave evidence before me that he is motivated to do so in order to look after his younger brother who also resides there.
	
	
	On the day of the offence he commenced consuming rum in the afternoon and continued drinking all day. He was intoxicated at the time he committed the offences. With respect to the first offence he gave evidence that he and his cousin, Brett, were walking past the shop when they decided to break in. It was completely unplanned and at the time he thought it was a bit of fun. He confirmed that they decided to go back to the shop on the second occasion to get more drinks.
	
	
	He expressed remorse whilst giving evidence and acknowledged that the owners must have been devastated when they realised the shop had been broken into. He gave evidence before me that he wanted to do all he could to prevent going back into gaol, including going to TAFE, learning to read and write and obtaining work in the construction industry. I accept he is remorseful and has developed insight into his offending behaviour.
	
	
	The offender was on conditional liberty at the time of these offences. I repeat he was on bail for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm that was subsequently dismissed. He has a number of matters on his record, in the main being dealt with in the Childrenâs Court by way of probation or a bond.
	
	
	There is one matter of a like nature which appears to have been dealt with in the Goondiwindi Magistrateâs Court in 2012. However, I note that he was dealt with by way of no conviction being recorded, entering into a good behaviour recognisance and being ordered to pay restitution of some $59.
	
	
	On 28 September 2014, having been taken back into custody as a result of the bench warrant that was issued for his non-attendance in Coonamble, he was sentenced to one month imprisonment for an offence of malicious damage. On appeal the sentence was overturned and he was dealt with by way of dismissal pursuant to s 10A. The malicious damage involved the offender scratching his name and the Aboriginal flag onto a Perspex wall at a police station.
	
	
	Whilst he does have some matters on his record I am not of the view that he has a significant criminal history, such as to enliven the principles in Veen v The Queen (No. 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465.
	
	
	I accept that the offender is remorseful for his actions. That remorse is reflected in his plea of guilty at the first opportunity, the fact that he made full and frank admissions to the police and cooperated with them. Indeed, it is noted in the agreed statement of facts that the police formed the view that he was remorseful.
	


PROSPECTS OF REHABILITATION


	
	I am satisfied, having heard evidence from the offender, that his intentions are to remain out of trouble, educate himself and obtain employment. Unlike the case for his co-offender, I do not have any evidence of demonstrated rehabilitation. Brett Sharpley appeared before me having remained out of trouble and working for a period of some five months on a property. I do not have such evidence in the present case. Although I am unable to make any prediction about Brandonâs prospects of rehabilitation with any certainty I am of the view that he would have reasonable prospects if he accepts the supervision of Probation and Parole, if he attends TAFE, learns to read and write and obtains employment.
	
	
	The uncontested evidence before me is that the community from which the offender comes and in which he has been raised has experienced an appalling degree of deprivation over a long period of time. This offender is a product of that community and it is therefore necessary for me to assess his moral culpability, bearing in mind the particular socio-economic factors that exist in his community that have inevitably had an impact upon him. Failure to do so would be a failure to fulfil the principle of individualised justice.
	
	
	Some of these remarks I made when sentencing Brett Sharpley. It is important that I repeat them. To be clear, taking into account the background of severe deprivation, I do not act upon a kind of racial stereotyping which diminishes the dignity of individual offenders by consigning them by reason of their race and place of residence to a category of persons who are less capable than others of decent behaviour. Instead I am applying the fundamental principle of equal justice requiring as it does differential treatment of persons according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of the law.
	
	
	The evidence relating to the deprived background of the offender and the poor conditions that have plagued his community is necessary contextual evidence to properly access the moral culpability of the offender and the competing purposes of punishment as set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	In the decision of R v Millwood [2012] NSWCCA 2 Justice Simpson explained the relevance of evidence of an offenderâs background of deprivation. She said at [69]:
	


âI am not prepared to accept that an offender who has had the starting life the respondent had bears equal moral responsibility with one who has had what might be termed a normal or advantaged upbringing. Common sense and common humanity dictate that such a person will have fewer emotional resources to guide his or her behavioural decisions.. I should not be taken as implying that such a person bears no moral responsibility, but I consider that the DPPâs submission significantly underestimates the impact of a dysfunctional childhood. Indeed, it sits uneasily with the immediately preceding acknowledgement that his upbringing has been tragic and dysfunctional. That his background is relevant consideration affording some of a limited mitigation is entirely consistent with the approach taken by Justice Wood in Fernando, a decision which has repeatedly been followed in this Court. If that were not so there would be no purpose in sentencing courts receiving, as they invariably do, evidence concerning the personal background of offenders.â


	
	In Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37, the Court sided with approval the observations of Justice Simpson in Kennedy v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 260:
	


âAn Aboriginal offenderâs deprived background may mitigate the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate for the offence in the same way that the deprived background of a non-Aboriginal offender may mitigate the sentence.â


	
	In this respect Simpson J has correctly explained the significance of the statements in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 at [53]:
	


âProperly understood Fernando is a decision not about sentencing Aboriginals but about the recognition in sentencing decisions of social disadvantage that frequently, no matter what the ethnicity of the offender precedes the commission of an offence.â


	
	The propositions stated in Fernando are largely directed to the significance of the circumstances that the offender was intoxicated at the time of the offence. As Justice Wood stated, drunkenness does not usually operate by way of excuse or to mitigate an offenderâs conduct. However, his Honour recognised that there are Aboriginal communities in which alcohol abuse and alcohol related violence go hand in hand. His Honour considered that where an offenderâs abuse of alcohol is a reflection of the environment in which he or she was raised it should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. To do so, he said is to acknowledge:
	


âthe endemic presence of alcohol in Aboriginal communities and the grave social difficulties faced by those communities where poor self-image, absence of education and work opportunity and other demoralising factors have placed heavy stresses on them.â


	
	In Bugmy the Court noted that,
	


âOf course not all Aboriginal offenders come from backgrounds characterised by abuse of alcohol and alcohol fuelled violence. However Justice Wood was right to recognise the problems are endemic in some Aboriginal communities and the reasons which tend to perpetuate them. The circumstances in which an offender has been raised in a community surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may mitigate the sentence because his or her moral culpability is likely to be less than the culpability of an offender whose formative years have not been marred in that way.â


	
	In any case where it is sought to rely on an offenderâs background of deprivation in mitigation of sentence it is necessary to point to the material tending to establish that background. In the present case that background material has been placed before me and it is not disputed by the Crown.
	
	
	Prolonged and widespread social disadvantage has produced a community so demoralised and alienated that many within it, like this offender, have succumbed to alcohol abuse, criminal misconduct and a sense of hopelessness. That background of disadvantage and of deprivation may impact upon the individual so deeply and so broadly that it serves to shed light on matters such as, for example, the offenderâs recidivism.
	
	
	In Bugmy the plurality held at paras [43] and [44]:
	


âThe experience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person throughout life. Amongst other things a background of that kind may compromise the personâs capacity to mature and learn from experience. It is a feature of the personâs makeup and remains relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence, notwithstanding that the offender has a long history of offending. Because of the effects of profound childhood deprivation do not diminish with the passage of time and repeated offending it is right to speak of giving full weight to an offenderâs deprived background in every sentencing decision. However, this is not to suggest that an offenderâs deprived background has the same migratory relevance for all purposes of punishment. Giving weight to the conflicting purposes of punishment is what makes the exercise of the discretion so difficult.â


	
	The Court also stated that,
	


âThe offenderâs childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offenderâs recourse to violence when frustratedâ

and again repeated that it is relevant to the offenderâs moral culpability.


	
	This offender has grown up with alcohol abuse being a normal part of his home life and also a devastating and entrenched problem in his peer group and his community. He committed these offences whilst affected by alcohol. The offenderâs self-induced intoxication is not normally to be taken into account as a mitigating factor. However, the evidence before me demonstrates that he has experienced a deprived upbringing, including exposure to significant alcohol abuse and domestic violence resulting in a dysfunctional family environment and a significant degree of disadvantage. I am satisfied that his background of deprivation operates to reduce his moral culpability and thereby mitigate the sentence.
	
	
	In addition to this offenderâs background of deprivation I have also had regard to his relative youth and immaturity at the time the offences were committed. His immaturity is perhaps best illustrated by his response when asked about the reasons for committing the offence. That it was, âJust for the fun of it.â
	
	
	The principles relevant to sentencing juvenile offenders were summarised in KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51. McClellan Chief Justice at Common Law, as he then was, observed at [23]:
	


âThe law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and or psychological maturity of a young person to contribute to their breach of the law. Accordingly allowance will be made for an offenderâs youth and not just their biological age. Although the extent to which leniency is extended to an offender by reason of youth maybe less where an offender is close to 18 years of age or has engaged in adult behaviour.â


	
	The remarks of Justice Hodgson in the decision of BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159 are apposite:
	


âWhile I agree the weight to be given to considerations relevant to youth diminish the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity. It does not follow that the age of maturity is 18. In my understanding emotional maturity and impulse control develop progressively during adolescence and early adulthood and may not fully be developed until the early to mid-twenties.â


	
	I have also had regard to the decision of Locke v R [2010] NSWCCA 296 where the Court considered the issue of youth. Considerations of general deterrence, while they may be significant, do not justify disregarding or discounting an offenderâs youth and immaturity.
	
	
	Although the offender had reached the age of 18, he is relatively speaking a young man whose emotional maturity and impulse control was not fully developed in my view. I am satisfied that in this case his relative youth is a factor that I should take into account in giving greater emphasis to rehabilitation at the expense of specific and general deterrence. That is not to say that general and specific deterrence are of no significance in the present case. They must be given some weight in the sentence to be imposed. However, I am not of the view that deterrence must be given determinative weight in assessing the appropriate sentences in this case. Punishment and denunciation are also relevant, but the impact of these considerations on my sentencing discretion is moderated in light of my finding that in this case there is a greater need to promote and give greater prominence to the rehabilitation of this young and emotionally immature offender.
	
	
	His rehabilitation is also relevant to the protection of the community. In R v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed a Crown appeal against the suspension of sentence for a serious armed robbery. During the course of judgment the Court sided with approval remarks made in a decision of Yardley and Betts (1979) 22 SASR 108.
	


âThe protection of the community is also contributed to by the successful rehabilitation of offenders. This aspect of sentencing should never be lost sight of and it assumes particular importance in the case of first offenders and others who have not developed settled criminal habits. If a sentence had the effect of turning an offender towards a criminal way of life the protection of the community is to that extent impaired. If the sentence induces or assists an offender to avoid offending in the future the protection of the community is to that extent enhanced. To say that the criminal law exists for the protection of the community is not to say that severity is to be regarded as a sentencing norm.â

PARITY


	
	I find that the role of this offender in the commission of both offences is virtually identical to the involvement of his adult co-offender, Brett Sharply. Their background of deprivation is very similar, although I note the evidence of Mr Trindall that the circumstances of disadvantage were even more severe in the case of this offender.
	
	
	There is some difference in the criminal history. Brett Sharply did not have a matter of a like nature on his record, whereas this offender was dealt with in the Goondiwindi Local Court for a like matter, although as noted earlier in these remarks he was dealt with by way of no conviction. Both were on conditional liberty at the time of the commission of the offences. There is no relevant distinction between this offender and Brett Sharpley and their involvement in the offences. I am also of the view that their subjective circumstances are largely similar. The objectives of consistency and equality before the law require the treatment of like cases alike. I find that the principle of parity applies in the present case.
	


PRESENTENCE CUSTODY


	
	The offender was in custody from 5 February 2014 to 18 March 2014, a period of one month and 13 days. During this period he was also in custody with respect to an offence of assault occasioning bodily harm that was subsequently dismissed. He was released on bail on 18 March 2014. He was arrested on 27 September 2014 on a bench warrant that was issued as a result of his failure to appear before me at Coonamble District Court. He has remained in custody since that date. I have been informed that during this later period he served a sentence of one month for malicious damage, which was subsequently overturned on appeal. This is the matter for which he was dealt with in the District Court by way of a s 10A dismissal.
	
	
	In total he has spent three months and 14 days in custody. Whilst it is true that periods at this time were also referable to other offences, one of those offences was subsequently dismissed and the other, in my view, should never have attracted a period of imprisonment. I will therefore take in account a period of three months in custody when determining the appropriate penalty in this case. I have turned my mind to s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which mandates imprisonment as a last resort. I am not satisfied that in the circumstances of this case no penalty other than a term of imprisonment is appropriate. I make that finding for the following reasons:
	



	
	The objective seriousness of both offences is at the low range for the reasons set out above.
	
	
	The offenderâs background of profound social deprivation operates to reduce his moral culpability and to moderate the weight that is to be given to general deterrence.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and cooperated fully with the police.
	
	
	In light of the offenderâs youth and relative immaturity I accept that rehabilitation plays a more prominent role than the other purposes of punishment.
	



	
	With respect to this last consideration it is necessary to set out in brief the remarks of Mahoney ACJ in R v Lattouf (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 12 December 1996, unrep). His Honour stated:
	


âIt is my opinion necessary that the law allows the sentencing judge discretion to determine the sentence appropriate for a particular offence, for the particular offender and for the circumstances of the particular case. General principles must, of their nature, be adjusted to the individual case if justice is to be achieved. Paramount amongst these is the achievement in the individual case. To see the sentencing processes involving no more than a stern punishment for each offender is not merely simplistic it damages the public interest. The sentencing process which is seen by the public merely as draconian and not just will lose the support of those whom it is designed to protect. If the sentencing process does not achieve justice it should be put aside. If justice is not individual it is nothing. But in addition a sentencing process must be capable of discriminating between cases. There is, as I have said, a public interest in punishment. But if the desire to punish results in a person who would otherwise not become a confirmed criminal becoming such that sentencing process is inconsistent with the public interest. It is to be recognised that imprisonment may convert a person who will not be a persistent criminal into one who is.â


	
	Having taken into account his plea of guilty and having given regard to the objective and subjective matters as outlined above I am satisfied that this offender can be dealt with by way other than terms of imprisonment.
	
	
	Accordingly, Mr Sharpley if you can stand up please? With respect to the first count of aggravated break enter and steal pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the offender is sentenced to a good behaviour bond for a period of two years commencing today, 28 November 2014 and subject to the following conditions:
	



	
	To be of good behaviour;
	
	
	To appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time in respect of this bond;
	
	
	To accept the supervision of Community Corrections and to report to the Bathurst office of Community Corrections within seven days.
	



	
	With respect to the second count of aggravated break enter and steal pursuant to s 86 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I order the offender to perform a total of 100 hours community service work. The offender is to report to the Bathurst office of the Community Corrections within seven days to enable the administration of the order to commence.

		20 January 2015",2014-11-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765420,Lee v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2014] NSWDC 221,"Judgment

1Following my rulings in relation to the imputations pleaded as arising from two publications dated 20 April 2014 (Lee v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2014] NSWDC 172), the plaintiff filed an amended statement of claim on 20 October 2014. The defendants have sought rulings concerning certain of the newly pleaded imputations. These are reasons for the rulings I have made today. 

2The challenged imputations fall into the following categories:

(a)Imputations 3(c)(ii), 3(f)(ii), 3(g)(i), 5(c)(ii), 5(f)(ii) and 5(g)(i) plead, as an alternative to the plaintiff being reasonably suspected by the police, that the plaintiff was reasonably suspected by Ms Olding, the journalist who wrote the article and the second defendant in these proceedings;

(b)Imputation 6(h): ""the plaintiff became a fugitive because he knew that he was guilty of murder""; and

(c)Imputation 6(i): ""The plaintiff is being investigated by police for fraud.

Imputations 3(c)(ii), 3(f)(ii), 3(g)(i), 5(c)(ii), 5(f)(ii) and 5(g)(i)

3Imputations that a person is reasonably suspected by the police (or by some other investigatory organisation, such as the ICAC: Greig v WIN Television NSW Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 632) are capable of being defamatory because the status and official role of that entity is enough in itself for the ordinary reasonable reader to conclude that the person is either guilty of the conduct alleged, or has at least conducted themselves in such a way as to warrant the suspicion: Alex v Gridneff [2013] NSWSC 2025 at [17].

4Does being suspected of such conduct by a journalist have the same force as being suspected by an investigatory body such as the police? Mr Rasmussen submitted that Ms Olding (the journalist who wrote the matter complained of) had effectively ""written a crime novel"". In doing so, she had put herself forward as such an expert on the topic that being suspected of these crimes by her had the same defamatory meaning as being suspected by the police.

5I first note the general rule that, where an imputation of reasonable suspicion of this kind was pleaded, the entity holding that suspicion (for example, the police), needs to be identified: Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Commission [1983] 2 NSWLR 669 at 671B: ""It is necessary to identify the accuser"". This person should be an investigating entity because ""an accusation from certain quarters may be a compliment"" (Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Commission at 671B per Hutley JA): see Purcell v Cruising Yacht Club of Australia [2003] NSWSC 245.

6In Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Alex [2014] NSWCA 273, the NSW Court of Appeal struck out (on other grounds) an imputation in the following form:

""There are reasonable grounds to suspect that he is the person who arranged for the visit to Mr Steve Mitrovic's premises of a group of men carrying a firearm during which visit Mr Mitrovic was shot dead.""

7McColl JA did not refer to Sergi, or to any requirement that the accuser was specified, presumably because the matter complained of consisted of statements by the Assistant Police Commissioner. This decision should not be regarded as giving an imprimatur to the pleading of being suspected of criminal conduct by ordinary members of the community, as opposed to entities charged with the task of investigating crime (see the cases discussed in Zeccola v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 227 at [42] - [44]). 

8I raised with the parties whether being suspected by family members of a murder victim might be sufficient. In Rivkin v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of NSW, 17 July 1998), Levine J was concerned by the ""authority"" requirement being limited to investigatory bodies: 

""I must say that I was troubled by the submission of Mr Nicholas on the ""authority"" issue. To the extent, of course, that there is reference to the ""authority"" he is undoubtedly correct. But why, one might ask, does the holder of the suspicion have to be a person in authority before the imputation can be held to be capable of being defamatory? If a person is suspected of some misconduct by his/her ""peers"" or one of them, might that not be sufficient? I agree with the submission of Mr Hughes to require the presence, as-it-were, of the ""authority"", as the holder of the suspicion is too restrictive. Each case might depend upon its own circumstances but I am of the view that if the publication refers to the conduct attributed to the plaintiff and the suspicion about it held by someone else and that there is something about the relationship between that person vis-a-vis the plaintiff, that gives some cogency or weight to the suspicion held by that person that might well be sufficient on a capacity argument.

What I have just enunciated could apply to the father of the deceased vis-a-vis the plaintiff the employer of the deceased's boyfriend (in the context of criminal connection with her death), or to the deceased herself vis-a-vis the plaintiff in relation to his (sexual) conduct with her boyfriend. If an imputation is pleaded to the effect that either ""suspected"" something in relation to the plaintiff, it is capable of being defamatory.""


9Levine J's obiter views are acknowledged to be an addition to the accepted rule that the reasonable suspicion must be held by an ""authority"", and his Honour certainly did not suggest that a journalist writing the report of a murder investigation would have the necessary ""relationship"" for the holding of a suspicion to convey a defamatory meaning. 

10Additionally, I do not accept Mr Rasmussen's submission that the author of the matters complained of was holding herself out as a specialist crime writer, expressing views and opinions of an expert nature or resulting from her own investigation of the crime. This is a straightforward news story about a cold crime. 

11Imputations 3(c)(ii), 3(f)(ii), 3(g)(i), 5(c)(ii), 5(f)(ii) and 5(g)(i) are accordingly struck out.

Imputation (h)

12As is set out in my earlier judgment, the matters complained of convey imputations of suspicion and not of guilt. Conformably with those reasons, I strike out this imputation, but with leave to replead.

Imputation (i)

13This imputation is assert to arise from paragraph 16 of the matter complained of, which states:

""Among the persons of interest identified by Detective Rogerson was Albert Lee, an old school mate of Peter Choi's from Trinity Grammar School, who was being investigated for fraud and had asked to borrow money from Peter's wife.""

14The next paragraph goes on to refer to an investigation in 2009, which gives further information as to the time at which the plaintiff was being investigated for fraud. However, the imputation in question is pleaded not in the past, but as an event occurring in the present.

15Mr Rasmussen submits that the use of the word ""being"" means that the conduct is in the present and not in the past. If the writer had intended to refer to conduct in the past, she should have used the construction ""has been"". 

16Mrs Barnett referred to Alex v Gridneff at [15], McCallum J discusses the pleading difficulties where conduct in the past is asserted to be conduct in the present, referring to Jackson v John Fairfax & Sons [1981] 1 NSWLR 36.

17However, that problem does not arise here. ""Has been"" and ""was being"" are both forms of the past tense. Only ""is being"", which is present progressive tense, connotes conduct in the present. Additionally, it is clear from the context that one of the persons identified in 2009 ""was"" the plaintiff who was being investigated (i.e. in 2009) for fraud and who ""had"" (i.e. at a time prior) attempted to borrow money from the victim's daughter-in-law.

18This imputation is not capable of arising while framed in the present tense, and is struck out with leave to replead. 

Costs

19All of the defendants' challenges to form and capacity have succeeded, and the plaintiff should pay the defendants' costs.

Orders

(1)Imputations 3(c)(ii), 3(f)(ii), 3(g)(i), 5(c)(ii), 5(f)(ii) and 5(g)(i) are struck out.

6A graph annexed to this judgment illustrates the structure of the overall sentence.

7In sentencing for the Manufacture offence the judge took into account at the applicant's request his guilt in respect of a number of offences listed on a Form 1 document (Div 3 of Pt 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)). There was one offence of possessing ammunition; three of not keeping a firearm safely; three of possessing unregistered firearms; one of possessing an unauthorised firearm; two of possessing a precursor; and one of possessing a prohibited weapon.

8The grounds of appeal contend that the sentence for the supply offence in Count 3 is manifestly excessive; the sentence for the prohibited firearm offence in Count 5 is manifestly excessive; and the degree of accumulation of the sentence for Count 5 was too great. I have concluded that there is merit in the first ground; that there is no merit in the other grounds; and that no lesser overall sentence is warranted.

Facts

9Police executing a search warrant at the applicant's home at Smithfield on 1 March 2012 found a clandestine laboratory set up in the kitchen and a bedroom. Both parts of it were in the heating and distillation process and were described in the statement of facts as being ""in a highly dangerous state"". A forensic chemist was of the opinion that the process underway was capable of producing 6 grams of methylamphetamine (Seq 2 - Manufacture methylamphetamine).

10Methylamphetamine crystals were found in a refrigerator in the kitchen. The amount was 7.57 grams and the purity was 77.5 per cent (Seq 15 - Supply methylamphetamine).

11A sawn-off double barrel Beretta shotgun was found on a bedside table in the master bedroom (Seq 20 - Possess unauthorised prohibited firearm). Beside it were two unused shotgun cartridges suitable for use in the Beretta (Form 1). 

12A .303 calibre bolt action rifle was found in the bedroom in which part of the laboratory was set up (""the Austrian rifle"")(Seq 5 - Possess unauthorised firearm). Another .303 calibre bolt action rifle with a jammed cartridge in the barrel was found in the same room (""the Lithgow rifle"") (Form 1). 

13In excess of 60 rounds of ammunition of varying calibre were found in the lounge room. Some were in a magazine. In excess of 300 rounds of a variety of types of ammunition were found in locations within the house that were not specified in the statement of facts.

14Two machete swords and a spear gun were found in the lounge room. A set of nunchakus and a telescopic rifle scope were found in a bedroom. 

15Various precursor chemicals were found including piperonal, the subject of the offence for which the applicant was sentenced (Seq 18), nitroethane and sodium borohydride (Form 1). 

Personal circumstances of the applicant

16The applicant was aged 22 at the time of the offences. He was single and lived with his father in the house where the drug manufacturing was occurring. He had a criminal record but with only one matter of any real seriousness and it was dealt with in 2008 in the Children's Court.

17He suffered a number of injuries, including a head injury, in a motor vehicle accident when he was aged 5. Thereafter he experienced behaviour changes characterised by impulsivity and interpersonal aggressiveness. He was diagnosed with a brain injury with poor impulse control demonstrating behaviour consistent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. There was no adverse impact upon his intellectual or cognitive functioning. He was taking medication from the age of 6 until he stopped of his own volition somewhere between the ages of 16 and 19. He attended anger management courses when he was 15 which he told Dr Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, were helpful.

18He started using substances at the age of 13 after his parents separated. He initially used cannabis, later alcohol, and then methylamphetamine. He consulted a psychiatrist when he was 19 or 20 and was prescribed medication but the judge observed that his continued substance abuse complicated the treatment. The applicant's mother gave evidence that he responded better when taking the medication than when not taking it. The psychiatrist considered that he should continue with medication but he was not compliant. By the time of the offences he was smoking about 3.5 grams of methylamphetamine and consuming half a bottle of scotch per day.

19The judge noted that the applicant's behavioural problems had caused him problems at school, in the workplace, and in interacting with others. He left school at the age of 15 for that reason. His work history had been in labouring endeavours with his longest period of employment being for about six months. He was unable to sustain a job because his irritable nature lead to conflicts.

20The applicant gave evidence that in 2010 he stopped working and seeing the psychiatrist. He was unmedicated for a year before he started manufacturing methylamphetamine. He also purchased the drug from dealers. The applicant had a gambling problem as well. He said that up to the age of 21 his drug abuse and gambling was financed by his wages, by money borrowed from his mother, and by periodic withdrawals from an income earning trust account that had been set up for him following an award of damages he received in relation to the motor vehicle accident when he was aged 5. 

21The learned judge reviewed at some length the evidence given by the applicant explaining his commission of the offences. In short, he said that he turned to making methylamphetamine as an alternative to getting a prescription for medication from his psychiatrist. He said he found it difficult to travel into the city to see him. Making the drug was cheaper than buying it from dealers. But he agreed in cross-examination that it would have been cheaper to get a prescription from a local doctor rather than making a prohibited drug.

22The applicant claimed that he never profited from manufacturing methylamphetamine. He said the 7.57 grams found in the refrigerator was not intended for supply, but he was prepared to admit guilt nonetheless. He conceded in cross-examination that he had been successfully making 3 to 6 grams of the drug every couple of weeks for 6 months prior to his arrest. He was using 5 to 6 grams every 3 days.

23Senior counsel for the applicant had submitted that there was a clear connection between the commission of the offences and the consequences of the head injury as explained by Dr Allnutt: executive dysfunction contributing to an increased propensity to impulsive behaviour as well as a disregard for the consequence of his actions. The judge was referred to authorities concerning the sentencing of persons with a significant mental disorder or intellectual handicap.

24The judge noted that the applicant had not claimed that his propensity to impulsive behaviour and disregard for the consequences of his actions played any part in his possession of the firearms. He did, however, find that the applicant's culpability for the drug and firearm offences was reduced and ""the full measure of general and personal deterrence can be reduced to a certain extent due to his intellectual dysfunction"". He added, ""the offender's actions could hardly be described as impulsive but involved planning and organisation over a considerable period of time. I consider specific and general deterrence remain important considerations.""

25The judge accepted a submission that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were good, provided that he engaged with the recommendations of Dr Allnutt that he consult a psychiatrist and start antidepressant medication; consult with a psychologist for strategies to deal with his impulsivity and frustrations with his cognitive limitations; and engage with ongoing drug and alcohol rehabilitation. 

26A finding was also made that the applicant was remorseful.

27A reduction of 25 per cent was allowed for the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty.

28Special circumstances were found to justify a reduction of the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period. The judge referred to the applicant's need for assistance after release for his drug and alcohol issues; his behavioural and emotional issues; and the fact that there was to be an accumulation of sentences.

The judge's assessment of the seriousness of the offences

29In relation to the manufacturing offence, the judge observed that the quantity involved was 6 grams and the indictable quantity range is from 5 to 250 grams. He took into account that the applicant sourced the recipe, bought the chemicals and apparatus, set up the laboratories in two rooms of the house and was the ""cook"". His Honour rejected the applicant's claim that he was only manufacturing the drug for his own use. He concluded that it was ""for both sale and his own use"". Nevertheless, he concluded: ""the seriousness of this offence falls towards the bottom of the range for this type of offence"". 

30The judge referred to the 11 matters on the Form 1; saying that many were serious offences and required an appreciable enhancement of the penalty to be imposed for the primary (manufacture) offence.

31His Honour found that there was a degree of overlap between the manufacture and supply offences. One feature of this was the applicant's role as the supplier of the drug at its source. The quantity was comparatively small but it was of a high purity and could be cut down many times to increase the number of grams available for sale. He concluded, ""a good quantity of it was for sale"". The supply offence was found to be ""above the middle of the range of seriousness of offences of this type"". 

32The judge rejected the claims made by the applicant about the precursor offences. He found that he ""knew perfectly well what piperonal was for and it was his intention to use this precursor for the future production of ecstasy"". Given the applicant's addiction was to methylamphetamine, it followed that his motive was financial gain. He noted the evidence that 743 grams of pure piperonal could lead to 354 grams of ecstasy being manufactured. The precursor offences on the Form 1 were relevant to that process of manufacture. The judge said ""this indicates the size of the reward he was expecting to reap and the large quantity of ecstasy that was potentially going to be made available for [end] users"". He concluded: ""the seriousness of the offence fell well above the middle of the range for offences of this type"". 

33His Honour found the possession of an unauthorised prohibited firearm (the shortened Beretta shotgun) was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. He noted that weapons that are more dangerous were included in the definition of ""prohibited firearms"" in the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) but being shortened meant that this one could be more easily concealed. He noted that the legislative intention was to deter and punish the possession of firearms whether in the hands of honest citizens or the criminally minded. He found that the applicant was ""amongst the ranks of the criminally minded through his drug manufacture and intended supply activities"". Whilst the firearm was not loaded, there were two cartridges found sitting beside it. Finally, the fact that the applicant possessed the shotgun in the context of being involved in the manufacture and intended supply of drugs was relevant to the seriousness of the offence. He did, however, accept the applicant's claim that he had never fired it at anyone.

34The possession of the .303 calibre bolt action rifle (the Austrian rifle) found where the laboratory was set up in a bedroom was found to fall ""slightly below the middle of the range"". The judge took into account that it was in the possession of a person who was ""criminally minded through his drug manufacture and intended supply activities"". There was a link between its location and the manufacture occurring. It was not loaded and it did not appear that there was ammunition suitable for use with it.

Ground 1 - The sentence for count 3 (the supply prohibited drug charge) was manifestly excessive

35Mr Stratton SC submitted for the applicant that the quantity of the drug was at the bottom of the indictable range and so, all else being equal, the objective seriousness of the offence should have been assessed as well towards the bottom of the range and therefore the sentence should have been towards the lower end of the range. However, the starting point before reduction for the applicant's plea of guilty was almost half of the maximum penalty.

36Mr Stratton pointed to the fact that the police did not find any of the commonly encountered indicia of a commercial drug dealing business such as cash, debtors' ledgers or packaging and there was no evidence of telephone calls to arrange sales.

37Judicial Commission sentencing statistics showed that 53 per cent of offenders received a full-time custodial sentence. Of 484 offenders who did, their sentences ranged from 6 months to 10 years with a median of 2 years 6 months. Only 20, or about 4 per cent, received a head sentence of 5 years or more. A review of non-parole periods that had been imposed was to a similar effect.

38An attempt was made to identify comparable cases but counsel was only able to cite two: R v Hughes [2005] NSWCCA 235 and Tran v R [2013] NSWCCA 322. They were both prisoner appeals against the asserted severity of sentence that failed and the objective and personal circumstances differed quite significantly. They do not assist.

39The Crown reminded the Court that to make good a ground such as this an appellant must establish that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 and Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 254 CLR 259. 

40It was submitted that the quantity of the drug was but one factor relevant to the assessment of the seriousness of the offence. The role of the applicant as the source of the drug and the high level of purity were relevant as well. 

41The Crown also reminded the Court of the care with which one must approach the use of statistics and so-called comparable cases: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 244 CLR 520; Skocic v R [2014] NSWCCA 225. In relation to the statistics, it was suggested that offenders charged in respect of a small quantity of the drug would more likely be street dealers and not a principal dealing with a drug of high purity.

42Giving full weight to the fact that the applicant was the source of the drug, and that it was of a high purity, the fact remains that within the scope of an offence that can involve quantities ranging from 5 grams to 250 grams, this offence was not above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The finding by the judge to that effect was not one that was open to him. The sentence imposed was consistent with that erroneous finding. I have come to the view that the sentence for the supply offence is manifestly excessive. 

Ground 2 - The sentence imposed for count 5 (the count of possession of a prohibited firearm) was manifestly excessive

Ground 3 - The degree of accumulation of the sentence imposed for count 5 (the count of possess prohibited firearm) was too great

43These grounds were dealt with together in the submissions and I will do likewise.

44Ground 3 may be despatched immediately. The sentence for this offence was specified to commence later than all of the other sentences. However, it was entirely subsumed within the sentence for the supply offence. The applicant received no additional punishment for this offence.

45Mr Stratton submitted that there should have been a finding that this offence was towards the lower end of the range of objective gravity. This was because there was no evidence it was loaded; the applicant swore that he had never fired it and that it was not kept loaded; and there was no evidence that it had been used in the commission of any offence.

46In my respectful view, the findings made by the sentencing judge were well open to him. The offence concerned a double barrelled shotgun that had been shortened to render it easily concealable. It was possessed by someone who was characterised as ""criminally mind"" (and there is no criticism of that). It was found in the context of the applicant's drug manufacture and supply activity. And there was ammunition found with it. 

47With a finding of objective seriousness in the middle of the range, and taking into account such matters that were favourable to the applicant (good prospects of rehabilitation, remorse, plea of guilty, less emphasis to some degree upon general and personal deterrence), a sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years, when assessed in the light of the legislative guideposts of a maximum penalty of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 3 years, is not unreasonable or unjust. 

Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)

48Having found that the sentence for the Supply offence is manifestly excessive, it becomes a matter for the Court to consider in the exercise of its discretion what sentence ought be imposed: AB v The Queen [1999] HCA 46; 198 CLR 111 at [130] (Hayne J). (Although Hayne J was in dissent; the paragraph cited deals with the appellate response to error having been established, either patent or latent, and was referred to with approval in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37 at [35] (French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ)).

49In Kentwell v The Queen it was recognised (at [43]) that in the exercise of the appellate court's discretion when it considers resentencing after patent error has been established, one of the outcomes may be that whilst a lesser sentence is thought to be warranted for one or more offences, it may also be thought that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences. In such circumstance it would not necessarily follow that the court would resentence. I see no reason in logic or principle why the same cannot apply in a case where latent error is identified and sentences for only one or some offences in a multi-offence sentencing exercise are found to be manifestly excessive. 

50In my view, a sentence for the Supply offence of no more than 4 years (that is, a starting point of about 5 years 6 months as opposed to 6 years 8 months) is appropriate. But the sentence for that offence should not entirely subsume all of the other sentences that were imposed. There should have been some partial accumulation on the sentence for the Possess prohibited unauthorised (Beretta) firearm offence, at least. In my assessment, nothing less than the overall term for all of the offences of 5 years is warranted and should have been passed.

Orders

51I propose the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.

2765430,Simms v R [2014] NSWCCA 286,"Judgment

1PRICE J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2McCALLUM J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

3R A HULME J: Dane Frederick Simms (the applicant) was sentenced in the District Court at Newcastle on 12 February 2014 by her Honour Judge Syme after having pleaded guilty to an offence of intentionally destroying property by fire. 

4The offence is contrary to s 195(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years.

5Her Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 7 months with effect from 12 February 2014.

6The applicant seeks leave to appeal on the three grounds: that the judge erred in taking subjective matters into account only in her assessment of the non-parole period; that her Honour made an error of fact; and that the sentence is manifestly excessive.

Facts

7The applicant's de facto partner, Ms Taylah Latimer, leased a duplex home unit in Raymond Terrace. The adjoining unit was occupied by a woman and her five year old sister.

8The applicant had been released on parole on 20 April 2013. Thereafter he lived ""on and off"" at the unit with his partner and their seven month old son. He otherwise slept in a car.

9In the early evening of 1 August 2013 the applicant was at home at the unit whilst Ms Latimer and their son were elsewhere. He was to later tell a psychiatrist that they had argued. Ms Latimer's grandmother called in and he told her that he was packing his belongings and was leaving. There were items of clothing packed into large garbage bags. It was observed that there were some vases and other items smashed on the floor of the unit.

10Mrs Latimer left and in the ensuing hours there was a series of text messages exchanged with the applicant. He was described as being ""obviously upset and emotional"". Later in the evening he drove to a service station and filled up a jerry can with petrol. A little later, Mrs Latimer drove past the unit and saw the applicant in his car parked out the front. She approached and asked what was happening. He pushed the door open and said, ""I'll show you what's happening"". The applicant grabbed the jerry can and entered the house through the garage. She called out to him, ""no Dane don't do this"". 

11Mrs Latimer moved her car a safe distance up the road and then called triple 0. While she was walking back to the house talking to the triple 0 operator she saw a glow from the house. The applicant walked out of the house, got into his car and drove away at speed. The house was soon well alight. Mrs Latimer yelled out to passers-by to alert the neighbours and they managed to exit their unit safely.

12Emergency services attended shortly afterwards and eventually brought the fire under control. However it had completely destroyed the unit and had caused some heat, smoke and water damage to the adjoining unit. 

13The applicant was arrested the following day. When he was informed that he was under arrest for breach of parole as well as starting the fire he said, ""it was an accident"". 

Personal circumstances of the applicant

14The applicant was born in 1987 and so he was aged 26 at the time of the offence. He grew up on an Aboriginal mission at Karuah with his mother, stepfather and three younger half siblings. He thought that his stepfather was his real father until the age of 12. He is reported to have said that his mother was good and caring when he was growing up. He got along well with his stepfather. He denied any history of violence, drug or alcohol problems, or sexual abuse in the family. His mother was involved in the use and supply of drugs, although the period in which this was the case is not clear.

15His parents separated when he was aged 12. He did not cope well. He missed his stepfather and continued to harbour anger and rejection. He had consumed cannabis and alcohol from the age of 9 or 10 but after the upheaval at home he started to associate with negative peers, run away from home and get into trouble with the law. 

16He continued drinking alcohol until he was aged 13 to 15. I take it he continued using cannabis. He commenced to use heroin at the age of 24. When he was on parole in 2013 he was using ""ice"" (methylamphetamine) on a daily basis. He was also taking buprenorphine. 

17The applicant has acquired a significant criminal history. He first appeared in the Children's Court at the age of 13 for an assault. He was first the subject of a custodial order at the age of 14. The offences on his record include break enter and steal; taking and driving cars without the owner's consent; damaging property; assault occasioning actual bodily harm; assaulting and resisting police; dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm; escape; drug possession; firing a spear gun in a manner likely to injure; aggravated break enter and commit serious indictable offence; accessory after robbery in company; stealing a motor vehicle; and kidnapping. There are multiple entries for many of those offences. There are also many entries for driving offences such as driving in a manner dangerous and driving whilst disqualified. 

18The applicant was transferred from a juvenile detention facility at the age of 17 to a correctional centre following a riot. That was in October 2004. Since that time he had only been at liberty in the community on two occasions; once for eight months in 2011-2012 and again for a period of three and a half months from 20 April 2013 until he was arrested for the present offence on 2 August 2013. He was on parole in 2011 but that was revoked in 2012. Parole was also revoked on 2 August 2013 and he was ordered to serve the balance of parole until 4 September 2015. 

19The applicant told a drug and alcohol worker at Cessnock gaol in November 2013 that he found it hard to cope in the community and that he had no real support and just could not cope. He returned to using methylamphetamine, which made matters worse. He said that he regarded himself as ""institutionalised"" and considered that he should be at a rehabilitation centre where he could learn to cope with living in the community. 

20Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, did not see any indications of serious mental illness such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia but made diagnoses of Substance Use Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder. He noted a history of the applicant being prescribed antidepressant and a low dose antipsychotic medication.

21Dr Furst wrote:

""Mr Simms has a generally unfavourable prognosis, being institutionalised, antisocial, impulsive, coping poorly under stress and being dependent on drugs. The best prospects of reducing his future risk of recidivism would be through abstinence from drugs of abuse, psychological counselling, such as the [Violent Offenders' Therapeutic Program], and engagement in appropriate drug and alcohol counselling and/or rehabilitation.""

22Dr Furst also recommended education, vocational training, and a staged reintegration into the community through a Community Offenders Support Program.

Remarks on sentence

23Syme DCJ made a number of findings relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence. She noted that the extent of the damage to property was significant in that the target unit was destroyed and the adjoining unit was partially damaged. There was also the potential risk to the lives of others. There was a small degree of planning in that the applicant removed his personal effects prior to the commission of the offence. The offence had a domestic violence flavour to it in that his motive was in part to lash out at his domestic partner. Her Honour found, ""this is an offence clearly directed at causing harm or distress to Ms Latimer by way of significantly damaging the property which she was leasing."" Her Honour found that domestic violence being the motive was an aggravating circumstance. Another matter was that the offence was committed without regard for public safety; her Honour finding that the next door neighbours were put in ""real and immediate danger"".

24Her Honour noted the applicant's extensive criminal record but did not find that it was a circumstance of aggravation. It did however deprive him of leniency but was also significant in terms of future parole consideration. 

25Her Honour noted that the offence was committed whilst the applicant was on parole. She found that any prospects of rehabilitation ""must be guarded"" only. She noted that remorse had been expressed to report writers but there was no evidence of insight other than a superficial understanding of a need to address his substance abuse issues and learn the skills necessary to function in the community. She found that the applicant had not accepted responsibility for his actions, nor acknowledged the damage, injury and loss. 

26Her Honour then turned to a question of whether there were special circumstances warranting a reduction in the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period (s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 NSW). She referred to a number of features of the applicant's subjective case, including his ""dysfunctional"" background. She said, ""he has a dysfunctional background which has informed and led to his criminal behaviour since he was a young man"". Reference was made to Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571.

27Her Honour indicated that it would be appropriate for the applicant to be directed to undertake a residential rehabilitation program when he came to be released on parole. She said his ""level of institutionalisation is of concern""; ""he clearly has difficulty living outside of the structures of a supervised environment"".

28Her Honour considered how to exercise her discretion in relation to the commencement date of the sentence given that the applicant was serving the balance of parole from August 2013 until September 2015. She resolved to commence the sentence from the date of imposition and no complaint is now raised in that respect.

Ground 1: Her Honour erred in taking the applicant's deprived and dysfunctional background, improvements in his behaviour whilst in custody and youth into account only when considering special circumstances

29This ground relates to a collection of references to aspects of the applicant's subjective case which appeared after her Honour turned in her judgment to a consideration of special circumstances. The submission was made that such matters were relevant to the total term of the sentence as well and in that respect her Honour had erred in her confinement of consideration of those issues.

30I am not persuaded that this ground can be made good. Her Honour referred to a number of aspects of the applicant's subjective case at earlier parts of her remarks on sentence. It has to be noted that judgment was delivered ex tempore soon after the completion of evidence and submissions. In those circumstances, some allowance must be made for the structure of the judgment. 

31The real issue in this case is the third ground. I would not uphold this one.

Ground 2: It was not open for her Honour to find that the applicant had been subject to lengthy supervision in the community

32Again in the course of discussing whether there were special circumstances, her Honour said: 

""However, he has, in the past, I note, been subject to substantial findings of special circumstances and been subject to lengthy supervision as a result of those findings of special circumstances. None of that supervision has produced the desired result, in fact Mr Simms' offending has accelerated over that period of time"".

33It was submitted that her Honour was mistaken; in truth the applicant had only been at liberty under supervised parole for two periods as an adult, eight months in 2011-2012 and three and a half months in 2013.

34I do not believe there is any merit in this. I consider the above passage to be the product of some inadvertent infelicity of expression which is not uncommon in an ex tempore sentencing judgment. I believe what her Honour intended to convey was that the applicant had been the subject of lengthy parole periods in the past but had not availed himself of the opportunities. 

35Her Honour in fact found special circumstances and thereby enlarged the period of the sentence in which the applicant would be eligible for further supervised parole. It would have been unlikely that she would have done so if she had been under the mistaken belief asserted under this ground.

Ground 3: The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive

36The submissions of counsel for the applicant took three approaches in arguing that the sentence of 6 years imprisonment was manifestly excessive. First, there was reference to sentencing statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales which indicated that the sentence imposed was at the upper end of the range of sentences which had been imposed in other cases of arson. Secondly, a table of comparative cases was provided. Finally, reference was made to the starting point for the sentence, before reduction on account of the plea of guilty, being 8 years against a maximum penalty of 10 years. 

37I do not believe it is necessary to have regard to statistics or so called comparable cases for the determination of this ground. The sentencing judge appears to have accepted that this was a serious example of the offence of intentionally damaging property by fire. She identified a number of factors that pointed to this conclusion but refrained from expressing a definitive finding as to the level of objective seriousness. 

38An assessment of sentence before reduction on account of the plea of guilty at 8 years against the maximum of 10 years would have been appropriate if the case was considered to be in, or close to, the worst category. However, if her Honour was of that view, it would be expected that she would have said so.

39Absent any finding being made by the judge, in my view it would have been appropriate for a finding to be made that this offence fell above the middle of the range of objective seriousness but not at or near the top of the range. In my view the sentence of 8 years is manifestly excessive and this court should move to resentence.

Considerations on resentencing

40I accept each of the findings made by the sentencing judge as to the objective seriousness of the offence and her identification of aggravating and mitigating features. 

41A significant feature of this case is that the offence occurred less than four months after the applicant had been released on parole for earlier serious offences. He has a substantial criminal history and is institutionalised. Such a history has to be viewed in the context of the circumstances of his upbringing, including his introduction to alcohol and drugs at a very young age and the dysfunction that attended his family life from the beginning of his teenage years.

42Two affidavits were read in the event that the Court came to consider resentencing. An affidavit by the applicant included that he was currently taking medication to assist him dealing with depression. He had completed a suboxone (buprenorphine) program. He claims to have remained drug free since about the middle of this year. He said that being off drugs had cleared his mind and he was facing his issues ""head on"". He was acquiring new skills and considered that he now knew what it would take to break his cycle of bad behaviour and offending. He is currently enrolled in the Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program, which is a 12 month intensive program which he attends two to three times per week. He is otherwise making use of his time by being enrolled in a small business management course and otherwise engaging in employment within the gaol. He maintains contact with his partner, Ms Latimer, who visits him when she is able. They plan to reunite when he is released and he looks forward to being a father to his young son.

43An affidavit by Ms Latimer includes that she too has been working on overcoming her personal difficulties. She had completed a period of residential rehabilitation to overcome her drug abuse and mental health issues. She has not used drugs for almost a year. She had seen what she describes as a dramatic improvement in the applicant. She describes him as thinking much clearer and no longer anxious about everything. She claims that they both realise that when he is released he will need to utilise as much of the support that is made available to him as possible. 

44In my view, after an allowance in the order of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea of guilty there should be a sentence of imprisonment for 5 years. I would maintain the finding of the sentencing judge of special circumstances but I would not impose a non-parole period in the same proportion to the total term as her Honour did. I consider that a period of 3 years and 3 months is appropriate as the minimum period of actual incarceration having regard to all of the circumstances of the case.

Orders

45I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted and appeal allowed.

(2)Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court on 12 February 2014.

(3)Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months commencing on 12 February 2014 and expiring on 11 May 2017 with a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year 9 months concluding on 11 February 2019.

		28 November 2014",2014-11-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765439,Youssef v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 285,"Judgment
1SIMPSON J:  I agree with McCallum J.
2PRICE J:  I have had the benefit of reading the draft judgment of McCallum J.  I agree for the reasons expressed by her Honour that Ground 1 of the appeal should be upheld and the remaining grounds dismissed.  However, I do not agree with the sentence proposed by her Honour on re-sentence. 
3As I am aware that Simpson J agrees with the orders proposed by McCallum J, my reasons for disagreement will be brief. 
4The total quantity of 29.86 grams of cocaine was almost six times the indictable quantity specified in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The sentencing Judge was entitled to find that this amount of cocaine had substantial value, was entirely inconsistent with the appellant's lifestyle and was, at least in part, to be supplied to others for a substantial benefit. This was in my opinion, a significant offence of supply and there was no alternative to a term of full time imprisonment.  General deterrence remains an important consideration when sentencing offenders for the dissemination of prohibited drugs to others. 
5On re-sentence, I would propose an undiscounted starting point of two years six months imprisonment.  After the utilitarian discount of 25 per cent for the pleas of guilty is applied and special circumstances found, the appellant would be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 1 year 11 months consisting of a non-parole period of 1 year and a balance of term of 11 months. 
6McCALLUM J:  Milad Youssef seeks leave to appeal against the sentence passed on him in the District Court after he pleaded guilty to a single offence of possessing a prohibited drug for supply contrary to s 25(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  The charge was based on the deeming provision in s 29 of the Act, since the amount in question was not less than the trafficable quantity.  The amount was 29.86 grams of cocaine, whereas the trafficable quantity of cocaine is 3 grams.  The offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years.  There is no standard non-parole period prescribed.  
7The applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and was allowed a discount of 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea.  He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year commencing on 1 May 2014 and expiring on 30 April 2015 and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months expiring on 31 October 2016.  In accordance with s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the judge made a parole order directing that the applicant be released on parole on 30 April 2015 on conditions including a requirement to accept treatment and counselling in respect of the consumption of alcohol and drugs.
8The applicant was sentenced on the strength of a statement of agreed facts.  He came to the attention of police after going through a red light, having driven around what I assume was an unmarked police car stationary at the light.  Police asked him if he was a user of any illegal drugs.  He said ""I use cocaine"".
9Police searched the car and found three small clear plastic bags containing drugs hidden under a plastic cover underneath the handbrake.  A further search of the car revealed ""a large white rock"" in a clear plastic bag in a compartment in the ceiling of the car.  The total weight was 29.86 grams of cocaine.  The purity of the larger amount was analysed to be 54%.  The purity of the three smaller bags was not tested.
10The applicant was taken to a police station but fell ill whilst in custody and so was taken to Canterbury Hospital.  It was determined that he should be released from custody at that point and he was issued with a court attendance notice.
11The applicant was accordingly not interviewed by police at the time of his arrest.  However, the material before the Court at the proceedings on sentence included a pre-sentence report prepared by the Department of Corrective Services.  The applicant told the author of that report that he was using cocaine regularly at the time of the offence and that he had purchased a quantity of the drug for himself and his friends to be consumed at his birthday party the following evening.  He gave the same account to a clinical psychologist who was retained to prepare a psychological assessment for the purpose of the proceedings on sentence.  
12The applicant did not give evidence at the proceedings on sentence.
13The applicant was just 25 years of age at the time of the offence.  The pre-sentence report recorded that he had led ""a relatively straightforward life"" until the time of a serious industrial accident in June 2012.  He was the middle child of three.  He came from ""a good family"" and enjoyed good relationships with both parents.  He completed the HSC, leaving with excellent school references.  He went straight to university to obtain a Bachelor of Construction Management and a Bachelor of Business and Commerce but left before completing those degrees and began working in the construction industry.  In June 2012 his hand was crushed in a work accident and almost had to be amputated.  Following that accident, he was unable to work and became depressed.  It was during that period that he began using cocaine. 
14The pre-sentence report assessed him as suitable for a community service order.  However, notwithstanding that assessment, the report said ""he is not eligible to participate in programmes provided by this service"".  The basis for the ineligibility was not stated in the report but this Court was told at the hearing of the appeal that it appears to have related to his physical condition following the workplace injury.
15The psychologist's report expanded upon the impact of the work injury on the applicant.  The applicant told the psychologist that he was terrified his hand would be amputated but that, following a nine and a half hour operation, the surgeons had managed ""to find and reattach every nerve and artery"".  After the operation he was prescribed a variety of medications for pain relief and to treat depression but he was reluctant to continue taking the antidepressant medication and turned instead to cocaine.  The applicant told the psychologist that, following his arrest, he had recommenced taking antidepressant medication and stopped using cocaine.  
16The psychologist expressed the opinion that, during the applicant's period of rehabilitation following his accident, he developed major depression which was triggered by the loss of his job, chronic pain and loss of functioning in his hand.  The psychologist thought that the applicant had developed ""psychological dependence on alcohol and cocaine"" during that period.  The report concluded:
""Mr Youssef expressed remorse for the offence and relief that his arrest by police had shocked him into abstinence from cocaine and moderation of alcohol intake.  His supportive family, stable history before his accident and commitment to return to work and a stable lifestyle reduce his risk of re-offending. He faces the challenges of finding suitable light duties employment and possibly another hand operation in August 2014.  Given these factors, Mr Youssef would be psychologically sensitive to a mild sanction from the Court."" 
17The applicant had a significant history of traffic offences but no prior criminal offences.  The judge accepted that he was entitled to be treated as a first offender.
18The first ground of appeal is:
""The sentencing judge erred in determining that the applicant was substantially involved in supply.""
19As already noted, the applicant told the author of the pre-sentence report and the psychologist that he had purchased the cocaine for the purpose of his own birthday party which was scheduled for the following evening (a Saturday night).  It had in fact been his birthday during the week a few days earlier.  The judge rejected that explanation.  His Honour said:
""As to the offender's explanation as to why he was in possession of a total of almost 30 grams of cocaine being for him to supply to various persons that he expected to attend his birthday party, I note that there is no support from any source as to the fact of any birthday party, and as to the explanation that the 30 grams was in his possession for the purposes of supplying to other persons at that party, I do not accept that explanation on the balance of probabilities.  The quantity was a significant quantity.  It was distributed between some four bags secreted in two different locations within the vehicle.  There is no explanation, in the circumstances, why there were three small bags in the vicinity of the handbrake, or why there was a substantial portion hidden in the roof of the car.""
20The judge also noted that 30 grams of cocaine has a substantial value, which was entirely inconsistent with the applicant's lifestyle, since he was unemployed (either on compensation payments or a Newstart allowance) and living with his parents.
21The judge accepted that the applicant was a cocaine user and that part of the drugs found were for his own use but concluded that otherwise, ""that which was not for his own use would have been provided to others for a financial benefit"".  His Honour noted that, even if the explanation of buying the drug for provision to friends at a party were accepted (which it was not), that would still indicate an intention to supply a significant portion of the drug to others, albeit with no expectation of any financial benefit (counsel for the applicant had invited the judge to infer that the cost of the drugs for the party was to be shared amongst all party-goers who shared the drug).
22In reaching the conclusion that the drugs were possessed for provision to others for a financial benefit, the judge acknowledged that there were no other indicia of supply in the car (such as a collection of small resealable plastic bags, scales or any significant sum of money).  However, his Honour was persuaded that the location of three small bags and one large bag in separate locations was ""an indication that the offender was intending to supply to others for benefit at least some portion that which he then possessed"".  
23On the strength of that finding, the judge concluded that the applicant fell to be characterised as a person ""substantially involved in supply"" and so had to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  His Honour said:
""There is a long line of authority, commencing with the case of R v Peter Michael Clark (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Court of Criminal Appeal, 15 March 1990, unreported) which indicates that where an individual offender can be seen to have been substantially involved in supply, they must receive a full time custodial sentence unless there are exceptional circumstances.""  
24His Honour acknowledged that the applicant had been found only on the one occasion with a total quantity of cocaine rather than supplying to a number of individuals or over a period of time but nonetheless concluded that the amount of which the applicant was in possession indicated substantial involvement in supply.  
25The judge said:
""The authorities indicate in those circumstances that a period of full time custody must be imposed unless there are exceptional circumstances.  While I have indicated the matters that have been accepted in the offender's behaviour, I do not accept that they are exceptional circumstances.""
26The decision in Clark was a Crown appeal against the leniency of a suspended sentence.  The offender had pleaded guilty to 2 charges of supplying amphetamine.  The first was an offence of deemed supply contrary to s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act relating to 13.4 grams of amphetamine found in his possession.  The second was based on his possession of a large amount of cash which was found to be the proceeds of other sales.  The offender admitted to police that he ""sold amphetamine to friends if they sought it"".  He said that he sold small plastic bags for $50 each, about three or four a week, and had been doing so for about a month.  He had a record of dishonesty and had previously but not recently served terms of imprisonment.
27The sentencing judge had acknowledged that a custodial sentence would normally be appropriate but deferred passing sentence upon the offender's entering into a bond.  By majority, the Court of Criminal Appeal allowed a Crown appeal against the lenience of that sentence.  Hunt J said:
""This Court has, on occasions too numerous to mention, emphasised that sentences involving a substantial general deterrence are to be imposed on drug traffickers, and it has indicated that only in exceptional circumstances will a non-custodial order be appropriate.""
28In the later decision of R v Bardo (wrongly title ""Ibardo""), also a Crown appeal, Hunt CJ at CL said that the point made in Clark was that custodial sentences are normally required, whether or not a profit has been obtained, for ""trafficking alone in any substantial degree"".  His Honour specifically clarified that the word ""trafficking"" in that context ""clearly carries with it the connotation of supply on more than one occasion"" (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Court of Criminal Appeal, 14 July 1992, unreported).
29I accept that the sentencing judge in the present case was not required to accept the applicant's account, which was not given on oath or affirmation, that the drugs were acquired for the purpose of the party the following evening.  However, I do not think it was open to his Honour to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was ""substantially involved in supply"" or that he was a trafficker in the sense understood in Clark.
30The principle stated in Clark (described in the headnote as ""the policy laid down by the Court of Criminal Appeal) states the existence of a requirement, in the circumstances delineated by the Court, to establish exceptional circumstances in order to obtain a non-custodial sentence (per Hunt J, Sharpe J agreeing).  Similarly in Bardo, the language of the judgment suggests that, where a person is involved in trafficking in any substantial degree, the court is ""bound"" to find exceptional circumstances before considering other than a custodial sentence (per Hunt CJ at CL, Sheller JA and Badgery-Parker J agreeing).
31Enderby J dissented in Clark, reiterating the importance of the sentencing judge's discretion.  His Honour endorsed the remarks of King CJ in R v Osenkowski (1982) 30 SASR 212; 5 A Crim R 394 that ""prosecution appeals should not be allowed to circumscribe unduly the sentencing discretion of judges"". 
32The proposition approved by the majority in Clark, asserting as it does the existence of a constraint devised by the Court of Criminal Appeal on the exercise of the sentencing discretion of judges, may warrant reconsideration in light of the remarks of the High Court (in a different context) in Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45 at [36] to [38].  However, the correctness of the decision in Clark was not raised in the present appeal and in any event need not be determined.
33In my respectful opinion, the sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant was ""substantially involved in supply"" so as to attract the putative requirement of the principle stated in Clark that the judge was bound to find exceptional circumstances before he could consider non-custodial options.  Ground 1 is made out.
34Ground 2 is that the sentencing judge erred in failing to make a finding that the applicant was unlikely to reoffend.  Whilst it would certainly have been open to his Honour to make that finding, I do not accept that the failure to do so can be said to have entailed error.  This ground must be rejected.
35Ground 3 is that the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant's subjective features.  This ground must also fail, in my view.  As noted on behalf of the Crown, a ground that alleges the giving of insufficient weight to one or other of the many factors to be taken into account on sentence implicitly acknowledges that some weight was given to that issue.  In that circumstance, it is difficult to establish error.
36Ground 4 is that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh and severe.  But for the establishment of specific error in ground 1, although the sentence was stern, I would not have been persuaded that it was manifestly excessive.
37However, specific error has been established in ground 1.  The High Court recently explained the role of this Court in that circumstance, which is ""to exercise the discretion afresh: Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37 at [38].  The High Court said:
""A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence.""   
38In my view, this was a case in which it was well open to consider non-custodial options.  It is the applicant's first criminal offence.  He is a relatively young man with strong family support.  He has a history of good education and regular employment which faltered only after a serious, painful and debilitating industrial accident.  Unfortunately, the consequences of that very accident appear to mean that he is ""ineligible"", although suitable, for community service.  But for that constraint, I would have referred him for assessment for an Intensive Correction Order before proceeding to sentence: see s 69 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  However, it seems likely that the same difficulty would arise. 
39In Kentwell, the High Court stated (at [43]), ""after having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law.""
40Since the sentence hearing, the applicant has served almost 7 months of the custodial sentence imposed at first instance.  Having regard to the apparent likelihood that he would not be eligible for the community service component of an ICO even if assessed suitable for such an order, I consider that the appropriate sentence is a short term of imprisonment which will enable him to be released on parole almost immediately subject to the conditions specified by the sentencing judge.   
41The orders I propose are:
(1)That leave to appeal be granted.
(2)That the appeal be allowed.
(3)That the sentence passed at first instance be quashed and in substitution therefor that the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 months commencing on 1 May 2014 and expiring on 30 November 2014 and a balance of term of 5 months expiring on 30 April 2015.  
(4)In accordance with s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, an order directing that the applicant be released on parole on 30 November 2014, subject to the supervision of the community corrections service, to obey all reasonable directions in respect of treatment and counselling in respect of the consumption of alcohol and prohibited drugs, such supervision to include random urinalysis in respect of prohibited drugs.

2765442,Corda v R [2014] NSWCCA 281,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Schmidt J.

2R A HULME J: I agree with Schmidt J.

3SCHMIDT J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal a sentence imposed by Blackmore DCJ in May 2013, after he admitted to paying two young co-offenders to set fire to his neighbours' home. He provided them with the petrol which they used to light a fire inside the house, which they broke into. The resulting blaze totally destroyed the house and almost all of its contents. 

4The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to an offence of being an accessory before the fact to aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and to an unrelated drug offence under s 23(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). 

5He received a 25% discount for his plea and does not appeal the 6 month fixed term sentence imposed for the second offence, which commenced on 27 June 2012, when he went into custody. The applicant was sentenced to a total term of 5 years, 6 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years, 6 months, commencing on 27 December 2012 for the accessory offence. The maximum penalty for that offence was 20 years imprisonment, with a standard non parole-period of 5 years. 

6The applicant advanced two grounds of appeal in relation to the sentence imposed for his s 112(2) offence:
""1. The sentencing judge erred in that he failed to give proper consideration to the principle of parity, insofar as he failed to adequately consider the penalty imposed on the principal offender Blake O'Connor in passing sentence on the appellant.

2. The sentencing judge erred in finding that the offence was ""well and truly above the middle range of objective seriousness"".


Ground 2 - the seriousness of the offence

7It is convenient to commence with this ground, which must be considered in light of the evidence and findings on sentence. 

The evidence

8The agreed facts tendered on sentence were that the applicant had been in an ongoing dispute with his neighbour, Mr Mark Taylor, who lived on a rural property near Bellingen. Their ongoing dispute involved violence and property damage. It resulted in a number of court matters. Both the applicant and Mr Taylor had enforceable personal violence orders (AVOs) made against the other in the Bellingen Local Court. 

9On 29 December 2011, Mr Taylor left his property and went to dinner in Bellingen. On his return at about 10.30pm he found his home engulfed in flames. The back door, which he had left secured, was open. He called for assistance on 000 and was able to salvage two computers, but the house and the rest of its contents were destroyed. He suffered minor burns to his hands. On later examination traces of petrol were found in soil nearby and it was confirmed that the back door had been opened.

10The insurance estimate for the premises was $383,282.91 and Mr Taylor estimated the contents lost to have a value of $85,031.

11A gold coloured Holden utility was seen driving nearby at high speed, when emergency services attended the fire. It was identified as belonging to Blake O'Connor, then aged 18 years, who was driving with an unidentified passenger. On 9 January 2012 he was in custody for unrelated matters. Text messages found on his phone implicated Blake O'Conner and a juvenile, DB, then aged 17 years, in the fire and suggested that the applicant had paid them to light the fire.

12Police investigations, including by lawful interception of mobile and home phones, revealed that Blake O'Connor and DB had knowledge of particular details of the fire.

13DB was later arrested and admitted his involvement in the fire, together with Blake O'Connor. He revealed that the applicant had offered them $1,000 to break in and set the house alight; that he and Blake O'Connor had accepted his offer; and that the applicant had supplied them with petrol and information. They had then gone to the house, forced the back door to gain entry and entered. He also armed himself with a knife. Blake O'Connor had ignited the petrol inside with a cigarette lighter. The applicant paid them $500 each, some weeks later. 

14Conversations between DB and the applicant, during which they discussed the offence, were later lawfully recorded. Blake O'Connor was arrested on 22 May 2012, when he made admissions about the offence. 

15Blake O'Connor and DB both pleaded guilty to aggravated break enter and destroy property by fire under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act and Blake O'Connor undertook to give evidence against the applicant. On sentence a control order was imposed on DB, which was suspended. Blake O'Connor was sentenced to an intensive correction order for a period of 1 year and 11 months, after receiving a 35% discount for his plea and assistance.

16The applicant gave evidence on his sentencing and also called character evidence. His evidence was that he had been under a lot of stress for years prior to the offence. He had been drinking and smoking about five or six joints of cannabis in an afternoon. He was then cultivating 123 cannabis plants, he said, for his own use. He apologised to his victim, explaining his remorse for the loss of his home and possessions. He said that they had been friends before the breakdown of their relationship, as the result of a dispute over a right of way. He described how the dispute had begun and later escalated, with the result that his consumption of alcohol and drugs also escalated and he had experienced a lot of problems with his family. He said that on the day of the offence his daughter had received a call from DB, one of her friends. He went to assist DB and Blake O'Connor, whose car had broken down. It was then that the offence was discussed. There had been no prior discussion between them about burning down the victim's house.

The cases advanced below

17The applicant's case on sentencing was that the offence was the result of a chance meeting, when he went to assist his co-offenders with a flat tyre. It was then that their mutual dislike of the victim had been discussed and he had suggested lighting the fire. It was he who gave his co-offenders petrol, which he had in his ute for his chainsaw. It was submitted to be relevant on sentence that the offence was unplanned and that the co-offenders had not been overborne or coerced by the applicant. Reference was made to what the co-accused had said in ERISPs and recordings of intercepted conversations between them, part of which, it was submitted, was concocted, in order to suggest that the planning of the offence had been more elaborate than it in fact was. It was also submitted that these recordings showed that the co-accused had no remorse for their offences, which were of significant criminality, assessed to have fallen above the mid-range of seriousness of such offences on their sentencing.

18Both aggravating and mitigating matters were also addressed. In the result it was submitted that questions of parity in sentencing arose to be considered in the applicant's case, as did questions of totality in respect of the drug charge. As to parity it was submitted to be relevant that the assistance which Blake O'Connor had given had been minimal, despite having received a combined discount of 35%. 

19The Crown's case was that the applicant's offence was objectively serious and aggravated by the fact that the victim was protected by an AVO order at the time and by the fact that the applicant was then subject to a bond for earlier breach of that AVO. 

20As to parity, it was submitted to be relevant that the offences would not have occurred without the applicant's involvement. In the result, given the applicant's age, almost 30 years older than the co-offenders and his relationship with them, it was apparent that his criminality was higher than theirs. It was also submitted that he had taken the opportunity to instigate the offence for which he later paid them, at a time when they were intoxicated and he was able to take advantage of bad feelings between them and the victim, by supplying them with petrol and advice that the victim was away from home. In the result the offence would be found to be above the mid-range of seriousness of such offending.

The sentencing decision

21In sentencing the applicant Blackmore DCJ took the view that the offence was a serious one, involving some degree of planning and an attempt by the applicant to distance himself from the offence, by approaching the co-offenders, at a time when the applicant knew he was not entitled to have any contact with the victim, given the AVO which bound him. He supplied the co-offenders with the means of carrying out the offence and offered them payment. While he believed that no-one would be at home when the fire was lit, he could not control that factor. 

22His Honour noted that Blake O'Connor's offence had been found by McLoughlin DCJ to fall above the mid-range of such offences. He said that the seriousness of such offences could be gauged by the applicable maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period, as well as by the maximum penalty applying to the offence which the co-offenders broke into the house to commit, destroy property by fire, which itself carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment (see s 195 of the Crimes Act). His Honour agreed with the remarks of McLoughlin DCJ when sentencing Blake O'Connor:
""Both crimes of this nature are serious and I could not envisage a more premeditated or organised offence. Whilst the idea, encouragement, organisation and the supply of the fuel came from the co-offender Corda, it was this offender and the juvenile co-offender who committed the crime. Corda is many years older and I accept that this offence was one carried out at his direction and for him to reek his own vengeance"".

23Blackmore DCJ concluded that the applicant's offence was ""an offence well and truly above the middle range of objective seriousness'', the applicant having tried to distance himself from the victim and offence by approaching the co-offenders, knowing he was not entitled to have any contact with the victim, supplying them with the means to carry out the offence and promising them payment. His Honour found that its commission in breach of the AVO was an aggravating factor, as was the fact that at the time the applicant was subject to a s 9 bond, imposed for an earlier breach of the AVO. 

24His Honour also considered that the offence involved the commission of a very serious indictable offence and that the damage caused was itself an aggravating factor, as was the fact that it was an offence committed on the home and personal property of a neighbour, for no purpose other than revenge. 

25The only possible mitigating factor identified was the offender's perception of harassment and/or provocation, but his Honour rejected that as being a mitigating factor, given the aggravating act that the offence was carried out in breach of the AVO. His Honour also noted that relationship tension such as this and general enmity leading up to an offence do not amount to provocation (see Shaw v R [2008] NSWCCA 58 at [26]).

26His Honour took the view that behaviour by which a member of the public acts outside the law to mete out what he sees as personal vindication had to be strongly deterred, making general deterrence an important part of the sentence imposed on the applicant. He found that was a factor which distinguished the applicant from his co-offenders. He also noted that arson was a difficult crime to detect and that paying someone to commit a crime had long been recognised as placing a crime into a more serious category. This, too, meant that the applicant was not in the same category as the co-offenders. His Honour also had regard to the applicant's long prior record, which disentitled him to any leniency.

27His Honour took into consideration the applicant's personal circumstances, he being a family man, married with two children, in gainful employment. He noted the positive testimonials in evidence and that others had felt under pressure from the victim's behaviour. His Honour accepted that the behaviour explained the offending, but did not mitigate its seriousness. He also took into account evidence of the applicant's alcohol and cannabis use, which he found was likely to have influenced the applicant's decision to commit the offence, which he accepted, was somewhat opportunistic. 

28His Honour also took account of the evidence as to the impact of the offence on the offender and his family and his past good behaviour, contributing to the community in various ways. His Honour accepted the applicant's remorse and that he had accepted responsibility for his offence. He found that he was unlikely to commit such an offence again and that he required drug and alcohol counselling, to reduce that possibility.

29His Honour took the view that the co-offenders had each committed offences falling above the middle range of seriousness and that the sentences imposed on the co-offenders were explained by their respective roles and individual circumstances. He found that they had carried out the offence at the applicant's direction, one being a juvenile and the other a very young man, some months older. His Honour found that the applicant was considerably more responsible than the co-offenders and that their offences had only been committed because the applicant wanted it to happen.

30His Honour took the view that had the matter gone to trial a sentence of 8 years imprisonment would have been imposed on the applicant for the two offences for which he was being sentenced. With a 25% discount for his early plea and a finding of special circumstances, the applicant received a total sentence of 5 years, 6 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years, 6 months. 

The finding that the offence was ""well and truly above the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" was correct.

31In my view this finding was correct.

32By his plea the applicant accepted that he was an accessory to the aggravated form of the s 112 offence. An accessory is not necessarily less culpable than his or her co-offenders, and may be more so, especially if the accessory instigates, or plans the offence or pays his co-offenders to commit it (see R v Norman; R v Oliveri [2007] NSWSC 142 at [30]). That was properly found to be the case here.

33Section 346 of the Crimes Act applied to the applicant. It provides:
""346 Accessories before the fact-how tried and punished
Every accessory before the fact to a serious indictable offence may be indicted, convicted, and sentenced, either before or after the trial of the principal offender, or together with the principal offender, or indicted, convicted, and sentenced, as a principal in the offence, and shall be liable in either case to the same punishment to which the person would have been liable had the person been the principal offender, whether the principal offender has been tried or not, or is amenable to justice or not.""

34Blackmore DCJ observed that the maximum penalty for the indictable offence which the co-offenders committed at the house, destroy property by fire, was 10 years. Under s 195(2) of the Crimes Act, a person who commits that offence in company is liable to a maximum penalty of 11 years. That was a relevant consideration, because, as Johnson J observed in Porter v R [2008] NSWCCA 145 at [81]:
""The crime of arson may be committed in a variety of circumstances. It is an extremely serious and dangerous crime: R v James (1981) 27 SASR 348 at 351; R v Davies at 358 [44]. The motive of the offender is relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence: Newton v State of Western Australia [2006] WASCA 247 at [13]. Courts have observed that arson is very easy to commit, usually with destructive (if not tragic) consequences: R v Catts (1996) 85 A Crim R 171 at 176; Newton v State of Western Australia at [12]. It has been said that arson is often a difficult crime to detect: R v Davies at 370 [97]. Consideration of factors such as these has led courts to emphasise the importance of general deterrence in arson cases."" 


35Circumstances of aggravation are defined in s 105 to include being armed with an offensive weapon or instrument and being in company. At the applicant's instigation, DB and Blake O'Connor broke into the house. DB armed himself with a knife, and he and Blake O'Connor lit the fire which the applicant paid them to light, using the petrol which the applicant had supplied them. The maximum penalty for that offence was, accordingly, 20 years' imprisonment. The standard non-parole period for such a mid-range offence was 5 years. 

36The maximum penalty and statutory non-parole periods were two statutory guideposts which his Honour had to consider in this sentencing exercise (see Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120). Both had to be considered as part of the synthesising exercise which his Honour had to undertake in arriving at the applicant's sentence (see Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357).

37It was submitted for the applicant on appeal, that the fact that the fire had been lit inside the house, rather than outside, added little to the criminality of this offence, because at best it could be argued that by entering the house to light the fire, it made it more likely that the entire house would be damaged, but that this was largely speculative and indeed, debateable and that being armed added little criminality to the offence. These were not submissions advanced on sentencing and if they had been, would have been rejected.

38An analogy was also sought to be drawn with a larceny committed after a break and enter, which, it was submitted, involved an intrusion into the sanctity of a person's home or workplace which was substantial and justified a significantly increased maximum penalty. In the case of this offence, it was submitted, while it could be said that the offence of destroy property by fire may be more serious than a larceny, particularly where the house was completely destroyed, it did not follow that the fact that the house was broken into first, or that the offence was committed in company, substantially increased the offender's criminality. This submission failed to pay necessary attention both to the Parliament's intention in enacting s 112 and to the applicant's actual role in this offending.

39The submissions overlook the seriousness with which the Parliament views offences under s 112, for which it has imposed a maximum penalty of 14 years and in circumstances of aggravation as defined, a maximum penalty of 20 years. Those penalties represent the legislature's assessment of the seriousness of such offences and for this reason, provide a yardstick to which proper attention must be paid in the sentencing exercise (see Elias v The Queen [2013] HCA 31; 48 CLR 483 at [27]). 

40The gravamen of a s 112 offence is breaking and entering a dwelling-house or other building and committing a serious indictable offence there, in this case, destruction of property by fire. If there was no breaking and entering, there would be no s 112 offence committed and the offence would be one of arson, which would attract a significantly lower maximum penalty.

41That the Parliament considers a s 112 offence to be a more serious offence than an arson offence under s 195, is reflected in the maximum penalties imposed for the two offences: 14 years and 10 years respectively. In the case of both offences, a higher penalty is imposed in specified circumstances of aggravation, including committing the offence in company. That increases the maximum penalties respectively to 20 years and 11 years. 

42 In the case of s 112 offences, other circumstances of aggravation also increase the maximum penalty, including being armed with a knife, as DB here was.

43This statutory scheme thus reflects, contrary to the applicant's case, that the circumstances of aggravation specified in s 105 give rise to the commission of a more serious offence, which attracts a higher maximum penalty. That must properly be taken into account on sentencing.

44Further, where more than one offender is involved in an offence, on sentencing the particular part which the offender played in the commission of the offence must be properly taken into account (see Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 per Gibbs CJ at 609). That is what Blackmore DCJ here did.

45The objective seriousness of the applicant's offence had to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of his offending, without reference to matters personal to the offender (see Muldrock at [27]). Other relevant aggravating and mitigating factors also, however, had to be taken into account, as a part of the synthesising exercise which his Honour had to undertake, in arriving at the sentence imposed, as s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) requires. 

46Thus his Honour considered what had been agreed that the applicant had done by recruiting and paying his two co-offenders; the fact that the two co-offenders were in company when they committed the offence; what they did in order to break into the house through the back door, which had been closed and secured with a strap, which was to burn through the strap with a lighter in order to gain entry; that DB then armed himself with a knife when they entered and looked around the premises; and that Blake O'Connor then lit the petrol the applicant had provided with a cigarette lighter, before they fled when a ferocious fire immediately broke out. His Honour also took into account the consequences of the offence.

47The nature and extent of the aggravating factors revealed by the evidence also had to be taken into account, particularly when the applicant's moral culpability for his offending was being considered. In oral submissions it was submitted that his Honour erred when he observed:

""Judge McLoughlin found that the offence committed by O'Connor: ""Above the middle of any scale constructed for such offences"". To my mind this is an offence well and truly above the middle range of objective seriousness. It was committed in breach of an AVO which is an aggravating factor on sentence. I note that the offender was also subject to a s 9 bond which it had itself been imposed due to another breach of the AVO. That is another aggravating factor. This offence also involved the commission of a very serious indictable offence.""

48It is strictly correct that the commission of the offence in breach of an AVO, while the applicant was subject to a s 9 bond, was not relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, that being a matter personal to the offender. That Blackmore DCJ wrongly took this into account in that assessment ought not to be accepted, however. 

49Preceding this passage in his Honour's ex tempore reasons, had been a discussion of the agreed facts which comprised the offence and his Honour's agreement as to McLoughlin DCJ's assessment of its seriousness. He concluded that the applicant's offence was also above the middle of the range of seriousness. He then turned in this passage to relevant aggravating factors, which had to be taken into account in arriving at the sentence. There was no error in that approach.

50Even if, contrary to this conclusion, his Honour had inadvertently taken these aggravating factors into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the applicant's offence, there was no issue that these factors had to be taken into account in the overall sentencing exercise. As discussed in McLaren v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 284, for example at [29], assessing the moral culpability of the offending in question, remains an important task in the sentencing process. 

51Further, his Honour's approach in fact, had no adverse effect on the applicant's sentence. Despite the seriousness of the applicant's offence, properly found to be above the mid-range of such offending and his significant moral culpability for his offending, the sentence imposed was only 5 years, 6 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years, 6 months. Given that the maximum penalty for this offence was 20 years and the standard non-parole period 5 years, if the alleged error was in fact committed, it is apparent that the sentence imposed was, in the circumstances, relatively lenient.

52It was also submitted for the applicant that the conclusion that the applicant's offence fell well and truly above the middle range of objective seriousness overstated, to a significant degree, the criminality involved in the applicant's offence. I disagree.

53What is required of a sentencing judge is an assessment of the gravity of the particular offending for which the offender is being sentenced. It is not a question of it not being difficult to imagine offences within that category which may have had a more lasting and significant impact on a victim, although in this case, of course, the result of the applicant's offence was the complete destruction of the victim's home and almost the entirety of its contents. 

54Contrary to the applicant's submissions, Blackmore DCJ did not fail to properly consider the objective seriousness of this offence. To the contrary, he gave careful consideration to the evidence which cast light on its gravity, including not only the results of the offence, but the circumstances in which it occurred and the nature of the applicant's involvement. This was an offence conceived and pursued, as his Honour found, entirely for the applicant's purposes. 

55As his Honour discussed, not only did the applicant act outside the law, he took steps to recruit his co-offenders, when the opportunity presented itself. They were two young men considerably younger than he, who were intoxicated. He enticed them into committing the offence, by providing them with the petrol in his truck and his offer of payment. Not only did he thereby distance himself from the offence, he avoided the dangers which it posed to his young co-offenders, dangers which those who responded to the fire and Mr Taylor were then exposed. Those matters all support the finding that this was an offence falling above the mid range of seriousness of such offences, as his Honour found.

56In the result the error alleged was not made out and, accordingly, this ground of appeal must be dismissed.

Ground 1 - parity

57In my view the applicant has not established that the unjustifiable disparity he complains about exists. 

58As discussed in Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [65]:
""Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect [original emphasis]."" 

59A complaint as to parity accepts that the sentence imposed was otherwise appropriate (see England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [22]; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [251]). It is for the applicant to demonstrate that the sentence imposed has left him with a justifiable sense of grievance as to the unjustifiable disparity between the sentence imposed upon him and his co-offenders. That does not depend upon the feelings of the person complaining of disparity. It depends on the application of objective criteria (see Green v The Queen; The Queen v Green [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [31] - [32]). 

60There are limitations on the operation of the principle in cases where co-offenders' levels of criminality are different, as his Honour correctly here found to be the case. 

61In that regard it ought not to be overlooked that age played an important part in these three sentencing exercises. DB was aged 17 years at the time of the offence and so was sentenced in the Children's Court to a 2 year control order, which was suspended. Blake O'Connor was 18, some months older than DB and like the applicant, who was then aged 45 years, was sentenced as an adult. He was sentenced to an intensive correction order for a period of 1 year,11 months. The applicant was sentenced to a total term of 5 years, 6 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years, 6 months.

62The case advanced on appeal rested on the sentence imposed on Blake O'Connor, there being limits to the comparisons which may properly be drawn when a co-offender is dealt with by the Children's Court (see R v Wong [2003] NSWCCA 247 at [35]). 

63The applicant acknowledged that there were differences in the objective seriousness of his co-offenders' respective offending, which he accepted justified some differential in the penalties imposed. He submitted, however, that the differences between the sentence imposed upon he and Blake O'Connor were so marked, as to leave him with a justifiable sense of grievance.

64It was submitted to be relevant to consider that while the applicant's objective criminality was increased, because he had paid others to commit the offence to which he was an accessory, he had not set out to find someone to commit the offence, prior to the day it was committed. The idea of burning down the house arose out of a discussion between the offenders, and the applicant's offer to pay them was only part of their motivation for their offences.

65It was also submitted that while there was a difference in the offenders' ages, an 18 year old male would have known that setting fire to someone's house was seriously wrong. The offence was not one of immaturity and relative age should not have given rise to substantial differences in penalty. Nor was the applicant in a position of trust or authority over the co-offenders. In the result the differences between the two head sentences was disproportionate and had to be reduced, in order to do equal justice between these offenders. 

66In my view that conclusion is not available.

67The starting point for the sentence imposed on Blake O'Connor was explained by McLoughlin DCJ to have been 3 years. His offence and that of the applicant both carried a maximum penalty of 20 years and a standard non-parole period of 5 years. Blake O'Connor was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 23 months, to be served by way of an intensive correction order, after a 35% discount for his early plea and assistance and a finding of special circumstances. 

68McLoughlin DCJ found his offence to have been serious, premeditated and organised by the applicant, but committed by the co-offenders. He took into account that the offence was carried out for reward, with significant damage resulting, as well as risks to the public at large and to fire and police officers who attended, as well as to Mr Taylor and a guest. Questions of parity and proportionality were considered on sentencing, as well as relevant subjective factors, including Blake O'Connor's record, which was considered to allow him some leniency on sentencing; evidence of psychological counselling for mental health issues, but no mental illness or disorder; his general background and circumstances; positive character references, which attested to his offending being out of character, as well as genuine guilt and remorse and assistance to police. His Honour also took into account, amongst other things, his conclusion that Blake O'Connor had acted in fear of the applicant, in concluding that his sentence should be served by way of intensive correction order. 

69As the applicant submitted to Blackmore DCJ on his sentencing, Blake O'Connor's offence involved significant criminality. The sentence imposed upon him by McLoughlin DCJ was thus in the circumstances a very lenient one, a matter which Blackmore DCJ expressly considered. The applicant's case that his offence was less serious than that of Blake O'Connor was properly rejected, for the reasons which Blackmore DCJ explained. 

70His Honour expressly took into account the arguments advanced by the applicant in relation to parity and totality. He considered that the reason that the sentences imposed on the co-offenders were considerably below the standard non-parole period could be explained by their individual circumstances. He concluded that the applicant was considerably more responsible for the commission of the offence, which was only committed by the co-offenders, because he wanted it to happen. His Honour also found that the applicant had committed his offence in numerous circumstances of aggravation, which had been identified and had to be taken into account. 

71Blackmore DCJ identified the starting point for the applicant's sentence for his two offences, for which he received a 25% discount, to be 8 years. Accordingly, given the 6 month fixed term sentence imposed for the drug offence, it follows that some 7 years, 4 months of this 8 year starting point related to the s 112(2) offence. The sentence imposed after a discount of 25% and a finding of special circumstances was 5 years, 6 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years, 6 months. 

72Given that the maximum penalty for this offence, properly found to have fallen above the mid-range of seriousness of such offences, was 20 years, with a standard non-parole period of 5 years, the imposition of a non-parole period of only 3 years, 6 months, can only be explained by his Honour's application of the parity principle. The result was, as I have explained, a lenient sentence, given the gravity of this offending.

73That does not reveal error, but different sentencing outcomes because the offenders' cases were different in relevant respects.

74In determining the applicant's sentence Blackmore DCJ had to pay proper regard to the gravity of the applicant's offence, the evidence of the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, as well as the maximum penalty for the offence and the standard non parole period. Questions of parity and totality also had to be considered, as did the applicant's personal circumstances, all matters which his Honour expressly took into account. 

75The heavier sentence imposed on the applicant properly reflected, as the Crown submitted, the different roles which the offenders had played in this offending, as well as the different findings made about the two offenders. In Blake O'Connor's case, they included his lower level of criminality and his differing subjective circumstances, including his age, being only eight months older than DB; his intoxication and problems with binge drinking; the evidence that he was scared of the applicant, due to his reputation; that he had recently left home and made poor choices of associates; and had since returned to live with his family. Blake O'Connor's sentence also reflected the benefit of the 35% discount he had received for his plea and co-operation.

76Blackmore DCJ properly found on the undisputed evidence, that the offence had been committed at the applicant's direction and solely for his purposes. The applicant was many years older than both DB and Blake O'Connor, who carried out the offence at his instigation, with the petrol he supplied, in return for the payment he made, in order to further his desire for vengeance. While he told his co-offenders that no one was at home, he could not assure that this would be the case, hence the aggravating fact that DB armed himself with a knife, when the co-offenders entered the home. 

77The applicant's sentence had to reflect that he had paid others to set fire to his neighbour's home, as part of an ongoing feud which had resulted in AVO orders being made and which he breached. The applicant's offence was objectively considerably more serious than that of his co-offenders, he having, as his Honour found, pursued his feud through others, taking the law into his own hands, while distancing himself and paying others to commit the serious offence he had instigated, which placed those who had to fight the fire at considerable risk. 

78There were also serious aggravating factors to be taken into account in sentencing the applicant, which did not apply to the co-offenders, including the applicant's breach of the AVO which bound him, at a time when he was already on a bond for another breach of that AVO. It followed that the need for both personal and general deterrence were also particularly important elements in the sentence imposed on the applicant.

79These matters all demonstrate that this was a case where the disparity in the sentences imposed was justified. Objectively assessed, the disparity in the sentences imposed gives rise to no appearance of injustice. 

80In any event, in my view, this is a case where, even if a justifiable sense of grievance were established, the Court's discretion to intervene in the applicant's sentence should not be exercised, given the gravity of his offending and the lenient sentence imposed upon him, for the reasons I have earlier explained. To intervene in this case would be to reduce a lenient sentence to one which would be entirely inadequate for the applicant's offending (see Green at [33]).

		28 November 2014",2014-11-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765444,R v D'Ambrosio [2014] NSWSC 1685,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
Introduction
1On 21 November 2014 the offender, James D'Ambrosio, was arraigned on an indictment dated 21 November 2014 charging him with unlawfully slaying Nikola Srbin at Redfern on 5 June 2013. He pleaded guilty to the offence. The basis for his liability is that he was party to a joint criminal enterprise which involved an unlawful and dangerous act which caused the death of the deceased.
2Prior to the presenting of the indictment referred to above, the trial by jury of the offender for the charge of murder had been set down to commence on 22 September 2014. He was arraigned on indictment on that day and pleaded guilty to manslaughter but, because of an error in the date of the offence on the indictment, I granted leave on 21 November 2014, which was not opposed, for the indictment to be amended to correct the date. The offender was re-arraigned as set out above.
The Facts
3The facts on the basis of which the offender is to be sentenced are derived substantially from the statement of agreed facts, which was signed by the offender and the Crown Prosecutor on 22 September 2014 (the Agreed Facts), from which the following narrative is taken. 
4As sentencing judge, I may not take facts into account in a way that is adverse to the interests of the offender unless the facts have been agreed or established beyond reasonable doubt, but if there are circumstances which I propose to take into account in favour of the offender it is sufficient that they be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [27], per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ. 
Narrative based on agreed Facts
5In May 2013 the offender lived in Housing Commission property at unit 36/125 George Street, Redfern.  He was a drug dealer of small stature.  His main supplier was someone whom he referred to as 'the Boss'.
6The deceased, Nikola Srbin, was 18 years of age on the morning of 16 May 2013 when he, together with his father, Jonel Srbin, brother Tony Srbin and Adrian Moshref, confronted the offender at home in his unit and demanded that he repay a $400 drug debt.  The Srbins, who were also drug dealers, used unit 69/125 George Street as a drug 'safe house'.  Moshref was their 'muscle', being a large and violent man.
7The offender, who had no money, was beaten and kicked by the group.  His DNA was later found on the shoes of the deceased.  The deceased produced a knife and held it to the offender's face to reinforce the demand for repayment.  A knife was found by police on the person of the deceased. The offender's house was ransacked.  The group gave the offender until 6 pm that day to repay the debt.  The offender sought help from the Boss.  He met with him and a group of men in the Burwood area later that day. They travelled to Redfern by car.
8At about 6.50 pm the Boss and about 8 men arrived in Redfern.  The offender met Moshref and the deceased who were with Danny Nykolyn in the courtyard of the apartment building where he lived.  Moshref and the deceased repeated their demands.  The latter placed his hand in a pocket in a manner intended to remind the offender of the knife.  About 10 men including the Boss then stormed into the courtyard and set upon Moshref and the deceased.  Moshref was threatened by someone with a handgun and told not to involve himself in the attack.  During the fist fight, someone from the Boss' gang produced a rubber mallet and struck a blow to the deceased's head.  The deceased fell down.  As he was getting up, a member of the gang beat him over the head with a baseball bat.  The assailants left the scene and the area.  The offender and Nykolyn took refuge in Phillip Street, Redfern.
9The deceased staggered back to unit 69. His head was bleeding.  He lost consciousness and was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where he remained unconscious and on life support. On 5 June 2013 he died as a result of the head injuries received during the melee.  Post mortem examination of the deceased revealed that death was due to blunt force head injury and consequential epidural haematoma. 
10Police interviewed the offender on 25 May 2013.  He gave an account of being stood over by Moshref and the Srbins. He admitted being present near his home at the time of the reprisal, but alleged that a number of Aborigines rushed past him and towards Moshref and the deceased.  He told police that he knew nothing of what followed.
11On 6 September 2013 the offender revealed more of what he knew about the evening to a police undercover operative.  He was arrested on 9 October 2013 and interviewed a second time.  He admitted lying in the first interview about the Aboriginal identity of the attackers, but continued to deny personal involvement in the melee.
12The offender admits knowing the identity of some of the gang who committed the reprisal attack at his behest.  He admits knowing that the gang members took a rubber mallet and a baseball bat to the melee. However, he believed they were armed against the known possession of a knife by the deceased.  Although he did not himself participate physically in the melee, he was present and had contemplated that some harm might be occasioned by the mallet or the baseball bat and not through the need for self-defence.
Further facts based on the offender's evidence
13The offender gave the following evidence which was not challenged in cross-examination. On the morning of 16 May 2013, the assailants visited him to recover the drug debt of $400. They remained in his residence for a period of about three hours. He was severely beaten. His house had been ransacked. His assailants had threatened to kidnap him and torture him if he did not come up with the money by the appointed time that evening. 
14He said that he was required to live at the Redfern address as a condition of his parole for the drug offences. He said that he was not a violent man and did not want to be involved in the use of force. He was terrified of what the assailants might do to him when they returned at the appointed time. After they left, he tried unsuccessfully to obtain $400 to pay the debt. In desperation he went to Burwood to try to find people who would protect him when his assailants returned to Redfern that evening.
Other facts relevant to the sentence
15The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 9 October 2013. At the time of the melee on 16 May 2013 he was on parole for a sentence imposed for three offences of supply of drugs commonly known as ice, cocaine and ecstasy. The sentence, which commenced on 9 October 2008, was for a total term of five years with a non-parole period of three years. Leave to appeal against the sentence was granted but the appeal was dismissed: D'Ambrosio v R [2010] NSWCCA 120. The offender's parole was revoked as of 16 May 2013. He was therefore required to serve 4 months and 23 days (being the period from 16 May 2013 until 9 October 2013). Accordingly the sentence for the drug offences expired on 3 March 2014. The time in custody since 4 March 2014 has been referable to the present offence.
16Ms Davenport SC, who appeared on behalf of the offender, tendered material which had also been tendered in the sentencing hearing for the drug offences. This evidence comprised a report dated 8 November 2008 of Dr Katie Seidler, psychologist, and the following three character references:(1)Tobias Leago, a long-term friend, dated 18 December 2008;(2)Tim Hanrahan, a long-term friend, dated 17 December 2008;(3)Didi Lo, a close friend since 2000, dated 15 December 2008.
17In the report referred to above Dr Seidler documented the following history, which was adopted and added to by the offender in evidence before me and was not the subject of cross-examination. 
18The offender was born in Scotland in November 1964. He has three older sisters. He is the younger of twin boys. His father was of Italian descent. The offender grew up in a small town outside Glasgow. He had a happy childhood and enjoyed close relationships with his parents and siblings. His parents ran a small mixed business together until his father died of cancer when the offender was 18. His mother has not formed another relationship. The offender was devastated by his father's death and moved first to Barcelona and afterwards to Toronto before migrating to Australia in 1991. He was happy in Australia although he would like to return to Scotland on his release to be closer to his family and the landscape of his childhood. 
19The offender married and had a son who was born in about 1993. They separated when his son was five years old. Because his ex-wife did not want him to see his son after the separation he did not see his son for the next thirteen years. 
20He was for some time a consistent worker and was apparently well-liked and trusted. He started a business with a partner; however, this was not successful. His work record after that time was patchy.
21Although the offender has no criminal history prior to the convictions for the drug offences, he reported to Dr Seidler that he used cannabis daily from about 1995. He also reported to Dr Seidler that he had used ecstasy and cocaine.  In about 2005, he returned to Scotland after an absence of twenty years. While he was there an aunt and three friends died of cancer. He dealt with his grief by self-medicating with crystal methylamphetamines, otherwise known as ice, which is a highly addictive substance.  He became depressed. 
22In 2006 or 2007 the offender worked in a coffee shop for Trudi Malony and her husband. He served coffee and cleared tables. Ms Malony gave evidence at the sentence hearing that the offender was a good, reliable employee who was well liked by patrons. 
23In 2008 the offender was taken into custody where he served the non-parole period of the sentences for his drug offences. While in custody he was medicated on Avanza, an anti-psychotic, anti-depressant drug which also had a sedative effect. In early 2011 Ms Malony assisted with the reconciliation between the offender, who was still in gaol, and his son. 
24On his release to parole in October 2011, the offender was unable to obtain a prescription for Avanza as he did not have a Medicare card. He returned to live with friends in Redfern and was reunited with a former girlfriend who was a heavy drug user. He sought treatment from a psychologist in Edgecliff whom he attended for four or five months and who advised him to terminate the relationship. Nonetheless, the offender continued in the relationship. He sought treatment to assist him to overcome his drug addiction and was prescribed Suboxone, which contains a blocker known as Naltrexone, which suppresses the high from drugs and therefore removes the incentive to take them. The offender took Suboxone for five months but then stopped because of, as he explained it, ""peer pressure"".
25In June 2013, after the melee that led to the death of the deceased, the offender began a relationship with a woman by the name of Julianne. Julianne became pregnant and had a daughter called Delilah who was born in about June 2014. By 8 October 2013 the offender had already been interviewed by police in connection with the events that led to the death of the deceased and Julianne knew that she was pregnant. She wanted to stop taking drugs to protect their unborn child. On that day the offender went with Julianne to the Langton Centre where they were both put on the Suboxone programme. The following day he was arrested.
26From the time of the offender's arrest in October 2013 Ms Malony has kept in touch with him, brought Julianne and Delilah to gaol to visit him and contacted his family in Scotland on his behalf. Julianne attended the sentence hearing with Delilah.
Relevant principles
27It is well recognised that of all offences, manslaughter produces the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability and consequently there is a substantial range in the sentences imposed for this offence: R v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67 (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ). The fundamental touchstone for sentencing in such cases is that there has been an unlawful taking of human life for which the offender is criminally liable and for which he must be sentenced to imprisonment. 
Maximum penalty
28The maximum penalty is an indication of the relative seriousness of the offence (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [31], per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) and is therefore to be taken into account. The maximum term of imprisonment for manslaughter is 25 years: s 24 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). There is no standard non-parole period.
The objective seriousness of the offence
29The deceased died because he was involved in recovering a modest drug debt from the offender. The offender is criminally responsible for his death because he arranged for supportive assailants to come to the place where his creditors were to return to recover the debt demanded earlier that day. The offender envisaged that force would be required to enforce, or resist, the demand and that weapons, a mallet, a knife, or a baseball bat might be used to attack as well as threaten members of the opposing side.
30The offender himself had been the victim of actual force and threats of force earlier that day. Ms Davenport submitted on his behalf that he did not know how many assailants would return to his residence at the appointed hour that evening to enforce the drug debt. So much may be accepted. However, while this may explain, it does not excuse, his response, which was to escalate the violence and increase the risk of physical harm. His desire for physical protection was understandable. However disputes are not to be resolved by the use of force or stand-over tactics. 
31Ms Davenport referred me to two cases which she submitted were the most similar that she could find: R v Taiseni, Motuapuaka, Leota, Tuifua [2007] NSWSC 1090 and R v KP & PR [2008] NSWSC 970. I have read and considered those decisions but am mindful of the restrictions of placing too much weight on so-called comparable cases: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 at [53] - [55]; Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R [2014] HCA 2; 88 ALJR 372 at [40]-[41]; RCW v R (No. 2) [2014] NSWCCA 190.
32The offender, although not the actual assailant, set in motion the train of events that led to the death of the deceased. He appreciated that there was a risk of violence and must have appreciated that he would be unlikely to be in a position to control the consequences of the conflict which he had orchestrated. His was not an impulsive act. Rather, he implemented a plan that had been conceived and arranged during the course of a day to set one group of men against another. Despite the offender's statement that he abhorred violence, he deliberately used other men as his weapons. 
33The use of force to settle disputes, enforce debts or intimidate others is wholly inconsistent with the rule of law and the standards of civilised society. When force is resorted to in order to settle differences and serious consequences ensue, as they did in the present case, the instigator is guilty of serious offending. General and specific deterrence are important considerations in the exercise of the sentencing discretion in the present case. I regard the offender's moral culpability as high.
Plea of guilty
34I am required to take into account the offender's plea of guilty which came shortly before the trial was due to begin. Although a four-week trial has been avoided, the utilitarian value of the plea is lower because of its timing. There will be a discount of 10% with some slight rounding down to achieve a practical result.
Pre-sentence custody
35Ms Davenport submitted that the sentence I impose ought be back-dated to commence on 9 October 2013 since the parole was revoked because of the manslaughter offence. The Crown accepted that a degree of concurrency was appropriate. I am persuaded that the sentence for the manslaughter offence ought be back-dated to 9 October 2013.
Criminal history
36As referred to above the offender has previous convictions for drug offences. However his criminal history is limited to a single period in 2006-2007, when he was already over forty years old. He has no history of violent offending. He is entitled to have taken into account his good character prior to that time. 
Remorse
37The offender gave evidence that he has frequent nightmares about the death of the deceased and his responsibility for it. I accept that he is distressed by the consequences of his actions although I am not persuaded that his distress is necessarily for the deceased and his family as opposed to himself. 
Prospects of rehabilitation
38The offender was 48 at the time of the offending and he is now 50 years old. Ms Davenport submitted that his prospects of rehabilitation were fair. She contended that, although his age was against him, the fact that he was a new father and was in a good, loving relationship would give him the incentive to overcome his drug addiction which was the root cause of his offending. The offender is unusual in that his criminal history began late in life and was the result of his resorting to drugs and his inability to overcome his addiction. I am not satisfied that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are better than fair. One might have thought that his age and his recent reconciliation with his son would have been sufficient for him not to return to drugs and to find a better alternative to the situation with which he was confronted in May 2013 when he lacked the money to repay a drug debt. However this did not prove to be the case.
Offence committed while on parole
39It is a significant aggravating factor that the subject offending was committed while the offender was on parole. 
Offence committed in company
40Ms Davenport accepted that it was an aggravating factor that the offence was committed in company. Notwithstanding this concession, I do not consider it to be appropriate to take this factor into account as a separate aggravating factor since it is incorporated in the basis of the plea to manslaughter. The offender was responsible for the death of the deceased because of his role in the joint enterprise, which by definition, involved others.
Special circumstances
41Ms Davenport submitted that, as the offender was on limited association in custody (by reason of the circumstances of his plea for the drug offences), I ought find special circumstances. The evidence does not establish the extent to which, if at all, those conditions are more onerous for the offender. I am not satisfied that there are special circumstances.
Victim impact statement
42Retribution is one of the many aspects of punishment and is particularly significant when a life has been taken. However, the loss suffered by the deceased and his family cannot be reflected in any sentence I impose, although it can be taken into account. In the course of the sentencing hearing the Crown tendered a Victim Impact Statement by the deceased's mother. I accept without qualification the loss of the deceased which is felt on a daily basis by those who loved him.  I take this opportunity to extend my personal sympathies to family and friends of the late Nikola Srbin.
Sentence
James D'Ambrosio:For the manslaughter of Nikola Srbin, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 9 years and 10 months commencing on 9 October 2013 with a non-parole period of 7 years and 5 months.
The earliest date upon which you are eligible for release on parole is 9 March 2021.*********

		28 November 2014",2014-11-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765445,ES v R [2014] NSWCCA 268,"Judgment

1THE COURT: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court on 26 July 2012 after he entered a plea of guilty on 8 February 2012 to aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring Lachlan Wilson to import a commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine, a border controlled precursor, contrary to ss 307.11(1) and (2) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Code). That offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment, 5,000 penalty units, or both. 

2On the same day the applicant also entered a plea of guilty to attempting to possess pseudoephedrine, as a precursor, contrary to s 24A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (the DMT Act). That offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, 2000 penalty units, or both. 

3Pseudoephedrine is both a border controlled precursor under the Code, and a prohibited drug and a precursor under the DMT Act.

4After applying a combined discount of 40 per cent for the pleas of guilty and assistance to the authorities, the applicant was sentenced to 9 years and 11 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 6 years on the first count and a fixed term of 2 years and 2 months imprisonment on the second count, to be served wholly concurrently with the sentence imposed on the first count. 

5The application for leave to appeal is limited to the sentence imposed on the first count (the Commonwealth count). 

6Five grounds of appeal were filed but only three grounds were pressed at the hearing. The first two grounds address the combined discount for the plea of guilty and assistance and are conveniently dealt with together. The applicant complains that the discount of 8 per cent for the plea of guilty was inadequate and a greater allowance should have been made for the applicant's assistance to the authorities. In short, it was submitted that the combined discount of 40 per cent should have been greater. The third ground of appeal complains that the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence was inappropriate and that a non-parole period of less than 6 years should have been imposed. 

A chronology of events post arrest 
7This applicant was one of six offenders arrested and charged on 14 August 2008 with various offences relating to the importation and supply of just over 603 kg of pseudoephedrine calculating to a pure weight of around 125 kg. The drug was detected by Customs on 8 August 2008 secreted in 45 boxes in a consignment of 390 boxes. The container had been packed and loaded in Thailand. After removing the pseudoephedrine and replacing it with an inert substance upon its arrival in Australia, the container was the subject of a controlled delivery to a warehouse where others were arrested. Relevantly, they included DS, Yousef Jidah and his brother Ibrahim Jidah. Another offender, Lachlan Wilson, was arrested upon his return to Australia from Thailand.

8The applicant was committed for trial on 26 October 2009. A joint trial was fixed for 21 June 2010. On 3 June 2010, the applicant offered to plead guilty to the charge under s 24A(1) of the DMT Act in full satisfaction of the indictment which, at that time, also included two further counts, namely aid and abet the importation and a supply charge under the DMT Act. The Crown rejected that offer. 

9On 9 September 2010, the applicant was granted conditional bail. He remained on bail until he was sentenced. After successive adjournments, the joint trial of all offenders, other than this applicant, was listed to commence on 23 February 2011. The applicant's trial had been vacated some weeks earlier to enable him to secure funding to allow him to be represented at his trial.

10On 12 May 2011, the jury returned verdicts of guilty in the trial with respect to Lachlan Wilson, Ibrahim Jidah, Yousef Jidah and DS, for their involvement in seeking to possess pseudoephedrine for supply contrary to s 25(2) of the DMT Act. DS, Ibrahim Jidah and Yousef Jidah were also convicted of attempting to obtain possession of the pseudoephedrine as a precursor, contrary to s 24A of the DMT Act. The jury were unable to agree as to whether Lachlan Wilson imported the pseudoephedrine as a border controlled precursor or whether DS aided and abetted the importation by Lachlan Wilson, both counts laid under the Code. 

11On 16 June 2011, the applicant offered to plead guilty to aiding and abetting the importation of the pseudoephedrine by Lachlan Wilson conditional on the Crown agreeing to discontinue the remaining two charges referred to above and discontinuing the proposed retrial of Lachlan Wilson and DS, listed to commence on 1 August 2011. That date was subsequently vacated with their joint trial ultimately listed to commence in February 2012. That offer was also rejected by the Crown.

The sentencing of co-offenders
12Between 23 September 2011 and 27 July 2012, Lachlan Wilson, Ibrahim Jidah, Yousef Jidah and DS were sentenced to differing terms of imprisonment. Nothing turns on that fact so far as this applicant is concerned since he makes no complaint about disparity. In the applications for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on DS (who was sentenced the day after this applicant) and Lachlan Wilson (who was sentenced 2 months earlier), they each complain that the sentence imposed on this applicant was so markedly disparate to the sentences they received for, what they both submitted was, less objectively serious offending, as to be productive of a justifiable sense of grievance. DS was re-sentenced having made out a ground of appeal based on a disparity referable, in part, to the sentence imposed on this applicant (DS v R [2014] NSWCCA 267). Lachlan Wilson's sentence appeal was dismissed (Lachlan Wilson v R [2014] NSWCCA 266).

The facts for sentencing purposes
13His Honour had regard to a comprehensive set of agreed facts supplemented by a summary of a number of lawfully intercepted telephone calls and text messages between this applicant and Lachlan Wilson and between Lachlan Wilson and DS. From that material, his Honour concluded that, despite the applicant pleading guilty to aiding and abetting the importation by Lachlan Wilson (the count upon which the jury were unable to agree at Lachlan Wilson's trial and for which he was not subsequently retried), this applicant was the principal in the enterprise, which had the importation and attempted retrieval of 125 kg of pure pseudoephedrine from a consignment of 603 kg of tablets imported from Thailand as its objective. His Honour found that the applicant had controlled the operation from its inception. That involved directing the activities of others, including Lachlan Wilson, in whose name the consignment was imported, and then directing his cousin DS and Ibrahim Jidah in the supply phase of the operation. 

14After summarising the facts, his Honour found that the applicant's role as principal included, in particular, arranging for the supplier of the drugs in Thailand to make initial contact with Lachlan Wilson; liaising with Lachlan Wilson and the suppliers to ensure they had a means of communicating with each other; arranging for Lachlan Wilson to be in Thailand at the time the container arrived in Australia and when it was delivered to his warehouse; maintaining contact with and pressure on Lachlan Wilson to ensure the importation arrived in a timely fashion and to ensure the container was dealt with promptly by Lachlan Wilson's Customs broker, and ultimately communicating with Lachlan Wilson as to what the applicant believed to have been the success of the operation. 

15The directions the applicant gave to DS included ensuring he supervised the reception of the container at the warehouse and the identification of the 45 boxes that contained the drugs and ascertaining whether any of the boxes contained a listening device. This applicant also recruited Ibrahim Jidah (to escort the 45 boxes from the warehouse to another location) who, in turn, recruited his brother, Yousef, as the driver. This applicant provided surveillance advice to ensure against the risk of police intervention.

16His Honour found that the applicant's motivation was greed since he must have anticipated a vast financial reward from the operation given the capacity of the consignment of drugs to realise between $77 million and $112 million if it had been exploited in the manufacture of methyl amphetamine. 

The applicant's subjective circumstances 
17The applicant was aged 32 at the time of sentence. He was a member of an Orthodox Christian Lebanese family, being the eldest of three brothers and three sisters. He completed his Higher School Certificate. He worked in the security industry for some time before setting up a transport business. He met Lachlan Wilson a few years before the criminal activity for which they had both been charged. Apparently he loaned $250,000 to Lachlan Wilson, although arrangements to pay it back did not seem to eventuate. It is unclear whether that money was outstanding at the time of their criminal union. Although the applicant had no relevant antecedents, he put before the court material that revealed he had a history of being involved in substantial drug trafficking. His Honour held this accordingly disentitled him to some leniency. 

18The applicant relied upon a report from Dr John Jacmon, a consultant psychologist, in which it was suggested that the applicant's compromised mental health diminished his ability to formulate reasoned judgments and caused him to act impulsively with little or no thought given to the consequences (we note in DS's sentence proceedings, a report from the same practitioner was tendered in almost identical terms). The sentencing judge gave no weight to Dr Jacmon's opinion, being well satisfied that the importation was planned and well organised over an extended period of time, that the applicant had directed the activities of others and the offence was the product of the same business acumen he had demonstrated through his involvement with various corporations in the course of which he had generated very considerable wealth. His Honour was, however, satisfied that his regret at the distress he caused his family and the bad example he had set his children, as expressed to Dr Jacmon, was genuine. 

19He regarded the applicant's prospects for rehabilitation as reasonable, being satisfied that he was unlikely to re-offend. There was evidence of a reasonable measure of remorse.

Grounds 1 and 2: The sentencing judge erred in setting an appropriate discount in respect to the applicant's plea of guilty and his assistance to authorities
20The combined discount of 40 per cent reflected an allowance of 8 per cent for the pleas of guilty and 14 per cent for future assistance if it was necessary that he gave evidence at the culmination of an investigation into unrelated serious offending. The remaining 18 per cent must be taken to have been an allowance for the applicant's assistance up to the date of sentence. His Honour also took into account the fact that the applicant was in protective custody at the time of sentence and would likely apply for non-association custody upon sentence. He also took into account that the assistance would likely put the applicant's family at risk which may result in a need for them to be relocated.

21Insofar as the ground concerning the specific allowance for the pleas of guilty, the applicant submitted that insufficient weight was given to the applicant's earlier conditional offers to plead guilty which should have moderated his Honour's finding that the pleas of guilty were entered at a very late stage. It was also submitted that although the pleas of guilty were late (having been entered approximately three years and six months after his arrest) they nonetheless had considerable utilitarian value and, insofar as the Commonwealth offence was concerned, the plea reflected the applicant's willingness to facilitate the course of justice, despite the strength of the Crown case against him. 

22In our view, neither the terms nor the timing of the earlier conditional offers to plead guilty in any way diminish what was a very late plea the value of which, on the Commonwealth count, was greatly reduced by the overwhelming strength of the evidence to establish the applicant's actual involvement as the principal in the importation he was charged with aiding and abetting. His Honour also found that there was no basis to infer that the conditional offer to plead guilty in June 2011 was motivated by any willingness, on the applicant's part, to facilitate the administration of justice. We are satisfied this was a view entirely open to the sentencing judge in the exercise of his sentencing discretion. 

23We also reject counsel's submission that his Honour failed to give appropriate consideration to the applicant's willingness to facilitate the course of justice when the plea was ultimately entered. The fact that the retrial of Lachlan Wilson and DS was, at the time a guilty verdict was entered by the applicant, due to commence (a retrial in which the applicant was to stand trial jointly with them), does nothing to diminish the fact that the plea was over three and a half years after he was arrested and eight months after the second plea offer had been rejected. It is entirely irrelevant to the weight to be afforded to the applicant's plea of guilty to the Commonwealth count that the Crown elected not to proceed with a retrial of the applicant's co-offenders.

24Insofar as the discount for assistance is concerned, the applicant's complaint is essentially that a discount of 22 per cent in a combined discount of 40 per cent was an inadequate reflection of assistance which was described by his Honour as being of a ""high level and of great value"" (or, to put it another way, that a combined discount of 40 per cent failed to reflect that finding of fact). 

25The general approach of appellate courts and sentencing courts to the discount applied to a sentence for the combined effect of a plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities has been restated on a number of occasions by this Court (see Zreika v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [81], Bland v R [2014] NSWCCA 82 at [88], R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; (2006) 172 A Crim R 151 at [5], R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38; (2012) 219 A Crim R 415 at [66]-[68] and LB v R [2013] NSWCCA 70 at [62]). The authorities acknowledge that although there will be exceptional cases where a combined or composite discount of more than 40-50 per cent is called for (for instance, either because of the nature of the assistance itself or where the conditions of custody are particularly harsh or where there is a risk that family members might be exposed to danger) in all cases to which reference has been made above, the plea of guilty was in substance, if not described as such, ""early"" and thus account for a significant proportion of the discount (M v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 39 at [15]). Here, as we have already sought to emphasise, the plea was late. Although the assistance was found to be of a high level and of great value we are not satisfied that it ought to have attracted a more significant discount or that his Honour's discretion miscarried in applying a combined discount of 40 per cent.

26Sentencing is not an arithmetic exercise but a discretionary exercise in which the purposes of sentence under s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) need to be reflected in a principled way. Any greater discount would have undermined the need for the sentence to reflect personal and general deterrence and to punish this applicant for his role as the notional apex of a large commercial drug enterprise.

Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in setting an appropriate ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period 
27The sentence imposed in this case reflected a ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period of 60.5 per cent. Essentially the complaint advanced by the applicant is that, while his Honour indicated an intention to take into account the applicant's custodial conditions in appointing the proportion of the non-parole period to the head sentence, he must have failed to do so. It was also submitted that he failed to take into account the additional hardship to the applicant's family caused both by having to relocate and the fact that, after being on conditional liberty for an extended period of time, the applicant was ultimately sentenced to imprisonment. It was further submitted that his Honour failed to give any or sufficient weight to the deterioration in the applicant's financial situation. 

28These submissions fail entirely to deal with the obligation on the part of a sentencing court when sentencing for a Commonwealth offence to ensure that the minimum term to be served is fixed in accordance with Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), that is, it is referable to the minimum term that an offender should be required to serve in custody without the opportunity of parole, so as to serve, amongst other objectives, the needs of specific and general deterrence, and not to any judicially determined norm (see Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [44]). 

29To the extent that his Honour was entitled to be informed by the considerations referred to by the applicant's counsel on the appeal in fixing the non-parole period (about which we have some doubt), we can discern nothing in the appointment of the non-parole period as necessitating a finding that he failed to afford appropriate weight to them. In fact, on one view, the allowance given by his Honour to the applicant's family circumstances was generous when there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that any hardship that they might suffer as a consequence of the applicant's imprisonment was exceptional (see R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162). 

30A sentence of 6 years imprisonment prior to being eligible to be considered for release to parole for offending of the scale and order of the applicant's offending does not admit of any suggestion that his Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried in providing for a ratio of 60.5 per cent between the head sentence and the non-parole period (see Phan, Thanh Dinh v R [2013] NSWCCA 49). 

Orders
31Accordingly, the orders of the Court are:
(1)Leave to appeal is granted.

(2)The appeal is dismissed.

2765447,X7 v R [2014] NSWCCA 273,"JUDGMENT 

1BATHURST CJ: The applicant, (X7), seeks an extension of time to make an application for leave to appeal, and for leave to appeal under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against a refusal by the primary judge to permanently stay any further proceedings on an indictment. The indictment contains the following four counts. First, one count of conspiracy to traffic in a commercial quantity of cocaine, second, one count of conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of cocaine, third, one count of conspiracy to deal with the proceeds of crime and fourth, one count of attempting to possess a controlled drug. Each of the counts on the indictment were said to involve contraventions of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).

2The issues raised in the appeal are of general importance and both the extension of time and leave to appeal should be granted.

Background

3Following his arrest and being charged with the conspiracy offences referred to above, X7 was summonsed to appear and give evidence at an examination under the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) (ACC Act). The legislative scheme under which such examination was to take place is summarised in the joint judgments of French CJ and Crennan J and that of Hayne and Bell JJ in X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; (2013) 248 CLR 92 (X7 (No 1)) at [10]-[11] and [72]-[76]. It is unnecessary to repeat what was set out in those paragraphs. For present purposes it is sufficient to note the following matters. 

4First, any person examined under the ACC Act is obliged to answer questions put to him or her by an examiner, and a refusal to do so constitutes an offence (ACC Act, s 30(2) and (6)). Second, if a person claims that an answer given or document produced might tend to incriminate him or her, the answer or document is not admissible against the person in criminal proceedings (ACC Act, s 30(4) and (5)). Third, an examination must be held in private (ACC Act, s 25A(3)) and the examiner may direct that evidence or the content of any document produced must not be published or published only to a limited class of persons (ACC Act, s 25A(9)). The latter subsection requires the examiner to make such a direction where a failure to do so may prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been charged with an offence.

5X7 attended the premises of the Australian Crime Commission (the ACC) on 1 February 2011 and gave evidence with respect to the offences for which he had been charged, claiming the privilege against self-incrimination. On the following day he attended with a lawyer and refused to answer questions put to him. He was informed he would be charged with failing to answer questions. The examiner made a direction under s 25A(9) of the ACC Act, which he clarified by stating that the officers of the Commonwealth DPP and police officers associated with the prosecution of the offences with which X7 was charged, were not to receive evidence given by X7. 

6X7 subsequently commenced proceedings in the original jurisdiction of the High Court seeking certain declarations and injunctions. Gummow J reserved the following questions for consideration by the Full Court:

1. Does Division 2 of Part II of the ACC Act empower an examiner appointed under s 46B(1) of the ACC Act to conduct an examination of a person charged with a Commonwealth indictable offence where that examination concerns the subject matter of the offence so charged?

2. If the answer to Question 1 is ""yes"", is Div 2 of Part II of the ACC Act invalid to that extent as contrary to Ch III of the Constitution?

7A majority of the Court held the first question should be answered in the negative. The majority did not find it necessary to answer the second question. Subsequently, X7 applied to the District Court of NSW for a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings relating to the offences for which he had been charged. The primary judge refused to grant such a stay. The appeal is brought from that decision.

The reasoning of the primary judge

8The primary judge noted that the evidence established that nobody associated with the investigation of X7 was present at the ACC hearing and that there was no evidence of any dissemination of material obtained at the hearing to anyone involved in the investigation of the charges or their prosecution. Her Honour held that the granting of the stay was discretionary and that the circumstances would usually have to be extreme for such relief to be given. She stated that the right of the applicant to a fair trial must be balanced against the right of the community to expect that people charged with serious offences will be brought to trial.

9The primary judge found that X7 had not demonstrated that he would suffer any actual prejudice were the trial to proceed. In the circumstances she refused to grant a stay.

10Although the notice of appeal raised an additional ground, the only ground ultimately relied upon was that the primary judge erred in the exercise of her discretion in declining to grant a stay.

The principal authorities relied upon

11The submissions made on behalf of X7 involved a detailed analysis of four authorities: Hammond v The Commonwealth of Australia [1982] HCA 42; (1982) 152 CLR 188 (Hammond), X7 (No 1), Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; (2013) 251 CLR 196 (Lee (2013)) and Lee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20; (2014) 88 ALJR 656 (Lee (2014)). It is useful in understanding the submissions made in the appeal to have regard to the issues raised in these cases and what was said in them relevant to this appeal.

(a) Hammond 

12Hammond involved the claim for an interlocutory injunction seeking to restrain a Royal Commissioner from questioning the appellant on matters in respect of which he had been charged with criminal offences.

13The relevant legislation provided that it was an offence to refuse to answer any questions relevant to the inquiry. It also provided that no statement made by any person, in answer to any question before the Commission, should be admissible in any proceedings against him or her, nor be made the ground of any prosecution, action or suit against him or her.

14The ground of the application was that examination of Mr Hammond would constitute contempt of the court before which the criminal proceedings were pending. Gibbs CJ (with whom Mason J agreed) pointed out at 196 that to succeed Mr Hammond had to establish that there was a real risk, as opposed to a remote possibility, that the administration of justice would be interfered with if the Commission proceeded with the examination.

15Gibbs CJ held there was such a risk. His conclusion was expressed as follows at 198:

""Once it is accepted that the plaintiff will be bound, on pain of punishment, to answer questions designed to establish that he is guilty of the offence with which he is charged, it seems to me inescapably to follow, in the circumstances of this case, that there is a real risk that the administration of justice will be interfered with. It is clear that the questions will be put and pressed. It is true that the examination will take place in private, and that the answers may not be used at the criminal trial. Nevertheless, the fact that the plaintiff has been examined, in detail, as to the circumstances of the alleged offence, is very likely to prejudice him in his defence. In the Builders Labourers' Case I expressed the opinion that, if during the course of a commission's inquiries into allegations that a person had been guilty of criminal conduct, a criminal prosecution was commenced against that person based on those allegations, the continuance of the inquiry would, generally speaking, amount to a contempt of court, and that the proper course would be to adjourn the inquiry until the disposal of the criminal proceedings.""

16Brennan J reached the same conclusion. He stated at 202 that it was sufficient for the purpose of the case to appreciate the deep-rooted principle that the Crown may not subject any person to compulsory process to obtain answers upon the issue of the guilt of an offence with which he or she has been charged.

17Deane J reached the same conclusion, stating at 207 that subjecting the plaintiff to questioning and being charged for refusing to answer questions, of itself constitutes an injustice and prejudice to the plaintiff. He also stated at 208 that a person who is the subject of pending criminal proceedings in a court of law should not have their part in the proceedings investigated in a parallel inquisitorial inquiry. He stated that such an investigation constitutes an interference with the administration of justice.

18The decision in Hammond did not involve a finding that a particular question proposed to be asked or any use made of the answers would give rise to prejudice. Rather, the point was made that the fact of an examination on matters the subject of the charge gave rise to a real risk of interference with the administration of justice and was very likely to prejudice Mr Hammond in his defence. In X7 (No 1) this proposition was said to be correct.

(b) X7 (No 1)

19In X7 (No 1), a majority of the High Court held that the provisions of the ACC Act, which I have summarised, did not authorise the examination by the ACC of a person in respect of matters for which he or she had been charged with criminal offences.

20Hayne and Bell JJ delivered a joint judgment. They stated at [70] that permitting the Executive to ask, and requiring an accused person to answer, questions about the subject matter of a pending charge would alter the process of criminal justice to a marked degree, whether or not the answers given by the accused are admissible at trial or kept secret from those investigating and prosecuting the charge. Their Honours explained at [71] that any admission made at the examination would hinder, even prevent, the accused from challenging at trial that aspect of the prosecution case. They stated that that would radically alter what would otherwise be a wholly accusatorial process in which the accused may simply test the sufficiency of the prosecution's evidence. They stated a statutory alteration of that nature would need to be expressed in clear terms. Their Honours emphasised this point again at [85] and [87].

21Their Honours stated at [118] that every stage of the process of criminal justice is accusatorial. They stated that if the provisions of the ACC Act were to permit a compulsory examination of a person charged, they would effect a fundamental alteration to the process of criminal justice.

22Their Honours explained the impact on the accusatorial process in the following terms:

""[124] Even if the answers given at a compulsory examination are kept secret, and therefore cannot be used directly or indirectly by those responsible for investigating and prosecuting the matters charged, the requirement to give answers, after being charged, would fundamentally alter the accusatorial judicial process that begins with the laying of a charge and culminates in the accusatorial (and adversarial) trial in the courtroom. No longer could the accused person decide the course which he or she should adopt at trial, in answer to the charge, according only to the strength of the prosecution's case as revealed by the material provided by the prosecution before trial, or to the strength of the evidence led by the prosecution at the trial. The accused person would have to decide the course to be followed in light of that material and in light of any self-incriminatory answers which he or she had been compelled to give at an examination conducted after the charge was laid. That is, the accused person would have to decide what plea to enter, what evidence to challenge and what evidence to give or lead at trial according to what answers he or she had given at the examination. The accused person is thus prejudiced in his or her defence of the charge that has been laid by being required to answer questions about the subject matter of the pending charge.""

The decision in Hammond was expressly affirmed:

""[136] Two consequences follow. First, the actual decision in Hammond cannot be dismissed from consideration on the basis that it was decided in haste or improvidently. Secondly, the identification by Gibbs CJ of why continued examination of Mr Hammond would be a contempt is not to be treated as if expressed too loosely. Gibbs CJ said that: 

'Once it is accepted that [Mr Hammond] will be bound, on pain of punishment, to answer questions designed to establish that he is guilty of the offence with which he is charged, it seems to me inescapably to follow, in the circumstances of this case, that there is a real risk that the administration of justice will be interfered with.' (Emphasis added)

The 'circumstances of this case' to which Gibbs CJ referred were identified as including the fact 'that the examination will take place in private, and that the answers may not be used at the criminal trial'. But the interference with the administration of justice, and thus the contempt, was identified as lying in 'the fact that [Mr Hammond having] been examined, in detail, as to the circumstances of the alleged offence, is very likely to prejudice him in his defence'. It would prejudice him in his defence because he could no longer determine the course he would follow at his trial according only to the strength of the case that the prosecution proposed to, and did, adduce in support of its case that the offence charged was proved beyond reasonable doubt.""
(References omitted).

23Their Honours stated at [140] that Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21; (1989) 166 CLR 486 (Hamilton v Oades) and the cases which preceded it, Rees v Kratzmann [1965] HCA 49; (1965) 114 CLR 63 (Rees v Kratzmann) and Mortimer v Brown [1970] HCA 4; (1970) 122 CLR 493 (Mortimer v Brown), emphasised that the compulsory examinations would be conducted before a court which had the power to prevent abuse. They stated these cases depended upon the historical pedigree of the legislation there being considered.

24Kiefel J agreed with the reasons of Hayne and Bell JJ. Her Honour emphasised what she described at [159] as a fundamental principle of the common law, that the onus of proof rests upon the prosecution and its companion rule that an accused person cannot be required to testify to the commission of the offence charged. She also emphasised that the accusatorial nature of the system involves not only the trial itself but also pre-trial inquiries and investigations.

25It should be noted that Hayne and Bell JJ emphasised that their conclusions did not depend on classifying the trial after a secret and compulsory examination as an unfair trial. They stated at [89] that the relevant question was whether the accused would have a trial according to law. In this context they made the following comments:

""[93] Thirdly, there may very well have been an antecedent question of policy: should the legislature provide for an examination of the kind described? That would have been a question for the legislature. And it is a question which may well have been affected by notions of what is 'fair' or 'unfair'. But in considering the first, and in this case determinative, question identified (has the legislature provided for an examination of the kind described?), debate about the fairness of the outcome would serve only to divert discussion into generally unproductive arguments of the kind which have attended discussion of the privilege against self-incrimination. More particularly, the debate would necessarily proceed from stated or unstated assumptions about how a balance should be struck in the criminal justice system between individual rights, privileges and immunities, and societal demands for the detection and punishment of crime, especially serious crime. It is neither right nor profitable to approach the questions of construction which must be decided in this case by describing one or other of the possible constructions as leading to 'unfair' or 'undesirable' results.""

26French CJ and Crennan J dissented. Their Honours pointed out at [36] that it was critical to appreciate that the injunctive relief in Hammond was granted in circumstances where the prosecution was to have access to evidence and information which was in contrast to the safeguards in the ACC Act. They emphasised at [38] that the right to a fair trial extends to the whole course of the criminal process. They pointed to the fact, referring to Jago v The District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; (1989) 168 CLR 23 (Jago) and Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48; (1980) 147 CLR 75 (Barton), that the power to prevent an abuse of process is an incident of the general power to ensure fairness.

27They stated at [53] that executive inquiries into offences under some statutory schemes are capable of prejudicing a fair trial of an accused person by giving the prosecutor an unfair forensic advantage, including making use of derivative evidence.

28Their Honours emphasised at [54] that given the onus on the prosecution to prove an offence, and the non-compellability of the accused, in the absence of a factor such as the independent sourcing of evidence, it is not possible to reconcile a fair trial with reliance on compulsorily obtained evidence (from the accused person).

29Their Honours concluded at [60] that the protective provisions in s 25A of the ACC Act were sufficient to demonstrate that the examination provisions did not authorise executive interference with the process of criminal trials. They stated that whether a direction under s 25A would be sufficient to prevent the prosecution from obtaining an unfair advantage could not be stated in a categorical or exhaustive fashion. They said it would be necessary to consider the nature of the evidence, as well as the role of the person who had access to such evidence and who might make use of it.

(c) Lee (2013)

30Somewhat similar issues arose in Lee (2013). The case, like X7 (No 1), involved a question of statutory construction. The question was whether the provisions of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (CAR Act) authorised the compulsory examination of a person who had been charged with an offence in respect of the matters the subject of the charge. A majority of the High Court said that as a matter of construction, the CAR Act authorised such an examination.

31The legislative scheme contained in the CAR Act is set out in detail in the judgment of Crennan J at [92]-[110] and in the judgment of Gageler and Keane JJ at [271]-[290]. It is not necessary to do more than identify its principal features. 

32The CAR Act empowers the Supreme Court to make orders, including confiscation and forfeiture orders, in respect of the property of a person, where it is found to be more probable than not that the person has engaged in serious crime related activities. Ancillary to those powers is a power conferred on the NSW Crime Commission to apply for a restraining order in respect of an interest in property. Importantly, the CAR Act also allows for the Supreme Court, at a time it makes a restraining order or at a later time, to make an order for examination before the Court of the owner of the interest in the property subject to the restraining order, or another person concerning the affairs of the owner.

33Section 13A of the CAR Act provides that a person cannot refuse to answer questions or produce a document on the ground of self-incrimination. However, s 13A(2) states that any such answer or document is not admissible in criminal proceedings against that person, if objection is taken at the time of answer or production.

34Section 63 of the CAR Act provides that the fact that criminal proceedings have commenced is not a ground to stay proceedings which are not criminal proceedings. Proceedings under the CAR Act themselves are not criminal proceedings.

35There is no specific provision in the CAR Act equivalent to s 25A(9) of the ACC Act. However, until its repeal in 2010, s 62 of the CAR Act permitted the Supreme Court to make orders with respect to the publication of any matter arising under the act. Since the repeal of that section the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) provides the equivalent protection. 

36French CJ said at [3] that courts do not interpret a statute to permit questioning of the nature of that complained of unless expressly authorised or permitted by necessary implication.

37His Honour stated at [25], after referring to The King v Macfarlane; Ex parte O'Flanagan [1923] HCA 39; (1923) 32 CLR 518, that as a general proposition the nature and extent of prejudice to a person required to answer questions concerning matters the subject of pending criminal charges, will depend in part on the statutory context and, in particular, the protections which the statute affords concerning the use which may be made of the answers. He also indicated that the prejudice may depend on whether the examination is conducted by a judicial officer and the extent of that officer's discretion to control the examination so as to limit prejudice.

38His Honour expressed the view at [36] that the decision in Hammond was of limited utility in the appeal before him, as it did not concern an examination subject to the judicial control and discretion of the kind available under the CAR Act. He stated at [43] that the case before the Court was much closer to Hamilton v Oades than to Hammond. He distinguished X7 (No 1) for the same reason, namely, that the examination in that case was not to be conducted by judicial officers, but officers of the ACC. In the circumstances, he held the CAR Act permitted the examination, emphasising that the question was one of power, not whether the discretion to order the examination should have been exercised. He concluded as follows:

""[54] It may be accepted that the examination process under the CAR Act may, if it touches upon matters the subject of pending criminal charges against the examinee, affect the accusatorial character of the trial process. Even if the responses of the examinee to questions put to him or her were kept secret and were solely exculpatory or did no more than disclose defences to the charges, the examinee could be said to have suffered a forensic disadvantage. The nature of that disadvantage was discussed in the joint judgment of Hayne and Bell JJ in X7. I do not, with respect, disagree with anything their Honours said in the description of that disadvantage. 

[55] In my opinion, however, those considerations did not deprive the Court of Appeal of power to make the orders it did in this case. In so saying, I observe that the grounds of appeal for which special leave was granted do not raise any question whether the Court of Appeal's discretion miscarried when it made the orders it did. The question is one of power.""
(References omitted).

39The passage from X7 (No 1), referred to at [54] of the judgment of French CJ in Lee (2013), was the passage at [124] of the judgment of Hayne and Bell JJ in X7 (No 1), which I have set out above. 

40Crennan J referred at [125] to what was said by French CJ and her in their joint judgment in X7 (No 1) in relation to the concept and importance of a fair trial, the principle that the onus of proof rests on the prosecutor whom the accused is not required to assist and the rule that the accused is not compellable at his or her trial. She stated at [126] that it was a settled principle that statutory provisions are not to be construed as abrogating fundamental rights or immunities in the absence of clear words or a necessary implication.

41Her Honour also accepted that without an immunity from derivative use, as well as direct use of evidence obtained in a compulsory examination, the accused is not in as good a position as he or she would have been if the privilege had not been abrogated. She stated at [137] that Meagher JA was correct in stating in his judgment in the Court of Appeal that in the present case derivative use was protected by requiring the examination to take place before a judicial officer, having the inherent power to ensure the proper administration of justice. She emphasised that the power to make restraining orders and ancillary orders was one that was to be exercised judicially.

42Her Honour said at [148] that the distinction drawn by Gibbs CJ in Hammond between a real risk and a remote possibility was longstanding, practical and familiar. She stated that under the provisions of the CAR Act the Court's power to control an examination can prevent the prosecution obtaining an unfair forensic advantage and the precise circumstances of Hammond can be avoided. She stated at [154] that if, notwithstanding those protections, there is a real risk of interference with pending criminal proceedings, it is impliedly authorised by the legislature.

43Gageler and Keane JJ reached a similar conclusion. Their Honours summarised the argument advanced by the appellant in the following terms:

""[305] In support of that refocused argument, it was put for the appellants that (even if answers given and documents produced in an examination could be quarantined from all knowledge or use by the prosecution) the compulsory examination on oath of a person against whom criminal proceedings are pending on a matter touching or concerning the subject matter of those criminal proceedings is inherently prejudicial to the person's conduct of those proceedings. That was said to be because the answers given and documents produced by the person in the examination would inevitably constrain the instructions on which the legal representatives of the person could act in the criminal proceedings: the legal representatives would be ethically bound not to lead evidence or cross-examine or make submissions to suggest a version of the facts which contradicted that given by their client on oath in the examination.""

44Their Honours rejected the proposition that that argument compelled the conclusion that the CAR Act did not authorise the compulsory examination of a charged person. They stated at [322] that Hammond is not authority for the proposition that a real risk to the administration of justice necessarily, or presumptively, arises, by reason only of the exercise of a statutory power to compel the examination on oath of a person, against whom criminal proceedings have commenced but not been completed, where the subject matter of the examination will overlap with the subject matter of the proceedings. They stated that X7 (No 1) did not embrace such a proposition.

45Their Honours then made the following remarks:

""[323] There is a variety of ways in which, as a matter of practical reality, the examination on oath of a person against whom criminal proceedings have been commenced may have a tendency to give rise to unfairness amounting to an interference with the due course of justice in a particular case. The deprivation of a legitimate forensic choice available to the person in those proceedings may be one of those ways. However, we are unable to regard as the deprivation of a legitimate forensic choice a practical constraint on the legal representatives of the person leading evidence or cross-examining or making submissions in the criminal proceedings to suggest a version of the facts which contradicted that given by their client on oath in the examination. The legal representatives would, of course, be prevented from setting up an affirmative case inconsistent with the evidence but they would not be prevented from ensuring that the prosecution is put to proof or from arguing that the evidence as a whole does not prove guilt.

[324] The notion that any subtraction, however anodyne it might be in its practical effect, from the forensic advantages enjoyed by an accused under the general law necessarily involves an interference with the administration of justice or prejudice to the fair trial of the accused is unsound in principle and is not consistent with Hamilton v Oades. To accept that a criminal trial 'does not involve the pursuit of truth by any means' is not to condone as legitimate the pursuit of falsehood. The words of Lord Scarman in R v Sang, concerning the judicial discretion to exclude legally admissible evidence on the ground of unfairness, resonate more widely:

'The test of unfairness is not that of a game: it is whether ... the evidence, if admitted, would undermine the justice of the trial. Any closer definition would fetter the sense of justice, upon which in the last resort all judges have to rely: but any extension of the discretion ... would also undermine the justice of the trial. For the conviction of the guilty is a public interest, as is the acquittal of the innocent. In a just society both are needed.'""

46Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ dissented. Hayne J agreed with the reasoning of Kiefel J. He stated that Hammond was not confined to its own facts and was not overtaken by the decision in Hamilton v Oades. He stated at [69] that there was no relevant difference between the provisions of the CAR Act and the legislation in X7 (No 1). He stated any difference in opinion as to what was decided in Hammond and Hamilton v Oades was settled by X7 (No 1). He stated that the only thing which had changed since X7 (No 1) was a change in the composition of the Court, which was not a reason for overruling the earlier decision.

47Kiefel J stated at [163] that there could be little doubt that the material the subject of the examination would be made available to the prosecuting authorities. However, she stated that in addition there was a real risk, if not the likelihood, that aspects of the appellant's trial would differ from a criminal trial as it is ordinarily conducted, especially in its accusatorial aspects. She stated that rather than the prosecutor being required to prove the case without assistance from the appellant, the examination was likely to result in the prosecution being advantaged in the conduct of its case and the appellant being prejudiced.

48Her Honour described the principle that the prosecution must discharge the onus of proof and cannot compel the accused to give evidence for it, as ""the fundamental principle"" of the common law, stating that it was an essential aspect of the criminal justice system. She said that as stated in X7 (No 1), it was the fundamental principle and accusatorial system of criminal justice to which attention must be directed in construing a statute which requires a person charged with an offence to answer questions concerning that offence.

49Her Honour stated at [182] that the fundamental principle is best understood in the context of the accusatorial system of criminal justice, which reflects the balance struck between the power of the state to prosecute an individual and the position of the individual who stands accused.

50Her Honour referred to the conclusion reached in Hammond in the following terms:

""[213] The conclusion that was reached in Hammond was that an examination of an accused person risks an interference with the administration of justice because it may prejudice the person in his or her defence. It follows that if general legislation which provides for compulsory examination was to be read as permitting the examination of an accused person, the principle fundamental to the accusatorial system of justice would be altered. That proposition was accepted and applied by a majority of this Court in X7. Hammond is not to be distinguished on the basis that the legislation there in question concerned an examination by the executive, whereas the CAR Act involves an examination by the executive before the Supreme Court or an officer of the Court. As will be explained later in these reasons, the same conclusion as to the risk to the administration of justice is reached in each case. Given the need for continuity and consistency in judicial decisions, X7 should be followed.""
(References omitted).

51Her Honour stated at [241]-[249] that cases such as Hamilton v Oades and bankruptcy legislation, which provides for compulsory examination, should not be extended to areas of law where the fundamental principle operates. She stated at [249] that the trilogy of bankruptcy and corporation liquidation cases, Rees v Kratzman, Mortimer v Brown and Hamilton v Oades, resulted from a historical anomaly.

52Bell J agreed with the orders proposed by Kiefel J and her Honour's reasons. She noted at [258] that the respondent did not submit that X7 (No 1) was wrongly decided. She stated at [264] that the idea, that compelling a person to give an account of circumstances of a criminal charge pending before the courts creates a real risk to the administration of justice, is not a novel one. She stated that the prejudice flowing from an examination of the nature of that in question is not remote or fanciful.

(d) Lee (2014)

53Whereas X7 (No 1) and Lee (2013) concerned the construction of the ACC Act and the CAR Act respectively, Lee (2014) involved a case where transcripts of examinations of the appellants conducted under the provisions of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 (NSW) were made available to the prosecution authorities in contravention of s 13(9) of that act. The examination in that case took place prior to charges being laid for one appellant, whilst the other appellant had been charged with an offence prior to the examination.

54The Court, following X7 (No 1), held that such disclosure constituted a departure in a fundamental respect from a criminal trial to which an accused person is entitled. The Court stated at [19] that in those circumstances the Court of Criminal Appeal should have made orders quashing the conviction and ordering a retrial.

55In reaching that conclusion the Court at [31]-[32] explained the principle to be derived from X7 (No 1) in the following terms:

""[31] In X7, a majority of this Court held that the powers of compulsory examination given to the Australian Crime Commission were not to be construed as applying to persons already charged with offences the subject of the examination. To do so would be to depart from the accusatorial nature of the criminal justice system in a fundamental respect. Clear words or those of necessary intendment were therefore necessary and neither were present in the legislation in question. As such, it was not necessary for the majority in X7 to consider the protective purpose of a provision similar to s 13(9). However, French CJ and Crennan J, who were in dissent, did so. It was a matter of some significance to their Honours' reasoning that the legislation, in providing for a direction regarding non-publication, did so in order to safeguard the examined person's trial as fair.

[32] Our system of criminal justice reflects a balance struck between the power of the State to prosecute and the position of an individual who stands accused. The principle of the common law is that the prosecution is to prove the guilt of an accused person. This was accepted as fundamental in X7. The principle is so fundamental that 'no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained' albeit its application may be affected by a statute expressed clearly or in words of necessary intendment. The privilege against self-incrimination may be lost, but the principle remains. The principle is an aspect of the accusatorial nature of a criminal trial in our system of criminal justice.""
(References omitted).

56The Court pointed out at [41], again referring to X7 (No 1), that an accused person may be prejudiced because he or she can no longer determine the course to take at trial according only to the strength of the prosecution case. It was emphasised at [43] that the appeal did not fall to be decided by whether ""practical unfairness"" was demonstrated, but rather the case was one concerning the very nature of a criminal trial and its requirements in our system of justice. The concluding sentence of that paragraph stated that the appellants' trial was altered in a fundamental respect by the prosecution having the appellants' evidence before the NSW Crime Commission.

57The Court stated at [44] that the prosecution should have alerted the trial judge to the situation so steps could be taken to ensure the trial was not affected. The Court said that the trial judge could have ordered a temporary stay while another prosecutor and other DPP personnel, not privy to the evidence, were engaged. The Court expressed this conclusion in the following terms:

""[46] In X7, it was held that the compulsory examination of a person with respect to an offence with which the person stands charged would be a departure, in a fundamental respect, from that principle. X7 was ultimately concerned with questions of statutory construction. Nevertheless, the point it makes about what may amount to a fundamental departure from a criminal trial as it is comprehended by our system of criminal justice is relevant to this case. It is a breach of the principle of the common law, and a departure in a fundamental respect from a criminal trial which the system of criminal justice requires an accused person to have, for the prosecution to be armed with the evidence of an accused person obtained under compulsion concerning matters the subject of the charges. It cannot be said that the appellants had a trial for which our system of criminal justice provides and which s 13(9) of the NSWCC Act sought to protect. Rather, their trial was one where the balance of power shifted to the prosecution.""

The parties' submissions

(a) X7

58In written submissions filed on behalf of X7, it was submitted that the interrogation was a contempt of court and an abuse of the accusatorial process. It was also said to be an interference with the exercise of Commonwealth judicial power. Ultimately, no constitutional issue was raised in the proceedings.

59It was submitted that the focus in Lee (2014) was not on a demonstration of practical unfairness but rather upon the ""transmogrification of the adversarial system of criminal justice"".

60It was submitted that the primary judge erred by requiring that actual prejudice be demonstrated before a stay be ordered. The submissions referred to Moti v The Queen [2011] HCA 50; (2011) 245 CLR 456 (Moti v The Queen) as an example of a case where a stay was granted for an abuse of process despite the trial being otherwise fair. It was submitted that the examination after charge must entail some legal consequences, which can only be expressed as a termination of the prosecution.

61In the written submissions, it was put that it was not possible to reconcile an open accusatorial system of criminal justice with a situation where accused persons are placed in a position where they are left with a mere assurance from the executive government that the trial is not unfair. This submission, which seemed to be based on the proposition that it would not be possible to ascertain whether derivative use had been made of any evidence obtained during the investigation, ignored the finding by the primary judge that there was no evidence of dissemination of any of the relevant material to investigating or prosecuting authorities. This was accepted by senior counsel for X7 at the hearing, who put his client's case on a more fundamental basis.

62The submissions at the hearing focused on the authorities to which I have referred in pars [11]-[57] above. Senior counsel for X7 based his argument essentially on the following propositions. First, X7 (No 1) concluded that there was no power to examine X7 after he was charged. Second, the examination was a contempt of court resulting in a fundamental alteration of the accusatorial judicial process. Third, there was nothing which could be done by the trial judge to remedy what had taken place. In these circumstances, it was submitted that the only option available to the Court was to permanently stay the proceedings.

63Senior counsel for X7 submitted that it was erroneous to regard the possibility of a fair trial as the only or governing criterion. He submitted that what is required is a trial according to law.

64In his opening submissions, senior counsel for X7 emphasised that the trial judge could do nothing about the fact that the examination had occurred and that it should not be the case that an applicant for a stay has to provide actual rather than assumed examples of prejudice.

65Senior counsel for X7 submitted that consequent on the decision in X7 (No 1), it was not possible to entertain argument that Hammond contains nothing binding on this Court by way of rules or principle. He repeated the submission that at the heart of the matter was the necessity for the trial to be a trial according to law. He pointed to Moti v The Queen as an example of where a stay was granted, not because of unfairness in the process, but to vindicate lawfulness in such process.

66Senior counsel for X7 submitted that the Court in Lee (2014) ordered a retrial rather than a permanent stay as there was no stay application ""live"" in that matter. He submitted that the order for a retrial put the process of criminal justice back in motion, including the right of the prosecutor to file a nolle prosequi or the applicant to apply for a stay.

67Senior counsel for X7 submitted that Lee (2014) supported his propositions, notwithstanding the remarks at [46] of the judgment to the effect that it was a fundamental departure from a criminal trial, as comprehended by our system of justice, for the prosecutor to be armed with evidence of an accused (see par [57] above). He submitted that although that was the particular factual situation which confronted the Court in Lee (2014), the Court's approval of X7 (No 1) indicated acceptance that the fundamental departure lay in the questioning, rather than in the disclosure. He submitted that that was made clear from the passages in X7 (No 1), specifically cited in Lee (2014), particularly at [124] of X7 (No 1) referred to in par [22] above. He also submitted that what was said at [32] of the judgment in Lee (2014) was to similar effect. 

68Senior counsel for X7 noted that in Lee (2014) the Court stated at [41] that an accused person may be prejudiced because he or she can no longer determine the course to take at trial according to the strength of the prosecution case, citing [124] and [136] of X7 (No 1) (see par [22] above). He submitted that the decision of the trial judge in the present case was based on ""unfairness"", contrary to what was said by the Court in Lee (2014) at [43].

69Senior counsel for X7 also submitted that the reference to a temporary stay at [44] of Lee (2014) did not undermine his argument. He submitted that that passage had to be read in conjunction with what was said at [45] of the judgment, which pointed out that the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in that case was delivered before the decision in X7 (No 1) was handed down. It was not made entirely clear how this fact influenced what was said by the Court at [44].

70Senior counsel for X7 accepted that the concern of the dissenting judges at [53] and [54] in X7 (No 1), to which I have referred in pars [27] and [28] above, focused on disclosure. However, he submitted that the judgment of Hayne and Bell JJ made it clear that the fundamental departure from the requirement of a fair trial according to law is the questioning rather than the disclosure. He referred to the emphasis of this point at [85] of X7 (No 1), which was cited with approval in Lee (2014) at [46], fn 31.

71In that context, senior counsel asked rhetorically, how could it be said that, notwithstanding what was said at [44] of Lee (2014), something which is not a trial according to law can be something which in the administration of justice is allowed to proceed. He submitted it was time for a court to say that a contempt of this nature is not of a kind which can be purged so as to bring about the practical equivalent at trial of the secrecy that the High Court was at pains in X7 (No 1) to say was not to the point. He emphasised what was said at [124] in X7 (No 1) and at [136] of that judgment concerning Hammond.

72Senior counsel for X7 submitted that the distinguishing feature in Lee (2013) was that it involved the exercise of discretion by a judicial officer and was thus no authority on any issue in the present proceedings. He accepted his submission was contrary to what was said by Gageler and Keane JJ at [323] and [324] of their judgment in Lee (2013). However, he stated those passages were contrary to what was said in X7 (No 1) and did not form part of the ratio in Lee (2013). He submitted taking practical injustice as the criterion on which a stay should be granted was contrary to what was said at [43] of Lee (2014).

73Senior counsel for X7 further submitted that what was said by Gageler and Keane JJ at [323] and [324] of their judgment in Lee (2013), was contrary to what was said by French CJ in that case at [54] (see par [38] above). He also submitted that it was not supported by what was said by Crennan J in her judgment.

74So far as Hammond was concerned, senior counsel for X7 referred to that part of the judgment of Gibbs CJ to which I have referred in par [15]. He also emphasised that the Chief Justice in that case said that the fact of questioning would give rise to a real risk of interference with the administration of justice. He referred to the remarks of Deane J to which I have also referred, submitting that if what occurred was injustice and would result in a trial differing in the fundamental respect from what was required, it must produce an entitlement to a stay.

75Senior counsel accepted his submissions were contrary to a recent decision of this Court in R v X [2014] NSWCCA 168 (R v X), but submitted that case was wrongly decided. 

(b) The Crown

76The Crown emphasised that the power to stay criminal proceedings is reserved for the most exceptional circumstances. It was submitted that actual prejudice going to the root of the trial must be shown before a stay will be granted. It was submitted that X7 (No 1) is not authority for the proposition that the fact of an examination grounds a permanent stay of the charges. 

77The Crown submitted that in reaching its conclusion concerning the correct construction of the ACC Act in X7 (No 1), the majority reasoning was confined to the question of construction and drew no conclusion about the actual effect of the unlawful questioning by the ACC.

78The Crown referred to the fact that in Lee (2014) at [3] the Court noted that the majority in X7 (No 1) did not consider the protective purposes of s 25A(9) of the ACC Act, but that this provision was of some significance to the reasoning of the dissentients, in that the legislation provided for a direction regarding non-publication in order to safeguard a person's right to a fair trial. The Crown emphasised that in Lee (2014) the Court ordered a retrial, not an acquittal or a permanent stay. It was submitted that Lee (2014) suggested the appropriate order was not a permanent stay but rather a temporary stay, whilst quarantined prosecution personnel are engaged, or where a trial has been infected by unlawful dissemination, a retrial conducted by quarantined personnel.

79The Crown submitted that this approach was consistent with the decisions of this Court in R v CB; MP v R [2011] NSWCCA 264 (R v CB) and R v Seller [2013] NSWCCA 42; (2013) 273 FLR 155 (R v Seller). In respect of the former, the High Court, on a special leave application, stated that the basis of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal was not affected by the subsequent decision in X7 (No 1). In respect of the latter case, special leave was refused, the refusal of leave taking place subsequent to the decision in X7 (No 1).

80The Crown submitted that Hammond did not determine that it would be appropriate to permanently stay the proceedings. However, it must be remembered that in that case Mr Hammond had declined to answer any questions. 

81The Crown also submitted that at [323]-[324] of the judgment of Gageler and Keane JJ in Lee (2013), their Honours made it clear that they did not regard a pre-trial examination of an accused as resulting in a necessary deprivation of legitimate forensic choice to the accused.

82Counsel for the Crown pointed out that in X7 (No 1) Hayne and Bell JJ stated at [93] that their decision did not depend on classifying the trial as an unfair trial. He submitted that the majority's decision did not contradict the proposition in earlier authorities that actual prejudice, going to the root of the proceedings, that cannot be ameliorated by the trial judge, must be demonstrated in order to obtain a permanent stay. He submitted that X7 (No 1) did not bind this Court in determining whether or not a stay should be granted.

Consideration

83None of the cases to which I referred above considered the question of whether, and in what circumstances, a permanent stay should be granted if examination of a charged person, unauthorised by statute, took place, or the content of an authorised examination had been transmitted to prosecuting authorities contrary to a direction designed to protect the accused person against derivative use of the answers and other material obtained as a result of the examination. It is necessary to consider this question both having regard to what was decided in the cases referred to above and the principles surrounding the grant of a stay in criminal proceedings.

84In Barton, which concerned an application for a stay of proceedings commenced by ex officio indictment, Gibbs ACJ and Mason J stated at [95] that in exercising its power to prevent an abuse of process, the Court will on rare occasions be required to consider whether a prosecution should be permitted to continue. They stated at [96] that there was ample authority for the proposition that the courts possess all necessary powers to prevent an abuse of process and to ensure a fair trial.

85In Jago, Mason CJ at 30 referred with approval to what was said, by Richardson J in Moevao v Department of Labour [1980] 1 NZLR 464 at 482, to be the rationale for the exercise of the power to stay a prosecution:

""The justification for staying a prosecution is that the Court is obliged to take that extreme step in order to protect its own processes from abuse. It does so in order to prevent the criminal processes from being used for purposes alien to the administration of criminal justice under law. It may intervene in this way if it concludes from the conduct of the prosecutor ... that the Court processes are being employed for ulterior purposes or in such a way ... as to cause improper vexation and oppression. The yardstick is not simply fairness to the particular accused. It is not whether the initiation and continuation of the particular process seems in the circumstances to be unfair to him. That may be an important consideration. But the focus is on the misuse of the Court process by those responsible for law enforcement. It is whether the continuation of the prosecution is inconsistent with the recognized purposes of the administration of criminal justice and so constitutes an abuse of the process of the Court.""

86Mason CJ emphasised at 30-31 that the public interest in holding a trial does not warrant the holding of an unfair trial. However, he stated the power to stay proceedings will be exercised only in an extreme circumstance. He stated at 34, referring to what was said by Wilson J in Barton at 111, that to justify a permanent stay in criminal proceedings there must be a fundamental defect, which goes to the root of the trial and is of such a nature that there is nothing that the trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial to relieve against its unfair consequences: see also Brennan J at 47-48 and Gaudron J at 75.

87In The Queen v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 605 Mason CJ and Toohey J repeated the statement made by Mason CJ in Jago at 34. This statement, made in the context of an application for a stay based on adverse pre-trial publicity, was said by the High Court in Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20; (2010) 241 CLR 237 (Dupas v The Queen) at [18] to be an authoritative statement of principle. 

88In Dupas v The Queen the Court stated at [35] that describing a case as extreme or singular recognises the rarity of the situation in which the unfair consequences cannot be relieved against by the trial judge during the course of the trial. The Court stated the question to be asked is not whether the case can be described as extreme, but rather, whether the apprehended defect is of such a nature that nothing a trial judge can do will relieve against its unfair consequences.

89In Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34; (1992) 174 CLR 509 at 520 Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ identified two fundamental policy considerations affecting abuse of process in criminal proceedings:

""The first is that the public interest in the administration of justice requires that the court protect its ability to function as a court of law by ensuring that its processes are used fairly by State and citizen alike. The second is that, unless the court protects its ability so to function in that way, its failure will lead to an erosion of public confidence by reason of concern that the court's processes may lend themselves to oppression and injustice.""

See also Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27; (2006) 226 CLR 256 at [8].

90In Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77; (1993) 177 CLR 378 (Walton v Gardiner) the majority at 392 approved the statement by Gleeson CJ and Kirby P in the Court of Appeal; namely, that the Court had power to stay proceedings if satisfied the proceedings would be unfairly and unjustifiably oppressive so as to constitute an abuse of process. They also approved the statement of Mahoney JA that the question was whether, in all the circumstances, the continuation of the proceedings would involve unacceptable injustice or unfairness: see also R v Edwards [2009] HCA 20; (2009) 83 ALJR 717 (R v Edwards) at [22]-[23].

91These authorities demonstrate three matters. First, the power to grant a permanent stay is one that rarely will be exercised. That is unsurprising as in criminal proceedings there are significant countervailing considerations, namely, the interests of the community and the victims of crime in the enforcement of the criminal law: see, for example, Jago at 54 per Brennan J. 

92Second, a stay will be ordered where there is a fundamental defect of such a nature that there is nothing a judge can do in the conduct of the trial to relieve against its unfair consequences. Implicit in that proposition is that it is necessary to identify both the fundamental defect and the unfair consequences. In that context, it is important to bear in mind that in considering what was said in Walton v Gardiner, the Court in R v Edwards emphasised at [22]-[23] the use of the words ""would"" be unfairly or unjustifiably oppressive as distinct from ""could"" be unfairly or unjustifiably oppressive. In each of the cases to which I have referred, the nature of the prejudice was identified to be either that there was delay in the bringing of the proceedings, adverse pre-trial publicity or the proceedings were brought for an improper purpose. That is not to say the categories where such a stay is granted are closed, but merely that in each case particular prejudice to the applicant for a stay was sought to be demonstrated.

93Third, irrespective of whether or not unfairness is demonstrated, a stay may be granted if the proceedings in question are an abuse of process in the sense that the use of the court proceedings brings the administration of justice into disrepute: Rogers v The Queen [1994] HCA 42; (1994) 181 CLR 251 at 286 and Moti v The Queen at [10].

94In three cases this Court has declined to order a stay in circumstances somewhat similar to the present. The first was R v CB. CB had been examined under the provision of the ACC Act after being charged. The Court concluded at [108], following the judgment of the majority of the Full Federal Court in Australian Crime Commission v OK [2010] FCAFC 61; (2010) 185 FCR 258 (OK), that the ACC Act permitted an examination to continue on a matter the subject of a pending criminal charge so long as the protective provisions in s 25A were invoked. That conclusion was incorrect having regard to the decision in X7 (No 1).

95The Court declined to grant a stay. In that context McClellan CJ at CL, with whom Buddin and Johnson JJ agreed, made the following comments at [128]:

""[128] Although I accept that questions were asked of the appellant during his examination relating to matters relevant to the charges, accepting as I do that the majority decision in OK should be followed, provided the information obtained was effectively protected as the Commission acknowledged it should be, the mere fact that an examination has occurred could not justify a permanent stay. Even if, and the evidence does not establish this fact, it was the case that questions were asked which required the appellant to disclose his defence, this would not of itself have the consequence that the appellant would be denied 'a fair trial'. Only if it can be shown that either the relevant information has been, or there was a real risk that it would be communicated to the prosecution, could it be concluded that the exceptional step of granting a permanent stay should be taken.""

96Care must be taken with this conclusion having regard to the reliance on OK. However, as I indicated, a special leave application subsequent to X7 (No 1) was refused. French CJ, who heard the special leave application with two other justices, made the following remarks in dismissing the application:

""This application turns upon the question whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in quashing the decision of the trial judge to grant a permanent stay of criminal proceedings pending against the applicant. The basis of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal was not affected by the subsequent decision of this Court in X7 v Australian Crime Commission & Anor [2013] HCA 29. No question warranting the reopening of the application for special leave is disclosed. The application to reopen the application for special leave is dismissed.""

97These remarks do not constitute any precedent binding on this Court: Attorney General for the Commonwealth v Finch (No 2) [1984] HCA 40; (1984) 155 CLR 107 at 115 and North Ganalanja Aboriginal Corporation v The State of Queensland [1996] HCA 2; (1996) 185 CLR 595 at 643. However, they provide ""guidance"" to this Court, Bird v Colonial Spark Plugs Proprietary Limited [1942] HCA 11; (1942) 66 CLR 43 at 47, amounting to ""dicta"", Ex parte Zietsch; Re Craig (1944) 44 SR (NSW) 360 at 368, and which has persuasive value: Sir Anthony Mason, ""The Use and Abuse of Precedent"" (1988) 4 Aus Bar Rev 93 at 97 and Algama v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1884; (2001) 115 FCR 253 at [62]. At the very least, it indicates that the issue presently before this Court is not concluded by X7 (No 1).

98R v Seller was a case where the examination took place before the charges were laid, the charges being laid after dissemination of material the subject of the examination to prosecuting authorities. The decision is not in those circumstances of direct relevance to this case. However, a stay was refused because, as stated at [114]-[115], the material had not been disseminated to the particular people responsible for the prosecution, the situation which obtains in the present case. Once again special leave to appeal was refused.

99R v X was decided following the decision in X7 (No 1), Lee (2013) and Lee (2014). That case involved an examination under the ACC Act after charges had been laid against the respondent. A direction under s 25A(9) of the ACC Act had been given, preventing dissemination to investigators and prosecutors. The trial judge had determined the criminal proceedings should be stayed. Hidden J, with whom Simpson and Hamill JJ agreed, recognised at [53] that X7 (No 1) constituted binding authority for the proposition that the examination was unlawful.

100Hidden J referred to the dissenting judgment of Hayne J in Lee (2013) at [80], that it was theoretically possible that at the end of a trial it may be said that the deprivation of those choices (to test the prosecution case) was anodyne in effect. Hidden J stated that that passage recognised that where an examination has occurred, its effect on a trial will depend on the circumstances of the case in question. He concluded at [57] that the effect on the trial could be assessed and measures could be considered to guard against any prejudice which would otherwise occur. In these circumstances he quashed the order imposing the stay but remitted the matter for further examination of the question, whether unauthorised access to material had been obtained and whether any prejudice which had resulted could be guarded against at a trial.

101In R v X, Hidden J noted that consideration of both issues in the District Court had been complicated by the fact that, while the judge and the respondent's legal representatives had access to the transcript of the examination, the Crown prosecutor did not. The Court sought to remedy this situation by recommending that at the re-hearing the Crown be represented by counsel and solicitors other than those conducting the trial.

102Zhao and Jin v The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2014] VSCA 137 (Zhao and Jin) involved an application to restrain forfeiture proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth), brought against the appellants, pending determination of criminal charges against the second appellant. The Court granted the stay. The Court stated it was bound by Lee (2014) and said that that case was authority for the following propositions:

""[53] ... Although it was concerned with compulsory examination, and so in a sense only with a situation where the privilege against self-incrimination is expressly abrogated by statute, logically the High Court's reasoning in Lee No 2 appears to dictate that: 

a) the privilege against self-incrimination consists as much of the right of an accused to require the Crown to prove its case without the accused's assistance as it does of the accused's right to refuse to answer incriminating questions; 

b) as a constituent of the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to require the Crown to prove its case without the accused's assistance, like the right to refuse to answer incriminating questions, may only be abrogated by statute; and 

c) perforce of the principle of legality, as a constituent of the privilege against self-incrimination the right to require the Crown to prove its case without the assistance of the accused may only be abrogated by express statutory terms or clear necessary statutory implication. 

[54] The failure of the non-publication order to quarantine evidence given by Lee from persons involved in the prosecution of the charges against him reinforced the importance of these principles. We do not consider the principles stated to be at odds with the majority's reasoning in Lee No 1, including the reasoning of Gageler and Keane JJ, because all of the members of the Court in Lee No 1 viewed the privilege against self-incrimination as incorporating the right of an accused to require the Crown to prove its case without the assistance of the accused or saw the 'right to silence', while neither singular nor immutable, as including the right of any person who believes that he or she is suspected of a criminal offence to remain silent when questioned by any person in authority about the occurrence of an offence, and attached some significance to the principle of legality. The emphasis placed by Gageler and Keane JJ on the apparent availability of ancillary measures under the control of the Court to avoid an interference with the administration of justice meant that, when the failure of those measures was revealed in Lee No 2, the principles to which they had subscribed mandated the result. Moreover, given that Lee No 2 is the latest decision of the High Court in point, and a unanimous decision of five members of the Court including French CJ, Crennan and Keane JJ, we consider that we are bound to follow and apply it as best we can.""
(References omitted).

103In the result, the Court concluded that it was bound to do what it could to protect the accused's right to require the Crown to prove its case against the second appellant. It stated at [58] that the only way in which that could be done was to stay the forfeiture proceedings pending the determination of the criminal proceedings. This did not involve a permanent stay.

104The High Court has granted special leave to appeal from this judgment.

105X7 (No 1) in my opinion is authority for the following propositions. First, as a matter of construction the ACC Act did not permit an examination of a charged person about the matters for which they had been charged. This was because such an examination fundamentally altered the accusatorial judicial process. The accused could no longer decide the course to adopt according only to the strength of the prosecution's case, but rather also in light of any self-incriminating answer he or she had been compelled to give at the examination. Second, such an examination constituted a contempt of court. Third, the conclusion did not depend on the fairness or otherwise of the trial, as what was required was a trial according to law.

106The Court in X7 (No 1) did not consider what consequences for the criminal proceedings arose from their conclusion. That is not surprising as the only issue before the Court was the separate questions referred to it by Gummow J. However, Hayne and Bell JJ emphasised that their conclusion did not depend on stated or unstated assumptions of how a balance should be struck between individuals' rights, privileges and immunities and societal demands for the detection and punishment of crime. Those questions, however, are relevant in considering whether it is appropriate to grant a permanent stay: Jago at 54, Dupas v The Queen at [37] and Moti v The Queen at [11].

107The propositions for which X7 (No 1) is authority were reaffirmed in Lee (2014). I do not regard the fact that a retrial was ordered as indicating that the Court considered that a permanent stay was inappropriate. However, two matters should be noted. First, the Court contemplated at [44] that the position could be remedied by a temporary stay. Second, the Court emphasised at [51] that the appeal concerned the effect of the prosecution being armed with the appellants' evidence, stating this affected the criminal trial in a fundamental respect, because it altered the position of the prosecution vis-Ã -vis the accused. It should be noted, however, that it was not suggested in that case that the examination was not authorised by the relevant statute. The complaint related to dissemination.

108In considering the question of a stay I do not think that the reasoning of the majority in Lee (2013) can be ignored. Gageler and Keane JJ at [323] stated that the deprivation of a legitimate forensic choice available to a person may be one of the ways that unfairness amounting to an interference with the due course of justice could arise in a particular case. The reference to a particular case in my opinion is not inconsistent with the views expressed by the other members of the majority in Lee (2013) or what was said in X7 (No 1). Rather, it emphasises the fact that the conduct of the examination may have different consequences depending on its nature and extent in any given case.

109In these circumstances, it does not seem to me that either the decision in X7 (No 1) or in Lee (2014) compels the conclusion that the fact of an unauthorised examination, on its own, requires an order that there be a permanent stay of criminal proceedings relating to the matters the subject of the examination. To grant a stay in such a case would be to grant one without regard to the nature and extent of the unfairness which results. It would also fail to take into account the interests of the community in the prosecution of serious criminal offences.

110If in fact the examination was productive of actual unfairness, it seems to me the person affected would be able to establish that fact without suffering further unfairness or injustice. In the present case an application could be made under s 25A(10) of the ACC Act to vary the direction previously made, so that the content of the examination could be released to a judge hearing the application for a stay, to enable it to be determined if there was any actual unfairness in the particular case. This was the course adopted in R v Seller at [35] and R v X at [7].

111In reaching the conclusion that a permanent stay should not be granted, I am conscious that what occurred was a contempt of court which cannot be purged. However, there is nothing to suggest that the examination was not conducted by the ACC in the bona fide belief that it was authorised by the ACC Act. In these circumstances it does not seem to me that the continuation of the criminal proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute or that a stay was necessary to protect the court process from abuse.

112In the result, I would make the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

113BEAZLEY P: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the detailed reasons of the Chief Justice. 

114I agree with his Honour's reasons and the orders he proposes. As his Honour has explained, a permanent stay will only be granted in ""an extreme case"" and only in circumstances where it has been established that there is a fundamental defect of such a nature that the trial judge, in the conduct of the trial, cannot relieve against its unfair consequences: The Queen v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; 173 CLR 592; Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20; 241 CLR 237; and Moti v The Queen [2011] HCA 50; 245 CLR 456. These authorities make it clear that it is the consequences of the defect which dictates whether or not a permanent stay will be granted. 

115In the present case, it is known that the applicant answered questions put to him by officers of the Australian Crime Commission on the first day that he attended, in response to a compulsory process to attend and to give evidence. However, the Court is unaware of the extent or nature of the questions asked or the answers given on that occasion. The questions may have been directed to no more than X7's identity and background, which may have nothing to do with the crime in respect of which he is to be tried, or as Hayne J observed in Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 87 ALJR 1082, at [80], the information provided, so far as its impact on his criminal trial is concerned, may be anodyne in effect. The result is that this Court is left in the position that it is unable to determine whether a judge, in the conduct of the trial, would be able relieve against the unfair consequences (if any) flowing from the compulsory examination of the applicant. It follows that the applicant has not made out a case for the relief he seeks by way of a permanent stay.

116HIDDEN J: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

117FULLERTON J: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

118R A HULME J: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

2765448,Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270,"Judgment

1THE COURT: On a joint indictment presented on 23 February 2011, Lachlan Wilson, DS, Ibrahim Jidah, Yousef Jidah (the appellant) and Ryan Kapral were charged with a range of what might be described broadly as drug offences. ES, another person also involved in the alleged offences pleaded guilty.

2The charges against the appellant alleged contraventions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (the DMT Act). The charges were as follows:

""Count 8

Between about 13 August 2008 and 14 August 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did supply a prohibited drug, namely pseudoephedrine, being not less than the commercial quantity and not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to pseudoephedrine.

Contrary to s.25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (NSW)

Count 9

Between about 12 August 2008 and 14 August 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did attempt to possess a precursor, namely pseudoephedrine, intended for use in the manufacture or production by Yousef JIDAH or another person, of a prohibited drug.

Contrary to s.24A(1) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act (NSW).""

3Following a trial before Judge Frearson SC and a jury, the appellant was convicted on both counts. On Count 8 (the supply count) he was sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of eight years and nine months with an additional term of four years and three months. On Count 9 (the possession count) he was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be served wholly concurrently with the sentence imposed on Count 8. 

4The appellant has appealed against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the supply count.

5Lachlan Wilson, Ibrahim Jidah and DS were convicted by the jury of various offences relating to the same drugs as those the subject of the charges against the appellant. They also appeal against their convictions and seek leave to appeal against sentence. ES entered pleas of guilty to charges also involving the same drugs. He seeks leave to appeal against his sentence.

6All appeals and applications for leave to appeal against sentence were heard at the same time with the exception of the sentence appeal of ES.

The relevant legislation
7Section 25(2) of the DMT Act provides as follows:

""25(2) A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.""

8""Supply"" is defined in s 3 of the DMT Act in the following terms:

""supply includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things.""

9""Prohibited drug"" is defined in s 3 of the DMT Act as any substance other than a prohibited plant specified in Sch 1. Pseudoephedrine is specified in Sch 1. A large commercial quantity of that drug is 5.0 kg.

10Section 33(3) of the DMT Act provides that the maximum penalty for s 25(2), where the offence involved not less than the large commercial quantity, is life imprisonment, a fine of 5,000 penalty units or both. The standard non-parole period is 15 years imprisonment.

11Section 24A of the DMT Act so far as relevant provides as follows:

""24A(1) A person who has possession of: 

(a) a precursor, or

(b) a drug manufacture apparatus,

intended by the person for use in the manufacture or production, by that person or another person, of a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.

...

(3) In this section: 

drug manufacture apparatus means an apparatus specified or described in the regulations as a drug manufacture apparatus for the purposes of this section.

precursor means a substance specified or described in the regulations as a precursor for the purposes of this section.""

12Pseudoephedrine is specified in Sch 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Regulation 2011 (NSW) (the DMT Regulations) as a precursor for the purpose of section 24A of the DMT Act.

13Section 33AB of the DMT Act provides that the maximum penalty for an offence under s 24A is a fine of 2,000 penalty units or imprisonment for 10 years or both.

Factual background 
14The facts relating to the charges against the appellant are set out in our judgment in the appeal of Lachlan Wilson (Lachlan Wilson v R [2014] NSWCCA 266 at [13]-[114]), particularly at [75]-[99] and it is not necessary to repeat them.

The conviction appeal
15The appellant appealed against his conviction on the sole ground that the trial miscarried because he was charged with inconsistent verdicts. However, during the course of the hearing of the appeal the appellant was granted leave to amend this ground of appeal in the following terms:

""On the facts of this case the conviction of the appellant on both Count 8 and 9 has led to a miscarriage of justice because the elements of Count 8 are contained in the elements of Count 9.""

16The relief sought was that the conviction under Count 8 or Count 9 be quashed.

The submissions
17The appellant submitted that it was impermissible to leave both counts to the jury. He referred to the statement by the prosecutor at the sentencing proceedings that both counts had been laid in case there was a ""Carey type"" defence. That was a reference to a decision of this Court, R v Carey (1990) 20 NSWLR 292, which held at 297 that ""supply"" within the meaning of the extended definition of ""supply"" in the DMT Act did not include the transfer of drugs to a person who the accused reasonably believed to be the owner.

18The appellant submitted the Carey defence was not raised at the trial as it was no part of his case that he believed that there were drugs in the boxes which he was involved in transporting, unpacking and resealing.

19The appellant accepted that each of the counts had different elements as well as common elements. He submitted the most significant difference was that the supply count had an element relating to the quantity of the drugs whilst the attempt possession count did not and that the two counts characterised the substances differently in that the supply count concerned pseudoephedrine specified in Sch 1 of the DMT Act as a prohibited drug and the possession count concerned that substance as a precursor in Schedule 1 of the DMT Regulations.

20The appellant noted that at the trial it was submitted that for the purpose of s 25(2) and s 24A of the DMT Act a substance could not be characterised simultaneously as a prohibited drug and a precursor. He accepted as a matter of definition the substance could be both but submitted that its characterisation depended on the intention of the person attempting to obtain possession under s 25(2), namely for the purposes of supply or the person in possession under s 24A intending that it be used for the purposes of manufacture of a prohibited drug. He submitted that, if the intention was manufacture, then it was a precursor but, if not, assuming the other elements are made out, it is a prohibited drug. He submitted it could not be both simultaneously.

21In his written submissions the appellant also submitted that the conviction on Count 8 should be quashed and the appellant resentenced on Count 9. As we have indicated earlier, at the hearing it was submitted that either Count 8 or Count 9 be quashed.

22Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that having regard to the extended definition of ""supply"" relied upon by the Crown as constituting the supply in this case, being an attempt to obtain possession for supply because of the substitution of an inert substance, all of the elements of the supply count were contained within the attempt possession count. He submitted that the Crown case for the possession count, under s 24A of the DMT Act, was that there was an attempt to obtain possession for the purpose of supplying to another for the purpose of manufacture. (That offence was also charged as an attempt because of the substitution.) He submitted that in that scenario all the elements of the supply count were contained within the s 24A offence.

23Senior counsel for the appellant pointed to the fact that in both his opening address and in the sentencing proceedings, the Crown Prosecutor made it clear that the Crown's case was not that the appellant or his brother were intending to take any steps themselves in the manufacture of a prohibited drug by their attempt to obtain possession of what they believed was in the 45 boxes, rather that they intended that at some unspecified place and time it would be manufactured by a person or people unknown.

24He also submitted that it could not make a difference that the supply count under s 25(2) of the DMT Act related to a prohibited drug and the possession count under s 24A related to a precursor as pseudoephedrine fell within both categories. He also submitted that the requirement of proof of a large commercial quantity for the supply count was irrelevant as there was no quantity specified for a breach of s 24A.

25Senior counsel for the appellant acknowledged that no application for a stay of either count had been sought at the trial, although the question of unfairness, by inclusion of both counts on the indictment, was raised by trial counsel and rejected by the trial judge. On the appeal, counsel accepted it would have been open to the Crown to bring the counts in the alternative but submitted, relying on what was said by this Court in Nahlous v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 58; (2010) 77 NSWLR 463, that it was inappropriate to invite a conviction for two offences which involved the same criminality. He also referred to the decision of the Western Australian Court of Appeal in Blay v The Queen [2006] WASCA 248; (2006) 205 FLR 414 at [6] where McClure JA in somewhat similar circumstances expressed reservations about there being two convictions arising from the same set of facts.

26Senior counsel for the appellant sought to distinguish the case from the decision of this Court in Standen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2011] NSWCCA 187; (2011) 218 A Crim R 28. He submitted that in that case there was a real doubt whether the proposed import was a prohibited drug or simply a precursor and that in those circumstances it was appropriate to lay the charges the subject of the indictment. He submitted that that was not this case.

27The other appellants, whose appeal was heard at the same time as this appeal, relied upon the same submission. However, on the question for relief, senior counsel for Lachlan Wilson submitted, without elaboration, that the inclusion of two counts in the indictment, in circumstances such as the present, led to the indictment being bad and as a consequence any conviction obtained as a result should be quashed.

28The Crown said that no submission was made at the trial in the terms of that made in this Court. It submitted that the argument raised below was that the two counts arose from the same acts and ""a plea in bar"" would be available ""from one to the other"". In these circumstances the Crown contended that leave was required under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) to rely on this ground.

29The Crown pointed to the fact that the offences contained different elements. It submitted s 24A of the DMT Act required proof of a specific intent that the precursor that was possessed (or in this case attempted to be possessed) would be used to manufacture a prohibited drug, but not proof of any act of supply for that purpose. The Crown also pointed out that s 24A involves proof that the substance possessed was a precursor, whilst s 25 involves proof that a prohibited drug was to be supplied and further that the s 24A offence does not involve proof of any particular quantity of the substance, unlike the s 25(2) offence which requires proof of supply of a large commercial quantity. In these circumstances it was submitted that a conviction on one of the counts would not entitle the appellant to a plea in bar on the other.

30The Crown accepted that the unavailability of a plea in bar did not preclude the Court's power to prevent an abuse of process. However, it was submitted that a stay of proceedings would only be granted in extreme circumstances. The Crown pointed out that, as in Standen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) supra, it was possible the jury might be satisfied of the elements of one count but not the other. The Crown pointed to the fact that the jury might be satisfied that the accused was in possession of a prohibited drug (or a precursor) but not satisfied he was aware of the quantity or, that in relation to the supply count, the accused might claim that he was a mere custodian relying on R v Carey supra. In these circumstances it was submitted there was no abuse of process to justify the grant of a stay.

31Counsel for the Crown submitted that the Crown case did not involve a specific allegation that the tablets were going to be used by a particular person to produce a prohibited drug and that the Crown's case did not preclude the possibility that the accused intended to pass the tablets on to some other person who might have had an intention to create a prohibited drug. In that context the Crown submitted that the appellant's submission that the Crown case was that the enterprise related to an intended manufacture of a prohibited drug using pseudoephedrine as a precursor and for that reason it was inappropriate to charge the supply count, was not made out.

32Counsel for the Crown submitted that the appellant's contention, that whether pseudoephedrine was to be characterised as a prohibited drug or precursor depended on the intention of the person in possession of it, was incorrect as it confused the physical element with the mental element of the offence. So much may be accepted, but it begs the question whether the counts in the present case were directed to the same criminality.

33Counsel for the Crown submitted that in relation to the possession count there is a remnant of criminality that is not in the supply count, namely, in the latter the jury did not have to be satisfied as to what was intended to be done with the substance.

Consideration
34The elements of the offence under s 25(2) of the DMT Act, applicable to this case, were that the appellant attempted to obtain possession of what he believed to be a prohibited drug, for the purposes of supply in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that drug. To establish the count, it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that the appellant attempted to take possession of the drug for the purposes of supply, knowing or believing that the substance in the 45 boxes was a prohibited drug of not less than a large commercial quantity.

35By contrast, the elements of the offence under s 24A of the DMT Act, as applicable to this case, were that the appellant attempted to possess a precursor, intending it to be used by another person in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. As we have observed, it was not contended by the Crown that the appellant intended to use the precursor for the manufacture of such a drug. The identity of that person (or those people) and where and when and how they were to be given access to the precursor was left open by the Crown.

36Thus, to establish the offence under s 24A of the DMT Act, the prosecution was required to prove that the appellant attempted to possess a substance he knew or believed to be a precursor with the intention of it being used by another person to manufacture a prohibited drug.

37The appellant accepted, correctly, that not all the elements of the possession count were subsumed in the supply count even in the circumstances of the present case. This was correct at least for the reason that any on-supply of the substance possessed (or attempted to be possessed) that may be comprehended under s 24A of the DMT Act had to be with the intention that it be used for the manufacture or production of a prohibited drug as distinct, for example, for the purposes of on-selling the precursors.

38Further, for the purpose of the supply count, it was unnecessary to prove that the drug in question was a precursor or that the appellant was aware or believed it was a precursor. It is sufficient if he knew or believed it was a prohibited drug.

39However, the appellant was not correct in submitting that all the elements of the supply count were subsumed in the possession count. First, for the possession count it was not necessary to prove the substance in question was a commercial quantity. Secondly, at least theoretically, the appellant could have been aware that the substance was a precursor but not a prohibited drug, perhaps because he was told it was not and believed that to be the case. It is true that this possibility would be highly unlikely where the drug was within both categories but nevertheless it does illustrate the different elements of the counts and, most critically, the different mental elements.

40In these circumstances a conviction or acquittal on one or the other of the counts would not give rise to a plea of autrefois convict or autrefois acquit. As was pointed out by the plurality in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [20], consideration of whether a conviction or acquittal would give rise to a plea in bar on another offence invites attention to what must be proved to establish the commission of each offence. That is, it invites attention to identifying those elements as distinct from what evidence might be called and what the witnesses would say (see also Gummow J at [63]).

41In R v Langdon and Langdon [2004] VSCA 205; (2004) 11 VR 18 the Victorian Court of Appeal considered the position in circumstances somewhat similar to this case. Relevantly, the appellants were convicted of trafficking a drug of dependence (amphetamine) and of being in possession of a drug of dependence (amphetamine). They were convicted on each count and appealed, one basis being that the possession charge was entirely subsumed in the trafficking charge. The Court of Appeal, following Pearce v The Queen supra, held that a plea in bar was not available (Gillard AJA at [46]-[50], Batt and Eames JJA agreeing).

42However, we accept that does not mean that the Court would not have the power to stay the charges if it were necessary to prevent an abuse of process (Pearce v The Queen supra at [29]). In Pearce v The Queen the appellant was charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and breaking and entering a dwelling house and inflicting grievous bodily harm. The Court held that prosecuting both those charges did not constitute an abuse of process. The plurality stated at [31] that, because the offences were different in important respects, the laying of both charges could not be said to be vexatious or oppressive. They stated that to hold otherwise would be to preclude the laying of charges that reflected the whole criminality of the accused and would require him or her to be sentenced only for the offence charged, excluding consideration of any part of the conduct that could have been charged separately.

43These remarks are apposite to the present case. We have indicated above the difference in the offences. Further, as was pointed out by the Crown in its submissions, there may have been a defence available to the supply count which was not available to the possession count under s 24A of the DMT Act. The fact that such a defence ultimately was not raised does not make the bringing of the two counts vexatious and oppressive.

44A similar conclusion was reached by the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Langdon and Langdon supra at [57]-[60].

45The same approach was adopted by this Court in Standen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) supra. In that case the appellant was indicted on three counts. The first count charged a conspiracy to import a substance intending to use any of it in the manufacture of a controlled drug and the second to knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug. An application that the second count be dismissed as an abuse of process was dismissed by the trial judge. His conclusion was upheld on appeal. Hodgson JA, who delivered the principal judgment of the Court, considered (at [23]) that there was a realistic possibility that the applicant knew the substance was a prohibited drug but not that it was a border controlled precursor. He also indicated that he was not satisfied that the whole of the relevant criminality would be captured by the first Count. In these circumstances he concluded that the bringing of both counts was not vexatious or oppressive.

46However, even if it is accepted that a plea in bar would not be available on the conviction or acquittal on one or other of the counts in the indictment and the inclusion of both counts on the indictment was not vexatious or oppressive, there remains the question whether, in the particular factual circumstances of the present case, the conviction and sentence on both counts exposed the appellant to double punishment, such that the conviction on one or the other of the counts should be quashed to avoid a miscarriage of justice.

47In Environment Protection Authority v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd (1992) 28 NSWLR 502, the question arose whether the respondent could be convicted of a charge under s 17D of the State Pollution Control Commission Act 1970 (NSW) having already been convicted of an offence under s 16 of the Clean Waters Act 1970 (NSW). The particulars of the offence relating to each charge were identical and the offences in substance were the same. The Court answered the question in the negative. Gleeson CJ, with whom Carruthers and Smart JJ agreed, dealt with the matter in the following terms at 510:

""There are two possible ways of looking at the matter, both of which lead to the same conclusion. One way is to say that, in the circumstances of the present case, the offence against s 16 of the Clean Waters Act is in substance the same as the offence against s 17D of the State Pollution Control Commission Act. Counsel for the Environment Protection Authority sought to answer this by the following argument. He observed that, to take the present case as an example, the breach by Australian Iron & Steel of s 17D could properly be regarded as more serious than the breach of s 16 because, although exactly the same acts or omissions gave rise to each offence, the former involved an abuse of a licence and, in a sense, of a breach of trust. I find the moral distinction somewhat elusive, but, even if it is valid, it does not assist the Environment Protection Authority. If the analysis be correct, it simply shows that, in a case such as the present, a contravention of s 17D is an aggravated form of a contravention of s 16. As R v Dodd illustrates, that falls squarely within the established scope of the rule against double jeopardy.

It was also submitted on behalf of the Environment Protection Authority that, since there are two different statutes and planning provisions involved, the Court has no choice but to obey the will of Parliament and give effect to both of them. The short answer to that submission is that the rule against double jeopardy, in its ordinary application, applies in relation to two or more statutory offences. Once again, R v Dodd was precisely such a case.""

48In R v Sessions [1998] 2 VR 304, the accused was convicted of one count of rape and one count of recklessly causing serious injury. The offence arose from an incident when the accused was changing the eight month old victim's nappy. He became annoyed with her crying and pushed his index finger into her vagina causing part of the intestine to be extracted through the vaginal opening. The prosecution had charged both offences to avoid the possibility that any sentence imposed could infringe the principle laid down in The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383. The trial judge sentenced on the basis that the rape was constituted by the insertion of the accused's finger into the vagina to the slightest extent and the offence of recklessly causing serious injury was constituted by the continued forceful penetration. The appellant sought leave to appeal against his conviction for recklessly causing serious injury and against his sentence for rape on the ground that, by being charged with two offences for the same act, he was exposed to double jeopardy in relation to conviction and punishment.

49The appeal was allowed. The Court held that the appellant should have been sentenced for rape on the basis that his sexual penetration of the child caused the damage which in fact occurred, but that the conviction for the lesser count should be quashed. Hayne JA (as his Honour then was) said this was for three reasons. First, if the basic principle is that a single act or omission should not give rise to multiple punishment, conviction should not be recorded on both counts. He emphasised that conviction itself was a form of punishment (referring to s 7 of the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic), the NSW equivalent is s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)). Second, he emphasised that the serious injury to the victim could be taken into account in the sentence for rape and that, in the circumstances, the charging of the separate offence resulted in an illusory and un-useful distinction. Third, his Honour pointed out that the charging of separate offences was not required as the same physical acts were relied upon and the evidence on each count would have been identical if the plaintiff had pleaded not guilty to either or both of the offences. In these circumstance, his Honour held the accused was punished twice for the one act and the conviction on the second count should be quashed.

50R v Sessions supra was a case, as in Environment Protection Authority v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd supra, where the whole of the criminality was encompassed in one charge.

51Although in Pearce v The Queen supra the Court concluded that a plea in bar could not arise and that the presentation of both charges was not vexatious or oppressive, the need to ensure that the offender was not doubly punished for the same act was emphasised. The Court pointed out at [40]-[49] that the problem would not necessarily be avoided by making the sentences concurrent. 

52In R v Langdon and Langdon supra Gillard AJ said the question of whether there was double punishment must be approached as a matter of common sense. He concluded at [97] that, in the circumstances of that case, the act of possession was common to both the trafficking and the possession counts and there was double punishment. He stated at [117] that as there was no remnant of criminal conduct in the possession count, which had not been taken into account in the trafficking count, the only course was to quash the conviction.

53In Nahlous v The Queen supra, it was held that it was an abuse of process to charge a person with a principal offence and also dealing with the proceeds of crime flowing from that offence, as the receipt of money was an element of the original offence. The Court made the following remarks at [17]:

""We appreciate that a person can by the one act commit two offences and, where the two offences address different aspects of the criminal conduct, there is nothing wrong with prosecuting the two offences or, subject to the principle of totality, with imposing separate sentences for the two offences. But in our view the receipt of the money as a result of the sale did not result in a separate act of criminality that warranted a separate charge and a separate penalty. We do not believe that there is anything in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 that conflicts with the view that we have taken as to the inappropriateness of the prosecution of the Code offence as well as the decoder offence (see particularly at 621[31]). We believe that in the circumstances of this case it was oppressive to charge the applicant with both the sale of the decoders and the receipt of the money as a result of the sale. That is because in our view the offence of sale encompassed the criminality of possessing the proceeds of the sale.""

54Nahlous v The Queen supra may be contrasted with the other cases to which we have referred, in that it concluded that the laying of the charge of dealing with the proceeds of crime was vexatious and oppressive, as distinct from merely quashing the conviction to avoid double punishment. This was no doubt due to the fact that the principal offence looked at in isolation carried a far lesser sentence than the offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime (see at [20]).

55It is not necessary to determine whether the approach in Nahlous v The Queen supra is consistent with the other authorities to which we have referred. What is clear is that, in each of the cases, the particular conviction was quashed because the whole of the criminality arising out of the charged acts was encompassed in the other offence (see Hinchcliffe v R [2010] NSWCCA 306 at [25]-[28]).

56In the present case, as in Standen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) supra, we do not think that the whole of the criminality for each offence is captured in the other. Whilst having regard to the evidence and the manner in which the case was conducted both offences may have involved an attempt to supply a prohibited drug, the s 24A offence does not capture the criminality involved in the supply of a large commercial quantity, for which the maximum penalty is life imprisonment, reflecting the seriousness with which Parliament regards that offence. Although there is more force in the proposition that the criminality involved in the offence under s 24A of the DMT Act is wholly captured by the supply offence under s 25(2), this ignores the fact that a separate element of the former offence (that the possession of the precursor was intended by the accused to be used in the manufacture or production by another person of a prohibited drug) is an element of criminality not encompassed in the s 25(2) offence.

57In these circumstances it is not appropriate to quash either conviction. It will of course be necessary in dealing with the appeal against the severity of the sentence to ensure that the appellant is not doubly punished for common elements of the offences.

58In the result the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

The sentence appeal
59The application for leave to appeal against sentence is limited to the sentence imposed on the supply count. For that offence a sentence of 13 years was imposed, comprised of a non-parole period of 8 years and 9 months and a balance of term of 4 years and 3 months against a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. 

60Four grounds of appeal are relied upon. They are expressed in largely identical terms to the grounds relied upon by the appellant's brother, Ibrahim Jidah, who was sentenced in the same proceedings to a sentence of 15 years and 9 months, comprised of a non-parole period of 10 years and 3 months and a balance of term of 5 years and 6 months. The grounds of appeal are as follows:

(1)His Honour failed to properly assess the objective seriousness of the supply count by failing to take into account the interrelated nature of that offence and the possession count. 

(2)His Honour erred by finding that the appellant knew that the size of the enterprise involved hundreds of kilograms of product. 

(3)His Honour erred by placing too much significance on the standard non-parole period.

(4)The appellant is left with a justifiable sense of grievance given the sentences that were passed on his co-offenders. 

The facts found for sentencing purposes
61His Honour found that the objective seriousness of the appellant's offending was within the mid-range but at the very bottom of that range. He concluded that, while his role was subordinate to others (including his brother) and he had no planning role, he did make himself available over a number of days; he was not a mere courier and his involvement could not be described as opportunistic by reason of him having a courier van, since it was a van of that kind which suggested the driving from place to place was for legitimate purposes. He made the following additional factual findings: 
(a)The appellant was recruited by his brother to supply the van used to transport the boxes five days before they were collected;

(b)He made follow up enquiries as to whether he was still required;

(c)He met with ES on 13 August 2008;

(d)He travelled in a convoy with his brother to collect the boxes from the auction house;

(e)With DS he physically loaded the boxes into the van;

(f)He transported the boxes towards Blacktown in a convoy with his brother following;

(g)He drove the van in a particular manner for the purpose of ascertaining if he would be followed;

(h)He offered to confront the people following him suspected of being police;

(i)He suggested that the boxes be taken somewhere for the purpose of inspecting them;

(j)He left his van with the boxes still on board at a shopping centre in Blacktown;

(k)Thereafter he met with ES and subsequently retrieved the van and drove the boxes to the warehouse on the night of 13 August;

(l)He engaged in a form of counter-surveillance by doing laps around the area which he reported to his brother; and

(m)He met his brother on 14 August and returned to the warehouse to collect the unpacked boxes with a view to transporting them to another location.

62His Honour accepted the submission advanced on the appellant's behalf on sentence, that there was no direct evidence that the appellant had been told that the drugs would be in 45 of the boxes loaded into his van and transported by him, nor that he was involved in repacking the boxes nor that he had seen or handled any unsealed boxes. For those reasons, his Honour accepted that the appellant should only be sentenced on the basis of what the evidence proved he did in dealing with the boxes and what he knew of their contents. In that respect, his Honour was satisfied that the appellant knew (or believed) he was engaged to carry ""some hundreds of kilos"" of prohibited drugs. 

The appellant's subjective circumstances 
63His Honour acknowledged the tender of what he described as a wealth of subjective material including a psychological assessment from Ms Danielle Hopkins. He noted the appellant's background and family history included that he has 2 older and 6 younger siblings and that he was subjected to harsh physical punishment as a child. He married in Lebanon at the age of 25 and was aged 33 at the time of sentence. He had, at that time, a daughter five years old and a son two years old. His daughter suffered severe burns in an accident with the result that he had been her full-time carer for a substantial period of time. His wife suffers from an adjustment disorder and a depressive illness following her husband's incarceration. This was confirmed in reports concerning her mental state tendered on sentence. 

64His Honour accepted that the personal references tendered on the appellant's behalf described him as an honest person.

65The appellant completed Year 12 but failed most subjects. He was bullied at school as a result of having a cleft palate. He completed a four-year course in spray-painting at TAFE. 

66His Honour concluded that, while there was no evidence of remorse, the appellant was unlikely to reoffend in the particular way for which he was convicted and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation.

Ground 1: His Honour failed to properly assess the objective seriousness of the supply count by failing to take into account the interrelated nature of that offence and the possession count 
67The first ground of appeal is, in a sense, related to the sole ground of appeal against conviction. His brother, Ibrahim Jidah, argued the same ground. The conviction appeals were dismissed (see pars [34]-[58] above and Ibrahim Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 269). 

68In the sentence proceedings, an issue arose as to how the supply count and the possession count should be treated for sentencing purposes. The appellant argued that given the way the case was prosecuted at trial, not only did the two offences have significantly overlapping elements, the trial judge was obliged when sentencing to find that the appellant was only ever in possession of the large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine (or what he believed was pseudoephedrine) for the purpose of supplying it to someone, for no reason other than to facilitate that person's manufacture of another prohibited drug (namely methamphetamine), and that he was not supplying the pseudoephedrine to the market, or to someone else who was intending to supply it to the market. 

69Viewed in this way, the appellant submitted that the proper characterisation of his criminality on the supply count was that he had done no more than to have taken a preparatory step in the process of manufacturing another prohibited drug and, for that reason, his criminality was no more than, perhaps even less than, the intended recipient(s) of the pseudoephedrine who intended to use it for that criminal purpose.

70On that analysis, the objective criminality constituted by the appellant's role as a supplier of pseudoephedrine (being a prohibited drug) was said to be significantly less than other offences under the DMT Act, involving the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug where the drug is intended to be marketed to end users. 

71The appellant submitted that his Honour had wrongly inflated the objective seriousness of his conduct on the supply count by ignoring the use to which the pseudoephedrine would ultimately be put.

72We are not persuaded his Honour erred by treating the fact that the pseudoephedrine (a prohibited drug for the purposes of the supply count) was ultimately to be used in the manufacture of another prohibited drug (the mental element specific to possession of the pseudoephedrine on the possession count) as diminishing the objective gravity of his offending as a supplier. Nor are we satisfied that the fact that there was, or might have been, a number of intervening steps before the pseudoephedrine was exploited for manufacturing purposes, had any significant bearing upon the objective gravity of the offending constituted by the supply count, or that it diminished the objective criminality of what this appellant did as a supplier of the drug to any significant degree. 

73As the Crown emphasised in its submission in this Court, it has always accepted that there was no evidence any particular person, including this appellant or his brother, had the means to manufacture an illegal substance for which the pseudoephedrine was to be used as a precursor. Moreover, the evidence in the Crown case did not permit any finding as to what was to happen to the pseudoephedrine at the point of delivery. Although it was conceivable that ES had the means to convert the pseudoephedrine into a huge quantity of methamphetamine to be supplied for wholesale purposes, it was equally open to find that ES was simply another link in the chain of supply, and that he intended that the pseudoephedrine would be sold or supplied at a wholesale level to others who would supply it to one or more manufacturers. 

74In our view, it would have been an error for the trial judge in sentencing to have treated the appellant's criminality as a supplier of the pseudoephedrine (being a prohibited drug) for the purposes of his conviction under s 25(2) of the DMT Act, as if it were no more serious than his attempted possession of that substance as a precursor under s 24A. To have approached the matter in that way would have been to ignore the statutory regime provided for in the DMT Act. Where different penalties are provided against a range of specific conduct comprehended by drug possession, manufacture and supply, despite the fact that the prosecution elects to bring a number of charges with overlapping elements, similar criminal conduct may be represented in different offences. This is one such case. 

75Ultimately, the gravamen of the criminality the subject of the supply count was the role the appellant performed as a supplier of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug to which a life sentence attaches to and to which a standard non-parole period of 15 years applies. In our view, his Honour's assessment of the criminality inherent in that conduct was neither appropriately, nor necessarily, diluted by the fact that the appellant also attempted to take possession of the same consignment of pseudoephedrine with the intent specific to the offence under s 24A of the DMT Act.

76We would dismiss the first ground of appeal. 

Ground 2: His Honour erred by finding that the appellant knew that the size of the enterprise involved hundreds of kilograms of product 
77As concerns the weight of what the appellant believed to be prohibited drugs in the boxes he loaded and transported, his Honour found that, on the whole of the evidence, the only reasonable explanation for the appellant's conduct on 13 and 14 August 2008, after being recruited to provide his van five days earlier, was that the appellant believed he was engaged to carry ""a gross quantity of some hundreds of kilos"". The appellant submitted that his Honour could not have reached that finding on the available evidence beyond reasonable doubt and that the only conclusion legitimately open on the evidence was that the appellant knew that there are was ""considerably more than the large commercial quantity"" of 5 kg, being the minimum the jury would have to have been satisfied that the appellant knew he was attempting to possess for on-supply in order to return a guilty verdict on the supply count. 

78The absence of any direct evidence of the extent of the appellant's knowledge did not mandate a finding that the quantity of the drugs he believed to be in the boxes should be limited to 5 kg. This finding was urged upon the trial judge in sentencing by the appellant's counsel and repeated on the appeal. The question is whether it was open to his Honour to make the finding that he did on the whole of the evidence, including the objective nature and scale of the enterprise and what the appellant did as a contribution to it.

79In reasoning to the conclusion that the appellant knew he was involved in a supply of a gross quantity of some hundreds of kilograms, his Honour relied upon the payload weight of the van with 2 passengers, being 788 kg and that it could carry 50 per cent more than that before ""bottoming out"". He noted that there was evidence that the van was fully laden and overloaded (the evidence revealed that the bottom of the van was in contact with the road at several points) and that a van of that carrying capacity would not have been required to transport a mere 5 kg. 

80The appellant submitted that his Honour's reasoning was flawed in that only 45 boxes in the van contained the substituted pills, the balance obviously being loaded as a decoy or to camouflage the boxes the appellant believed to contain the drugs. It was submitted that there was therefore no evidence from which his Honour could reasonably infer that the appellant knew how many of the boxes were expected to contain the prohibited drugs. This submission completely ignores the fact that his Honour also noted that, when police arrested the appellant in company with DS and another man inside the warehouse, all 45 boxes were located: 4 on a hand trolley, 20 in the back of the van, 16 in a shipping container and 5 up against the back wall. Although his Honour did not refer to it, the evidence was that all but 5 of the 45 boxes had been opened and resealed.

81We would reject this ground.

Ground 3: His Honour erred by affording too much significance to the standard non-parole period
82Consistently with our analysis of his Honour's sentencing reasons under this ground of appeal in Ibrahim Jidah's sentence appeal, and the Crown's concession in respect of both this appellant and his brother that a Muldrock error (see Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120) is demonstrated in his Honour's sentencing approach, this ground of appeal is made out (see Ibrahim Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 269 at [37]-[40]). 

Ground 4: The appellant is left with a justifiable sense of grievance on the proper application of parity principles
83Having resolved that DS should be re-sentenced to properly reflect the differences in the criminality of both ES and Lachlan Wilson as senior players in the syndicate, compared to DS's subordinate, but nonetheless important role, and that Ibrahim Jidah's sentence would need to be adjusted to ensure the relativity of his role was properly reflected in his sentence, it follows that this appellant will also need to be re-sentenced (see DS v R [2014] NSWCCA 267 and Ibrahim Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 269).

Re-sentence
84On re-sentence, an affidavit by Ross Patrick Hudson, solicitor, was relied upon. He annexed various documents updating the appellant's custodial and family circumstances after been a serving prisoner for a number of years. In summary, the appellant is regarded by correctional staff members as polite and respectful. He was commended for his diligence in undertaking the Tertiary Preparation program. He has since completed that program and achieved outstanding results. 

85Having regard to his Honour's findings of fact, and our own assessment of the criminal culpability of this appellant, relative to his co-offenders, including his brother who recruited him to be the driver, and having regard to the material relied upon on re-sentence, in addition to the material considered by his Honour as bearing upon the appellant's personal circumstances, we consider a sentence of imprisonment for 10 years, comprised of a non-parole period of 6 years, and an additional term of 4 years as the appropriate sentence. This preserves the finding of special circumstances made by the sentencing judge although the ratio between the non-parole period and the additional term has been altered slightly. We are satisfied that a minimum term of 6 years in custody for this appellant's offending, utilising the standard non-parole period of 15 years as a legislative guidepost, is an appropriate outcome in the re-sentencing exercise. 

Orders
86The Court makes the following orders:
(1) Appeal against conviction dismissed.

(2)Grant leave to appeal against sentence.

(3)The sentence imposed in the District Court on 23 September 2011 on Count 8 on the indictment is quashed.

(4)In lieu thereof, a sentence of imprisonment of 10 years is imposed, commencing on 11 May 2010 and expiring on 10 May 2020, comprising a non-parole period of 6 years and an additional term of 4 years.

(5)The appellant will become eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 10 May 2016.

2765449,Ibrahim Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 269,"Judgment

1THE COURT: On a joint indictment presented on 23 February 2011, Lachlan Wilson, DS, Ibrahim Jidah (the appellant), Yousef Jidah and Ryan Kapral were charged with a range of what might be described broadly as drug offences. ES, another person also involved in the alleged offences, pleaded guilty.

2The charges against the appellant alleged contraventions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1983 (NSW) (the DMT Act). The charges were as follows:

""Count 6

Between about 12 August 2008 and 14 August 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did supply a prohibited drug, namely pseudoephedrine, being not less than the commercial quantity and not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to pseudoephedrine.

Contrary to s.25(2) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 

Count 7

Between about 12 August 2008 and 14 August 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did attempt to possess a precursor, namely pseudoephedrine, intended for use in the manufacture or production by Ibrahim JIDAH or another person of a prohibited drug.

Contrary to s.24A(1) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act.""

3Following a trial before Judge Frearson SC and a jury, the appellant was convicted on both counts. On Count 6, he was sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 10 years and 3 months with an additional term of 5 years and 6 months (that is a head sentence of 15 years and 9 months to expire on 26 January 2026). On Count 7, he was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment to be served wholly concurrently with the sentence imposed for Count 6.

4The appellant has appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him.

5Lachlan Wilson, Yousef Jidah, DS and ES were convicted of various offences relating to the same drugs as those the subject of the charges against the appellant and their appeals, with the exception of that of ES (on sentence), were heard at the same time as this appeal.

The relevant legislation
6Section 25(2) of the DMT Act provides as follows:

""25(2) A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.""

7""Supply"" is defined in s 3 of the DMT Act in the following terms:

""supply includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things.""

8""Prohibited drug"" is defined in s 3 of the DMT Act as any substance other than a prohibited plant specified in Sch 1. Pseudoephedrine is specified in Sch 1. A large commercial quantity of that drug is 5.0 kg.

9Section 33(3) of the DMT Act provides that the maximum penalty for s 25(2), where the offence involved not less than the large commercial quantity, is life imprisonment, a fine of 5,000 penalty units or both. The standard non-parole period is 15 years imprisonment.

10Section 24A of the DMT Act so far as relevant provides as follows:

""24A(1) A person who has possession of: 

(a) a precursor, or

(b) a drug manufacture apparatus,

intended by the person for use in the manufacture or production, by that person or another person, of a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.

...

(3) In this section: 

drug manufacture apparatus means an apparatus specified or described in the regulations as a drug manufacture apparatus for the purposes of this section.

precursor means a substance specified or described in the regulations as a precursor for the purposes of this section.""

11Pseudoephedrine is specified in Sch 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Regulation 2011 (NSW) as a precursor for the purpose of section 24A of the DMT Act.

12Section 33AB of the DMT Act provides that the maximum penalty for an offence under s 24A is a fine of 2,000 penalty units or imprisonment for 10 years or both.

Factual background 
13The facts relating to the charges against the appellant are set out in our judgment in the appeal of Lachlan Wilson (Lachlan Wilson v R [2014] NSWCCA 266 at [13]-[114]), particularly at [75]-[99] and it is not necessary to repeat them.

The conviction appeal
14The appellant appealed against his conviction on the sole ground that the trial miscarried because the appellant was charged with inconsistent verdicts. However, during the course of the hearing of the appeal the appellant was granted leave to amend this ground of appeal in the following terms:

""On the facts of this case the conviction of the appellant on both Counts 6 and 7 have led to a miscarriage of justice because the elements of Count 6 are contained in the elements of Count 7.""

15The relief sought was that the conviction under Count 6 or Count 7 be quashed. 

The submissions on the conviction appeal
16The appellant adopted the submissions made on behalf of Yousef Jidah in his appeal. The Crown also relied on the submissions made in that appeal (see Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270 [17]-[33]).

Disposition of the conviction appeal
17This appeal on conviction raises the same issues as those raised in the appeal of Yousef Jidah. For the reasons given in that appeal (Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270 at [34]-[58]), the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

The sentence appeal
18The application for leave to appeal against sentence is limited to the sentences imposed on Count 6 (the supply count). For that offence a sentence of 15 years and 9 months, comprised of a non-parole period of 10 years and 3 months and a balance of term of 5 years and 6 months was imposed against a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. The sentence was imposed on 23 September 2011. It took account of broken periods of pre-sentence custody. His Honour made a finding of special circumstances. 

19Four grounds of appeal are relied upon. They are expressed in largely identical terms to the grounds relied upon by the appellant's brother, Yousef Jidah, who was sentenced in the same proceedings to a sentence of 13 years, comprised of a non-parole period of 8 years and 9 months and a balance of term of 4 years and 3 months.

20The grounds of appeal are as follows:

(1)His Honour erred in his consideration of the standard non-parole period in that:

(a)He breached Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120;

(b)He erred in his finding regarding the objective seriousness of the offence;

(c)His Honour erred in failing to properly assess the objective seriousness of the supply offence, by failing to take into account the inter-related nature of the two offences charged against him; and

(d)His Honour erred by finding that the applicant ""had knowledge of at least the approximate, if not the precise, quantity involved"". 

(2)His Honour erred in breaching the principle of parity. 

(3)His Honour imposed a sentence that was otherwise manifestly excessive.

The facts found for sentencing purposes
21His Honour found that the objective seriousness of the appellant's offending was close to the top of the mid-range. He rejected counsel's submission that it was much lower than mid-range offending because the appellant had no involvement with the unpacking of the boxes inside the warehouse, where he simply acted as a lookout and was involved for a limited timeframe. 

22His Honour based his finding that the offending was in the top of the mid-range upon the role the appellant performed generally, which his Honour noted the Crown had described as one of an organiser and overseer. His Honour referred to the appellant performing the task of safeguarding the drugs whilst they were in transit. 

23On the appeal, although the appellant's counsel made no direct challenge to his Honour's characterisation of the appellant's offending, he maintained the submission that the sentence imposed did not reflect the limited tasks the appellant actually performed.

24His Honour also took into account the ""obvious organisation and planning"" involved in the operation generally, in the context of the actual role the appellant performed, together with the duration and nature of his involvement. He found that the appellant was motivated by significant but unquantified financial gain, proportional to the role he played and the risk he took in becoming involved in a large scale commercial supply.

25His Honour made the following additional factual findings: 
(a)The appellant recruited his brother to transport the boxes;

(b)He met with ES on the evening of 12 August 2008 and the next morning instructed his brother to take the day off;

(c)He consulted with ES as to ""how many cement bags did we pick up"" to which ES responded ""three million""(His Honour concluded this conversation related to the individual tablets in the consignment which were calculated to be 2.6 million - see the summary of the phone call in Lachlan Wilson v R [2014] NSWCCA 266 at [78]); 

(d)Later that day he coordinated with his brother for a meeting at ES's father's house after which he travelled in convoy with his brother to collect the boxes. He maintained contact with ES en route;

(e)He reported to ES what he believed to be police surveillance and reported the same to his brother, discussing with each of them the appropriate reaction;

(f)He communicated the instruction from ES to his brother to abandon ""the car and everything"";

(g)He then collected his brother and met up again with ES;

(h)He accompanied ES to the warehouse alert to the risk of police surveillance;

(i)He liaised with his brother regarding the collection of the boxes the following day and attended the warehouse on 14 August; and

(j)He remained in contact with ES while the boxes were being loaded into the van and waited nearby for the purposes of escorting it.

26His Honour noted the submission of counsel that the evidence was insufficient to support the inference that the appellant had knowledge of the actual quantity of drugs involved, or any quantity approaching that quantity, in contrast to the knowledge of others in the enterprise - ES in particular. 

27His Honour considered that the close relationship between ES and this appellant, the fact that he knew he required a van with a large carrying capacity to transport the boxes, together with the fact that it took a substantial time to load and unload the boxes, meant the only reasonable explanation that was available on the totality of the evidence, was that the appellant knew of ""the approximate, if not the precise, quantity [of drugs] involved"". His Honour's finding that the appellant's brother knew (or believed) he was handling ""hundreds of kilograms"" of prohibited drugs is not a relevantly different conclusion, or at least not materially different for sentencing purposes. 

The appellant's subjective circumstances 
28His Honour acknowledged the tender of what he described as a wealth of subjective material, including a psychological assessment from Ms Danielle Hopkins and references from family members who described the appellant as a man of integrity and honesty. He noted the appellant's background and family history and that he was subjected to harsh physical punishment as a child. 

29The appellant completed Year 12 and 16 months of a TAFE course as an apprentice electrician. He was aged 27 at the time of the offending and was paying off a mortgage with his wife, working seven days a week as a concrete labourer. His wife was expecting their first child at the time of sentence and, being under medical advice that she was not to lift more than 15 kg, was heavily dependent upon the appellant on a day-to-day basis. 

30His Honour accepted that the appellant had what he described as a ""strong store of otherwise good character"" and that in many areas of his life he had made a positive and worthwhile contribution to society. He considered that the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation were good and that he was unlikely to ""ever reoffend in this particular way"".

Ground 1(b): His Honour erred in his consideration of the standard non-parole period in that he erred in his finding regarding the objective seriousness of the offence
Ground 1(c): His Honour erred in his consideration of the standard non-parole period in that his Honour erred in failing to properly assess the objective seriousness of the supply offence, by failing to take into account the inter-related nature of the two offences charged against him
31Despite the separate formulation of grounds 1(b) and (c), at the hearing submissions were only made with respect to ground 1(c). It was not submitted that ground 1(b) raised any issue over and above ground 1(c). Ground 1(b) may therefore be considered to be encapsulated by ground 1(c). For the reasons we gave when rejecting the equivalent ground of appeal to ground 1(c) in the appellant's brother's sentence appeal, this ground of appeal is also rejected (see Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270 at [67]-[76]). 

Ground 1(d): His Honour erred in his consideration of the standard non-parole period in that his Honour erred by finding that the applicant ""had knowledge of at least the approximate, if not the precise, quantity involved"" 
32As concerns the weight of what the appellant believed to be prohibited drugs in the boxes, his Honour found that, given the totality of the evidence, the only reasonable explanation for the appellant's conduct was that he had knowledge of at least the approximate, if not the precise, quantity involved. 

33As we observed when dealing with the appeal against the severity of sentence brought by his brother (Yousef Jidah), where the same ground of appeal was advanced, the absence of any direct evidence of the extent of the appellant's knowledge does not mandate a finding that it was not open to the sentencing judge to draw the inference of knowledge of the quantity of drugs in that consignment beyond reasonable doubt from the totality of the evidence, including the objective nature and scale of the enterprise and what the appellant did as a participant in that enterprise.

34In reasoning to the conclusion adverse to the appellant on the issue of knowledge, in addition to the various matters set out above, his Honour also relied in particular upon the close relationship between ES and the appellant, albeit that it was not a relationship that was necessarily reflected in his appointment of any role in the enterprise before 12 August 2008 in the supply phase of the operation. His Honour made specific reference to the telephone conversation concerning cement bags as set out at par [78] in Lachlan Wilson v R [2014] NSWCCA 266. Counsel submitted that, contrary to the construction of that conversation as contended for by the Crown and found by his Honour, we would be left in doubt as to whether the reference to the three million cement bags was a reference to drugs at all. Counsel was unable to advance any other construction of the conversation. 

35 We are satisfied that it was open to his Honour, in the context of all of the evidence in the case, to regard that conversation as illuminating. We also note the terms of another intercepted conversation three hours later as set out in Lachlan Wilson v R [2014] NSWCCA 266 at [79] where, after the container was delivered to the warehouse, ES asked DS ""did you find them"" and ""how many"". He then said if there were not 45 to call him ""straight away"". It was immediately following that phone call that ES called the appellant and told him to ""get ready"". The appellant said he was ""waiting"" and enquired whether he needed (what we interpret to be) the van, immediately. ES said it had to be ""pronto"" whereupon the appellant enquired, ""Hows it lookin'? Hows, hows the .... (indecipherable)"", to which ES responded, ""Everything's all right"". It was after that conversation that the appellant arranged to meet with his brother, after which they proceeded to the warehouse, loaded the van and the boxes were transported. 

36The summary of the appellant's involvement thereafter, set out in Lachlan Wilson v R [2014] NSWCCA 266 at [80]-[99] (the jury having plainly rejected the appellant's account of his irregular driving as consistent with his unbridled passion for his car), in addition to the evidence to which his Honour made specific reference, is a sufficient basis to support a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was aware of the scale of the operation and the approximate quantity of drugs involved.

Ground 1(a): His Honour erred in his consideration of the standard non-parole period in that he breached Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 
37At the time of sentence the High Court's decision in Muldrock v The Queen supra had not been delivered. Although his Honour did not refer to this Court's decision in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 as requiring him to point to the extent to which the appellant's offending departed from a notional offence in the mid-range of objective seriousness as the first step in the two-stage approach to sentencing for an offence carrying a standard non-parole period, the Crown's written submissions on sentence commended that approach to his Honour as the correct approach of law. 

38It is clear from his Honour's sentencing remarks that he made a finding as to where, referable to that notional range, the appellant's offending should be appointed and that he did so expressly for the purpose of considering the standard non-parole period and whether there should be a departure from it by balancing out other factors in the appellant's subjective case. That his Honour took this approach is patent from the following passage. After finding that the objective gravity of the offending was ""within the mid range but at the very bottom of the mid range"" he went on to say:

""I should point out that in relation to Ibrahim Jidah I do propose to depart from the standard non parole period which applies to offences in the middle of the range of objective gravity. I do propose to depart because of the finding of special circumstances and because of the particular combination of otherwise good character and what I consider to be the very good prospects of rehabilitation. It is a combination of features that cause me to depart.""

39On the appeal, the Crown conceded that it would be open for this Court to find that the sentence was infected by the two-stage process of reasoning the High Court found to be a wrong approach in Muldrock v The Queen supra. We regard that concession as properly made. We are satisfied that this ground of appeal is made out for that reason. 

40The question is whether on re-sentence we are persuaded that the Muldrock error has resulted in a failure to afford the appellant's subjective circumstances sufficient weight in the synthesising of all the matters material to sentence and/or whether the standard non-parole period was given a primary or determinate significance such that when we undertake the re-sentencing exercise we can reach the positive view that another sentence is warranted in law as required by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

Ground 2: His Honour erred in breaching the principle of parity
41The appellant complains that relative to the sentences imposed on Lachlan Wilson and upon DS, being respectively 16 years and 2 months and 15 years 11 months and 1 week (each of whom participated with the appellant in the supply of the pseudoephedrine but at more elevated levels in the notional hierarchy of offenders in the syndicate), and relative to the sentence imposed on ES (to whose direction the appellant was subject at all times in the supply phase of the importation of the drug), being an undiscounted sentence of 16 years and 6 months, the appellant's sentence of 15 years and 9 months engenders a justifiable sense of grievance.

42The principle of parity derives from the fundamental norm of equal justice. In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462, at [28] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, their Honours said of equal justice:

""It requires, so far as the law permits, that like cases be treated alike. Equal justice according to law also requires, where the law permits, differential treatment of persons according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of the law. As Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Wong v The Queen:

'Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect.'""
(References omitted).

43The sense of grievance complained of when the sentence for one offender is compared relative to that of a co-offender or co-offenders is to be assessed objectively governed by considerations of substance rather than form. It is only triggered where differences in the sentences imposed on co-offenders is disproportionate to relevant distinctions in the role each played in the commission of the offence (even if the roles might be differently described or involve different conduct) and in an offender's subjective circumstances. There are necessarily degrees of both similarity and difference in the criminal conduct of co-offenders and in their subjective circumstances. In some cases this requires that different sentences be imposed. However, it is only where the discrepancy between sentences is not reasonably explained by the degree of difference between co-offenders and their offending that the disparity is such that appellate intervention is required. For there to be a justifiable sense of grievance, the disparity must be ""gross"", ""marked"" or ""glaring"" (see the discussion by Howie J in Crystal Lee England v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [61]-[67]).

44In Gill v R [2010] NSWCCA 236 at [58], McColl JA (with whom RS Hulme and Latham JJ agreed) observed that an applicant faces considerable obstacles in invoking the parity principle in circumstances where a sentence, said to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, was imposed by a sentencing judge who was aware of the sentences imposed on co-offenders and it is clear that the sentence is structured in that knowledge.

45This appellant and his brother were the first of the five convicted co-offenders to be sentenced. Eight months later, in May 2012, Lachlan Wilson was sentenced for his role in knowingly taking part in the supply of the same quantity of drugs this appellant and his brother were involved in supplying. Lachlan Wilson, being sentenced to 16 years and 2 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months, received a sentence 5 months longer in total than the sentence imposed on this appellant, with a differential of only 3 months in the non-parole period. DS, who was sentenced almost 12 months after this appellant, received a sentence of 15 years 11 months and 1 week and a non-parole period of 10 years 4 months and 1 week, only 2 months and 1 week longer than the sentence imposed on this appellant with a differential of 1 month and 1 week in the non-parole period. 

46In imposing the sentence on Lachlan Wilson, his Honour referred to the decision in Muldrock v The Queen supra and that this appellant and his brother had been sentenced under an approach to the application of Part 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) that applied at the time of their sentences and that has since been disapproved. In sentencing Lachlan Wilson, his Honour also made specific reference to equal justice considerations and the question of parity when referring to the non-parole periods imposed upon this appellant and his brother eight months earlier. He also expressed the view that, despite the change in the approach to the standard non-parole period post Muldrock v The Queen supra, the non-parole periods he imposed were commensurate with the minimum terms that could properly be imposed for their offending having regard to its objective gravity and their criminal antecedents which denied them some level of leniency. His Honour's observations, whilst entitled to the greatest respect, do not bind this Court on re-sentence, given Muldrock error was conceded by the Crown.

47Similarly, when sentencing DS for his role, which his Honour described as one involving the coordination and supervision of the arrival of the container and unpacking the boxes to isolate the drugs, he referred to the sentences he had already imposed on this appellant and his brother and on Lachlan Wilson. It was in those sentencing remarks that he described the role of this appellant as ""the escort"" and his brother as ""the driver"". 

48DS's sentence appeal was upheld, in part, on parity grounds when compared with the sentence imposed on Lachlan Wilson (DS v R [2014] NSWCCA 267). He was re-sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 14 years and 6 months, comprised of a non-parole period of 9 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 5 years. The finding of special circumstances was preserved. Lachlan Wilson's sentence appeal (which included a ground that his sentence was disproportionate to the sentence imposed on ES) was dismissed (see Lachlan Wilson v R [2014] NSWCCA 266). 

49The sentence imposed on DS after re-sentence leads inevitably to there being an unjustified disparity in the sentence imposed on this appellant and his brother. The necessity for this appellant's sentence to reflect the overriding principle of equal justice will be addressed in the context of re-sentence which, in light of the Crown concession that a Muldrock error is made out, is the inevitable outcome of his sentence appeal. 

50Were we not persuaded that the ground of appeal alleging disparity was made out, we would not have intervened to re-sentence on the basis that the sentence imposed at first instance was manifestly excessive, in the sense of it being unreasonable or plainly unjust, after giving due weight to all relevant circumstances particular to this appellant's offending, including the maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

Re-sentence
51On re-sentence, an affidavit by Ross Patrick Hudson, solicitor, was relied upon. He also annexed various documents updating the appellant's custodial and family circumstances after having been a serving prisoner for a number of years. In summary, that material confirms that his Honour's assessment of the appellant as having good prospects of rehabilitation has been borne out. He has not been the subject of any disciplinary charges in custody and has been regarded by correctional staff members as compliant, respectful and hardworking. He has undertaken various courses to improve his literacy and to enhance his vocational skills. He has held various positions within the prison and most recently has been given clearance to work in a position where he liaises with inmates and staff. His wife has since given birth to their first child and supports herself and her child with government benefits. 

52Having regard to his Honour's findings of fact, and our own assessment of the criminal culpability of this appellant relative to his co-offenders, including his brother who he recruited to be the driver, and having regard to the material relied upon on re-sentence, in addition to the material available to the sentencing judge bearing upon the appellant's subjective circumstances, we consider a sentence of imprisonment for 12 years and 6 months, comprised of a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months, and an additional term of 4 years is the appropriate sentence. This preserves the finding of special circumstances made by the sentencing judge although the ratio between the non-parole period and the additional term has been altered slightly to ensure the non-parole period, as the minimum time the appellant should serve in custody, adequately reflects the gravity of his offending utilising the standard non-parole period of 15 years as a legislative guidepost. 

Orders
53The Court makes the following orders:
(1)Appeal against conviction dismissed.

(2)Grant leave to appeal against sentence. 

(3)The sentence imposed in the District Court on 23 September 2011 on Count 6 on the indictment is quashed.

(4)In lieu thereof, a sentence of imprisonment of 12 years and 6 months is imposed, commencing on 27 April 2010 and expiring on 26 October 2022, comprising a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months and an additional term of 4 years.

(5) The appellant will become eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 26 October 2018.

	GLEESON JA: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	BELLEW J: MAJ (âthe applicantâ) seeks leave, pursuant to s. 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, to appeal against orders made by his Honour Judge Blackmore SC in the District Court:
	



	
	allowing the Crown to rely upon particular evidence as tendency evidence; and
	
	
	declining to grant a separate trial of any of the counts in the Indictment, and ordering that all counts be determined together.
	


BACKGROUND


	
	The applicant has pleaded not guilty to ten counts of aggravated indecent assault, each being an offence contrary to s. 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The three victims of the alleged offending, to whom I shall refer as JA, DA and DMA, are brothers. At the time of the alleged offending the applicant was in a relationship with TS, the mother of the victims. The applicant is not the father of any of the victims, although he and TS had a daughter, from their relationship to whom I shall refer as T.
	
	
	In 2012, when the allegations against the applicant were first raised, TS was in a relationship with a person to whom I shall refer as W, and who is apparently a police officer.
	
	
	The counts in the Indictment presented against the applicant may be summarised as follows:
	



	
	each of counts 1 to 7 allege an offence committed between 1 January 2002 and 31 August 2003 against JA;
	
	
	each of counts 8 and 9 allege an offence committed between 1 January 2003 and 31 August 2003 against DA; and
	
	
	count 10 alleges an offence committed between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2002 against âDMAâ.
	



	
	On 31 January 2014, the Crown issued three tendency notices pursuant to s. 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 NSW (âthe Actâ). Paragraph 2 of the first notice was in the following terms:
	


âThe tendency sought to be proved is his/her tendency to act in a particular way, namely to touch and masturbate (JA) and whisper into his ear and cause him discomfort.â


	
	Paragraph 2 of the second notice was in the following terms:
	


âThe tendency sought to be proved is his/her tendency to act in a particular way, namely to touch and masturbate (DMAâs) genitals, pull down his pants, and whisper into his ear and cause him discomfort.â


	
	Paragraph 2 of the third notice was in the following terms:
	


âThe tendency sought to be proved is his/her tendency to act in a particular way, namely to pull (DAâs) pants down and to touch and masturbate (DAâs) genitals.

THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE PRIMARY JUDGE

The Crown case


	
	When the matter came before the primary judge on 18 February 2014, the Crown outlined the case against the applicant as follows (T6 L40-49):
	


âThe basic case is that (TS) is the mother of the three complainants, she commenced her relationship with the accused person (the applicant) which ended towards the end of August, hence the 31 August date in the indictment. They moved to an address in Georges Hall and it is said that whilst at that premise the accused assaulted each of the three boys of the family unit, at that stage, he performing the role of if you like, of father figure, he clearly had them under his supervision. We say that the commonality of the allegations is that he went into the bedroom of these young boys at night and effectively touched their genitalia and masturbated them under the blanket. That is the common allegation.â


	
	In relation to the three tendency notices, the Crown said (T7 L9-23):
	


âIn respect of the tendency notice, of course, we say in effect that he has a tendency to act upon his sexual attraction to young boys by assaulting them in the allegations set out in counts 1 to 10. In respect of the additional witnesses over and above the boys, that is the grandmother and the mother, part of the ..(not transcribable).., which one likes, is that in respect of two of the boys they talk about the accused person whispering in their ears at the time. They don't say they remember specific words said but say that they feel uncomfortable, that's their feeling about what was happening at that stage. The grandmother for instance at para 10 in her statement, says, ""I see on one occasion-"" outside of the charges period, ""-him whispering into (JA's) ear and I say, what's you doing and he stops"". That lends support, we say, to a tendency or propensity to act in that way as part of the offending. (TS) talks about (the applicant) being absent from the bed during the evening and having entered (JA')s bedroom. The version being given of course is to comfort (JA) who is crying.â


	
	In response to an inquiry from the primary judge about the circumstances in which the complaints first emerged, the Crown said (T7 L44 - T8 L11):
	


âThe allegations come about in this way, is that they say that in December of 2012 at a family barbeque at the then house they are living at, (JA) makes a disclosure as a result of a discussion about the daughter, (T). (T) being a younger daughter who is the natural daughter of the accused person (the applicant) and (TS) and her behaviour, and there's some discussion around the concerns about that and (JA) is said to blurt out that he had been touched by (the applicant) and that he hated him. As a result of that the mother makes a general inquiry and the two other boys who are present nod or confirm that they likewise had been touched, all boys say that they were either asked not to say anything or they were scared of (the applicant) and didn't mention these things. In fact one of them says he simply wanted to try and forget it but it came to light in this way when the protection of the daughter, if you like, was under discussion and that's how the disclosure is made, the police being contacted by the parents two days later on 6 December. And then you will see that the boys make statements on 12 and 18 December respectively and I think there's one then in February which is a clarifying statement of, I think it's (DA). So that's how the disclosure comes about your Honour in 2012.â


	
	It was the Crownâs position before the primary judge that the evidence of each of the three victims was admissible as tendency evidence and that accordingly, the trial of the ten counts contained in the Indictment should proceed together. That was opposed by counsel for the applicant on the basis that (inter alia):
	



	
	the evidence which was relied upon was not tendency evidence;
	
	
	if the evidence was tendency evidence, it did not satisfy the provisions of s. 101 of the Act.
	



	
	The applicant also initially raised an issue as to whether reasonable notice had been given by the Crown of its intention to rely upon tendency evidence as required by s. 97(1)(a) of the Act. However, counsel appearing for the applicant before the primary judge expressly abandoned any reliance upon that matter (at T6 L18-19).
	
	
	A separate issue was raised before the primary judge concerning the validity of the tendency notices. In essence, it was submitted by counsel for the applicant that the form in which the notices had been drafted did not signal an intention to adduce tendency evidence from one victim in support of a charge involving a different victim. The Crown explained (commencing at T13 L11) that this was not the way in which the notices were to be construed, following which counsel for the applicant indicated (at T14 L3-5 and again at T15 L12-14) that he was content to proceed on that basis.
	
	
	At the commencement of the proceedings before the primary judge, the Crown tendered a number of documents, including the statements of each of the three victims as well as the statement of TS. At that point, counsel then appearing for the applicant indicated that he did not wish to adduce any evidence and did not propose to cross-examine any of the victims. However, following an exchange with the primary judge, counsel revised that position and indicated that did wish to cross-examine them.
	


The evidence of TS


	
	TS made a statement to police on 18 December 2012 which was before the primary judge and which was also before this Court on the hearing of the application for leave to appeal. TS did not give oral evidence before the primary judge.
	
	
	In paragraphs (40) and following of her statement, TS said that following her separation from the applicant, she came to an arrangement whereby the applicant would have fortnightly access to T. She stated that over a period of time she became concerned about the deterioration in Tâs behaviour, and had developed a particular concern that such deterioration may have been linked to Tâs treatment by the applicant.
	
	
	At paras. (47) and following of her statement TS recounted a telephone call that she received in late 2012 from the applicantâs then partner, who expressed concern about the behaviour of both T and the applicant. TS then said the following at paras. (48)-(49):
	


âOn the evening of the 4th of December 2012, we were having a family BBQ at (our address). I was talking to (DMA), (DA) and (JA) about my concerns over Tâs behaviour and the possibility that it may have been linked to (the applicant). As I was speaking to them, (JA) said to me:

âMum, (the applicant) has hurt me. He has touched me.â

I was in total shock at this stage and felt physically sick and helpless. I said to (DA) and (DMA):

âHas he touched you?â

(DA) said:

âHe touched me.â

I said:

âWhat did he do?â

(DA) wouldnât reply.

I said to (DMA):

âDid he touch you?â

(DMA) said:

âYes, he used to âdackâ us.â

I said:

âDid he touch you?â

(DMA) just put his head down and looked away.

I spoke to (W) and told him what the boys had to (sic) spoken to me about. (W) spoke to the boys on the back verandah, whilst I went inside the house.â

The evidence of JA


	
	JA provided a statement to the police on 12 December 2012. Having set out the allegations of sexual assault by the applicant, he said the following at para (26):
	


âIt was this year after talking to Mum and (W) and then (DA) and finding out that he was also abused by (the applicant) I decided that I should tell police what happened to me and make a statement. When we were talking we also spoke about (T) and some of the problems that she was having which includes pooing herself which made me worry that (the applicant) might be hurting her. (The applicant) also has a girlfriend named (S) who has a young son named (B) and Iâve heard that (the applicant) is dacking (B) the same as he did to us and I am worried that (the applicant) might also be doing more to (B)â.


	
	JA gave oral evidence before the primary judge. He said (commencing at T6 L1) that it was after his mother had expressed her concerns about T that he disclosed what had occurred between himself and the applicant. He said (T6 L50 â T7 L4) that he was âpretty sureâ that when he did so, the other two victims were also present. That account is consistent with the statement of TS. It is also generally consistent with the accounts of DA and DMA which are discussed below.
	
	
	JA agreed (T8 L5-10) that he decided to make a statement to police âafter talking to mum and (W) and then (DA)â. He was adamant (T8 L14-15) that although he had learned from DA that he (DA) was also sexually abused by the applicant, he did not tell DA the same thing about himself. He could not remember the details of the conversation that he had with DA in that regard (T8 L46-49).
	
	
	In cross-examination, JA denied (commencing at T10 L25) that the allegations against the applicant had been discussed âas a familyâ. He said (T10 L38-44) that after disclosing the applicantâs alleged behaviour to TS, an appointment had been made for him to attend Campbelltown Police Station to make a statement. He agreed (T10 L49 â T11 L8) that W had reassured him about the process of taking the statement, but stated that he did not speak to DA about it (T11 L14-18). It was not suggested to him that he had discussed, with W, any aspect of the allegations prior to making his statement.
	
	
	JA said (T11 L30-34) that after he made a statement to the police he was given a copy of it which he took home. He said (T11 L36) that although he told TS that he had made a statement, he did not show it to her and did not tell her where he was going to keep it (T11 L48-49).
	
	
	JA agreed (T12 L4 and following) that DA and DMA had also made statements to police but said that he was not sure of where these statements were kept. He said he had not been shown the statements and was only âguessingâ that DA and DMA had made them (T12 L36-37). No suggestion was put to JA that any part of his statement had been tailored having regard to the contents of statements made by DA and/or DMA.
	
	
	It was not suggested to JA that his evidence was concocted or contaminated, nor was it suggested to him that his complaint against the applicant was motivated by what TS had said about T. His evidence as to discussions having taken place was limited to his reference (at T8 L14-15) to the fact that he had learned from DA that he had been allegedly sexually assaulted by the applicant. However, JA stated unequivocally that he did not tell DA the same thing about himself. This issue was not further pursued in cross-examination.
	


The evidence of DA


	
	DA also made a statement on 12 December 2012. Having set out the allegations of sexual assault against the applicant, he said the following at para (13):
	


âIt was only about a week ago that I told anyone about what happened. We were at dinner. There at the time was my stepfather (W), Mum, (DMA) and (JA). We were talking about T because we were all a bit worried about her behaviour after she comes home from visiting (the applicant). (JA) came out and said â(the applicant) used to touch me. I hate him.â I am not 100 per cent sure what else (JA) said. Mum asked me if (the applicant) used to do anything to me. I said, âhe used to touch me as well.â Mum and (W) spoke to me later separately and I told them what (the applicant) had done in more detail the same as in my statement.â


	
	That account of the circumstances in which the allegation emerged was consistent with that of TS, as well as with those of JA and DMA.
	
	
	DA also gave evidence before the primary judge. When cross-examined he agreed (commencing at T16 L30) that TS had spoken of her concerns about T at a family dinner, and in particular had expressed a concern that the deterioration in Tâs behaviour may be linked to the applicant. DA also agreed that TS had spoken of the suggestion that B (the applicantâs son from another relationship) was also the subject of sexual interference by the applicant. He agreed that it was following this that JA had said (in his presence as well as that of DMA) that the applicant had interfered with him (T18 L7-17).
	
	
	DA agreed (T18 L7-8) that he had heard what JA had said on that occasion. It was not suggested to him that he had ever spoken with JA about the allegations, be it before or after they were raised. He denied speaking with DMA about the matter (T21 L3-5). He said that he did not think that any aspect of the allegations was discussed between the time at which they were first raised and the date on which he made his statement to the police (T20 L28-41). It was not put to DA that his motivation in making the allegation against the applicant arose from what was said by either of his brothers, or TS.
	


The evidence of DMA


	
	DMA made a statement to the police on 18 December 2012. Having recounted the allegations of sexual assault by the applicant, he said the following at paragraph (16):
	


âA couple of weeks ago the family was talking about (T) and her behaviour which she has been referred to a specialist for and the fact that Mum thought that (T) may be being abused. (T) is very attached to her father, often saying that we or Mum doesnât love her like he does and that she wants to live him and she has outbursts wanting to be with him particularly after coming back from seeing her father. While we were talking about this we found out that (the applicant) had done some things to (JA) that Mum knew about a few years ago. When I heard this I told Mum and my step Dad (W) that (the applicant) used to also pull down my pants and that he had touched me. At that time my twin (DA) also told us that he had had his pants pulled down (the applicant). As a family it was decided that we should report it to police.â


	
	Once again, the account is generally consistent with that of TS, save for the fact that DMA said that he told TS that the applicant had touched him. This is contrary to the statement of TS, who said that when she asked DMA if he had been touched, he put his head down and looked away. DMAâs account is generally consistent with that of JA and DA.
	
	
	DMA also gave evidence before the primary judge. He said (commencing at T26 L45) that he was present with TS and his two brothers in early December 2012 at which time TS had expressed concerns about the applicantâs behaviour towards T. He agreed (T28 L44-45) that he was present when JA made allegations against the applicant, and that TS had then asked DA whether he had experienced similar offending (T29 L1-19).
	
	
	DMA said (T11 L30-31) that TS had then asked him if the applicant had assaulted him in a similar way. He said that he told her that he had done so. He also said (T20 L4-6) that he had later spoken to W about the matter in the presence of DA. However there was no evidence as to the extent of any such discussions, either with W or with DA. It was not suggested to DMA that those discussions had any bearing upon what he later told police.
	
	
	DMA agreed (T31 L1-3) that a decision was made âas a familyâ to report the matter to police. However he denied (T31 L5-8) that this decision followed âa series of family discussionsâ or â(his) parents talking â¦. about the allegationsâ. It was not put to DMA that he discussed any allegation with either of his brothers. It was also not put to him that his decision to disclose the applicantâs alleged behaviour was motivated, in any way, by what his mother had said about T, nor by what his brothers had said in his presence.
	


THE FINDINGS OF THE PRIMARY JUDGE


	
	The primary judge found that the evidence relied upon by the Crown was admissible as tendency evidence, and that the counts in the Indictment should not be separated. I have set out those findings in full when dealing with the specific grounds of appeal. In summary, in respect of the factual question of whether there was evidence of concoction or contamination, the primary judge found that:
	



	
	there was no aspect of the evidence of the three victims which caused him to question the reliability of their evidence (at 13);
	
	
	there was no direct evidence of concoction, and no such allegation had been put to any of the victims (at 17);
	
	
	the spontaneity of the complaints did not bespeak of concoction (at 17);
	
	
	whilst it was possible that there was some unwitting contamination (as opposed to concoction) that possibility had not been explored in cross-examination and accordingly, the probative value of the evidence had not been reduced by reason of any contamination (at 18).
	



	
	The primary judge also found that:
	



	
	the applicantâs submission, based upon the decision in Hoch v The Queen [1988] HCA 50; (1988) 165 CLR 292, that the evidence should be excluded if it was reasonably capable of explanation on the basis of concoction, should be rejected because that decision reflected common law principles which have no application to the Act (at 14-15);
	
	
	Hoch and other decisions of this Court which have applied it (notably BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 303 and FB v R [2011] NSWCCA 217) should not be followed (14-15);
	
	
	for the purposes of s. 97 of the Act, and in accordance with the decision of this Court in R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228, the probative value of the evidence was not to be determined by an assessment of its reliability and credibility (at 10; 13);
	
	
	as a consequence of (iii) there was no reason to consider the submission made on behalf of the applicant that the evidence may be concocted or contaminated, because such matters went only to the reliability and credibility of the evidence (at 12-13);
	
	
	the probative value of the evidence was significant (at 15);
	
	
	any potential prejudice arising from the possibility that the jury may not give each individual count proper consideration, and may consider the counts collectively, could be addressed by an appropriate direction (at 16-17);
	
	
	as a consequence, the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed any prejudice to the accused, and the evidence should be admitted (at 17).
	


THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL


	
	Before dealing with the grounds of appeal, it is necessary to say something about the issues raised by those grounds, and the approach which was taken by the Court at the hearing of the application for leave to appeal.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant raised three primary issues, namely whether the primary judge erred in:
	



	
	concluding that there was no evidence of concoction or contamination (âthe first issueâ);
	
	
	failing to apply the decisions in Hoch, BP and FB (âthe second issueâ); and
	
	
	concluding that the decision in Shamouil operated to prohibit any consideration being given to the possibility of concoction when determining the probative value of the evidence (âthe third issueâ).
	



	
	A further issue (âthe fourth issueâ) which was raised in the written submissions, but which was not referred to in oral argument, was that the notices did not amount to reasonable notice in writing as required by s. 97(1)(a) of the Act, and that they were otherwise invalid because of a failure to indicate that an intention to adduce tendency evidence from one victim in support of a charge against a different victim. As set out in [15] and [16] above, when these matters were raised before the primary judge counsel then appearing for the applicant effectively abandoned any reliance upon them and indicated, on more than one occasion, a preparedness to proceed on that basis. In light of counselâs clearly stated position before the primary judge, leave should be refused in respect of this issue.
	
	
	As to the first three issues, the Crownâs position, in general terms, was that the finding of the primary judge that there was no concoction or contamination in the evidence of the three victims was one which was open to him. The Crown further submitted that the primary judge did not err in declining to follow and apply Hoch and that the preferred approach to the issue, consistent with that followed by the primary judge, was that formulated by Basten JA in BJS v R [2011] NSWCCA 239 (âBJS No. 1â) at [26] and [27], and applied by Hoeben CJ at CL in BJS v R [2013] NSWCCA 123 (âBJS No. 2â) at [65]-[66] . The Crown further submitted that the primary judge was correct to decide that the decision of this Court in Shamouil prevented him from having regard to issues of concoction or contamination when determining the probative value of the evidence, because those matters went only to reliability and credibility.
	
	
	The first issue raised by the applicant is a purely factual one. However, the second and third issues highlight, to some degree, differing approaches to the question of how an allegation of concoction or contamination might bear upon the admissibility of tendency evidence, and the assessment of its probative value.
	
	
	Ultimately, the Court heard argument on all three issues. It is appropriate that leave be granted in respect of each of them. If the first is resolved against the applicant, the second and third will not require determination.
	


THE FIRST ISSUE â EVIDENCE OF CONTAMINATION OR CONCOCTION

The findings of the primary judge


	
	The primary judge extensively summarised the evidence of each of the three victims commencing at p. 2 of his reasons. Having done so he said (at p. 13):
	


âI heard the evidence of the complainants on the voir dire, and I am unable to find that there is anything in their evidence that causes me to question the believability or reliability or the evidence. It must follow that the evidence, if accepted by the jury, would have significant probative value on the issue of whether the accused committed similar acts on the other complainants. Of course it is the intention of the Crown to conduct a joint trial. In each of the cases involving a separate complainant the Crown seeks to tender two pieces of tendency evidence, namely, the allegations made by the other complainants, to seek to establish the tendency alleged. In my view, given the nature of the evidence, it must be accepted that it would be of importance in the jury's assessment of the allegations made by each complainantâ.


	
	He then said (at 17-18):
	


âInasmuch as I have not addressed the issues of alleged concoction andcontamination of the evidence in detail, I do note that whilst the complainants were called, none were confronted with an allegation of concoction. That leaves the Court with no direct evidence of any such concoction. Any inference of such concoction is, in my view, not a strong one based on the evidence. The spontaneity of the complaints was such that they do not bespeak of concoction. Moreover, if the allegations were entirely made up, particularly with the assistance of someone trained in the law as may be suggested, you would expect that they would address inconsistencies in those accounts that do not assist the Crown case. It does not appear to be the case based on the evidence led in the proceedings. It would be entirely speculative in these circumstances to suggest that there was any concoction here.

There must always be a possibility of contamination of the evidence when the complainants are closely related. Does that mean that in all such cases no tendency evidence could be admitted? With respect, that would be contrary to the line of authority already quoted. But in any case, it is plain from the evidence led in this case that none of the complainants was aware of the detail of the other complaints until those complaints were made for the first time to their mother. Thereafter there was a family, discussion about whether the matter should be reported to the police.

It is possible in that process that some unwitting contamination, as opposed to concoction of the evidence, occurred. If it did occur, based on the evidence I am unable to make any positive finding. Even the possibility of such contamination affecting the accounts of the complainants was not explored in cross-examination. Accepting that it is the Crown that must satisfy the Court on the issue, I am not of the view that the probative value of the evidence is reduced by the reason of any contamination. Clearly this is a matter that can be taken up before the jury, for them to determineâ.

Submissions of the parties


	
	Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that his Honour had erred in concluding that there was no evidence of concoction or contamination of the evidence of the three victims, and argued that such a conclusion was not reasonably open on the evidence.
	
	
	In advancing this submission senior counsel submitted, in particular, that the primary judge had failed to:
	



	
	engage in a proper analysis of the evidence; and
	
	
	provide adequate reasons for his conclusions.
	



	
	The Crown pointed to the fact that the primary judge had extensively summarised the evidence of the three victims. Leaving aside the consistency in the respective accounts of the alleged offending, the Crown submitted that the circumstances in which the allegations were made tended wholly against a conclusion that they were concocted or contaminated. The Crown pointed, in particular, to the spontaneity of JAâs account, which was immediately followed by those of DA and DMA. It was submitted that such circumstances tended wholly against a conclusion that the allegations were concocted or contaminated.
	
	
	The Crown also relied on the fact that there was no evidence of any discussions between the three victims before that time, nor was there any evidence of discussions having taken place between them in the period between the time at which the allegations first emerged, and the time at which they made their statements.
	


THE SECOND ISSUE â THE DECISION IN HOCH v THE QUEEN

The findings of the primary judge


	
	The primary judge found the following (at 14-15):
	


âSubmissions filed by the accused in this case state:

""The accused submitted that the proper basis for rejecting tendency evidence under s 101 on the basis of concoction is whether the evidence 'is reasonably capable of explanation on the basis of concoction'.""

The submission refers to BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 303 at para 110. The submission accurately states the judgment, but that judgment relies on the common law decision of Hoch v R (1988) 165 CLR 292. As the High Court itself has already pointed out, no reliance can be placed on decisions based on common law principles after the enactment of the Evidence Act where they are in conflict. Consequently, the decision in Hoch has no general application to the interpretation of s 101 of the Act. Similar statements about the applicability or principles derived from Hoch's case in determining questions of admissibility of tendency evidence in s 101 have been made in other judgments from the Court of Criminal Appeal such as FB v R [2011] NSWCCA 217 at para 35 and BJS v R [2013] NSWCCA 123 at paras 61-63. With respect, they suffer from the same problem. I note in BP that the Court also said that the possibility of concoction and contamination of the evidence was relevant to considerations of prejudice to the accused by the admission of the evidence. With respect, that does not seem to follow. The prejudice referred to in the section relates to the misuse of the tendency evidence by the jury. Questions of credibility and reliability or believability of the evidence are matters for the tribunal of fact. These are not questions that relate in any logical way to the jury misusing the evidenceâ.

Submissions of the parties


	
	As is evident from the findings of the primary judge, the principal submission advanced by counsel then appearing for the applicant was that that if the evidence in question was reasonably capable of explanation on the basis of concoction, it should be excluded as tendency evidence. That submission was based upon the decision in Hoch. 
	
	
	Before this Court, senior counsel for the applicant (who did not appear before the primary judge) sought to maintain that general position. Whilst he appeared to accept that difficulties arise when it is sought to apply decisions based upon common law principles to determinations under the Act, he submitted that the principle in Hoch had been adopted by this Court in BP and FB, and that the primary judge had erred in not following those decisions.
	
	
	In response, the Crown emphasised that the determination of any question arising under the Act was to be made according to the terms of the relevant provisions, and not by the application of common law principles which had been developed prior to their introduction. In this regard the Crown relied, in particular, upon recent observations by Basten JA in Saoud v R [2014[ NSWCCA 136 at [38]-[40]. The Crown submitted that these observations confirmed the proposition that common law principles had no application, and can indeed be distracting, to the consideration of issues arising under the Act.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that in these circumstances, the primary judge had not erred in declining to apply the principle in Hoch. It was submitted that although there were decisions of this Court which followed Hoch there had, more recently, been departures from it, notably by Basten JA in BJS No 1 at [26] and [27] and subsequently by Hoeben CJ at CL in BJS No. 2 at [65]-[66]. It was submitted that their Honoursâ respective observations were to be taken as reflecting the proper approach to the question of the continuing applicability of the decision in Hoch to the admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence under the Act.
	


THE THIRD ISSUE â THE RELEVANCE OF CONCOCTION AND CONTAMINATION TO AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF TENDENCY EVIDENCE

The findings of the primary judge


	
	Having referred to the decisions in Shamouil and R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; (2013) 84 NSWLR 363, the primary judge found the following (at 10-11 of his reasons):
	


âConsequently the consideration of the probative value of tendency evidence would rarely if ever be determined by assessment of the reliability and credibility of the evidence. In order to have significant probative value the evidence must be of importance or of consequence in the trial. It must be important in determining whether the accused had a tendency to act in a particular way, that is the tendency alleged.

The tendency if proved must itself be significantly probative of the charge that the accused is facing. The jury is asked to reason that because the accused has acted in a particular way on one or more occasion, that he must have acted in the way alleged on the occasions outlined in the chargesâ.


	
	His Honour then referred to decisions in DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; (2011) 81 NSWLR 568 and Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 before continuing (at p. 11):
	


âHowever the question as to whether the assessment of probative value ofevidence depends on the assessment of reliability or credibility was specifically addressed and settled in the unanimous decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Shamouil set out aboveâ.


	
	His Honour then concluded (at p. 12):
	


âBased on this authority there is no reason to consider the accusedâ (sic) submissions to the effect that the evidence might possibly have been concocted or that it is contaminated in some way. Those issues relate to the credibility and reliability of the evidenceâ.

Submissions of the parties


	
	Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that the decision in Shamouil did not preclude consideration of concoction and contamination when determining the probative value of the evidence. It was submitted that the decision in Shamouil established a general rule, the application of which was subject to identified exceptions. Senior counsel submitted that one such identified exception arose where evidence was contaminated or concocted. In support of these submissions senior counsel relied upon observations made by members of the Court in XY and in DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; (2012) 84 NSWLR 758 which, it was submitted, represented a ârelaxationâ of the reasoning in Shamouil. 
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was no basis, in any of the authorities, for the conclusion that the principles in Shamouil were to be relaxed. In respect of the reliance by senior counsel for the applicant upon the decision of this Court in DSJ, the Crown pointed out that the issues in that case did not bear upon matters of credibility and reliability. A similar submission was made by the Crown in terms of the reliance placed upon the decision in XY. In these circumstances, the Crown submitted that questions of concoction and contamination were relevant only to assessments of reliability and credibility, and thus irrelevant to any assessment of the probative value of tendency evidence.
	


THE STATUTORY PROVISIONS


	
	For present purposes, the Act contains two particular provisions which are relevant, namely ss. 97 and 101. Section 97 is in the following terms:
	


The tendency rule 

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence; and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

(2) Paragraph (1)(a) does not apply if:

(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100; or

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.

Note: The tendency rule is subject to specific exceptions concerning character of and expert opinion about accused persons (sections 110 and 111). Other provisions of this Act, or of other laws, may operate as further exceptions.


	
	Section 101 imposes further restrictions on the admissibility of tendency evidence relied upon by the prosecution and is in the following terms:
	


Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution 

(1)Â  This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sectionsÂ 97 and 98.

(2)Â  Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

(3)Â  This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.

(4)Â  This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.

CONSIDERATION


	
	For the reasons more fully set out below, I have reached the conclusion that there was no error in respect of the first issue, and that the conclusion reached by the primary judge that there was no evidence of contamination or concoction was well open to him. In those circumstances, it is not necessary to determine the second and third issues. However, as the court heard argument in relation to them, it is appropriate to make some observations about the questions that they raise.
	


The second issue


	
	In Hoch the High Court considered the admissibility of similar fact evidence, in circumstances where the question of concoction of that evidence was raised. The plurality (Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ) made reference at (296) to the decision of Lord Wilberforce in Director of Public Prosecutions v Boardman [1975] AC 421 at 444 before saying (at 296):
	


âHis Lordship there posited that the possibility of concoction - not a probability or real chance of concoction - served to render such evidence inadmissible. Indeed we think that must be right. Similar fact evidence is circumstantial evidence, as is implicit in what was said by Dixon J in Martin v Osborne (1936) 55 CLR 367 at 375 and as pointed out by Dawson J in Sutton v The Queen (1984) 152 CLR 528 at 564. In Sutton (at 564) Dawson J expressed the view, with which we agree, that to determine the admissibility of similar fact evidence the trial judge apply the same test as a jury must apply in dealing with circumstantial evidence, and ask whether there is a rational view of the evidence that is inconsistent with the guilt of the accused.

In cases such as the present, the similar fact evidence serves two functions. Itâs first function is, as circumstantial evidence, to corroborate or confirm the veracity of the evidence given by other complainants. Its second function is to serve as circumstantial evidence of the happening of the event of events in issue. In relation to both functions the evidence, being circumstantial evidence, had probative value only if it bears no reasonable explanation other than the happening of the events in issue. In cases where there is a possibility of joint concoction there is another rational view of the evidence. That rational view â viz. joint concoction â is inconsistent both with the guilt of the accused person and with the improbability of the complainants having concocted similar lies. It thus destroys the probative value of the evidence which is a condition precedent to its admissibility.

Thus, in our view, the admissibility of similar fact evidence in cases such as the present depends on that evidence having the quality that is not reasonably explicable on the basis of concoction. That is a matter to be determined, as in all cases of circumstantial evidence, in the light of common sense and experience. It is not a matter that necessarily involves an examination on voir dire. If the depositions of witnesses in committal proceedings or the statements of witnesses indicate that the witnesses had no relationship with each other prior to the making of the various complaints, and that is unchallenged, then, assuming the requisite degree of similarity, common sense and experience would indicate that the evidence bears that probative force which renders it admissible. On the other hand, if the depositions or the statements indicate that the complainants have a sufficient relationship to each other and have the opportunity and motive for concoction then, as a matter of common sense and experience, the evidence will lack the degree of probative value necessary to render it admissible. Of course there may be cases where an examination on the voir dire is necessary, but that will be for the purpose of ascertaining the facts relevant to the circumstances of the witnesses to permit an assessment of the probative value of the evidence by reference to the consideration whether, in the light of common sense and experience, it is capable of reasonable explanation on the basis of concoction. It will not be for the purpose of the trial judge making a preliminary finding whether there was or was not concoctionâ (emphasis on original).


	
	Brennan and Dawson JJ said (at 302):
	


âIf there is a real danger of the concoction of similar fact evidence it is consistent with the attitude which the law adopts toward evidence of that kind that it should exclude it upon the basis that its probative value is depreciated to an extent that a jury may be tempted to act upon prejudice rather than proof. That consideration is of special importance in cases where the fact to be proved is inferred not from similar facts which have been clearly established but from the concatenation of the testimony of a number of witnesses who depose to the occurrence of similar facts. The credibility of that testimony bears directly on the probative force of the evidence. Several witnesses all giving evidence to a similar effect are generally easier to believe than one witness. But if the witnesses have put their heads together that is not the case.â


	
	The effect of the decision of the plurality in Hoch was that at common law, the possibility of similar fact evidence being concocted rendered the evidence inadmissible. Hoch was decided prior to the commencement of the Act which refers, not to âsimilar factâ evidence, but to evidence of tendency and coincidence.
	
	
	In R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; (2003) 58 NSWLR 700 this Court (Spigelman CJ, Sully, OâKeefe, Hidden and Buddin JJ) concluded (at [74]) that Part 3.6 of the Act, within which the provisions regarding tendency and coincidence evidence are contained, reflected an intention on the part of the Parliament to lay down a set of principles covering the field, to the exclusion of common law principles which were previously applicable. The correctness of that approach was recently reiterated in Saoud where Basten JA (with whom Fullerton and RA Hulme JJ agreed) said at [38]-[40]:
	


âFirst, the provisions of the Evidence Act have effected change to common law principles, which are no longer to be applied. It follows that, whilst there may be assistance to be derived from the common law cases with respect to the underlying principles which inform the exclusion of tendency and coincidence evidence, those cases provide limited guidance as to the circumstances in which such evidence may now be admitted.

[39] Secondly, although there is no necessary harm in using concepts which became familiar in the common law cases, such as the fact that evidence reveals ""unusual features"", ""underlying unity"", ""system"" or ""pattern"", which are essentially neutral as to the level at which such features are demonstrated, the language of ""striking similarities"" suggesting a particular strength of probability reasoning is no longer apt, because it is inconsistent with the test of ""significant probative value"": Simpson J in Fletcher at [60], commenting on a passage from Hoch v The Queen [1988] HCA 50; 165 CLR 292 at 294-295.

[40] Thirdly, reliance on such language may distract (by creating a mindset derived from common law experience) and may provide little guidance in applying the current statutory test. As stated by Campbell JA in R v Ford at [125]:

""The Respondent accepts that the evidence in question has some probative value, but disputes that it has significant probative value. It submits that there is no striking pattern of similarity between the incidents. In my view there is no need for there to be a 'striking pattern of similarity between the incidents'. All that is necessary is that the disputed evidence should make more likely, to a significant extent, the facts that make up the elements of the offence charged.""


	
	There have been decisions of this Court in which Hoch has been applied to considerations of the probative value of tendency evidence for the purposes of the Act. In BP Hodgson JA (with whom Price and Fullerton JJ agreed) said (at [110]-[111]):
	


â[110] One matter that powerfully affects both the probative value of tendency evidence and the possibility of prejudicial effect is the risk of concoction or contamination of evidence. If the evidence of tendency from different witnesses is reasonably capable of explanation on the basis of concoction, then it will not have the necessary probative value: Hoch v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 292. However, this will be so only if there is a real chance rather than a merely speculative chance of concoction: R v Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261 at [111], R v OGD (No 2) [2000] NSWCCA 404; (2000) 50 NSWLR 433 at [74], [112]. The onus is on the Crown to negate the âreal chanceâ of concoction: OGD at [74], R v F [2002] NSWCCA 125; (2002) 129 A Crim R 126 at [48].

[111] Relevant to consideration of concoction are the factors mentioned in Hoch at 297, namely relationship, opportunity and motive. One of these on its own is not sufficient to base a finding of a real possibility of concoction: R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413 at [15], OGD at [111] â [112].â


	
	The effect of his Honourâs conclusion was that if there is a real, as opposed to speculative chance of concoction, the evidence will not have the necessary probative value and will be inadmissible.
	
	
	The issue arose again before this Court in FB. Whealy JA (with whom Buddin and Harrison JJ agreed), having acknowledged the decision of this Court in Ellis, said (at [35]):
	


â[35] It necessary to bear in mind that Hoch was concerned with the admission of similar fact evidence under the common law, and propounded the ""no other rational view"" test that had been adopted in Pfennig at 482-483 by Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ. This, of course, is not the test for the admission of tendency or coincidence evidence under the Evidence Act : R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700. Nonetheless, it could not have been said to have been an error for the trial judge in the present matter to approach the matter on the basis he did, namely to explore whether there was material that indicated there was a real chance of concoction having occurred. Mr Newton did not suggest otherwise. His Honour correctly identified, however, that there must be a real chance, rather than a merely a speculative chance, of concoction (BP v R; R v BP at [110]; R v Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261 at [111]).â


	
	The subsequent decision of this Court (Basten JA, RS Hulme and Hall JJ) in BJS No. 1 concerned an appeal against an interlocutory decision to refuse to grant separate trials in respect of counts of sexual offending which were referable to separate complainants. Basten JA, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said (commencing at [23]):
	


â[23] The language of ss 97(1)(b) and 98(1)(b), each referring to the evidence having ""significant"" probative value is not consistent with the requirement that there be no rational explanation for the evidence, apart from its cogency in respect of the charge. Further, the balancing test required by s 101(2) is also inconsistent with a general requirement as to probative value in terms of the Pfennig test. As explained by Spigelman CJ (with whom Sully, O'Keefe, Hidden agreed) in R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700 at [95]:

""The 'no rational explanation' test focuses on one only of the two matters to be balanced - by requiring a high test of probative value - thereby averting any balancing process. I am unable to construe s 101(2) to that effect.""

[24] As explained in Hoch, the rejection of propensity evidence on the basis that there is a reasonable possibility of concoction followed logically from the proposition that the evidence was inadmissible if there were any reasonable explanation for it, inconsistent with the guilt of the accused. The conclusion that the general principle is inconsistent with the Evidence Act must mean that, at least as a general rule, the subsidiary principle falls away. No doubt the reasonable possibility of concoction is a factor which must be taken into account in assessing the ""prejudicial effect"" of the evidence, but a more nuanced approach is now required under s 101(2), dependent on the circumstances of the particular case: cf Ellis at [96].

[25] That approach is consistent with the approach preferred by Hulme J in R v Le [2000] NSWCCA 49 at [115] (Hidden J agreeing) and in R v Andrews [2003] NSWCCA 7 at [16] (Heydon JA noting the issue as one not requiring resolution). On the other hand, there is a line of authority to the contrary, requiring that the principles adopted in Hoch be applied in trials conducted in accordance with the Evidence Act: R v Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261 at [107] (Mason P, Grove and Dunford JJ agreeing), applied in R v OGD [No 2] [2000] NSWCCA 404; 50 NSWLR 433 at [74] and [112] (Mason P and Dowd J agreeing) and R v F [2002] NSWCCA 125; 129 A Crim R 126 at [23]-[27] and [48] (Wood CJ at CL, Meagher JA and Bell J agreeing). The authority of this category of cases has been removed by the decision of a five judge Court in Ellis, which post-dated each of them.

[26] There are, however, authorities subsequent to Ellis which continued to apply the approach adopted in Colby and its progeny: BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303, and, most recently, FB v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 217 at [35] (Whealy JA, Buddin and Harrison JJ agreeing). In BP, Hodgson JA (with the agreement of Price and Fullerton JJ) stated:

""[109] The possibility of prejudicial effect with which s 101 is concerned is the possibility that the jury will act on the evidence otherwise than by way of its rational effect on the probability of a fact in issue .... An assessment must be made whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect that the evidence may have: R v Ellis ... at [94]-[95]. ...

[110] One matter that powerfully affects both the probative value of tendency evidence and the possibility of prejudicial effect is the risk of concoction or contamination of evidence. If the evidence of tendency from different witnesses is reasonably capable of explanation on the basis of concoction, then it will not have the necessary probative value: Hoch .... However, this will be so only if there is a real chance rather than a merely speculative chance of concoction: R v Colby ..., R v OGD (No 2) .... The onus is on the Crown to negate the 'real chance' of concoction: OGD at [74], R v F ... at [48].""

[27] The statements at [109] and in the first sentence of [110] are unimpeachable; the second and third sentences (relying on Hoch and Colby) at [110] are, in my view, inconsistent with Ellis and should not be applied as a general rule.â


	
	RS Hulme J said (at [42]):
	


âI agree with Basten JA that the approach to tendency and coincidence evidence for which Hoch (supra) stands as authority is not consistent with the terms of s. 97 and s. 98 of the Evidence Act 1995.â


	
	The issue was raised again before this Court (Hoeben CJ at CL, Davies and Adamson JJ) in BJS No. 2, which was the Courtâs determination of an appeal by BJS against the convictions for multiple counts of sexual offending at a trial which followed the decision in BJS No. 1. The reliance of the appellant in that case upon the judgment of Hodgson JA in BP led to the following observations by Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) at [65]-[66]:
	


âThe Appellant's reliance upon the observation of Hodgson JA in BP (see [61] hereof) is problematic. In BJS v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 239 at [27] Basten J identified the difficulties with that statement of principle and concluded that it was âinconsistent with Ellis and should not be applied as a general ruleâ.

[66] The Appellant's submissions on the issue of contamination go very close to requiring the trial judge to usurp the function of the jury by making a ruling as to admissibility which went considerably beyond the evaluative process required by ss97 and 101 of the Evidence Act. Moreover, his Honour was well aware of the risk of contamination and he excluded some of the proposed tendency evidence on that basis.â


	
	The primary judge did not refer to BJS No. 1 in his reasons. He did refer to BJS No. 2 in the passage set out in [51] above, although the terms in which he did so suggest that he thought that it was supportive of the position taken by the applicant. As is evident from the passages of the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL which are set out above (they being passages to which his Honour did not refer) the decision in fact supports the conclusion that the primary judge reached.
	
	
	In my view, the reliance placed by the applicant in the present case upon Hoch and those cases which followed it was (as Hoeben CJ at CL described it in BJS No. 2) problematic. Such an approach tends to overlook the decisions in Ellis and Saoud. As Bell JA (as her Honour then was) stated in AE v R [2008] NSWCCA 52 at [44]:
	


ââ¦Hoch was concerned with the admission of similar fact evidence under the common law and propounded the âno other rational viewâ test that was adopted in Pfennig v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461 at 482-483 per Mason CJ, Deane J and Dawson J. This is not the test for the admission of tendency or coincidence evidence under the Act; R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319â¦â

The third issue


	
	The primary judge concluded that questions of concoction and contamination were relevant only to issues of credibility and reliability. Having reached this conclusion, the primary judge found that the decision of this Court in Shamouil prohibited any consideration being given to questions of concoction and contamination. 
	
	
	The essence of the submissions advanced by senior counsel for the applicant was that in cases decided since Shamouil (notably DSJ and XY) there had been something of a relaxation in the application of the relevant principles, such that the possibility of concoction or contamination was a relevant consideration when assessing the probative value of tendency evidence.
	
	
	In Shamouil this Court (Spigelman CJ, Simpson and Adams JJ) considered whether issues of credibility and reliability were relevant to the determination of probative value for the purposes of (inter alia) s. 97(1)(b). Spigelman CJ (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) said (commencing at [60]):
	


[60] The preponderant body of authority in this Court is in favour of a restrictive approach to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and credibility are to be taken into account in determining the probative value of evidence for the purposes of determining questions of admissibility. There is no reason to change that approach.

[61] In my opinion, the critical word in this regard is the word could in the definition of probative value as set out above, namely, âthe extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment â¦â. The focus on capability draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude. It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude. Evidence has âprobative valueâ, as defined, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty.

[62] This conclusion is reinforced by the test that evidence must ârationally affectâ the assessment. As GaudronÂ J emphasised in Adam supra, a âtestâ of ârationalityâ also directs attention to capability rather than weight.

[63] There will be circumstances, as envisaged by SimpsonÂ J in Cook supra, where issues of credibility or reliability are such that it is possible for a court to determine that it would not be open to the jury to conclude that the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue. In that limited sense McHughÂ Jâs observations in Papakosmas that âconsiderations of reliability are necessarily involvedâ have application.

[64] To adopt any other approach would be to usurp for a trial judge critical aspects of the traditional role of a jury. In the case of evidence of critical significance, such a ruling by a trial judge would, in substance, be equivalent to directing a verdict of acquittal on the basis that the trial judge was of the view that a verdict of guilty would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. As the High Court said in that different, but not irrelevant, context in Doney v R (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 275, this is not a permissible âbasis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury functionâ. In my opinion, the same is true if a trial judge can determine the weight of evidence when applying sÂ 137.â


	
	In DSJ this Court (Bathurst CJ, Allsop P, Whealy JA, McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum J) considered an appeal against a decision dismissing an application that a number of charges alleging insider trading be tried separately. In allowing the appeal and referring the matter back to the primary judge, Whealy JA (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) said (at [56]):
	


âAssessment of the probative value of the evidence, whether for the purposes of ss. 97, 98, 101 or 137 of the Evidence Act does not, generally speaking, depend on any assessment of its credibility or reliability: Shamouil at 237; [60]. Nor does it depend on any prediction that a jury will in fact accept it. The trial judge considering probative value has to make his own estimate or assessment of probative value predicated upon the assumption that the jury will accept the evidenceâ.


	
	His Honour went on to say (at [79] and following):
	


â[79] In a practical sense there are two avenues of approach to be taken. First, in examining the coincidence evidence (together with other material already in evidence or to be adduced) the trial judge is required to ask whether there emerges, from a consideration of the Crown evidence, a possible explanation inconsistent with guilt. For regard to be had to the alternative explanation, it must be a real possibility, not a fanciful one. It must be a broad or overarching possibility, capable of being stated in general terms, even though it may derive from an individual piece or pieces of evidence, or the evidence taken as a whole.

[80] Secondly, the trial Judge must ask whether that possibility substantially alters his (or her) view as to the otherwise significant capacity of the coincidence evidence to establish the fact or facts in issue. Of course, if the trial Judge has already concluded that the coincidence evidence does not reach that level of significance in terms of its capacity, he will have rejected the evidence, in terms of s. 98. In that situation, the possibility of an alternative inference may, for the time being, be set to one side. Later in the trial, when the evidence has concluded, that possibility will become a matter for the jury to assess and determine when it comes to consider whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubtâ.

[81] The Crown â¦ however, stressed that at no stage in this process was the trial judge required to or entitled to assess the actual weight of any part of the evidence, or to make any actual assessment concerning the probabilities of any alternative theory. Nor was the trial judge required or entitled to make a comparison of the Crown theory and the probabilities or any alternative theory. This proposition appears consistent with established authority. Any attempt by the trial judge to anticipate the actual weight the jury would attach to the evidence is prohibited, as I have explainedâ.


	
	Bathurst CJ said (at [8]-[10]):
	


â[8]â¦it follows from the use of the word could in the definition of significant probative value that what the Court is required to assess is the possibility of the evidence affecting the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. It is not required to assess whether the evidence would have this effect, that is, engage in a fact-finding exercise involving an assessment of the reliability and credibility of the evidence: cf R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 226 at [59]-[67].

[9] â¦ the matters to which the Court is to have regard in performing this task is the evidence sought to be adduced either on its own or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to tender it. In particular, regard is not to be had to evidence either adduced or to be adduced by the other party to the proceedings. This also demonstrates, in my opinion, that it is no part of the Courtâs task to engage in a fact-finding exercise to determine the reliability or credibility of the evidence, or to form a view one way or the other whether the jury would in fact find the evidence to be of significant probative value.

[10] However, as Whealy JA has pointed out (at [78]-[81]) the trial judge in forming a view as to whether the evidence has significant probative value must consider by reference to the evidence itself or other evidence adduced to be adduced by the party tendering it, whether there is a real possibility of an alternate explanation inconsistent with (in this case) the guilt of the party against whom it is tendered. This is because the availability of such an alternative hypothesis will be relevant to forming the view required by the section that the evidence has significant probative value. However, this does not involve either undertaking the fact-finding analysis suggested by senior counsel for DSJ or reaching a conclusion that the explanation for the coincidence proffered by the party seeking to tender the evidence was more probable than an alternative hypothesis. Each of these approaches go beyond what is required by the terms of s. 98(1)(b) of the Act and would involve the judge usurping the fact-finding role of the juryâ.


	
	Allsop P observed (at [11]):
	


âIt is important, as Whealy JA recognizes, that there be no misunderstanding about the task of the judge. It is his or her task to assess the capacity of the evidence in the manner described by Whealy JA, not to assess what a jury will doâ.


	
	Subsequently in XY this Court (Basten JA, Hoeben CJ at CL, Simpson, Blanch and Price JJA) further considered (inter alia) the decision in Shamouil. In that case Basten JA (with whom Simpson J agreed) said (commencing at [66]):
	


â[67] The importance of Shamouil lies not in the precise language used (the judgment is not to be treated as a statute) but in the general principle it articulates. The operation of that principle may vary depending upon the circumstances of the case. In broad terms, the principle has three elements:

(1) in determining inadmissibility under s 137, the judge should assess the evidence proffered by the prosecution on the basis of its capacity to advance the prosecution case;

(2) it follows from (1) that the judge should deal with the evidence on the basis of any inference or direct support for a fact in issue which would be available to a reasonable jury considering the proffered evidence, without speculating as to whether the jury would in fact accept the evidence and give it particular weight;

(3) it also follows from (1) that the judge should not make his or her own findings as to whether or not to accept the inference or give the evidence particular weight.

[67] This principle does not produce uniformity of approach in all cases. The ""weighing"" exercise required if s 137 is engaged not only involves incommensurates, but elements that may interrelate in a variety of ways. For example, in the present case there are a number of possible inferences to be drawn from the recorded conversations. Those on which the prosecution relied, based on the key response of the accused set out at [8] above, were that his response -

(a) was made after he had identified who the complainant was;

(b) involved a realisation that she was referring to sexual activities between them, and

(c) involved acceptance of the occurrence of such activities.

Other available inferences were, for example, that:

(d) the respondent had not correctly identified the complainant;

(e) whether he had or not, he guessed she was referring to sexual activities and gave a jocular response, and

(f) even if there had been some form of acceptance of her suggestion, because no particular activities had been identified, his admission could not support any particular count in the indictment.

[68] Determining which inferences should be accepted was quintessentially a function for the jury. Before the exclusionary obligation in s 137 could arise, the judge had to identify the relevant ""unfair prejudice"". That meant identifying how the evidence (if admitted) would be left to a jury and wherein lay the risk of misuse. No particular element of prejudice was identified. Had it been, the risk that a jury would not appreciate the nature of the problem after proper direction had then to be assessed. The trial judge did not undertake that exercise because the previous step had not been taken. That was an error of lawâ.


	
	Hoeben CJ at CL said (at [86]-[89]):
	


â[86] In relation to s. 137 of the Evidence Act, subject to the following observations, I agree with Basten JA and Simpson J that when assessing the probative value of the prosecution evidence sought to be excluded, the court should not consider is reliability, credibility or weight. I

specifically adopt what was said by Basten JA at [66]-[67] above.

[87] Accordingly, I agree that the courts of New South Wales should follow R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 when applying s 137 of the Evidence Act. 

[88] Where I differ from their Honours is as follows. When assessing the probative value of the prosecution evidence sought to be excluded, that is, its capacity to support the prosecution case, a court can take into account the fact of competing inferences which might be available on the evidence, as distinct from determining which inference or inferences should be or are most likely to be preferred. It was that to which the court was referring in DSJ v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 9; (2012) 215 A Crim R 349 at [10] per Bathurst CJ; [11] per Allsop P and [78] per Whealy JA.

[89] Here, as Basten JA, Blanch and Price JJ have pointed out, there were alternative inferences available which were inconsistent with the prosecution case and which were objectively plausible. That is a matter which can properly be taken into account when carrying out the balancing exercise required by s. 137 to determine whether the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effectâ.


	
	In the present case, the primary judge found that the possibility of concoction or contamination of the evidence was a matter which went only to issues of credibility and reliability. He concluded, in effect, that in those circumstances the decision in Shamouil precluded him from having regard to any issue of credibility and reliability in an assessment of the probative value of the evidence.
	
	
	It must be emphasised that in the course of his judgment in Shamouil, Spigelman CJ made reference to the fact that the relevant authorities were in favour of a restrictive approach to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and credibility might be taken into account in determining the probative value of evidence. He did not describe that approach as one which prohibited the consideration of those issues when determining that question. In describing the approach as restrictive, his Honour recognised that there may be cases in which issues of credibility or reliability may be relevant to that determination.
	
	
	The effect of the conclusion reached by the primary judge in the present case was that the decision in Shamouil prohibited, under any circumstances, consideration of issues of credibility. That overstated the effect of the decision in Shamouil, although it does not alter the view I have ultimately reached as to the disposition of the present application.
	
	
	Those parts of the judgments in DSJ and XY set out above support the conclusion that in assessing probative value of tendency evidence for the purposes of ss. 97 and 101, it is no part of the function of the Court to assess, and make its own findings as to, the weight of the evidence, or to determine the likely acceptance or rejection of the evidence by a jury. However, they also support the conclusion that in assessing such probative value the Court may take into account, without determining the acceptance or rejection of, such competing inference(s) as may arise from the evidence.
	
	
	Whether that may extend, in a given case, to allowing a Court to take into account concoction and contamination is a separate question entirely, the answer to which will depend largely upon the evidence. The evidence in DSJ and XY did not involve any issue of credibility and reliability. Accordingly, the Court was not required, in either case, to determine the question.
	
	
	It is conceivable that there may be cases in which evidence of concoction and contamination gives rise to competing inferences. It may be that in such a case, those inferences are relevant to a determination of the probative value of the evidence. However, the evidence in the present case does not give rise to such inferences. For the reasons set out below, his Honourâs conclusion that there was no evidence of concoction or contamination was one which was well open to him. In those circumstances, the third issue raised by senior counsel for the applicant based upon the judgments in XY and DSJ does not require determination.
	


The first issue


	
	In my view his Honourâs finding that there was an absence of evidence of concoction or contamination was one which was well open to him. I have reached that view for several reasons.
	
	
	Firstly, the submissions made on behalf of the applicant that the primary judge failed to properly analyse the evidence, and that his reasons were inadequate, cannot be accepted. His Honour, commencing at page 2 of his reasons, comprehensively summarised the evidence of each of the three complainants, including their cross-examination.
	
	
	There are a number of factors which may bear upon a determination of whether evidence has been concocted, or is contaminated. One is the relationship between the complainants. Another is the opportunity for concoction. Another is whether there is a specific factor or factors which might act as motivation to concoct evidence. In the present case, there was obviously evidence of a relationship between that of the three alleged victims and, in turn, a relationship between each of them and the applicant. However, the mere existence of such relationships does not, of itself, support a finding of concoction or contamination. The evidence in the present case, as a whole, runs entirely contrary to such findings.
	
	
	His Honour noted (at page 3 of his reasons) that it had not been specifically put to JA that he had concocted his story. He further noted that no reason had been suggested to JA which might have gone some way towards establishing some motive for any such concoction. Those observations were entirely correct. Moreover, although his Honour did not do so, it would have been open to him to extend such observations to the evidence of the remaining two witnesses.
	
	
	Counsel who appeared for the applicant before the primary judge did not put to any of the victims, specifically or otherwise, that their evidence was either concocted or contaminated. Moreover, counsel did not put to any of the victims that there was any opportunity for them to concoct their evidence, nor did he put to any of them any factor(s) which might have provided some motivation to do so.
	
	
	The evidence in the present case established a spontaneous complaint by JA. That was followed by complaints by DA and DMA. Although those latter complaints were made following questions being put to each of DA and DMA by TS, those questions were open ended. They did not solicit, much less suggest, a particular response. There was no evidence that any discussions had taken place between the three victims prior to that time. There was no evidence of any discussions having taken place between them in the period which intervened between the making of the allegations and the making of their statements. There was also no evidence of anything arising from the discussions which took place between the victims and W which suggested concoction or contamination.
	
	
	It follows that I am not satisfied that any factual error was made by the primary judge.
	


ORDERS


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal on the fourth issue is refused.
	
	
	Leave to appeal on each of the first, second and third issues is granted.
	
	
	The appeal dismissed.

		10 August 2015",2014-11-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765455,R v Taane [2014] NSWCCA 330,"Judgment
1LEEMING JA:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2McCALLUM J:  I agree with R A Hulme J's reasons for dismissing the Crown appeal.
3R A HULME J:  The Crown appealed pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in respect of sentences imposed upon Kyle Robert Taane (the respondent) by Christie ADCJ in the District Court at Campbelltown on 25 June and 23 July 2014. 4The appeal was heard on 1 December 2014.  At the conclusion of the submissions for the Crown the Court ordered that the appeal be dismissed.  The following are my reasons for joining in the making of that order. Offences and sentences
5The respondent was dealt with for four offences of having sexual intercourse with a child above the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years contrary to s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The maximum penalty prescribed for such an offence is imprisonment for 10 years.  The respondent had pleaded guilty to two of the offences and asked for a further two such offences to be taken into account on a Form 1 document pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
6For the first offence and taking into account the Form 1 offences, his Honour imposed a sentence of 3 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 2 years dating from 7 February 2014.  For the second offence he imposed a sentence of 3 years 1 month with a non-parole period of 2 years dating from 7 May 2014.  
7The respondent had previously been dealt with in respect of two similar offences committed against the same complainant by his Honour Judge Armitage on 22 June 2012.  For those offences Armitage DCJ imposed suspended sentences of imprisonment for 2 years and 18 months respectively.  The respondent had breached certain conditions of the suspended sentence good behaviour bonds.  Christie DCJ revoked the bonds and resentenced in an erroneous fashion on 25 June 2014.  The matter was returned to his Honour by way of an application by the Crown pursuant to s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to correct the error.  His Honour proceeded to specify that for an offence contrary to s 66C(1) (sexual intercourse with a child aged 10 or above but under 14) the sentence of two years would date from 7 May 2015 and there would be a non-parole period of one year.  For an offence contrary to s 66C(3) the sentence of 18 months would date from 7 August 2015 and there would be a non-parole period of 9 months.
8The overall sentence to which the respondent then became subject was one of 3 years 4 months with a non-parole component of 2 years 3 months dating from 7 February 2014.
Facts
9The respondent is a distant relative of the complainant in that his mother and her mother are cousins.  The complainant was born in 1997.  At the time of the commission of the first of the offences dealt with by Armitage DCJ she was aged 13 and she was 14 at the time of the second offence.  The respondent was aged 25.
10In about November 2010 the respondent moved from New Zealand to Australia.  The complainant's father had arranged employment for him and he lived in the home of the complainant and her family.  
11In May or June 2011 the complainant and the respondent were watching a movie in his bedroom.  They kissed and he asked her if she would have sex with him.  She said she would if he used a condom.  
12The first offence occurred a few days later when the pair were again watching television late at night.  The complainant's parents had gone to bed.  The complainant went to the respondent's bedroom where they had sexual intercourse.  
13It was common ground that thereafter the respondent and the complainant had sexual intercourse on between 20 and 30 occasions in either his or her bedroom.
14In August 2011 the respondent told the complainant's mother that he had a romantic relationship with her daughter.  He said that they had been ""fooling around"" but had not been having sex.  He was asked by the complainant's parents to leave the house and did so.  However he continued to see her and to engage in sexual activity with her.
15The last occasion upon which they had sexual intercourse in 2011 was on a day in September when she was 14.  Her parents were away interstate and she was being cared for by her grandmother.  The respondent telephoned her late at night and she agreed to meet up with him.  She climbed out of her bedroom window and met him in a park.  They drove to some bushland and had sex in his car.
16On 28 September 2011 the complainant's mother accessed her Facebook account and saw entries indicating that they had been engaging in sexual intercourse.  On 5 October 2011 the complainant reported the matter to police.  On 11 October 2011 the respondent discussed the matter with the complainant's mother.  She encouraged him to talk to police.  He voluntarily attended the Liverpool police station, was interviewed and then charged.  He did not apply for bail and was held at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre at Silverwater until released on bail on 9 February 2012.
17On 16 March 2012 the respondent pleaded guilty and was committed to the District Court for sentence.  A final apprehended violence order was made which included a condition that he was to have no contact with the complainant.
18The respondent continued to have sexual intercourse with the complainant whilst the proceedings were awaiting resolution in the District Court.  
19For the purposes of the forthcoming sentence proceedings the respondent saw a psychologist, Ms Jenny Howell, on 25 May 2012.  He conveyed to Ms Howell that he had been ""drawn"" to the complainant and loved her.  Ms Howell considered that he seemed to express ""genuine and appropriate regret and remorse for harm done to the complainant and her family"".  She said he ""demonstrated an understanding of issues related to consent and sexual boundaries acknowledging that his behaviour was unacceptable"".  He told her that he felt ""very ashamed"".
20Ms Howell assessed the respondent's risk of further sexual offending.  This was carried out with her being oblivious to the respondent's continued sexual relationship with the complainant.  She noted, ""Mr Taane is not in a current intimate relationship"".   As a consequence, much of what Ms Howell reported, and the opinions she expressed, are (with no criticism of her) worthless.  One example is her statement that the respondent ""accepts that his offending behaviour is unacceptable and I would not regard him as engaging in extreme minimisation or denial"".
21The respondent also attended an interview with Community Corrections in relation to the preparation of pre-sentence reports on 17 May 2012.  Although the reports are not within the appeal book, it is safe to assume that he did not disclose to the authors the recent continuation of his offending conduct.
22On 13 June 2012 the complainant undertook a pregnancy test which revealed that she was four weeks pregnant.  It was the following week that the respondent appeared before Armitage DCJ when the suspended sentences of imprisonment were imposed.
23On 15 July 2012 the complainant travelled to New Zealand to live with her maternal grandmother.  Over the following week the respondent disclosed to her mother that she was pregnant.
24The complainant gave birth to their son on 24 February 2013 in New Zealand.  In April 2013 she travelled to Sydney.  Police made contact with her and she agreed to attend a police station and provide a statement.  She told police that between April and June 2012 the respondent had sexual intercourse with her on a number of occasions.  She described four specific occasions when this had occurred.  She said that it was consensual on each occasion.
25The respondent was arrested on 10 May 2013.  He participated in a recorded interview in which he made full admissions to being in an intimate relationship with the complainant and having had sexual intercourse with her between April and June 2012.  He estimated this occurred on about 10 occasions.  He also told police that he loved and cared for the complainant and that she had consented to the sexual intercourse on each occasion.  He admitted that he was aware that she was 14 years old at the time and that it was an offence to have sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 16.  He also admitted that he was the father of the complainant's child.  He was then charged with the four offences contrary to s 66C.
26On 6 November 2013 the respondent pleaded guilty and was committed to the District Court for sentence.  However on 7 February 2014 he was refused bail after having been arrested and charged with offences contrary to the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2002 (NSW) that involved failures to comply with his reporting obligations.
Personal circumstances of the respondent
27The respondent was born in 1986 and so he was around 25 years of age at the time of the offences and around 28 when sentenced.  He was born and raised in New Zealand by his maternal grandmother until the age of 10 because of the inability of his mother to look after him.  He then lived with his mother for a short period before going to live with his paternal grandfather.  He then alternated between living with him and his mother until the age of 18 when he left home.  
28He completed Year 11 at high school and then worked in a vineyard before obtaining employment as an arborist.  When he moved to Sydney in 2011 he continued to work as an arborist.  
29The respondent had no previous convictions of any significance.  Between the time he was dealt with by the two judges the respondent was dealt with for a number of driving offences:  driving whilst suspended (twice) and driving whilst disqualified.  He received fines, disqualification and a good behaviour bond.
30The respondent told the author of a Pre Sentence Report prepared in April 2014 that he had not had any contact with his son or the complainant.  
31The psychological report that was prepared by Ms Howell in May 2012 was tendered in the proceedings before Armitage DCJ and again in the proceedings before Christie ADCJ.  Ms Howell described a complex and disrupted upbringing of the respondent with frequent moves and separation from his biological mother.  She reported that his first sexual experience was at the age of 12 with a 16 year old female.  She said that there was no suggestion that he was a violent man and she did not consider his emotional identification with children as inappropriate or abnormal.  She found that he represented a low risk of reoffending and was unlikely to engage in predatory or paedophilic behaviour.  She said that he seemed genuinely remorseful for the harm done to the complainant and her family.  She concluded that, whilst he did not suffer from any psychological disorder, he was a somewhat immature and naÃ¯ve young man who appeared to be emotionally vulnerable.  Of course, as I have previously noted, Ms Howell was not told about the continued offending.
32His Honour allowed a 20 per cent reduction of sentence on account of the utilitarian value of the respondent's pleas of guilty. 
Ground 1:  His Honour erred in failing to consider the revocation of the s 12 bond imposed by Judge Armitage before imposing sentences for the fresh offencesGround 2:  His Honour erred in imposing sentences for the breach of the s 12 bonds imposed by Judge Armitage which were made totally concurrent with sentences imposed for the other offences 33Christie ADCJ initially said that he was going to impose concurrent sentences for the two offences he was dealing with and said they would each be 3 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 2 years.  34His Honour appears to have been unaware until after he had announced those sentences what he was required to do in relation to the breach of the s 12 bonds.  It was at that point he asked, ""Ms Crown what do you wish me to do about the breach of the bond given by Judge Armitage?""  Before she answered, he indicated that he proposed to fix a term of imprisonment of 14 days and asked if she wished to say anything about that.  He added, ""Whatever sentence I pass I wasn't intending to make it other than concurrent"".  
35The experienced solicitor who was appearing for the Crown first reminded the judge that he had omitted to mention that he had taken the Form 1 offences into account, observing as well that it would appear that he had not because he had imposed concurrent sentences of identical duration for both offences.
36In response, the judge confirmed that he had taken the Form 1 offences into account.  He said that in relation to ""the breach"" there ""maybe some validity in imposing something that would not be completely concurrent with the present sentence"".  He then announced that ""not so much as a resentence but at least as a penalty for having breached a recognisance"" he would impose a sentence of 3 months and order that it be served from ""7 April 2016 until 6 May 2016"" [sic].
37When the matter came back before his Honour on 23 July 2014 for s 43 correction, his Honour clarified that he had imposed a 3 month sentence from 7 February 2016 until 6 May 2016, thereby extending the non-parole period for the sentences he had imposed by 3 months.
38What appears in the transcript is unclear and confusing but what happened was this.  At first his Honour imposed an overall sentence for the offences he was dealing with (along with the Form 1 offences) of 3 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 2 years.  He then added 3 months in a purported attempt to deal with the breach of the s 12 bonds, yielding a total term of 3 years 4 months with a non-parole component of 2 years 3 months.  He then corrected that on the next occasion in a way that maintained the same overall sentence.
39The Crown is right to point out that the correct approach would have been for his Honour to have revoked the suspended sentence bonds pursuant to s 99 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and to have considered what should be done in terms of setting commencement dates and non-parole periods for those offences at the same time as he was considering the sentences to be imposed for the later offences.  All of this would have been guided by the principle of totality. 
40Be that as it may, the real question is whether the ultimate overall sentencing outcome is manifestly inadequate, a matter that falls for determination under the final grounds.
Ground 3 - His Honour erred in considering himself to be constrained by reason of the sentences imposed by Armitage DCJ on the basis of the principle of parity
41Christie ADCJ did not appear to notice that Armitage DCJ had taken into account the fact that the respondent had been held in custody bail refused for 4 months prior to being sentenced.  In any event, he made it plain that he thought the sentences imposed by Armitage DCJ were inadequate:
""I would be misleading the Court and the public if I did not say that I totally disagree with the sentence that was imposed by his Honour in relation to these matters.  That the Crown did not appeal that sentence I find not only surprising but absolutely astounding.""
42He felt constrained however:
""But I think it does oblige me to deal with this present matter somewhat more leniently than I otherwise would regard to be the case.  In other words I think there has to be at least some modicum of parity.""
43His Honour used the term ""parity"" but I think counsel for the respondent is correct in submitting that what his Honour was probably talking about was consistency.  
44His Honour later indicated that he had initially been of the view that the starting point (before allowance for the pleas of guilty) for the sentences he had to impose should have been 6 years.  Because of his perceived need to have regard to the earlier sentences, he reduced that to a starting point of 4 years 2 months.  
45The Crown submitted that the judge erred in feeling so constrained by the earlier sentences.  The later offences were of significant objective seriousness and there were aggravating factors.  Matters relevant to that assessment included the age differential; the exploitation of the youth of the complainant; her pregnancy; and that the respondent was on bail and subject to an apprehended violence order.
46In my view, Christie ADCJ was required to have regard to the sentences imposed for the earlier offences and to the circumstances of those offences in order for him to properly assess the totality of the criminality.  In dealing with the respondent for the breach of the s 12 bonds his only function was to specify commencement dates for the sentences and set non-parole periods.  He was not empowered to impose longer sentences for the later offences to make up for any perceived inadequacy in the earlier sentences.
47The ultimate question remains whether his Honour erred in imposing sentences and assessing the appropriate measure of concurrency and accumulation that yielded something that is manifestly inadequate, a matter for consideration under the final grounds.
Ground 4 - His Honour erred in imposing a manifestly inadequate sentence upon the respondent on 25 June 2014Ground 5 - His Honour erred in imposing a manifestly inadequate sentence on the respondent on 23 July 2014  48The Crown submitted in writing in relation to these grounds that the sentences were manifestly inadequate because of the following.
(1)""The respondent was a convicted offender of identical offences upon the same complainant who was 14 years old""
(2)""General deterrence was very significant"" and ""personal deterrence must have had a substantial part to play""
(3)""The number of aggravating factors present should have led to greater punishment than that imposed""
(4)""The failure to accumulate to any degree the sentences for the second lot of offences upon the sentences imposed by Judge Armitage which included an offence under s 66C(1) which carries a maximum penalty of 16 years, demonstrates error which combined with his Honour's approach to the issue of parity has led to the manifestly inadequate sentence that the appellant complains about"".49Nothing beyond those contentions was advanced in oral submissions.
50Ms Burgess, counsel for the respondent, submitted that the sentences for the s 66C(3) offences were severe rather than inadequate. There was a substantial increase in respect of the sentences imposed by Christie ADCJ as compared to those imposed by Armitage DCJ.  The latter had adopted starting points before allowing a 25 per cent reduction for the pleas of guilty of 2 years and 2 years 8 months.  And that was taking into account that the respondent had also spent 4 months in pre-sentence custody.  The starting point adopted by Christie ADCJ was 4 years 2 months.  It was submitted that a 6 year starting point that he said he would otherwise have adopted was manifestly excessive.
51Ms Burgess also pointed to a number of further errors made by Christie ADCJ that had not been noted in the Crown's submissions.  During the proceedings on sentence it was submitted that the respondent should receive ""the full discount"" for his early pleas of guilty.  His Honour responded that ""subject to anything the Crown might put I'd be inclined to accept that"".  The solicitor for the Crown did not oppose that.  But then his Honour allowed a discount of 20 rather than 25 per cent and gave no reason for doing so. 
52 Another error was that his Honour repeatedly misstated the age of the complainant.  She was aged between 14 years 7 months and 14 years 10 months at the time of the second group of offences but his Honour referred to her as being a 12 or 13 year old.
53Another matter was that the judge appeared to think that the respondent had failed to disclose to the authors of the reports that were before Armitage DCJ that the complainant was pregnant.  But the pregnancy only became known the month after those reports were prepared. 
Conclusion
54I acknowledge the matters the Crown identified concerning the seriousness of the offences (see above at [45]).  It is obviously a serious matter to engage in sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 16; the penalties prescribed by Parliament make that clear enough.  
55A starting point of 4 years 2 months for the latter offences is significant in all of the circumstances of this case.  In looking at the overall sentence, sight should not be lost of the fact that there was a further 4 months the respondent had spent in pre-sentence custody and so the minimum period of his incarceration amounts to 2 years 7 months. 56The sentences might be described as lenient (although I am prepared to acknowledge that reasonable minds might differ about that).  However, I was not left with any sense that the sentences were completely outside the legitimate range available to the judge in the exercise of his sentencing discretion.
57It was for these reasons that I agreed with the dismissal of the Crown appeal.

		19 December 2014",2014-11-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765458,Atkinson v R [2014] NSWCCA 262,"Judgment
1SIMPSON J:  I have read in draft the judgments of Adams J and McCallum J.  It is unnecessary to restate the facts, other than to explain the somewhat different approach I take.
2With respect to Grounds 1, 2 and 4, I agree with McCallum J that the findings concerning the objective gravity of both firearms possession offences (unauthorised possession of the Ruger, and unauthorised possession of the Colt) were open to his Honour.  Generally, consideration of whether an offence falls into the category of ""worst case"" is directed to the objective gravity of the offence.  Such a conclusion exposes the offender to the possibility of the imposition of the maximum sentence, but does not mandate that that sentence be imposed.  Whether such a sentence is to be imposed will depend upon the variety of other sentencing considerations.
3In this case, it is clear that the sentencing judge made the assessment that the firearms possession offences fall into the worst case category on the basis of the objective circumstances (including the applicant's motivation, or purpose, in the possession), but, having regard to other circumstances, imposed penalties that fell considerably below the maximum sentences available.
4In my opinion, the argument about whether the applicant had either firearm in possession for the purpose of re-sale or for use in his criminal activities, could have had little, if any, impact on the sentencing decision.  On-sale would clearly have been to the criminal milieu, with no control on any future use of the weapon.  In terms of criminal culpability, possession of a firearm for the purpose of on-sale is no better and no worse than possession of a weapon with the intention of using it in criminal activity.  Nor do I see any major distinction between possession of a weapon with the intention of using it to threaten, as distinct from using it to cause death or serious injury.  Use of a weapon to threaten in a criminal context clearly carries the inevitable risk that it will in fact be used to kill or cause injury, whether intentional or impetuously or even accidentally in the circumstances as they arise.
5For these reasons I would not uphold Grounds 1, 2 or 4.
Ground 3
6The substance of this ground of appeal is the asserted failure of the sentencing judge to have regard to the sentence imposed upon Paul Colvin.
7Paul Colvin was, in the applicant's proceedings, accepted as having been the person who had sold the Ruger to the applicant.  Colvin was charged with an offence against s 51(1A)(a) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW), of selling a prohibited firearm to a person not authorised to possess it; such an offence carries a maximum term of imprisonment for 20 years (that is, 6 years longer than the maximum sentences carried by the firearms possession offences committed by the applicant).  Colvin's criminal record and personal circumstances were scarcely distinguishable from those of the applicant.
8Colvin pleaded guilty and appeared for sentence before Keleman DCJ.  He was sentenced on 4 October 2012, six months before the applicant.  Keleman DCJ was not prepared, on the evidence before him, to find, beyond reasonable doubt, that Colvin had in fact sold the Ruger to the applicant (something that was accepted in the present proceedings).  He treated Colvin as:
""... a middleman conducting negotiations with [the applicant] for the purpose of selling [the applicant] a prohibited firearm in exchange for money ...""
He sentenced Colvin to imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months.
9The Remarks on Sentence with respect to Colvin were available to Bennett DCJ, when sentencing the applicant.
10The question which arises under this ground of appeal is whether principles of parity in sentencing are applicable: Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606; Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295.
11Primarily, these principles apply to co-offenders strictly so called.  But their application is not so confined: Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540 at [202]-[203].
12In this case, as the legislation prescribing maximum penalties recognises, the offence (of selling the Ruger) committed by Colvin is more serious than the offence of possession of the Ruger (committed by the applicant), in respect of which the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years.
13Bennett DCJ turned his mind to issues of parity.  He held:
""There is no sufficient comparison between Colvin and [the applicant] to justify concerns regarding parity in this case.  The determination of Colvin's sentence was upon his role as a middleman for the transaction in the acquisition of the pistol by [the applicant].  Upon the findings of fact I make that places his offence in a less serious category to that with which I am now concerned.""
This observation of Bennett DCJ was specifically directed to the offence concerning the Ruger.  
14Bennett DCJ went on to identify disparities in the circumstances of the two offenders.  Colvin stood for sentence in respect of a single offence, the applicant in respect of a total of seven offences.  Consistently with what I have said above, in a different context (see [4]), the offence of selling a firearm into the criminal milieu, as committed by Colvin, is at least as serious as possessing a prohibited firearm (whether for sale or for the purpose of criminal activity).  That is consistent with the maximum penalties prescribed for the two offences.15In my opinion, having regard to what was said in Jimmy, it was not possible so lightly to discard principles of parity with respect to the Ruger offence.  The disparity is enhanced when regard is had to the maximum penalties.
16That conclusion does not carry the consequence that the applicant ought to be sentenced, in respect of the Ruger offence, in the same way as was Colvin.  His possession of the Ruger cannot be separated from his concurrent possession of the Colt, nor of his possession of the significant quantities of ammunition suitable for both weapons, of his failure to keep the weapons safe, or from his possession of a ballistic vest, and the police badge and warrant card.  These circumstances elevate the seriousness of the Ruger possession offence, as well as justifying a significantly lengthier term of imprisonment overall.
17However, I am satisfied that a material consideration was overlooked.
Ground 5 (the consideration for the pleas of guilty)
18There was, before the sentencing judge and this Court, a complex history of the applicant's pleas of guilty to the counts on which he was sentenced.  Put briefly, the applicant believed that he had entered pleas of guilty at a much earlier stage than was in fact done, and it was accepted that he had given those instructions to his legal representatives.  It is clear that the focus of the applicant's legal representatives was on the count of conspiracy to murder, of which he was ultimately acquitted.  It appears that his intention to admit the other offences was never translated into the formal entry of pleas of guilty until 3 June 2011.  The evidence establishes that this was no fault of the applicant.  His Honour said:
""The reason for the delay in the plea until the arraignment is, as his Honour [Howie J in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1] pointed out, irrelevant because it is the fact of the plea forthcoming which provides utilitarian value.  That is a general observation, but [the applicant] chose his representation and indeed had the presence of mind to change his representation to another solicitor of his choice.  It is a matter for [the applicant] to have given clear and unequivocal instructions if his course was to plead guilty in the Local Court and to ensure that that was done.  There is no suggestion that his solicitors or any one of them along the way have misrepresented to him what they did or did not do.""
19In my opinion, this observation places too much weight upon the applicant, who was in custody, refused bail, and who was facing the very serious charge of conspiracy to murder.  Moreover, it has not been demonstrated to me that the delay in entering the pleas of guilty significantly affected their utilitarian value.  It is unlikely that these matters would have been disposed of in advance of the conspiracy charge.
20It appears to me to be implicit in the judgment of McCallum J that her Honour considers that the applicant ought to have been given the benefit of a more significant reduction in sentences, to the full extent of the 25 per cent envisaged in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383.  I agree with her Honour.
Ground 6
21The evidence showed that the applicant came from a significantly ""dysfunctional family background"".  His parents abused substances, and his mother was physically abusive towards him.  He himself also used illicit substances, and had a long history of psychiatric disturbances.  The evidence is such as to bring the applicant within the principles stated in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571.  It was therefore an error, as McCallum J says, to relegate those circumstances to only ""modest"" relevance.
22It follows from what I have said that it is necessary for this Court to intervene, quash the sentences imposed, and re-sentence the applicant.  Although, without the benefit of seeing the sentences proposed by McCallum J, I might have come to a slightly different result, I am prepared to concur in the sentences her Honour proposes.  23ADAMS J:  
Introduction
24The applicant seeks leave to appeal from sentences imposed in the District Court on 11 April 2013.  The applicant was arraigned in the District Court on 3 June 2011 on an indictment containing four counts, on the first of which (conspiracy to murder) he was acquitted whilst he pleaded guilty to the others.  Counts two and three charged the unauthorised possession of, respectively, a .22 calibre Ruger self-loading pistol, and a .45 calibre automatic Colt pistol, contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) (the Act), carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 3 years.  Count four was a charge of supplying 10.08 grams of heroin contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), for which a maximum penalty of 15 years and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units was prescribed.  In respect of count two, four offences were taken into account on the Form 1: unauthorised possession of .22 calibre ammunition contrary to s 65(3) of the Act (maximum penalty of 50 penalty units); not keeping the .22 Ruger pistol safely, contrary to s 39(1) of the Act (maximum penalty of imprisonment for 2 years and/or a fine of 50 penalty units); unauthorised possession of a ballistic vest contrary to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW) (maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment and/or 100 penalty units); and receiving a police badge and warrant card knowing them to have been stolen contrary to s 188(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (maximum penalty of imprisonment for 2 years and/or a fine of 20 penalty units).  In respect of count three, two offences were taken into account on a second Form 1: unauthorised possession of .45 calibre ammunition; and failing to keep the Colt safely.  In respect of count four, one offence was taken into account on a third Form 1: possession of 12 vials of steroids, contrary to s 16(1) of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 (NSW) (maximum penalty of imprisonment for 2 years and/or a fine of 20 penalty units).  
25The following sentences were imposed on 11 April 2013 - 
Count two (taking into account the offences on the first Form 1): imprisonment for 10 years commencing on 24 September 2009 with a non-parole period of 7 years expiring on 23 September 2016;
Count three (taking into account the offences on the second Form 1): imprisonment for a period of 10 years commencing on 24 September 2010 with a non-parole of 6 years expiring on 23 September 2016;
Count four (taking into account the offence on the third Form 1): imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years commencing on 24 September 2009.  
The total effective sentence was, therefore, 11 years imprisonment commencing on 24 September 2009 with a non-parole period of 7 years expiring on 23 September 2016.  
26The grounds of appeal are - 
1.  The primary judge erred in finding that the applicant's possession of the Ruger .22 calibre pistol fell within the worst-case category.
2.  The primary judge erred in finding that the Ruger .22 calibre pistol was acquired for purposes to do with the applicant's role as an enforcer and was not for the purpose of on sale; 
3.  The primary judge erred by failing to have regard the sentence imposed upon Paul Colvin for the purpose of ensuring parity and/or proportionality with the sentence imposed upon the applicant for the possession of the .22 calibre Ruger pistol; 
4.  The primary judge erred in finding that the applicant's possession of the Cold .45 calibre pistol fell within the worst case category;
5.  The primary judge gave inadequate weight to the applicant's pleas of guilty; and 
6.  The primary judge erred in determining that the applicant had reached the stage when his subjective circumstances could only modestly ameliorate his sentence. 
Facts
27Tendered on sentence was a document headed Facts Relevant to Sentence together with a folder of material from the Crown comprising witness statements, telephone intercepts and SMS transcripts, and photographs.  This material was not disputed.  The parties differ, however, as to the inference properly to be drawn from the material as to the use which the applicant intended to or had put the weapons, this being a relevant, perhaps decisive, factor in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences.  The following summary is taken from these documents.  
28The applicant had agreed with Michael Ibrahim to attempt to obtain a large sum of money from John Macris and a payment of $380,000 from Hesham Ibrahim.  Police searched the applicant's premises on 24 September 2009 and discovered the Ruger fitted with a silencer inside a kitchen cupboard, a box of .22 ammunition on the floor of an upstairs spare bedroom which was used by the applicant, together with a holster in which there were two magazines, each fully loaded with .22 rounds, a black bag hidden behind the cupboard where the pistol was found, containing two photographs of John Macris and a piece of paper with his address and the Colt pistol, which was loaded, together with the police identification badge and wallet and a pair of latex gloves; the heroin, steroids and body armour vest were found upstairs in the wardrobe of the spare room where the ammunition had been found.  One of the photographs had the applicant's fingerprint on it and the other, his DNA.  His fingerprints were also found on the piece of paper with the address on it.  The applicant obtained the Ruger pistol at the Parramatta Railway Station at about 7.30pm on 23 September 2009.  
29I have mentioned that the applicant had been acquitted on count one of the indictment.  He had not given evidence at the trial.  The only evidence in the sentence proceedings from him came from an affidavit concerning his intention to plead guilty which was tendered in the proceedings without objection, upon which he was not cross-examined.  
30As I have mentioned, the factual dispute concerned the purpose for which the Ruger was acquired and the use, if any, to which the Colt had been put.  The Crown prosecutor on sentence, had, in his written submissions, contended, in substance, that what the applicant had said in intercepted telephone conversations tendered in the trial (and the verdict of the jury) was consistent with the applicant having acquired the Ruger for the purpose of on-sale.  In oral submissions, the prosecutor confirmed that this was the Crown's position.  The situation concerning the Colt pistol was, however, submitted to be different.  It was submitted that the applicant possessed this weapon for purposes related to what he described as the applicant's ""debt recovery work"".  During the course of hearing submissions, the learned primary judge expressed disagreement with the prosecutor's concession as to the Ruger, indicating (with respect, rightly) that he was not bound by it.  The prosecutor then made further written submissions to the effect that, although the Crown's submission was that the Ruger was obtained in order to be on-sold, it was also open to conclude that the offender intended to keep the Ruger for what he called (in an intercepted telephone call on 11 September 2009 - dealt with below) ""special occasions"", when a silencer might be necessary.  The submission concluded - 
""Apart from noting that John Macris was a person from whom the offender was to obtain a sum of money, it is not proposed to submit that any particular action with any particular firearm was proposed with respect to him ...""
31That the applicant was a standover man, providing services for persons engaged in organised crime was not disputed.  For the purposes of sentence, the evidence relied on (and not disputed) was that of Detective Abdy as follows - 
""Q.  Now just finally there was a call ... where Mr Atkinson is suggesting that as part of his money collecting activities he just turns up and people just hand over money, it's just to - so it is not suggested we are being unfair, it's correct isn't it... the chit chat is usually covered with either the actual threat of violence or implied threat of violence...
A.  Yes."" 
32The applicant had also told Professor Greenberg - whose report was tendered by the Crown - that he had been involved with organised crime and ""bikie gangs"", stating that he was known as ""the enforcer"", telling Dr Greenberg, ""I made it all happen.  If told to enforce, it was my job, freelance work.""
33On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that the evidence did not permit the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant intended to do other than to on-sell the weapon.  As to the Colt, it was submitted there was no evidence one way or the other as to why it was in the applicant's possession and, although it must have been for an unlawful purpose, it could not be concluded beyond reasonable doubt that it had been or was intended to be used for his business.  
34This was the context for the primary judge's interpretation of the telephone intercepts involving the applicant, which led his Honour to reject the reasonable possibility that the purchase of the Ruger was only a commercial venture and conclude beyond reasonable doubt that it was ""acquired for purposes to do with the offender's role as an enforcer"".  His Honour accepted that the applicant's statements in the intercepted conversations indicated the purchase was for the purpose of on sale but considered these statements were misrepresentations made because the applicant did not wish to disclose to the seller his true purpose for acquiring the weapon.  His Honour also accepted that, although it was not possible to conclude that the Ruger was to be used to enforce payment of the debts owed by Mr Macris or Hesham Ibrahim, he was satisfied that the gun was acquired to be used in the applicant's business as a standover man.  His Honour concluded that he possessed the guns for the purpose of using -
""them in the services he provided for others engaged in the pursuit of organized criminal activities, and by his participation as a member of the society [outlaw motor cycle club] in which they conducted themselves in those pursuits, places the offences in the worst case examples of such offences"". 
35His Honour added - 
""Even so, upon the ... hypothesis that the Crown initially conceded [i.e. that the Ruger was acquired for resale], this was a .22 calibre self-loading pistol... [and the applicant] had a significant quantity of ammunition to go with the weapon.  It was fitted with a noise suppressor.  It could have had no legitimate purpose, and whether he had the weapon as part of his tools of trade, as the phrase has been used, as an enforcer, or whether he had it to sell it on to some other member of the underworld, for whatever purpose that person might have, I am of the view that his possession of this weapon in the context I earlier described, places this offence in the worst case example.""
His Honour came to the same conclusion as to the Colt.   
36It should be noted that the defence case at trial on the charge of conspiracy to murder was that the applicant's involvement was no more than agreeing to recover money as distinct from agreeing to kill Mr Macris.
Were the offences in the worst case category?
37In the course of the appeal we were taken by Mr Boulten SC for the applicant to the relevant portions of the intercepted telephone calls concerning the purchase and use of the Ruger to the effect that he was acquiring the Ruger for the purpose of resale.  It is not submitted that the primary judge was bound to accept the truth of these statements by the applicant.  The gravamen of this ground of appeal is that, even if what the applicant said was unreliable and did not prove positively that he was acquiring the weapon for resale, it could not be inferred beyond reasonable doubt from those conversations and from the fact that he was a standover man that he had acquired the Ruger or was in possession of the Colt for the purposes of this activity, thus, the conclusion of the primary judge in respect of both weapons was in error.  
38It is further submitted that, if the applicant merely acquired the Ruger for on sale, the offence could not properly be regarded as being in the worst case category.  In the alternative, it was submitted that, even if the Ruger had been acquired and the Colt was possessed to be used in some way in the applicant's criminal activities, this was not sufficient to place the offences in the worst category of case.  
39So far as the objective seriousness of an offence of the kind in question here is concerned, both the nature of the weapon and the purpose for which it is possessed represent, to my mind, the most significant factors.  It cannot be a circumstance of aggravation, of course, that the weapon in question is a pistol, since this is an element of the offence.  However, some such weapons are more dangerous than others, for example, a replica or single shot pistol is, for obvious reasons, less dangerous than the Ruger and Colt pistols in the applicant's possession.  They are semi-automatic or self-loading so that they automatically re-cock after each shot is fired, unlike an automatic which will continue to fire whilst the trigger is depressed.  Unless there was some particular factor which suggested they were significantly more dangerous than the general run of pistol or prohibited weapon to which the offence applied, there would be no basis for concluding that, as a type, possession of them would place the offence in the most serious category.  Many of the weapons in Schedule 1 to the Act (and thus prohibited under s 7(1)) are long arms and, accordingly, are difficult to conceal but, by the same token, are accurate at longer ranges).  To my mind, the Ruger falls within the middle of the range of seriousness for this offence.  The addition of the silencer added to the seriousness of its possession, taking it significantly above mid-range objective seriousness.
40So far as the purpose for which such a weapon is possessed, here again there is a wide range of relative seriousness.  Acquiring the weapon as a collector, with no intention of using it for any criminal purpose is obviously less culpable than acquiring it, say, for the purpose of committing a murder.  Acquiring it for self-defence is significantly less reprehensible than acquiring it for the purpose of committing crimes.  It is inescapable, of course, that the principal criminality of possessing a firearm is the risk of its use in criminal activities and the danger of its causing death or serious injury.  However, intending (say) to use the gun as a threat would, generally speaking, be less culpable than intending to use it to cause injury or, of course, grievous bodily harm or death.  Possessing a pistol for the purpose of resale is, of itself, serious (for reasons mentioned by the primary judge) because of the likelihood that it will be used for a criminal purpose and, very probably, for the purpose of threatening or causing serious injury or death.  Of course these distinctions all involve matters of fact and degree.  In some cases the distinction will be very material and in others less so.  Although bright line distinctions cannot, in the nature of things, be made, it is nonetheless necessary to address the question of objective seriousness as precisely as the circumstances permit.  
41In this case the context was that the applicant was in the business of being a standover man, one of the undoubted features of his methods being the making of threats which would be taken seriously by the victim.  Exhibiting a weapon such as the Ruger or the Colt with the implication that he would not scruple to use it if necessary would be an obvious use especially so far as the former is concerned, if it were fitted with a silencer.  The argument sought in this respect to be made by Mr Boulten SC for the applicant is that possession of the pistol for the purpose of causing fear is less culpable than having it for the purpose of causing injury. 
42It is agreed that the only evidence available to the primary judge and relevant to the issue was, in effect, the evidence that the applicant was a standover man, that he was engaged to act for Michael Ibrahim to recover money from two men and a number of intercepted telephone conversations on 11 and 12 September 2009 between him and Michael Ibrahim and some with others, including Colvin, who delivered the Ruger to him.  He and Michael Ibrahim used ""girl"", ""slut"" and ""dirty slut"" (and related language) to denote a weapon.  The distinction implied is uncertain, possibly (one or another) referring to a gun with a silencer.  By and large I have given the effect of the coded conversations which was not controversial.  
43In the call on 11 September 2009 at about 8.25pm, the applicant said that he attempted to find a gun but his contacts could not provide one and he did not know where to get one.  He said he ""was going to try and go out either Saturday night or Sunday"", to which Michael Ibrahim's response was, as I understand it, the applicant would have to find his own weapon.  About 20 minutes later the applicant called an unidentified male, and told him that his ""mate"" (presumably Michael Ibrahim) would pay for a gun if he (the applicant) could get one.  The man said ""one of the boys"" might bring a gun with him ""tonight"".  The applicant said he would charge (Michael Ibrahim) $6000 for the gun the applicant already had (presumably the Colt) and that way, ""We can get six for nothing"".  (This suggests, I think, that Michael Ibrahim was to pay for the gun for the applicant to have and, inferentially use.)  The man urged the applicant to wait until he contacted his mate to see if he could get a gun.  The applicant said he would prefer to sell his gun and get a ""nice girl ... for special occasions"", adding, ""You know what I mean, if we have a party ... or a buck's night or something, fuckin' pull her out ..."".  There is then a discussion about the noise of a party.  (This is a reference, I think, to some activity at which it was proposed to produce a gun and the desirability of a silencer.  The Crown pointed to this passage as conveying the applicant's intention to keep the newly purchased gun, if it had a silencer, for the purpose of his criminal activity.)  Three minutes later the applicant and the man talked again.  The latter suggested he had found someone with a gun and silencer.  The applicant said he knew someone who wanted one, ""and I can get a couple of bucks out of it too... because, honestly there, I could probably get five bucks out of it too, you know what I mean?""  (This implied that he had decided to sell this gun for a profit.)  The applicant asked if the man knew someone else with guns to sell and was told he would ask another person.  The applicant called again after a few minutes, but whether this was to speak to the same man or another is not disclosed by the evidence.  The applicant asked if he knew anyone with a ""dirty"" gun which he ""just needed to take out"", adding, ""like tonight or like it's for myself anyway just so I can take her out if I want to go out ... just find out how much she is for the night"".  Some two hours later (2.25am on 12 September), the applicant sent Michael Ibrahim a text message to the effect that he had found a weapon for $7000 and Michael Ibrahim should arrange for that amount to be put in the applicant's TAB account.  At about 9am, the applicant telephoned a female to say, in effect, the proposed purchase was not going ahead and asked if she knew someone else who could supply a gun.  The woman said she would ask around.  The applicant reminded her of someone who had ""the super duper ... thing ... with the laser light [which] I just want ... for myself"" but he thought he had gone to gaol.  The female agreed to make inquiries.  At about 7pm later the applicant sent Michael Ibrahim another text to the effect he had found a weapon which ""I will take out tomorrow night"" (I think meaning it would then be purchased, but it might suggest it would be used for a reason Michael Ibrahim understood) if $7000 were placed in his TAB account.  Several calls follow about the arrangements to pay.  
44On 16 September the applicant and Colvin spoke on the telephone discussing prices of weapons ($4000 or $5000), the applicant suggesting he wanted them for resale.  After a number of other (inconsequential) calls ultimately they met and Colvin delivered the Ruger and silencer to the applicant.
45As I have mentioned, the Crown prosecutor on sentence conceded initially that the tendered conversations were consistent with the applicant's intention of buying the Ruger for resale.  In rejecting this hypothesis, the primary judge said - 
""The difficulty that I have with that proposition is that it requires me to disregard the content of the conversation that was captured between the offender and Michael Ibrahim, and the terms of the conversation which had Michael Ibrahim willing to provide the sum of up to $7000 for the acquisition of a weapon, all occurring at a time when the offender was to attend upon John Macris to recover a debt of money allegedly owed.""
46Leaving aside the uncertain language of the intercepted conversations, this reasoning depends upon the assumption that they convey the entirety of communications between the applicant and Michael Ibrahim at this time.  The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the applicant intended to purchase a gun for resale to Michael Ibrahim for $7000, having acquired it through Colvin for $4000 or $5000 as well as them having an arrangement that the applicant would use the weapon to threaten the debtors.  After all, he already had the Colt if he needed a gun for that purpose.  In my respectful view, the evidence does not permit the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant intended to use the Ruger for the purpose of making unlawful threats, though the references to ""going out"" suggested such a use.  Given the nature of the applicant's criminal enterprise, it is reasonable to infer that he might have intended to use the Ruger to make threats but this is, as the evidence goes, no more likely than that he intended to sell it.   
47However, since the putative buyer must be taken to have some use for the weapon, which could well involve unlawful threats or even an attempt to cause death or serious injury or a threat to do so, the fact that the applicant himself did not intend to use it in these ways does not, to my mind, significantly reduce his criminal culpability.  This view is fortified by the circumstance that resale of the weapon would have entailed the commission of an offence under s 51(1A)(a) of the Act, carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and a standard non-parole period of 10 years.  The distinction sought to be made thus being practically inconsequential, it does not matter whether the primary judge erred in concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that the applicant acquired the Ruger for use in his criminal business.   
48Mr Boulten contends, however, even if the Ruger had been acquired to be used in the applicant's business, that would not place his possession of it in the worst category of case.  I accept the correctness of this submission.  An intention to use a prohibited weapon to kill or cause grievous bodily harm in the course of standing over a victim would almost certainly put the case in the most serious category.  On the other hand, although undoubtedly serious, an intention to use the weapon only to threaten or to sell it to a buyer who might use it for the same reason does not, as I think, place it in this category.  The fact that the applicant's business involved using a weapon to make threats does not take the matter any further.  Undoubtedly the offence is a serious one, but it does not, in my respectful opinion, come within the worst category of case.  The same conclusion must apply to possession of the Colt on the basis, to which no real issue was taken in this Court, that it was part of the applicant's ""tools of trade"".   
49It follows that grounds 1 and 4 have been made out.  It is not necessary to decide the other grounds of appeal, since the Court must consider for itself what sentences were warranted and whether they should have been passed: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1909 (NSW).
Subjective features
50The applicant is 34 years of age.  As the primary judge mentioned, the evidence as to the applicant's history comes from the reports of Dr Nielssen (tendered by the defence) and Professor Greenberg (tendered by the prosecution) together with the records of Justice Health.  Also relevant in the present context is his statement to Professor Greenberg quoted above as to his (longstanding) criminal business activities.  The primary judge referred extensively to this material and also to statements from the applicant's mother and the uncle of his partner.  
51Although a deal of psychiatric material was tendered, it was not, and could not, be suggested that there was anything in it which was connected with the offences in a way that could mitigate their seriousness.  However, it provides some insight into the reasons for the applicant's criminal behaviour and his prospects for rehabilitation and some brief reference to salient points is appropriate.  At the time of his examination in custody by Professor Greenberg the applicant said that his mood was normal and his sleep episodic, he worked out in the gaol gym three times a day, his appetite was good and he had lost some weight in gaol.  His energy levels were low despite his exercise regime and he reported poor concentration.  He denied current thoughts of self-harm.  
52He told Professor Greenberg that his father was a builder's labourer, killed in an accident while bushwalking when the applicant was 15 years of age.  In some ways, he had a difficult upbringing.  He said there was no physical violence between his parents in the home but at 13 he began moving out of home periodically, supporting himself by selling drugs, because of his mother's physical abuse towards him and other problems he had.  He fractured his skull at age five when bike riding and was unconscious for four days in Waratah Hospital Newcastle being in due course referred to Parramatta Brain Behaviour Centre.  He denied any long-term consequences.  At 16 years of age he moved out of home permanently.  He reported binge alcohol drinking from his mid-teens and suffered alcoholic blackouts, early morning drinking and alcoholic shakes.  He began smoking cannabis when he was 12, using up to 4 grams a day.  He also used LSD from the age of 15 and, amphetamines from 16 years and crystal amphetamine from the age of 21 though he has never injected drugs.  He said he had used cocaine from the age of 17 and regularly did so from 21, using crack cocaine from 2006 and heroin on occasion since 1995.  He told Professor Greenberg that he first joined an outlaw motorcycle gang at the age of 24 and had been associated with several clubs, but reported that he had distanced himself from his former associates since entering custody.
53The applicant said that he had been depressed for most of his life, with varying severity.  There is a family history of mental illness involving his maternal grandfather and suicide of a cousin.  (He told Dr Nielssen, however, that he was not aware of any diagnosed psychiatric disorder in either his mother's or father's families.) 
54The applicant was sickly as a child because of asthma.  He was suspended from school because of conduct problems and ultimately expelled, moving to another school but again being asked to leave because of behavioural problems.  He was a poor pupil but has fair literacy skills and is competent with numeracy.  Between the ages of 5 and 10 years he saw a school counsellor or psychologist because of his conduct at school.  He was not treated for ADHD or with any stimulant medications.  He saw a psychiatrist when he was 22 for psychosis and bipolar disorder and was prescribed antidepressants and antipsychotics.  At this time he was abusing drugs including methamphetamine.  In 2001 he took an overdose of alcohol and pills and was admitted to the John Hunter Hospital.  In 2003 he attempted to hang himself and was referred to the Newcastle Drug and Alcohol Services.  In custody he experienced hallucinations and was treated with antidepressants.  
55In 2010 the applicant was stabbed whilst in custody.  He fractured the bones in his right hand on three occasions and suffered a stab wound to that hand in a fight.  He has been using steroids for his bodybuilding but in 2001 attended a rehabilitation program and managed to remain abstinent for two years.  He denied using drugs in custody.  He has hepatitis C.  
56The applicant has had limited work in the open labour market, lawn mowing, as a fire sentry and a labourer.  He was on a disability support pension between 18 and 25 because of psychotic episodes from his drug use.  He formed a stable relationship with his partner with whom he has a four year old daughter.  
57Professor Greenberg diagnosed the applicant as having poly-substance abuse dependence, post traumatic stress disorder, dysthymia disorder with associated anxiety symptoms, and a history of drug induced psychosis and psychotic symptoms.  He has a personality disorder with antisocial features.  He does not suffer from any major psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.  There is no evidence of any current psychotic symptoms.  He suffered auditory and visual hallucinations whilst in segregation, having developed sensory deprivation symptoms.  Professor Greenberg did not consider that the applicant's use of alcohol and illicit substances was directly related to his involvement in organised crime or directly caused his criminal behaviour.  
58Dr Neilssen did not find the applicant to be depressed.  Nor was there an indication of underlying psychiatric illness.  The applicant's registration and retrieval of information was largely unimpaired and his intelligence appeared to be about average.  Dr Nielssen diagnosed substance dependence and abuse disorders in remission, dysthymic disorder (despondent) and drug induced psychosis, also in remission.  
59The applicant's mother provided a letter that was tendered on the sentence proceedings.  She said, amongst other things, that she had been visiting him in gaol, that he expressed great regret over his actions and is embarrassed and ashamed at the fact that his actions have caused him to be away from his daughter since September 2009.  She referred to his express desire to live with his partner and daughter and rebuild the family on his release from gaol.  She said that she was close and supportive of the applicant and would continue to be supportive of him (although this was not the picture of their relationship given by the applicant to Professor Greenberg).  Mrs Atkinson referred to the applicant's ""very difficult upbringing"" and the fact that he was affected substantially by the death of his father at a young age and the suicide of his cousin.  She mentioned also his addiction to illicit substances.  She believed that if he could refrain from using drugs and, being appropriately supervised on release, he would not commit any further offences and that his three and half years in custody to that point had changed his way of thinking.  The uncle of the applicant's partner also provided a testimonial in which he said, amongst other things, that he had visited applicant in gaol on a number of occasions and the applicant has expressed regret about his actions which have not only affected him but his young family and his intention to live a full and productive life with his family once he is released from custody.  
60The primary judge considered that the applicant's expressions of remorse and his desire to avoid reoffending when he is released should be considered ""with some reservation"", given that the applicant gave no evidence.  However, his Honour brought into account that the applicant had intended to admit his wrongdoing from the inception of the police search at his home and had persisted in his desire to plead guilty at the earliest possible opportunity.  His Honour concluded, however, that he was unable to come to the view that the applicant was unlikely to reoffend, given his antecedents.
Criminal history
61His Honour summarised this as follows - 
""His record of criminal antecedents began in November 1998 when he was sentenced in the Local Court to brief periods of imprisonment for cultivating a prohibited plant and larceny. Thereafter he accumulated a record of convictions for common assault (3), offensive language, intimidate a police officer (2), causing damage to property two, assault occasioning actual bodily harm (2), use an offensive weapon in company, drive whilst suspended (4), possess a prohibited pistol, offensive behaviour two, resisting police and driving whilst disqualified (3). There are other entries for traffic offences that I have not included in this summary.
In respect of two of the offences, using offensive language and intimidating a police officer ... the offender was taken to hospital on 3 February 2003 upon an order pursuant to s 33 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 ...The provisions empower a magistrate to order the defendant be taken to a mental health facility for assessment if it appears to the magistrate that the defendant is a mentally ill person. Subsequently, on 4 February 2003, the offender was convicted of the street offence and fined and sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act upon him entering into a bond to be of good behaviour conditioned as to residence and attendance upon a medical practitioner. That was in respect of the intimidation charge.""
62The possession of a prohibited weapon offence (with one offence of common assault on a Form 1), for which he was sentenced in March 2007, resulted in a sentence of 2 years and 3 months imprisonment with a 1 year non-parole period.  He produced the pistol following an altercation with the victim and threatened to shoot him (the common assault).  However, when the police were called, he left.  It later appeared the gun was not loaded.  
The plea of guilty
63The applicant relied upon an affidavit sworn 10 April 2013 concerning his intention to plead guilty to the present charges.  The affidavit was read without objection and no application was made by the Crown to cross-examine him.  The primary judge (with respect, correctly) accepted the truthfulness of the affidavit.  The applicant said that, when the police came to the premises and before they searched them he was asked whether he had any items of interest to disclose and immediately informed the police of the Ruger, drugs, ammunition, ballistic vest and steroids, admitting ownership of them.  He did not disclose at this time his possession of the Colt and the police warrant card and badge.  When he was arrested and taken to Parramatta Police Station, he was questioned about the items which had been found, including the bag containing the photo and addresses of Mr Macris, the warrant card and badge and the Colt.  He told Detective Abdy that everything found in the house was his, that he was in possession of it and, specifically, that the bag and everything in it was his.  However, he declined to answer questions about the identity of the person who supplied the weapon or the reason for which it was in his possession.  
64The applicant says that, before his first hearing in the Local Court, he instructed his solicitor that he wished to plead guilty to everything found in the house because he had already admitted to it but would plead not guilty to the conspiracy to murder because he knew nothing about such a conspiracy.  The solicitor advised him, in substance, that he should wait until the brief of evidence has been served.  The applicant, shortly after, changed his solicitors.  In due course, his new solicitor visited him at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre and, on that occasion, the applicant repeated the effect of his earlier instructions.  There were negotiations, it seems, as to the possibility of a guilty plea to the conspiracy charge with the other matters being placed on a Form 1 but the applicant rejected this suggestion and repeated his earlier instructions.  
65The applicant was rarely present in the Local Court, either in person or via AVL, and even when he was brought physically to the Court building he opted not to be present so that he was absent during the overwhelming majority of occasions when his matter was before the Local Court.  The committal proceedings commenced on 9 May and concluded on 13 May 2011 with the applicant being committed for trial.  He believed, by this time, he had pleaded guilty to the possession charges and the committal hearing was confined to the conspiracy to murder charge.  On 3 June 2011 the applicant's solicitor conveyed another offer from the Crown to accept a plea to the supply of heroin and possessing the two firearms, putting the other possession offences on a Form 1.  The applicant said that he was surprised by this and asked the solicitor why should he plead guilty again since he thought he had already done so.  
66In summary, the applicant provided his solicitor with unequivocal instructions to enter the pleas of guilty and was unaware that this had not occurred until the last conversation to which I have referred, believing that pleas of guilty had been entered in the Local Court.  He therefore had no reason to believe that pleas were not entered and assumed that, in accordance with his instructions, his solicitor had entered the pleas of guilty as instructed.  
67His Honour decided that he should accept and act upon what was contained in the affidavit.  The primary judge, citing the observation of Howie J in R v Borkovski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at [32], ""generally the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant because if it is not forthcoming the utilitarian value is reduced"", said that it was for the offender to ensure that his instructions had been followed and, in effect, he could not rely upon an assumption that his solicitors had followed his instructions.  His Honour concluded that ""fairness and justness dictates that in this case there should be a discount allowed of 15 per cent"".   
68Given that the evidence on the conspiracy charge depended to a significant extent on the evidence relating to the possession of the firearms and the applicant had already admitted both to that possession as well as the offences concerning the other items, there was very little preparation that would have been additionally necessary had all matters gone to trial.  In short, so far as any utilitarian value (and there was undoubtedly some) was to be gained from an early plea of guilty, the fact that it actually occurred late in this case, made very little difference.  The crucial question is whether the delay provides an appropriate basis for reducing the discount.  In my view, it was reasonable for the applicant to believe that his legal representatives had entered pleas to the other charges when he instructed them to do so.  The public policy underlying the availability of the discount for an early plea would be undermined if, in those circumstances, it was refused or reduced for reasons of which an offender, acting reasonably, was unaware.  Accordingly, I would respectfully differ from the primary judge's view of this matter and allow the applicant the full discount of 25 per cent on his pleas of guilty of the present offences.   
The sentence of the co-offender
69Paul Michael Colvin had sold the Ruger to the applicant.  He pleaded guilty to selling a prohibited firearm to a person not authorised to possess it contrary to s 51(1A)(a) of the Act, prescribing a penalty considerably greater than that applicable to its possession.  The factual basis accepted for the purposes of sentence was derived, essentially, from intercepted telephone calls and text messages between Colvin and the applicant which were also tendered in the applicant's sentence proceedings.  There was a dispute in Colvin's proceedings as to whether he had actually handed over the Ruger to the applicant, although he was present at the time this was done.  Keleman DCJ, who sentenced Colvin, thought it probable that Colvin had handed the gun to the applicant but could not make the finding beyond reasonable doubt.  This was, of course, a distinction without a difference.  Colvin was sentenced ""on the basis that he acted as a middle man conducting negotiations with Atkinson for the purpose of selling Atkinson a prohibited firearm in exchange for money, as evidenced by the recorded calls"".  
70Colvin was 30 years of age at the time of sentence with a criminal history commencing in 1995 with convictions including breaking entering and stealing, stealing, other offences of dishonesty, assaults, assaults occasioning actual bodily harm and affray.  In February 2007 he was sentenced to a term of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months for the offence of firing a firearm in a manner likely to injure persons or property.  Colvin's subjective features were not markedly dissimilar to those affecting the applicant, including periods of homelessness and problematic schooling, effectively ceasing at primary school level.  He had worked as a labourer and a scaffolder but was unemployed at the time of his arrest on 30 March 2011.  His drug use was also not dissimilar to the applicant's but he ceased this, unaided, when his second child was born in 2009 and since then had only occasionally used cannabis although he had problems with alcohol.  Keleman DCJ accepted that Colvin was remorseful but was guarded about his prospects for rehabilitation.  Colvin had pleaded guilty when he was due to stand trial and received a discount of 10 per cent for the utilitarian value of this plea.  Special circumstances were found.  The starting point for Colvin's sentence was 5 years, resulting after discount in an overall sentence of 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. 
Consideration
71It seems to me that an issue of parity is raised by Colvin's sentence for the offence of supplying the pistol to the applicant.  Given the very much greater maximum sentence (20 years) that applied to his offence, as distinct from that faced by the applicant (14 years) it must be regarded, on the face of it, as a significantly more serious offence than that for which the applicant was sentenced.  This difference is all the greater when the standard non-parole periods (respectively 10 and 3 years, for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness) are taken into account.      Indeed, even use of a pistol is, under s 7(1), also subject to a significantly less serious regime than the offence of supply under s 51(1A).  Categorising the relative seriousness of the two offences for the purposes of parity must take the statutory scheme into account, as reflecting the legislative scale of culpability - albeit within a very wide range of relevant scenarios - as well as the objective and subjective facts operating in each case.  
72There is, as Mr Boulten submits for the applicant, little difference between him and Colvin so far as their criminal records are concerned, both having convictions for offences of violence and possession or use of firearms.   Even if the applicant acquired the gun for the purpose of threatening victims in the course of his standover business, the fact that Colvin handed over the gun indifferent as to its use but plainly aware of the risk that it might be used, not only to threaten but of course to cause injury, marks his culpability as much the same as that of the applicant.  However, Colvin was a middleman who delivered rather than sold the weapon to the applicant.  This justified the significant departure from the standard non-parole period applicable to his offence.  Colvin's culpability was, therefore, significantly less than that of the applicant as the purchaser.  Furthermore, the applicant was charged with two offences.
73So far as objective seriousness is concerned, the offences are serious.  The fact that the Ruger was fitted with a silencer renders its possession more culpable than possession of the Colt.  I have mentioned that the offence carries a standard non-parole period of 3 years, representing objective seriousness in the middle of the range.  It seems to me that possession of the Colt is objectively in the middle of the range whilst that of the Ruger is somewhat more serious.  Of course, the 3 years specified in this regard is not prescriptive and represents only a guide or benchmark.  I have mentioned that the applicant is entitled, in my view, to a 25 per cent discount for his pleas.  This must result in a corresponding reduction of the non-parole period otherwise appropriate on the assumption that the balance of term is calculated without variation of the calculus specified in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  The Form 1 offences to be taken into account in respect of the possession counts increase the seriousness of those counts by making the possession more dangerous, as the possession of the specified articles facilitate the use of the weapons, which must inevitably be dangerous.
74It is reasonable to regard the applicant's background of a troubled history from a young age well into adulthood, involving problematic schooling, homelessness, significant psychological problems and drug addiction, as, to some extent, (to use the language in Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571; (2013) 229 A Crim R 337 at [43]) having compromised his ""capacity to mature and to learn from experience"" and remaining, ""a feature of ... [his] make-up ... relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence, notwithstanding ... a long history of offending"".  The apparent irrationality of the earlier firearms offence seems to reflect to some degree these problems.  It can readily be accepted that ill-advised early decisions - here, becoming involved with criminals, on his own admission - can lead to commitments and then criminal acts by a process which may be difficult to step away from, especially when addiction to drugs is present.  But there is no evidence that the applicant's business ""as an enforcer"" was other than a way of making money in a manner that suited his personality though this was, in perhaps important respects, a product of his earlier problematical life.  In no sense was the acquisition of the Ruger impulsive and there is no suggestion that possession of the Colt was other than a deliberate decision for considered reasons.  In these circumstances, the applicant's difficult upbringing approaches, if it does not quite reach, the inconsequential.
75It was not controversial that this Court should accept the primary judge's finding (with the reservation that the applicant gave no evidence himself) that the applicant was remorseful and his intentions to rehabilitate himself were genuine.  Nor was issue taken with his Honour's view that the applicant's antecedents did not permit a finding that he was unlikely to reoffend.  
76The applicant was taken into custody on 24 September 2009 which must be the commencement date of the first sentence.  Dealing with his pre-sentence custody, the primary judge noted that the applicant spent significant periods in segregation generally because of safety issues arising from his criminal associations.  His Honour accepted, on the evidence as to the nature of this imprisonment, that ""the time he has spent in custody has involved a measure of punishment greater than that suffered by others in the general prison population"" and made some allowance under this head. 
77The primary judge found special circumstances but made only a slight reduction in the non-parole periods.  The Form 1 offences are by no means trivial and reflect increased culpability for the principal offences.
78In respect of the offence of supplying heroin, the only complaint relates to the discount for an early plea.  For the reasons already mentioned, I consider that the appropriate discount is 25 per cent and the sentence should be adjusted accordingly.  This sentence was entirely subsumed in the sentenced imposed for Count 2, presumably for reasons of totality.  Since I propose significant reductions of the sentences imposed for the firearms offences, the question of concurrency is necessarily enlivened.  The same is the case in respect of the firearms sentences themselves, which were also entirely concurrent.  In my view the possession of two firearms rather than one is a significant increase in criminality, if not quite twice the culpability and some accumulation is necessary to reflect the total criminality involved in their commission.  Furthermore, supply of heroin is also a serious offence of a different kind, requiring some accumulation on the other offences. 
Result
79I propose the following sentences (after discounts in the order of 25 per cent) - 
Count 4, taking into account the Form 1 offence of possession of steroids: a fixed term of 1 year and 9 months commencing on 24 September 2009 and expiring on 23 June 2011. 
Count 2, taking into account the Form 1 offences of possessing ammunition and a ballistic vest, failing to keep the Ruger safe and receiving a stolen police badge and warrant card: a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months imprisonment commencing on 24 March 2010 and ending on 23 September 2013 and a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months imprisonment expiring on 23 November 2014.
Count 3, taking into account the Form 1 offences of possession of ammunition and failing to keep the Colt safe: a non-parole period of 2 years 9 months imprisonment commencing on 24 January 2012 and ending on 23 October 2014 and a balance of term of 11 months imprisonment expiring on 23 September 2015.
80The effect of these orders is to substitute for the overall sentence under appeal of 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years, an overall sentence of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years and 1 month.  This represents a variation of the statutory calculus, reducing the parole period somewhat.  However, in my view, the effective non-parole period is necessary to reflect the applicant's overall criminality.
81McCALLUM J:  I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Adams J in draft.  I agree that the appeal should be allowed.  However, I have reached that conclusion on different grounds from those stated by Adams J. 
82I would respectfully not share his Honour's conclusion concerning the learned sentencing judge's finding as to the purpose for which the Ruger was acquired.  In my view, it was well open to the sentencing judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Ruger was acquired ""for purposes to do with the offender's role as an enforcer"".  
83The document tendered by consent as the ""facts relevant to sentence"" included the fact that the offender had agreed to attempt to obtain a substantial sum of money from John Macris for Michael Ibrahim and that he was also seeking to obtain payment of $380,000 from Hesham Ibrahim for Michael Ibrahim.  It was also established by the material tendered on sentence that Michael Ibrahim had agreed to pay for a ""hooker"" (plainly a reference to a gun) for the applicant.  The Crown submitted to the sentencing judge, however, that ""the offender's plan for a firearm and Michael Ibrahim's plan for payment from John Macris should be recognised as separate"".  
84In my respectful opinion, that was an artificial distinction.  It is inconsistent with the intercepted material which, in my view, clearly reveals that Michael Ibrahim accepted, and treated with urgency, the need to pay the applicant for the gun before the applicant would carry out a further task.  It beggars belief that the applicant would attend enforcement meetings without a loaded gun.  In one of the intercepted conversations, he discusses his choices on that issue.  Adopting the code of referring to guns as ""sluts"", he says (in the context of his search for a new gun):
""see if there's just a nice girl around anyway, so, cause I'd rather just, we'll root the slut that I've got [apparently a reference to the Colt] and keep the...keep the other slut for special occasions...if we have a party or a buck's night or something, fuckin' pull her out"" [apparently a reference to the proposed new gun - the Ruger had not then been located].  
85At the time of his arrest, the applicant may not have determined whether he would take the Colt (which was loaded) or the recently acquired Ruger with a silencer (or both) when he went to find John Macris but it is very clear, in my view, that he acquired the Ruger for the purposes of his criminal trade as an enforcer.  To say that he acquired it instead for the purpose of on-sale or that he intended to make a profit out of the transaction poses a false dichotomy, in my view.  The intercepted material reveals that he had both objects in mind.
86The possession of guns for use in the criminal enforcement of debts must be regarded as approaching, if not falling within, the worst category of that offence.  If grounds 1, 2 and 4 were the only grounds of appeal, although I regard the sentences imposed to be severe, I would have been reluctant to intervene. 
87However, I consider that the sentencing judge's discretion miscarried in denying the applicant the recognised discount for a plea entered at the earliest opportunity.  That is the subject of ground 5.  Adams J did not find it necessary to deal with that ground but has indicated for the purpose of re-sentence that he would allow the full discount of 25 %.
88The plea was not in fact entered in the Local Court but it was uncontested that those were the applicant's instructions and that he believed, evidently on reasonable grounds, that he had in fact pleaded guilty to the present offences at the time he was committed for trial for the conspiracy to murder.  He had already made full admissions to police about those matters.  I accept the applicant's submission that the judge ascribed too much fault to him in concluding that he should have ensured that his instructions to enter pleas of guilty were complied with - he thought they had been.  In my view, this is one of those exceptional cases in which the reason for the delay must be regarded as being relevant: cf R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32](8).
89Accordingly, I would uphold ground 5.
90Adams J did not find it necessary to determine ground 3 (parity) or ground 6 (whether the applicant had ""reached the stage"" where only modest amelioration should be allowed for his subjective circumstances).  However, his Honour had regard to the issues raised by each of those matters on the question of re-sentence.  The material relevant to those grounds is set out at length in that part of his Honour's judgment, allowing me to state my conclusions briefly.
91It is logical first to consider ground 6.  The sentencing judge said:
I should say that notwithstanding my view that these are worse case examples of the weapons offences, I have not overlooked the subjective material that has been tendered in the offender's case which provides some explanation for his way of life.  The stage is reached though when the extent to which those matters can be relied upon to ameliorate the punishment that is justly required for such misconduct is but modest.
92The Crown acknowledged in this appeal that, if those remarks referred to the passage of time since earlier periods in the applicant's life, his Honour's approach did not accord with the remarks of the plurality decision of the High Court in Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37 at [43].  It is helpful to consider the whole of the relevant passage from that judgment (at [42] to [44]):
It will be recalled that in the Court of Criminal Appeal the prosecution submitted that the evidence of the appellant's deprived background lost much of its force when viewed against the background of his previous offences. On the hearing of the appeal in this Court the Director did not maintain that submission. The Director acknowledges that the effects of profound deprivation do not diminish over time and he submits that they are to be given full weight in the determination of the appropriate sentence in every case. 
The Director's submission should be accepted. The experience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person throughout life. Among other things, a background of that kind may compromise the person's capacity to mature and to learn from experience. It is a feature of the person's make-up and remains relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence, notwithstanding that the person has a long history of offending. 
Because the effects of profound childhood deprivation do not diminish with the passage of time and repeated offending, it is right to speak of giving ""full weight"" to an offender's deprived background in every sentencing decision. However, this is not to suggest, as the appellant's submissions were apt to do, that an offender's deprived background has the same (mitigatory) relevance for all of the purposes of punishment. Giving weight to the conflicting purposes of punishment is what makes the exercise of the discretion so difficult. An offender's childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender's recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender's moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.
93The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge's remarks should be understood to reflect the approach approved in the third of those paragraphs.  It must be recalled, however, that the judge sentenced the applicant almost 6 months before the publication of the High Court's decision and at a time when, as the judgment records, the accepted view was that the extent to which social deprivation in a person's youth and background can be taken into account, must diminish with the passage of time, as held by this Court in the decision under appeal in Bugmy: see R v Bugmy [2012] NSWCCA 223 at [50] per Hoeben CJ at CL; Johnson and Schmidt JJ agreeing at [57] and [58].
94In my view, it is clear that his Honour took exactly that approach, which was accepted to be correct at the time but which was subsequently held by the High Court to be erroneous.  That is not to say that the application of the correct approach as explained by the High Court would have conduced his Honour to a different result, but the consideration of that issue did, in my view, entail error.  My conclusion on that issue is reinforced by my view that the sentence imposed on the applicant was very severe, even having regard to his Honour's findings as to the seriousness of the offences.
95As to parity, it may be acknowledged that there were stark differences between the two sentencing exercises.  I do think, however, that the difference between the sentence imposed on Colvin and the indicative sentence stated in respect of the applicant's offence relating to the Ruger suggests that the two men did not receive equal justice.  In any event, in light of the conclusions I have reached as to grounds 5 (the discount for the plea) and 6 (the Bugmy error), it is not necessary to determine ground 3.  It is enough to indicate that I have had regard to the matters addressed by Adams J on that issue.
96In light of my conclusion as to grounds 1, 2 and 4, I do not agree with the orders proposed by Adams J.
97The judge started at sentences of 12 years for each firearm offence.  After applying a discount of 15% (rounded up to 2 years) he reached individual sentences of 10 years which, with one year of accumulation, gave an aggregate sentence of 11 years with an aggregate non-parole period of 7 years.  The ratio of the aggregate non-parole period to the total was about 63%.
98Had the applicant received the benefit of the full discount of 25% his sentence for each offence would have been 9 years; accumulation by one year would have produced an aggregate sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of about 6 years and 3 months.  
99However, having regard to the applicant's subjective case and the considerations to which Adams J has referred on re-sentence, I consider it appropriate to impose lesser sentences than achieved by that calculation.  Adopting the structure of the sentences imposed at first instance, I consider that the applicant should be re-sentenced to terms of imprisonment for 8 years accumulated by one year with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months for the first offence and a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months for the second offence, giving an aggregate sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months.  I am not minded to intervene in the sentence imposed for the drug offence, notwithstanding my conclusion as to the appropriate discount for the plea.
100The orders I propose are:
(1)That leave to appeal be granted;
(2)That the appeal be allowed;
(3)That the sentence imposed for the first offence, possession of the .22 calibre Ruger self-loading pistol, be quashed and in substitution therefor that the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole of 5 years and 3 months commencing on 24 September 2009 and expiring on 23 December 2014 and a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months expiring on 23 September 2017;
(4)That the sentence imposed for the second offence, possession of the .45 automatic Colt pistol, be quashed and in substitution therefor that the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole of 4 years and 3 months commencing on 24 September 2010 and expiring on 23 December 2014 and a balance of term of 3 years and 9 months expiring on 23 September 2018.
(5)The earliest day on which the applicant will become entitled to be released on parole is 23 December 2014.

2765466,R v Jiao [2014] NSWDC 352,"Judgment


	
	Counsel for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in this case is wanting to lead evidence from a Federal Agent regarding processes involved in money laundering. Counsel wants to do that because he is prosecuting the accused for an offence against s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 of the Commonwealth. An element of that offence, and therefore one necessary for the prosecution to prove, is that ""it is reasonable to suspect that the moneyâ¦is proceeds of crime.""
	
	
	Counsel for the accused objects to that evidence being led. He points to the record of interview between his client and the police. His client agreed to a record of interview and gave extensive answers to the questions she was asked. She provided an explanation for the more than $600,000 in cash which she had received at a casino in Sydney the day before and had attempted to remit part of to another account. Her explanation is consistent with her being innocent of any wrongdoing.
	
	
	The evidence which the Crown Prosecutor seeks to lead is from a Federal Agent of the Australian Federal Police to the effect that âmoney laundering syndicates regularly use casinos to engage in a form of money laundering.â I am quoting from particulars supplied on behalf of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to the solicitors for the accused on 25 June this year. The evidence, it is anticipated, will also be consistent with criminal syndicates depositing âcash into casino gaming accounts"", then moving âthat money from gaming accounts into other accounts, the intention being to create the impression that the cash originally deposited was one at the casino.â The money was deposited into an account at the casino in this case. The accused person asked the casino to remit all or, I think, part of it to another account.
	
	
	Defence counselâs point is that once one looks at the answers given in the record of interview, the money loses its suspicious character. That may well be right. But that is not the prosecution case, that is a statement of the defence case. The prosecution case is and must be that âit is reasonable to suspect that the moneyâ¦is proceeds of crimeâ.
	
	
	To my mind it is relevant to the proof of that component of the alleged crime that the prosecution through a witness should be able to give evidence to the effect that I have summarised.
	
	
	Defence counsel objected to the use of a particular expression - âlayeringâ - which, he complained, was not defined. He points out, probably correctly, that it was not his responsibility to ascertain the definition, given that it is the responsibility of the prosecution to prove the expertise of its witnesses. However, the Crown Prosecutor has indicated that he does not propose to lead evidence by reference to that term.
	
	
	I regard the evidence as relevant and admissible in that it tends to prove that âit is reasonable to suspect that the moneyâ¦is proceeds of crimeâ. I therefore propose to allow the witness to give evidence to that effect

		14 September 2015",2014-12-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765467,Lachlan Wilson v R [2014] NSWCCA 266,"Judgment

1THE COURT: Lachlan Wilson (the appellant) was charged with the following offences on a joint indictment presented on 23 February 2011:

""Count 1

Between about 15 July 2008 and 13 August 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did import into Australia a substance, namely a commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine, a border controlled precursor, intending to use, or believing that another person intended to use any of that substance to manufacture a controlled drug.

Contrary to s. 307.11(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth)

Count 2

Between about 15 July 2008 and 14 August 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely pseudoephedrine, being not less than the commercial quantity and not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to pseudoephedrine.

Contrary to s.25(2) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW)"".

2The appellant, together with his co-accused (Yousef Jidah, Ibrahim Jidah, DS and Ryan Kapral), was tried before Judge Frearson SC and a jury. He was convicted on Count 2 (the supply count) but the jury were unable to reach a verdict on Count 1 (the importation count). The appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months commencing on 3 September 2010 with an additional term of 5 years and 8 months (a head sentence of 16 years and 2 months).

3The appellant has sought leave to appeal against his conviction and against the sentence imposed on him. As his first ground of appeal against his conviction involves questions of mixed fact and law, leave was required. We are of the opinion that leave should be given.

4The appellant raises two grounds of appeal against his conviction:

""Ground 1 - The verdict on Count 2 was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the whole of the evidence and all of the relevant facts and circumstances of the case including the appellant's discharge (the jury being unable to reach a unanimous verdict) on Count 1.

Ground 2 - The trial miscarried because the appellant was charged with inconsistent charges.""

5The appeal was heard at the same time as the appeals of his convicted co-accused, Yousef Jidah, Ibrahim Jidah and DS (Ryan Kapral having been acquitted). They appealed against their conviction and sentence for offences relating to the same quantity of drugs. Another person involved in the alleged offences, ES, pleaded guilty. 

The relevant legislation
6Section 307.11(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Code) provides as follows:

""307.11 Importing and exporting commercial quantities of border controlled precursors

(1) A person commits an offence if:

(a) the person imports or exports a substance; and

(b) either or both of the following apply:

(i) the person intends to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug;

(ii) the person believes that another person intends to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug; and

(c) the substance is a border controlled precursor; and

(d) the quantity imported or exported is a commercial quantity.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years or 5,000 penalty units, or both.

(2) The fault element for paragraph (1)(c) is recklessness.

(3) Absolute liability applies to paragraph (1)(d).""

7Section 3.1 of the Code provides that an offence consists of physical elements and fault elements. Section 3.2 is in the following terms:

""3.2 Establishing guilt in respect of offences

In order for a person to be found guilty of committing an offence the following must be proved:

(a) the existence of such physical elements as are, under the law creating the offence, relevant to establishing guilt;

(b) in respect of each such physical element for which a fault element is required, one of the fault elements for the physical element.""

8At the time of the offence the word ""import"" was not defined in the Code. In R v Campbell [2008] NSWCCA 214; (2008) 73 NSWLR 272 at [128], the physical element of ""imports"" was held to be completed at the time the goods in question were delivered to a place where they would remain in Australia. In that case it was when the goods were picked up by the importer's agent or at the latest when they arrived at his premises and before they were unpacked. The Court also held at [43]-[44] and [137] that the physical element and the fault element must co-exist.

9Section 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (the DMT Act) provides as follows:

""25(2) A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.""

10""Supply"" is defined in s 3 of the DMT Act in the following terms:

""supply includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things.""

11""Prohibited drug"" is defined in s 3 of the DMT Act as any substance other than a prohibited plant specified in Sch 1. Pseudoephedrine is specified in Sch 1. A large commercial quantity of that drug is 5 kg.

12Section 33(3) of the DMT Act provides that the maximum penalty for s 25(2), where the offence involved not less than the large commercial quantity, is life imprisonment, a fine of 5,000 penalty units or both. The standard non-parole period is 15 years imprisonment.

Factual background 
13On 15 July 2008, a shipping container (identified in the evidence as container TTNU) left Bangkok, Thailand, on board the ship ""Northern Victory"". It arrived in Sydney at Port Botany on 4 August. The consignor was nominated as Royale Colourstones and the consignee, LJ Wilson Imports Pty Ltd, a company controlled by the appellant. 

14On 8 August 2008, the container was opened and inspected by Customs officers. They identified 45 boxes labelled as containing ""Tipco Juices"". The boxes contained plastic bags full of white tablets. The tablets tested positive to pseudoephedrine. In total, the boxes contained just over 2.6 million tablets, with a gross weight of just over 603 kg, consisting of just over 125 kg of pure pseudoephedrine. The street value of the shipment, if converted into 69-111 kg high-grade methamphetamine or ""ice"", was estimated to be between $34.5 million and $55.5 million. 

15Between 9 and 11 August 2008, the Australian Federal Police removed the pseudoephedrine tablets; replaced them with inert tablets; resealed the boxes to resemble their original condition and repacked the container into which were installed listening devices. From this time the police had the container under constant surveillance. 

16On 12 August 2008, container TTNU (and another container, referred to in the evidence as FSCU) were both released by Customs as part of a controlled delivery. 

17At 1.54 pm that day, Michael Terrance, a Customs broker who had previously been retained and utilised by the appellant or his company, sent an email to the appellant advising that ""both containers are now clear for delivery"". At 2.02 pm, the appellant (who at that time was in Thailand) sent a SMS message to DS advising him that ""both containers are now done with customs"". DS was ES's cousin and worked for the appellant. It was the Crown case that the unpacking of the drugs from the container by DS and people co-opted by ES, and the on-supply of those drugs was to occur while the appellant was in Thailand, in that way distancing him from both the importation of the drugs and their on-supply. 

18On 13 August 2008, container TTNU was loaded onto a truck, and delivered to the appellant's warehouse at Arndell Park (the warehouse) under police surveillance. It arrived shortly before 1 pm. It was signed for by DS and taken into the warehouse. Later that afternoon, it was unpacked by DS with the assistance of others (including Ryan Karpal, who was acquitted) and the boxes loaded onto another truck. That evening the truck, driven by DS, transported the 45 boxes containing the controlled delivery tablets from the warehouse to Penrith Auction House (the auction house). 

19At about 6.30 pm that evening, Yousef Jidah and his brother Ibrahim Jidah arrived at the auction house. Yousef was driving a white Mitsubishi Express van and Ibrahim was driving a blue BMW M3 sedan. Yousef's van entered the car park and was loaded with the 45 boxes while Ibrahim remained in his vehicle close by.

20Yousef Jidah then drove towards Blacktown, with Ibrahim Jidah following closely behind. Police followed both cars. The Crown case was that Ibrahim conducted ""counter surveillance"" and that, when they arrived in Blacktown, at least Ibrahim had detected that they were being followed. He telephoned ES to inform him. ES instructed Ibrahim to get Yousef to drive the vehicle to another location and ""leave it"". 

21Ibrahim Jidah gave the instructions to his brother who drove the van to a shopping centre at Blacktown. The van was left in a car park. Intercepted telephone calls at this time indicate that Ibrahim was in contact with his brother and providing him with details about what to do with the van. At around that time ES called DS (who was at the warehouse) and informed him that the Jidahs believed that they had been followed.

22Later that evening, the van was retrieved from the shopping centre carpark and driven back to the warehouse in Arndell Park. The Crown case was that some or all of the boxes were unloaded from the warehouse that night. 

23On Thursday 14 August 2008, ES sent SMS messages to DS asking whether there were ""any probs"" and ""is there a car antenna@"". The Crown case was that these messages referred to ES's concern that the shipment might have contained listening devices. DS gave evidence that he didn't know what ES was talking about when he asked if there were ""any probs"". He thought ES's reference to a ""car antenna"" was referring to an aerial for DHL tracking. He said in cross examination that he wasn't actually working at that stage and was lying to ES.

24Around this time Yousef Jidah and DS were inside the warehouse with the boxes. ES was in telephone contact with Ibrahim Jidah and DS. They discussed the unpacking. 

25At 8.22 am that day, Federal Police entered the warehouse and arrested DS, Yousef Jidah and another man who was not charged. Ibrahim Jidah, who was sitting in his car opposite the warehouse, was also arrested. Police located all 45 boxes either in the white Mitsubishi van, on a hand trolley, in the TTNU container or on the floor of the warehouse. All of the 45 boxes, save for five, had been opened and resealed.

26The appellant was arrested at Sydney Airport on 19 August 2008, on his return from Thailand. 

The appellant's knowledge of the importation of the drugs he was convicted of supplying
27In proof of the first of two counts on the indictment laid against the appellant, the Crown alleged that he agreed with ES to import a commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine, being a border controlled precursor, intending, or believing, that another person intended to use any of that substance to manufacture a controlled drug, contrary to s 307.11(1) of the Code. In proof of the second count, the Crown alleged that he knowingly took part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine contrary to s 25(2) of the DMT Act. It was not in dispute that the drugs imported were the drugs that the Crown alleged he supplied.

28On the Crown case, ES travelled to Thailand around the time container TTNU was packed to source and oversee the export of the drugs, and the appellant was to facilitate their importation through his company, LJ Wilson Imports Pty Ltd. The company was an importer of foodstuffs and had its warehouse at Arndell Park. Between September 2007 and July 2008 the company imported approximately 12 containers of foodstuffs for wholesale. It was the Crown case that the company was utilised to provide a cloak of legitimacy for the importation. 

29Although ES was indicted on a charge of aid, abet, counsel or procure the importation of the drug, to which he entered a plea of guilty, the Crown case was that ES, with the assistance of the appellant, played a significant if not a central role in the enterprise incorporating both the importation of the drugs and their on-supply. DS worked for the appellant and was involved in what the Crown described as the ""importation"" phase of the enterprise. Ibrahim Jidah and Yousef Jidah, both friends of ES, were co-opted into the scheme by ES but did not become involved until the consignment had reached what the Crown described as the ""supply"" phase. 

30ES and the appellant were friends who co-owned two racehorses. On the Crown case, all communications between the appellant and ES about the importation were coded, and at times they utilised horse racing terms. The appellant gave evidence at trial that the conversations relied upon by the Crown as coded communications were actually about betting, barrier trials, and the sale and gelding of the racehorses the appellant managed and co-owned with ES, being ""Danehill Smile"", ""Rich Hussy"" and ""War Stories"", or in which the appellant's company had an interest, namely ""Red Lord"" and ""Dealer Principal"".

31On 17 June 2008, ES departed for Thailand. 

32On 26 June 2008, the appellant (who was in Australia) received a SMS message from an unknown source asking that he contact ""royale_colour@yahoo.com"" and request a ""product list"" (as noted above at par [13], the consignor of container TTNU, containing the drugs, was Royale Colourstones). 

33The appellant replied via email on 27 June 2008 requesting a ""list of available products"". Later that day ES and the appellant communicated via SMS message in the following terms:

""ES: Did you get that message?LW: YepES: My girlfriend's waiting. 
... 

ES: Remember how I told you she has that new friend that you would like well send her your details she wants to hook up with you, r u drinking LW: I sent the details straight away ... but she hasn't got back to me.""

The Crown case was that in these SMS messages ES was confirming that the appellant was in contact with the consignor, Royale Colourstones. 

34On 28 June 2008, the appellant received an email from ""Jhon Levlee"" of Royale Colourstones attaching a list of products including ""Tipco Juices"".

35Between 30 June and 21 July 2008, the appellant and Jhon Levlee communicated from time to time regarding the arrival of shipping containers. In particular, the Crown asserted email communications between Jhon Levlee and the appellant from 11 to 13 July (in which the appellant inquired as to when ""the container"" was due to arrive in Sydney, and Jhon Levlee responded around ""22nd to the 25th of this month"") related to the anticipated arrival of both container CRXU (which did not contain drugs) and container TTNU (which contained the pseudoephedrine). 

36On 14 July 2008, the appellant (who had not yet left for Thailand) sent an email to his Customs broker in the following terms:

""I have another container due to arrive between the 22nd and the 25th of this month ... I have had to change suppliers ... probably causes me more headaches with customs in terms of release time ... going on holidays from Monday the 4th of August through to 13th of August, so it would be ideal if could be released before I head off ...""

37The day the container TTNU left Bangkok, consigned for Sydney (Tuesday 15 July 2008), the appellant and ES had a conversation, which the Crown asserted concerned the anticipated delivery of both containers. It was the Crown case that the references to the horses ""Rich Hussy"" and ""War Stories"" were coded references to the containers CRXU and TTNU and their anticipated date of delivery:

""ES: Hey mate you sure that horse is racin' on the 25th? LW: Not sure. Ideally......
ES: You just had a wild guess?
LW: No, there's a race on the 26th... or the 20...well the Saturday at Rand... Canterbury
ES: No not that one, not Rich Hussy, the other horse
LW: What other horse?
ES: War Stories
LW: No, I never said anything about War Stories... I dunno when War Stories is running... I haven't ever said a thing about War Stories
ES: What about your girlfriend's horse?
LW: Oh um...22nd, to that date 25th
ES: Are you sure about that?
LW: I got... that's what I got told
ES: I'm fuckin sick of thisLW: That's the... that's the number oneES: Yeah I fuckin know that's for the first
LW: Yeah I haven't heard anything about number two
ES: So you're (ind) the 26th for Rich Hussy not 25th
LW: Twenty yeah, 22nd to the 25th...Rich Hussy 26th yeah, somethin like that
ES: Oh
LW: But I'm still tryin to find out about number two.""
(Emphasis added).

The Crown case was that in this conversation, ES and the appellant were at cross-purposes until ES mentioned ""your girlfriend's horse"", referring to the SMS messages on 27 June 2008, after which the appellant realised the conversation was about the expected arrival date of the shipping containers.

38Later that day, the appellant called his Customs broker, and had the following exchange:

""LW: ...have you had any news on roughly when the firstcontainer turns up?
MT: Yeah that's due in on um Thursday, the ship W: Oh this Thursday is it? Okay.""

39Approximately five minutes after that conversation, the appellant contacted ES via text and informed him that he was ""wrong earlier"" and that ""Rich Hussey will be having a gallop b4 Friday, [war] stories more then likely early August"". Container CRXU (which did not contain any drugs) arrived in Sydney on Friday 18 July 2008. On the Crown case, ""War Stories"" was a coded reference to container TTNU. As mentioned above, container TTNU arrived in Sydney in early August. 

40The following Monday, 21 July 2008, the appellant sent an email to the Customs broker in the following terms:

""Here is the bill of lading for the second container from Royale. I should have the documents on Monday/Tuesday of next week. It left Thailand on the 15th so I would imagine it would be arriving while I am on holidays I guess as I leave on the 4th so [DS] will have to accept the container... I should have another container from Dan D arriving a few days after this also...""

The Crown case was that this email concerned the drug consignment in container TTNU. 

41On 28 July 2008, the appellant sent an email to the Customs broker regarding ""the second royale colour container"" in the following terms:

"" ... A quick release would be great, just purely because I am heading on holidays next week so it will make it easier on me but I wont hold my breath."" 

42On 4 August 2008 (the day that container TTNU arrived in Sydney) the appellant flew from Sydney to Phuket, Thailand, where he remained until 19 August. The Crown case was that during this time the appellant continued to be involved in coordinating the clearance of container TTNU, including communicating with ES and giving instructions to DS. 

43On 4 August 2008, whilst waiting to board the aircraft, the appellant had a telephone conversation with DS. He informed him that he had given his contact details to the Customs broker. He said, ""[he will] hopefully have it out for us by Wednesday"". DS confirmed that he had been in contact with the broker.

44On 5 August 2008, ES telephoned the appellant and the following conversation took place:

""ES: No news?LW: ...I'm workin', I'm workin', I'm workin' it... It's lucky I got someone there to help me out while I'm away so...I'll speak to him this arvo and hopefully...see if he's heard anything either.""

Later that day the appellant sent two SMS messages to DS referring to attempts to make contact with his broker ""to find out ... when the container will be arriving"". 

45Between 5 and 7 August 2008, the appellant sent a number of SMS messages to DS seeking updated information from the Customs broker regarding clearance of the containers and their delivery. During this time, DS maintained contact with ES. The appellant maintained contact with his Customs broker. 

46On 7 August 2008 at 4:47 pm ES sent a SMS message to the appellant asking ""Today?"". The appellant responded ""Don't know yet. Soon"". 

47Later that day, the broker was told that a ""hold"" had been placed on container TTNU. The appellant spoke with him the next day and was told that he did not know when the container would be cleared. The drugs were located by Customs in container TTNU that day. 

48The Crown case was that the delay in clearance created high levels of anxiety for the appellant and ES, which was obvious in the content and regularity of communication over the subsequent days.

49On 8 August 2008, ES and the appellant had two phone conversations (at 8.27 pm and 8.46 pm) where they discussed the location of container TTNU, the ability to track its whereabouts online, and inquiries that might be made with the shipping company. The conversation at 8.27 pm was in the following terms:

""ES: Listen then um...you know when you said DHL how you can track it?
LW: Yeah
ES: Why can' t you do that with that one ?
LW: Because ...I only put certain things on there
ES: What do you mean?
LW: ...they only put release certain things
ES: But it should tell you where it is
LW: No bro, some bits they do
ES: Where does it say it is?
LW: It's there
ES: Well what did it say last week?
LW: It's there but they only release certain information
ES: Who's that through, the actual - the actual DHL?
LW: Yeah, yeah
ES: Or through, or through the inspection?
LW: Yeah no... they only release certain bits of information
ES: Is that through the shipping line?
LW: No
ES: Well that's what you gotta look up. The actual shipping line
LW: I mean... its done all that mate
ES: And you can't tell where it is?
LW: I know where it is mate but I only know certain bits of information
ES: Well that's...it should tell you exactly where it is. And if it was delayed or if it wasn't
LW: It was, that's what they 're telling us
ES: No, I don't care what he's telling me. I'm fuckin over this cunt. He's sacked as soon as you get back 
LW: Yeah
ES: The fuckin um...the shipping company should tell you where it is
LW: Yeah it's there. They only tell you where it's at. They don't...they don't from then on they don't tell you... 
ES: Well a week ago they told you it was there as well? LW: Yeah
ES: So it wasn't delayed?
LW: No it...it... getting off it has been
ES: According to him or according to you look it up?
LW: No according to what it actually is. According to what he's...yeah he's told me but it is...mate I know what it is. I've been through this a thousand times
ES: So what do you reckon it is?
LW: Oh I dunno. I really don't
ES: You're not makin any sense man
LW: Oh well...yeah well you know
ES: When you track it, you can tell where it is yeah?
LW: Yes you can tell where it is
ES: Okay, but a week ago where was it?
LW: Here!
ES: It was here? So it's been here the whole week?
LW: Yes but they...they had delays because they couldn't get it off. That's where the delays were incurred. Its just been sitting on it
ES: Cause when we spoke to him today he said fuckin it was delayed in China. That thing doesn't go to China
LW: It goes through to...no...yeah
ES: So fuckin how did it get delayed in China?
LW: Yeah I think there was a lot of delays in China, not mine, a lot of delays in China which back held these ones. Because the delays of where they were, then they eventually turned up....
ES: Well what did he say to you today ?
LW: Oh mate I've only just got here now...he sent off a pretty serious email
ES: He did?
LW: Yeah
ES: To who?
LW: I'll call him
ES: Ring me back.""
(Emphasis added).

The Crown case was that ""he's sacked as soon as you get back"" was a reference to the Customs broker and ES's frustration and concerns about the reliability of the information they were receiving from him.

50At 8.46 pm, the appellant called DS. DS handed the phone to ES and he and the appellant had the following conversation, in which the appellant informed ES that the container had been ""held up"" by Customs.

""LW: ...it turned up then but it got held up then
ES: by who, the whole thing or just ours?
LW: Yeah no, it was stuck on the thing
ES: ...Alright is it safe now?
LW: It's hopefully, they're hoping, hopefully 95 tomorrow okay...see they only tell certain bits of things...
ES: I know, fuck I'm gonna bang youse both when you get back here. So yeah
LW: Uh?
ES: I'm gonna bang youse both when you get back here
LW: They only tell you, know what I mean?
ES: 95 tomorrow
LW: yeah well if it's tomorrow it means we can't get it till theycan't book it for Monday. So it may not be till Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning
ES: what's 95 tomorrow then?
LW: that it's cleared tomorrow and then it just says wait, wait to be moved
ES: will he ring you tomorrow and tell you it's been cleared?
LW: he's gonna email me if it gets done, yeah
ES: alright, you ring him regardless
LW: I don't know mate, I'm not, I'm not-I dunno. I dunno if that...
ES: well you ring him regardless
LW: Uh? Yeah no I will, but I dunno, I dunno if people are on the know
ES: How's Phi Phi?
LW: yeah not bad, did you hear me?
ES: yeah
LW: good, good. I don't know how many people are on the know
ES: what?
LW: yeah, I don't know about some people on the know. Yeah
ES: you're around for people on the mum?
LW: on the know
ES: who?
LW: I dunno
ES: you're around for people that are on the know
LW: no, I don't know if there is people that know, that are on the know
ES: oh, ok. What makes you say that?
LW: I've been done for these at least 10 in a row
ES: oh yeah. So this is normal you reckon?
LW: well he sent off um a thing today
ES: yeah
LW: But um he's been pretty harsh to say what's goin on basically
ES: oh about you?
LW: about the cost of money yeah, for them
ES: alright so you reckon so tomorrow night you'll know if it's been...
LW: yeah
ES: yeah and then fuck (overtalk)
W: (ind)
ES: and then what? And then what, should have it Monday?
LW: then Monday-yeah then we book it Monday coming out
ES: alright man
LW: alright but man I dunno. I dunno, I dunno who's on the know
ES: listen
LW: yeah
ES: regardless if it doesn't come tomorrow and tells us Monday
LW: yeah
ES: you don't catch a flight until fuckin - do you understand what I'm saying?
LW: yeah
ES: well...
LW: I know yeah, I know, I know
ES: you know what I mean, regardless
LW: yeah, yeah
ES: yeah
LW: alright
ES: take the bloke out for dinner, buy him a few drinks, do this, do that, eh
LW: uh I think, I think honestly he's being very blunt to the point that this is just ridiculous, it's stupid and you know these guys are just costing us a fortune if it's not on, what the fuck, what do we have to do, you know what I mean
ES: mm
LW: so you know if you know, but
ES: yeah well what time tomorrow
LW: alright so - uh?
ES: what time tomorrow about six, the same time?
LW: oh maybe, maybe early in the morning. Who know, who knows
ES: alright well let me know
LW: the longer this, the longer this goes on you know ...
...
ES: you alright for money?LW: yeah hopefully I'll be alright. ES: alrightLW: no dramas.""
(Emphasis added).

DS gave evidence that, although he was on the phone to the appellant at the start of this conversation, he was not around ES for the rest of the conversation that is extracted above.

51The Crown asserted that the appellant's references to ""people that are on the know"" was to suggest to ES that the authorities may have discovered the drugs, and that ""95"" was a reference to being 95% sure that the container would be cleared the next day. Further, the Crown asserted that ES's entreaties to the appellant not to catch a flight, and his inquiry as to whether the appellant had enough money was to ensure that the appellant stayed out of the country until the shipment had cleared Customs. The Crown asserted that the reference to someone having sent off ""a thing"" that was ""pretty harsh"" was a reference to an email the broker sent to Customs the previous day complaining about the delay in the release of the two containers. The Crown case was that this email, together with the references to ""tracking"" something, ""DHL"", a ""shipping company"" and something being ""delayed in China"" demonstrated that the appellant and ES were concerned about the shipping container and its possible interception by law enforcement bodies. 

52The two telephone calls on 8 August 2008 were followed by a series of SMS messages between ES and the appellant, in the following terms:

""LW: I feel sick brother ... just my sea legs I hopeLW: So you know mate I get back next week. We should catch
up for a bite to eat or just a few drinks ES: MaybeLW: You still owe me a birthday drinkES: Maybe a bulletLW: I don't like that shot of alcoholLW: Are your mates giving u grief - is there something I need to
be worried about?ES: Yeah, a lot of fuckn griefLW: U better make sure they buy shares in horses off meES: They want shares of you dont worry about horses.""

53The following day, 9 August 2008, the appellant communicated with DS, the Customs broker and ES regarding the clearance of the containers.

54At 2.07 pm, the appellant emailed the broker asking ""any news on possible clearance of both containers?"". Four minutes later, the appellant sent a SMS message to ES saying, ""My dad hasn't told me how the horse went yet. May not know till Monday morning"". At 3.04 pm, the appellant sent a SMS message to DS intimating that he would not know until Monday when the containers were arriving. 

55On Monday 11 August 2008, as police initiated a controlled delivery of the TTNU container, the appellant continued to communicate with the broker. At 3.55 pm, the appellant emailed him saying:

""Hi Mike, are customs giving any indication on this Royale container? This all seems a bit weird to me at the moment.""

56That evening, the appellant also communicated via SMS message with ES:

""LW: I may be coming home on Thurs now, can't change my flights
ES: Not a good idea, until you sell that horse, please mate trust me on this, sell the horse then come home it's the safest bet, please mate 
LW: Fair enough. Can you spot me 500 or so
ES: [I'll] deposit in chloe's account tomrw, or do u want western union?
LW: Chloe's is cool mate. Thanks for that, it will be good to relax in some sun for a bit longer. U ok mate?
ES: Alive, waiting for our horse to race, be okLW: Have a small bet on danehill smile and dealer principal to
win on Saturday ES: Will do.""

The Crown case was that these SMS messages related to ES's advice to the appellant to stay in Thailand until the problem with the container was sorted out, and that the ""horse"" was container TTNU. 

57On Tuesday 12 August 2008, the appellant sent a SMS message to ES saying ""Maybe consider return post"", to which ES replied ""Not yet"". The Crown case was that this was a suggestion that they abandon taking delivery of container TTNU. 

58The appellant was also in contact with the broker and DS that day with regards to container TTNU (and another container FSCU). At 11.50 am, the appellant sent a SMS message to DS advising him that container FSCU would be delivered the next day, but that container TTNU had still not been cleared. At approximately 12.45 pm, DS passed that information onto ES. However at 1.45 pm, the broker sent an email to the appellant advising that both containers had been cleared. At 2.02 pm, the appellant sent an email to DS advising that both containers were ""done with customs"".

59At 3.04 pm, ES called the appellant and had the following conversation, in which, the Crown asserted the appellant informed ES, in a coded manner, that both containers had been cleared: 

""LW: Um...oh now also my dad got his test results back too and they were all clear so...
ES: your, your dad got his test results back?
W: yep
ES: yeah, what 'd they say
LW: clear, so...
ES: what? On both or on... on both his nuts?
LW: so he's back at work tomorrow
ES: on both his nuts?
LW: he's back at work tomorrow. His prostate.
ES: on both his nuts or just one?
LW: yeah, yeah
ES: Fuck! So he can start rootin again?
LW: huh?
ES: he can start rooting again
LW: pretty much yeah, so he's back at work tomorrow.""

The Crown case was that the appellant's reference to his ""dad"" in this conversation, and the conversation on 9 August 2008 (""My dad hasn't told me how the horse went yet"", at par [54]) were coded references to the containers.

60That night, at 9.13 pm, ES sent a SMS message to Ibrahim Jidah saying ""Day off 2mrw"". Ibrahim responded approximately an hour later saying ""What u mean"". Shortly after that ES called Ibrahim and they arranged to meet. It was the Crown case that ES, having received confirmation that container TTNU had cleared Customs, was mobilising a team to assist in moving the drugs once they were unpacked from the container.

61The following morning, Wednesday 13 August 2008, at 8.43 am, Ibrahim Jidah sent a SMS message to his brother Yousef Jidah saying ""Take day off"".

62The Crown case was that by the afternoon of Wednesday 13 August 2008, ES believed that things were going well with the container. Just after 4 pm, he sent a SMS message to the appellant saying ""... the other horse seems fine you must be a very lucky man"". The Crown asserted that the ""other horse"" was a reference to container TTNU. ES and the appellant then exchanged a series of SMS messages in which, the Crown asserted, they joked about having successfully effected the importation of the drugs undetected:

""LW: Yeah yeah early days yet...Behind the scenes though I've
been working my ring off n pulling tricks
ES: Yeah right
LW: You'll see my friend
ES: What do you mean
ES: What?
LW: All good. I'll show you my tricks when I'm back
ES: Kinky
LW: I am my friend, these shows over here have taught me a lot.""

63At 6:44 pm, after Yousef Jidah's courier van had left the auction house with the boxes, ES telephoned the appellant. The Crown case was, that in this conversation, ES and the appellant continued to joke and express relief:

""ES: kinky your tricks eh, you've learnt to kinky your tricks have you?
LW: Uh l do my best
ES: how about I fuckin teach you a few when you get back, don't worry about that
LW: yeah (laughs) as long as you're happy
ES: we've gotta move you out of the beginners circle
LW: uh? (laughs)
ES: we've gotta move you out of the beginners circleLW: Yes I knowES: Hey listen I've gotta bit of money left over on my credit 
card, do you want me to book you a flight back?LW: You wanna have a bet on Danehill's smile, don't ya?ES: Oh fuck, I'd rather fuckin' see you than see a horse race, 
dickhead. LW: I'll leave it up to you my friend. ES: Honestly its up to youLW: I'm goin; its up to you ES: Fuck man, I'm being seriousLW: So am I....ES: Do you want to come back now or do you wanna wait 'til 
Monday?
LW: I don't reckon I can 'til Monday man, I'm dyin' here. I've been here ten days
ES: And you can't change it again with Jetstar?
LW: No, no, uh just leave it, I'll wait. See how things go anyway
ES: Alright
LW: Probably better to guts it out
ES: Yeah
LW: See how we go ...
ES: everything's all right here with the horses
LW: yeah?
ES: yeah definitely
LW: yeah?
ES: yeah fuckin surprised
LW: so am I.""

It was the Crown case that the appellant's comment ""I'm dyin' here. I've been here ten days"" demonstrated that the appellant did not want to be in Thailand, but only remained out of the country to distance himself from the importation and to enable him to be able to deny any knowledge that his warehouse was being used to unpack the drugs in the event that the consignment was under surveillance. 

64At 6.54 pm, ES called the appellant again, and, on the Crown case, continued to express relief that everything was going according to plan:

""LW: You seem a lot happier ES: Fuck wouldn't you be? LW: (laughs) I dunno ES: no? LW: I dunno ES: Why not?
LW: I dunno because... Haven't they always heard of the... ah what's the saying um, not over til the fat lady sings 
ES: It's already sung LW: has it? ES: Yeah
LW: (laughs) fair enough ES: Got nothing to be upset about 
LW: huh?
ES: There's nothing to be upset about LW: I'm not upset
ES: If she's still gonna sing, she's gonna sing a fuckin - singin a long tune 
LW: (laughs) ES: (laughs)
LW: You 're a lucky man my friend
ES: No. I dunno what the fuck happened there but you, you know even the fuckin studs on that horse... 
LW: Yeah?
ES: ... like not even one of the fuckin nails was out of it, like it was still all locked in 
LW: Yeah?
ES: Yes. So fuckin I dunno LW: (laughs)
ES: Oh you got too many copper mates mate LW: Nah, nah, I...ES: (laughs).""

The Crown asserted that ""studs"" and ""nails"" on ""that horse"" referred to ES's surprise that the drugs were apparently still intact when located in the container. 

65Shortly after that conversation, Ibrahim Jidah detected that the van his brother was driving was being followed. As noted in par [20] above, ES instructed Yousef Jidah and Ibrahim to abandon the van and its contents, after which a decision was made to retrieve the van and unpack the drugs. Whilst these events were occurring, the appellant was still in Thailand and unaware of the situation that was unfolding in Sydney. The appellant sent a number of SMS messages to ES on the evening of 13 August 2008 regarding flights back to Sydney, which remained unanswered, DS having been arrested at 8.22 am on 14 August, and ES at 12.15 pm. 

66The appellant sent the following SMS messages on to ES and DS on 14 August 2008:

""10:39 am - to ES: Did you get me out of this place yet!
10:59 am - to DS: I'm dying here! My travel agent in Sydney can arrange everything... 12 days in phuket is a long time.

11:10 am - to DS: Roughly when do you think both containers will be empty? Cause customs held us up the daily fee's r pretty big. No rush, just
got to let Mike know.

11:20 am - to ES: This virus is killing me man, I'm dying from the humidity. I can't hold any food or drink down.

11:40 am - to ES: Don't worry bud, I'll just try n change my flights with jetstar. I'm just exhausted from the heat n can't get over this virus, it's fucked

12:03 pm - to DS: Can you please move the old stock of rice toonies ... 
9:51 pm - to DS: Hey mate, u ok?""

It was the Crown case that those SMS messages put beyond question that the appellant stayed in Thailand at ES's insistence, and that he made no plans to return to Australia until ES advised that he should. 

The appellant's evidence at trial 
67The appellant gave evidence at trial. It was his case that he had no knowledge of the pseudoephedrine imported or unpacked in his warehouse. He denied that he agreed with ES that his container could be used for that purpose, or that he knew or believed that ES was going to arrange for drugs to be secreted in the container while ES was in Thailand. The appellant gave evidence that, although he had no knowledge of the pseudoephedrine that was imported (or the plans to import it), he was aware that ES was intending to bring ""something"" into Australia without his knowledge. The appellant gave evidence that it was just ""very unfortunate"" that drugs were in his container. 

68It was part of the appellant's case at trial that he would not have knowingly imported drugs because he knew that most, if not all, of his previous containers had been examined by Customs. 

69The appellant gave evidence that, without his knowledge, Royale Colourstones had taken over from his usual supplier in Thailand, SS Intertrade, and sent him the goods he had previously ordered from SS Intertrade. The appellant denied that he provided his details to Royale Colourstones or that he paid them any money, or communicated with them as part of an arrangement pursuant to which drugs would be put inside his container.

70The appellant gave evidence that as a result of his conversation with ES at 8:27 pm on 8 August 2008 (at par [49] above), he had suspicions that ES was bringing something into Australia in his container, such as building supplies, to evade tax liabilities:

"" ... If [ES] was to bring stuff into Australia, he was doing it to save on tax purposes. If he was to bring in tiles or what not (for his house job site in Glenorie), if he used my container as a carrier service he wouldn't have to pay taxes on the goods he was bringing in, but I didn't know.""

The appellant gave evidence that he rang back to warn ES that ""whatever was coming in this container ... was going to be found"". The appellant gave evidence that he subsequently allowed the container to be delivered to his warehouse because his concerns were ""just a theory in [his] head"", and by the time it was unpacked, he ""just assumed that everything was going okay now ... [ES] hadn't talked to [him] about those sorts of things..."".

71With regards to what the Crown asserted were coded references to container TTNU, the appellant asserted that they were legitimate conversations relating to the horses he and ES managed and co-owned. For example, the calls and SMS messages between the appellant and ES on 5, 7 and 11 August 2008, the appellant asserted, concerned the sale of their horses ""Rich Hussey"" and ""War Stories"", and not container TTNU. Similarly, the appellant gave evidence that the SMS messages on 8 and 12 August regarding ES's stress and the people ""giving [ES] grief"" were references to debts ES owed. The appellant gave evidence that ES had told his creditors that the appellant was the reason he (ES) had not settled his debts, and so ES's entreaties to him not to come home to Australia were in the interests of protecting him. With regards to the SMS message sent on 12 August ""maybe consider return post"", the appellant gave evidence it was meant for his father, not ES.

72With regards to the conversation on 12 August 2008 in relation to his father's prostate and the ""all clear"", the appellant gave evidence that it was another unfortunate coincidence that he used the expression ""all clear"" approximately two hours after he was told by the Customs broker that both containers had been cleared by Customs.

73With regards to the SMS message from ES on 13 August 2008 saying ""you must be a very lucky man"", the appellant gave evidence that these related to a decision to bet on a horse, and did not relate to the safe arrival of the drugs.

74The appellant gave evidence that, in the telephone conversation with ES on the evening of 13 August 2008, he was ""basically telling [ES] 'mate, if you've done something wrong, if you've got something to do with my container', I knew my containers had been searched, there was no question about it, there was no way this was the end of it if he had something to do with my container"" and ""I was just saying that you've got away with it mate. Good luck to you. I don't know what you've got away [with] but so be it"".

Ibrahim Jidah and Yousef Jidah's role in the importation
75Ibrahim Jidah was charged with two counts under the DMT Act. The first alleged, contrary to s 25(2), that between 12 and 14 August 2008, he supplied a large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine (Count 6). In proof of the second count (Count 7), the Crown alleged that between 12 and 14 August he attempted to possess a precursor, being pseudoephedrine, intended for use in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, contrary to s 24A(1). Yousef Jidah was charged with identical offences (Counts 8 and 9), with the exception that the dates in relation to the offence contrary to s 25(2) (Count 8) were particularised as being between 13 and 14 August.

76Ibrahim Jidah and ES had been friends for a number of years, sharing a mutual interest in racehorses and racing. In written submissions on appeal the Crown described Ibrahim as ES's ""trusted lieutenant"". It was the Crown case that Ibrahim played an organisational and overseeing role and liaised closely with ES during the supply phase. It was the Crown case that Ibrahim recruited his brother, Yousef Jidah, at least five days prior to the initiation of the supply phase. 

77The Crown alleged that Yousef Jidah's role was the lowest in the (known) hierarchy of offenders, but he was nonetheless indispensable. His role was to transport the boxes of drugs in his courier van. He met with Ibrahim Jidah and ES to receive instructions, followed Ibrahim's instructions, and was responsible for moving the boxes thought to contain the drugs, while Ibrahim acted as a lookout.

78At 12:14 pm on 13 August 2008, about 30 minutes before container TTNU was delivered to the warehouse, ES called Ibrahim Jidah and they had the following conversation (emphasised words were spoken in Arabic):

""ES: Do you remember when we went and did that concrete job at, um, for (ind) brother? 
IJ: YeahES: How many cement bags did we pick up, one or two?IJ: Wasn't it, wasn't it three?ES: Three?IJ: YeahES: Are ya sure, man?IJ: It was - yeah, it was three. ES: Three million?IJ: I'm pretty sure. I can confirm it with my mate, 'case he was
there with us. 
...IJ: Is everything under control?ES: Yeah it is ... I thought it was two. ...IJ: Yeah. No bro, I'm pretty sure it was three, man!ES: Alright, no worries. IJ: Alright?ES: Alright then.""

The Crown alleged that the reference to ""three million"" referred to the number of tablets in the shipment (being 2.6 million). 

79At 3:14 pm on 13 August 2008 (about two hours after the container was delivered to the warehouse), ES had a conversation with DS in which ES asked ""did you find them"" and ""how many?"". ES told DS ""if there is not 45 call me straight away"". Immediately after that call, ES called Ibrahim Jidah and they had the following conversation:

""ES: Oh get ready.IJ: Yeah I'm waiting. ES: What?IJ: I'm waiting. ES: You a bit far from there, bro. IJ: Oh do ya want it, do ya want it pronto?ES: Yeah. Fuckin' oath, 'cause its gotta be pronto. IJ: Yeah alright, bro. Hows it lookin'? Hows, hows the
(indecipherable). ES: Everything's alright.""

80At 3:18 pm, ES again called Ibrahim Jidah and said ""You and ya mate come to my old man's"". At 3:23 pm, Ibrahim called Yousef Jidah and gave him instructions on how to get to ""my mate's old man's"". It was the Crown case that ES met with Ibrahim and Yousef at ES's ""old man's"" house at Rooty Hill to give them final instructions regarding the collection and movement of the boxes. 

81As above, at par [18]-[19], it was the Crown case that the arrangements were then for DS to deliver the 45 boxes from the warehouse to the auction house where they would be collected by Ibrahim and Yousef Jidah. The boxes were then to be transferred into Yousef's van, with Ibrahim travelling close by in another vehicle providing counter surveillance. 

82At 6:15 pm, DS telephoned ES and informed him that ""they"" were not there. At 6:15 pm, ES telephoned Ibrahim Jidah and said ""My mate's waiting for ya"". Ibrahim responded ""yeah, we're there"". As described at par [19] at 6:15 pm, police observed Yousef Jidah's van enter the car park at the auction house, and that Ibrahim's vehicle was parked a short distance away. 

83A large number of boxes including, on the Crown case, the 45 boxes containing the drugs the subject of the importation, were then loaded into Yousef Jidah's courier van. At approximately 6:30 pm, police observed Yousef's van leave the auction house with Ibrahim Jidah's vehicle following. At 6:31 pm, ES telephoned Ibrahim. They had a conversation about a vehicle that had been overloaded so much that it was ""scrubbing"". The Crown case was that this conversation was a joke referring to the large quantity of boxes loaded into Yousef's van. 

84As above at par [20], just after 7.00 pm, Ibrahim Jidah detected that he and Yousef Jidah were being followed. At 7.10 pm, Ibrahim called ES and they had the following conversation:

""IJ: I believe they are following us, man!ES: Why?IJ: Because there is a car that was parked in front of
Yousef's house that has been following us since we have left. 
ES: Um, are you fucking with me or what?IJ: No, it's the truth bro. ES: Is there something inside them?IJ: What do you mean is there something inside them, we
haven't left yet!
ES: What sort of car?
IJ: The car is a white van. ... It kept following him then
and then he just done a u-turn around and around and he
parked out the, er, in front of him. ES: In front of his house?IJ: Yeah. ...IJ: Yeah, what are we going to do?ES: Get him to drive his car ... IJ: YeahES: Get him to drive his car and drive on then see if it's going to
follow him. IJ: Yeah, alright. ES: You stay where you are but. IJ: Yeah, alright. Alright, bye.""

85Police then observed Ibrahim Jidah's vehicle driving erratically and at high speeds in the suburban streets of Blacktown, apparently chasing various vehicles that he believed were conducting surveillance. Around that time, Yousef Jidah asked Ibrahim if he should approach a vehicle that they suspected of following them and ask ""what he is doing"". 

86As described at par [20] above, Ibrahim Jidah and ES then had a series of conversations in which ES instructed Ibrahim to tell Yousef Jidah to abandon ""the car and everything"":

""ES: Well, get him to leave it. IJ: The car and everything?ES: Pardon?IJ: The car and everything?ES: What can we do, bro! Its better than him getting caught
with it now. IJ: I tell you what, if he goes home and parks it at the back
they would say that the job is over and he was going to do it tomorrow, that's it. 
ES: And why would they think so? No man, they would not
think so. IJ: What then, should he leave the car and go?ES: He should leave it and call Farid. IJ: Yeah alright.""

87As described at par [21] above, around that time, Ibrahim and Yousef Jidah had a series of conversations where Ibrahim gave Yousef the following instructions:

""You are going to take the car now to a place where there is an underground carpark ... in Westmead somewhere ... take it from, where you are at the back and see what they would do, and don't go, don't go, just come straight out.""

And shortly after that:

""Once you arrive there park the car and get out of it then call me, I will pick you up. Leave it there somewhere .... Park it in a good spot where no one can see inside it.""

88As above at par [21], at around 7.30 pm police observed Yousef Jidah's vehicle drive into the Westfield shopping centre at Blacktown. At around that time Ibrahim Jidah called Yousef and instructed him ""Don't let them see how you look like ... Leave it, leave it and go. Pretend that you're going towards the shops or something."" 

89Shortly after that Ibrahim Jidah collected Yousef Jidah and they met with ES. 

90It was the Crown case that, later that night, Yousef Jidah retrieved the van and drove it and the boxes back to the appellant's warehouse. Listening devices installed inside the container (which remained in the warehouse) recorded Yousef and DS's voices sometime after 10 pm. They did not discuss anything of consequence but were relied upon by the Crown to prove Yousef's presence at the warehouse. Yousef then continued to conduct counter surveillance around the warehouse and, just after 11 pm, told Ibrahim Jidah over the telephone that he was ""still doin' laps around the area"". 

91Yousef Jidah collected Ibrahim Jidah around 6 am the next morning, 14 August 2008, and travelled to the warehouse. It was the Crown case that Ibrahim acted as a lookout while Yousef and others unpacked the boxes. Ibrahim maintained telephone contact with ES during this time. Ibrahim and Yousef were arrested around 8.22 am. 

Ibrahim Jidah and Yousef Jidah's evidence at trial
92The issue of dispute at trial was Ibrahim and Yousef Jidah's knowledge of the contents of the boxes.

93Ibrahim Jidah gave evidence. It was his case that he was unaware that there was pseudoephedrine in the boxes in the container, or in the boxes in the van. His case was that he was set up by ES.

94He gave evidence that he was friends with both ES and the appellant, and that from time to time he did jobs for ES for which he was paid cash. On three or four occasions he helped the appellant with unloading containers, stacking boxes on pallets and delivering them. 

95In relation to the telephone calls and SMS messages exchanged between Ibrahim Jidah and ES and Ibrahim and Yousef Jidah, it was Ibrahim's case that they did not demonstrate any knowledge of pseudoephedrine. In evidence in chief, Ibrahim gave evidence that he initially thought that ES was stealing the contents of the container from the appellant. Once Ibrahim suspected they were being followed and ES encouraged them to abandon the van, saying ""Its better than him getting caught with it now"", Ibrahim ""realised it was more than juices and noodles"" and began to suspect that there may have been guns in the container. Ibrahim gave evidence that when he met with ES that night, ES seemed unconcerned with what had transpired that evening, and that this allayed his fears as to the type of contraband which may have been in the boxes. 

96Ibrahim Jidah's case was that he drove in a vehicle separate to his brother Yousef Jidah, not for counter surveillance purposes, but because he had an ""unbridled passion"" for his car and loved to drive it. Further, his erratic driving at high speeds was to work out what was happening, and why he and Yousef were being followed. 

97Yousef Jidah did not give evidence at trial. Through his counsel the jury were invited to consider a number of aspects of the evidence as being inconsistent with any knowledge of the drugs in the boxes, including that there was no allegation that he ever handled anything other than taped boxes, which appeared to contain foodstuffs, and for that reason there was nothing that would have excited his suspicions. Counsel submitted that handling boxes for a short period of time without enquiring as to their contents was consistent with Yousef's work as a courier. 

98Further, it was submitted on Yousef Jidah's behalf that he did not have a relationship with ES, let alone a relationship of trust. In those circumstances, it was submitted, it was unlikely that ES would have disclosed to Yousef the contents of the boxes.

99In relation to the intercepted calls on the evening of 13 August 2008 between Yousef Jidah and his brother Ibrahim Jidah, Yousef's counsel submitted that they did not prove Yousef's knowledge of the contents of the containers, but were consistent with confusion, suspicion and uncertainty. Further, it was put that Yousef enquiring of his brother, Ibrahim, whether he should approach the car following them and ask ""what he is doing"" was indicative of his lack of any concern that they were being followed by police. 

DS's evidence at trial
100DS met the appellant at a family function ES's parents held around 2007. ES asked DS to work at the appellant's warehouse as, at the time, DS did not have much work from his waterproofing business. He started working there around May 2008.

101DS gave evidence that, when he started working at the appellant's warehouse, he was unpacking containers, sorting, moving and wrapping pallets. He gradually began to have more involvement in customers, receiving instructions from the appellant as to who had to pay upfront or who could pay with credit. He negotiated prices with clients. 

102DS said ES was at the warehouse a fair bit and would order products off him. He said the appellant didn't pay him a wage, more of a commission, which the appellant would work out based on how much product DS had sold.

103DS said he at times slept at the warehouse on a blow up mattress because he was having problems with his girlfriend at the time. He gave evidence that the appellant did not like him staying there as it did not look good in front of the customers. 

104DS said that, once unpacked, the appellant would want the containers to be picked up as soon as possible to avoid paying fees on the containers. 

105DS remembered the appellant telling him in July 2008 that he was going on a holiday and asking if DS could look after things ""like...[he]...had been doing"". DS agreed in cross examination that he was left in charge of the warehouse in the appellant's absence. 

106DS explained SMS messages and phone calls received from the appellant on 1 and 4 August 2008 related to arranging for an empty container to be picked up. DS gave evidence that he asked the appellant for access to his computer on 4 August 2008. However, the appellant said he could use ""Cloey's icon"" which would give him basic office and internet systems. DS said he did not hear the appellant giving him the password to his computer in the conversation and he never logged into the appellant's computer in his name. 

107DS said conversations he had with the appellant while he was away related to when incoming stock was to arrive. He said the appellant asked him to chase up his Customs broker about the stock and remind the latter that there was an auction coming up on a Thursday where the stock (if it had come in) could be sold. He said the appellant told him he really didn't want to miss the auctions. DS said he had already arranged for a truck and driver to take the goods to the auction. 

108DS received multiple SMS messages from the appellant while he was on holiday informing him about the progress of the stock being ready for collection, telling him whether the appellant's Customs broker had any updates, asking him whether DS had any updates from the appellant's Customs broker or could request an update from the appellant's Customs broker and issuing instructions as to what to do with the pallets and who could potentially be a client to sell the products to. In some of the SMS messages, the appellant apologised to DS for the ""non stop delays"" and ""stuffing around"". DS recalled contacting Mr Terrance and asking about the containers after receiving a SMS message from the appellant on 11 August 2008 at 3.29 pm asking him to contact Mr Terrance. DS gave evidence in cross examination that he didn't think there was pressure to get the appellant's container released, it was normal for the appellant to be pushing for his goods to be sold. However he did concede that there was some pressure to get the containers released. 

109On 12 August 2008 at 12.45 pm, ES and DS had a telephone conversation in which the following was said (emphasised words were spoken in Arabic):

""ES: Hello.
DS: How are ya man?
ES: How ya goin' cuz?
DS: Alright man. What's happening?
ES: Not much. What's goin' on?
DS: Nothin' man. I...I just got back home.
ES: Oh did ya finish up there already?
DS: No I I sealed all upstairs where the pool area is.
ES: Yeah.
DS: I'm pretty confident that'll probably stop ninety percent of it.
ES: Yeah.
DS: It was very absorb...very very porous the tiles and the grout.
ES: Yeah.
DS: Um so it- I I gave it a good soaking of this sealer. That should do the trick.
ES: Yeah.
DS: But I'm still gonna go inject it for him on Thursday.
ES: What about the wall?
DS: The wall I couldn't do it because he fuckin' took off on me.
ES: Yeah.
DS: And then I didn't want to go ask the neighbours like fuck I'll just go back on Thursday anyway so...
ES: Yeah.
DS: But the where- I'm confident that ninety percent of the problem was obviously from above it and I sealed all the- I sealed it as best I can. Like 'cause I don't know what's goin' on underneath his barbecue area and where all that stack stain is.
ES: Yeah.
DS: So if water's getting in front there I- it's - I've only got to try and stop it with injection.
ES: Yeah.
DS: But if it's coming in and which it is, a lot of it's coming in from the slab above the car...um that's that's ninety percent I'm confident that that's gonna all be fixed.
ES: Alright.
DS: But about the wall that's probably comin' from the other side or from from upstairs somewhere and it's just tracking down the wall or some'in so...
ES: Alright.
DS: I told I told the - there was some girl there. I said look I'll be back on Thursday just let him know. 'Cause he goes I'll be back in fifteen and then he wasn't so...
ES: Yeah right.
DS: I was there for, I was there for about fuck an hour and a half.
ES: Yeah.
DS: So I did what I had to do anyway and then fuck.
ES: What are you goin' now? Are you gonna do the Ashfield job or not?
DS: Fuck bro. I dunno what I'm gonna do.
ES: What?
DS: I really don't know. I might go to Abs's or might I go to fuckin' Ashfield. I just don't wanna go to Ashfield. I'm gonna cop traffic all the fuckin' way back.
ES: Cuz!
DS: What? No seriously mate this bitch has done me head in today but I swear to God I'm just fuckin' pissed off bro.
ES: Which bitch?
DS: Ah this fuckin' bitch. I'm fuckin' spewing mate. Fuckin'...that one up the fuckin' road. She's done my fuckin' head in bro.
ES: What's wrong?
DS: Nothin'. She's just a fuckin' whingin' fuckin' slut.
ES: What's she want now?
DS: Uh?
ES: What's she want?
DS: Nothing she's just fucked. They're just fucked bro. I just want nothing to do with 'em.
ES: Fuck 'er off!
DS: They just whinge. I do bro. We are. I did but fuck! They still do your head in. Fuckin'...and then I came home.
ES: Oh (ind) you know what, you know how the saying goes.
DS: What?
ES: Don't shit in your own backyard.
DS: Fuck I didn't shit in my own backyard. Look at it this way.
ES: You did a long time ago and you're coppin' the shit now.
DS: Oh-hh. [LAUGHS] Come on bro. Don't don't fuckin' stress me out.
ES: I'm tellin' ya. That's the way to say go (ind) it's true. Don't shit in your own backyard.
DS: Mmmm.
ES: You (ind) after a while.
DS: Fuck off bro. I don't do that shit.
ES: Ah-hh.
DS: But anyway...what are you doin'?
ES: Nothing. You spoken to our mate today?
DS: What?
ES: Have you spoken to our mate today?
DS: [COUGHS] Yeah.
ES: And no good?
DS: Ah same same fuckin' shit. Same as yesterday.
ES: They did not say today, hey?
DS: What?
ES: They didn't say today eh?
DS: I can't hear you?
ES: They didn't say today eh?
DS: Yeah.
ES: They did?
DS: But fuckin' ...first one is coming - the last one's coming first.
ES: Yeah.
DS: And maybe the second one maybe not so...
ES: When today?
DS: Ah tomorrow. Late tonight or tomorrow.
ES: They're not sure about the second one yet?
DS: The first one?
ES: Yeah they're not sure about it?
DS: Nuh. They're still trying to get it cleared or some'in.
ES: That's funny as.
DS: Yeah so...may as well just scrap that one.
ES: Hh-hm.
DS: [LAUGHS] D'you know what I mean? Just forget about it. Fuck! I reckon but anyway we'll just keep goin'.
ES: Righto.
DS: See what happens. Have a laugh. I don't know.
ES: Ah what time's Mike gonna let you know?
DS: Umm he's not. I didn't speak to him.
ES: You didn't?
DS: Umm actually I did this morning but he just gave me the same answer as what's his name did.
ES: Yeah?
DS: So...yeah. [COUGHS] Anyway it's all good.
ES: (ind overtalk)
DS: [COUGHS] What?
ES: Bit of a fuck around.
DS: Yeah. But anyway all good. I told him I'll be back there on Thursday and I'll finish it and blah blah blah.
ES: Yeah.
DS: So...anyway.
ES: Alright no worries.
DS: Alright. I'm, I'm just at home now. I might go for a drive to Ashfield fuck.
ES: No worries.
DS: Alright cuzzie.
ES: I'll talk to ya later.
DS: If you come this way give us a call.
ES: I will.
DS: Alright. See ya.""

DS gave evidence that the above extracted conversation concerned a waterproofing job he did and his girlfriend. Whilst that may explain the first part of the conversation, it does not explain the latter part of it, particularly where DS says, ""...may as well just scrap that one"". 

110 On 13 August 2008 at 11 am, DS received a SMS message from the appellant saying ""If any stock is missing from either container let me know so I can contact the supplier. Thanks mate."". DS said this was not an unusual request. 

111On 13 August 2008 at 1.50 pm, DS received a telephone call from the appellant in which DS told the appellant both of the containers were at the warehouse, one inside and one outside.

112Later that day at 3:14 pm, DS and ES had a further telephone conversation in which the following remarks were made (emphasised words were spoken in Arabic):

""DS: Uncle Samiry?
ES: Yeah mate.
DS: Fuck me dead, mate.
ES: What's up?
DS: Nothin', man. Fuckin' my back's hurting.
ES: Good. Did you find them?
DS: Yeah.
ES: Yeah, all of them? How many?
DS: [COUGH]
ES: Forty-five?
DS: Thirty-two? Thirty-two?
ES: Uh?
DS: Thirty-two?
ES: That's not right, is it?
DS: Thirty-two and four in each one [PAUSE] so far.
ES: So is there still?
DS: What?
ES: Is there still?
DS: I dunno, I can't see anything.
ES: What do you mean you can't see anything?
DS: Because it's all...
ES: Uh...
DS: ...At the bottom.
ES: Alright.
DS: Like all, we took all the noodles out. That was the...
ES: Yeah, so there is still?
DS: Yeah.
ES: If it's four then there must be forty-five.
[PAUSE]
ES: Oi!
DS: There is thirty-two.
ES: Forty-five square metres.
DS: Alright.
ES: Alright?
DS: Alright.
ES: How long do you need?
DS: Uh not long.
ES: Alight then.
DS: Eh...
ES: If there is no forty-five call me straight away.
DS: Twenty-four?
ES: Forty-five.
DS: Okay.
ES: They have to be...
DS: Okay.
ES: Make sure.
DS: Alright.
ES: Bye.
DS: Bye.""

DS explained that this conversation was talking about the boxes ES had earlier told DS he had already presold. However, he said in cross examination that he was not paying attention in that phone call as he ""was all over the shop"", tired, puffing and working. DS said when he said, ""Thirty-two and four in each one [PAUSE] so far"" he was just making that up, lying to ES to try and get rid of him. He denied it was referring to the fact that four packets of tablets were found in each box. 

113DS had another telephone conversation with ES on 14 August 2008 at 6: 55 am. The following exchange took place (emphasised words were spoken in Arabic):

""DS: Good morning mate.
ES: Good morning cousin.
DS: How are you going?
ES: What's going on, mate?
DS: Not much, mate...
ES: Alright?
DS: [COUGHS] Yeah so far.
ES: Not one?
DS: What?
ES: Not one?
DS: Nothin' yet.
ES: How many more, how many more have you got to go?
DS: Forty-three, forty-two.
ES: What? You have forty-three metres to go?
DS: Yeah.
ES: What you just started?
DS: What?
ES: You just started?
DS: Oh about an hour ago, had dramas, one fuckin' one square metre fuckin', one square metre fuckin' gave me dramas 'cause it fuckin' broke apart, the fuckin' anyway.
ES: 'Cause they're probably gonna be there soon.
DS: Mate, I'm not even at the fuckin' job yet. This happened yesterday.
ES: Yeah?
DS: Yeah, I'm not even at the job yet. I don't even know if I'm gonna fuckin' go there.
ES: Why?
DS: What?
ES: Why?
DS: 'Cause I dunno man, I don't feel good today yeah. I might just have the day off.
ES: [LAUGHS]
DS: Alright, I'll call you back soon, I'm just havin' a coffee.
ES: Alright mate.
DS: Alright?
ES: Alright then.
DS: Bye.""

DS gave evidence that, in this conversation, he was lying to ES to ""get rid of him"" because he didn't like working early in the mornings. He said he thought the references to ""Forty-three"" and ""Forty-two"" were something to do with a courier coming to pick up ES's presold boxes. He denied in cross examination that he was deliberately using ""code"" by using the term ""square metre"". He denied the reference to ""one square metre fuckin' gave me dramas 'cause it fuckin' broke apart"" was a reference to a broken box or packet. 

114DS gave evidence that at 8 am that day, 14 August 2008, Yousef Jidah, the courier, arrived and went to the toilet in the warehouse. DS started to load ""the boxes that were"" ES's when one of the fruit juice boxes broke open and white pills spilled on the floor. He said he swept them or scrapped them up and put them back in the box they had come from. He looked at the pills for identification such as having ""Panadol"" written on them but could not see anything on the tablet. He kept one aside next to his mobile phone to ask the appellant about it. He was intending to call the appellant in a couple of hours to ask him about it. However, he then had a cigarette and was arrested whilst smoking. In cross examination, DS said he never opened the 45 boxes that he understood were ES's. He also could not explain how one of the tablets was found downstairs in the toilet area.

The directions to the jury
115Because of the way the case on Ground 1 of the appeal was put, it is important to have regard to the directions made to the jury on each count.

The written directions
116The jury was provided with a document in respect of each count which set out the elements of the offence that the Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt.

117In relation to the importation count, the document identified five elements. Element one stated that the Crown was required to prove that the appellant ""did intentionally import the substance (tablets) which was in the 45 boxes (whether or not he knew of the precise nature of the tablets)"". The written direction stated that the appellant ""will have 'meant' to import the substance (tablets) if he knew or believed the substance (tablets) was inside the container when he imported it"".

118The second element of the offence the Crown was required to prove was said to be that the boxes contained pseudoephedrine, a border controlled precursor. The document explained that as a matter of law pseudoephedrine was such a precursor.

119The third element which the document stated the Crown was required to prove was that the quantity of pseudoephedrine in the boxes was not less than a commercial quantity.

120The fourth element was described in the following terms:

""That at the time of importing the boxes, the accused either:

(a) knew or believed that the boxes contained a substance of the type that was a border controlled precursor, or:
(b) was aware of a substantial risk that the boxes contained a substance of a type that was a border controlled precursor and in the circumstances known to him it was unjustifiable for him to take the risk that the boxes contained a substance of that type.""

121The final element which the written directions stated the Crown was required to prove was that the appellant imported the substance in boxes either:

""(a) intending to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug, or;
(b) believing that another person intended to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug.""

The written direction pointed out that if the Crown established the other elements then the appellant is taken to have imported the substance with that belief unless he proves to the contrary (this was a reference to the provisions of s 307.14 of the Code).

122The written directions identified three elements that the Crown was required to prove to establish the supply count. The first element identified was that the appellant knowingly took part. In that context, the direction stated that the Crown was required to prove, in respect of the appellant, that he knowingly provided the premises (the warehouse) in which those involved in the enterprise attempted to possess a prohibited drug for supply. The direction pointed out that ""knowingly"" meant with knowledge of what it was that the appellant was taking part in but that it was sufficient for the Crown to establish a belief by the appellant that he was taking part in the supply of a substance of the type that was a prohibited drug.

123The second element was described as taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug. The written document explained the meaning of supply and possession and stated that pseudoephedrine was a prohibited drug.

124The third element referred to was that the Crown was required to prove that the quantity involved was not less than the commercial quantity.

The summing-up and the jury deliberations
125Early in his summing-up the trial judge stated that to establish the importation count the Crown had to prove that the appellant intentionally imported ""the substance, the tablets"" whether or not he knew of the precise nature of the tablets. He pointed out that the importation cannot have gone on beyond 8 August 2008 when the authorities seized what was in the boxes. Subsequently, he pointed out that the Crown did not establish the case against the appellant on the importation count if the appellant only possessed the relevant state of mind after the importation ceased.

126When first describing the elements for the importation count the trial judge gave this direction:

""Element four - and this you might think - the way the case is being conducted, this is the critical element of this charge you may think. That at the time of importing the boxes the accused either (a) knew or believed that the boxes contained a substance of the type that was a border controlled precursor or (b) was aware of a substantial risk that the boxes contained a substance of a type that was a border controlled precursor and in the circumstances known to him it was unjustifiable for him to take the risk that the boxes contained a substance of that type, a border controlled precursor. You might think that is an element that deals with the requisite state of mind of the accused that the Crown have to prove beyond reasonable doubt.""

127The trial judge directed that it was necessary for the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant imported the substance in the boxes either intending to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug or believing another person intended to use any of the substance for that purpose.

128The trial judge then summarised the importation count against the appellant in the following terms:

""I know I am repeating myself a bit here but Lachlan Wilson has committed that offence if the Crown establishes beyond reasonable doubt that he (a) intentionally imported the substance, the tablets, in the forty-five boxes, (b) the boxes contained pseudoephedrine, (c) the quantity of pseudoephedrine in the boxes was not less than the commercial quantity and (d) at the time of importing the boxes Lachlan Wilson either knew or believed that the boxes contained a substance of the type that was a border controlled precursor or was aware of a substantial risk that the boxes contained such a substance, a substance of that type and in the circumstances known to him it was unjustifiable to take such a risk, and (e) Lachlan Wilson imported the substance in the boxes either intending to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug or believing that another person intended to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug.""

129In respect of the supply count, the trial judge pointed out that the Crown first had to prove the appellant knowingly took part in the supply of a prohibited drug. He explained it was sufficient for the Crown to establish belief by the appellant that he was taking part in the supply of such a drug. He explained, in the case of the appellant, the Crown was required to prove that he knowingly provided the premises, namely, the warehouse. He also explained to the jury the extent and meaning of supply.

130The trial judge summed-up for approximately two and a half days. At the commencement of the second day of their deliberations, the jury asked for a transcript of the evidence of the appellant.

131On the sixth day of their deliberations, the jury indicated they had reached a unanimous verdict on most of the counts but stated that they were undecided on Counts 1 and 3, Count 1 being the importation count against the appellant and Count 3 being a count that DS aided and abetted the importation offence charged against the appellant. The trial judge took the verdicts of guilty on the other counts including the supply count against the appellant and gave the jury a Black direction (Black v The Queen [1993] HCA 71; (1993) 179 CLR 44).

132On the seventh day of their deliberations, the jury asked the following questions:

""(1) Is it possible that we come to a guilty verdict on a count 3 and not guilty on a count 1?

(2) Does the accused need to have believed the boxes had pseudoephedrine in them specifically or simply a prohibited substance?

(3) What considerations do we look at to decide if a risk was substantial and if it was unjustifiable to take the risk?""

133The trial judge answered the first question ""No"". In relation to the second question his direction was as follows:

""The answer to that is that the accused had to have the state of mind in relation to a type of precursor and the only precursor that has been - border control precursor - the only one that has been mentioned here is really pseudoephedrine so realistically that is the one you are talking about. But when I say 'state of mind' I am talking about a belief as to whether it was a type of precursor pseudoephedrine or whether the accused was aware of a substantial risk that it was.

You will need to go back to the elements document for that. When you see element 4, the element about the state of mind is that the accused knew or believed the boxes contained a substance of the type that was a border control precursor pseudoephedrine or was aware of a substantial risk that the boxes contained a substance of the type that was a border control precursor and in circumstances known to him it was unjustifiable for him to take the risk that the boxes contained a substance of that type.""

134The jury subsequently asked the following questions:

""(1) Can we reach a not guilty verdict if we believe one or two of the elements but not all of them?

(2) Regarding Count 1 if element 4(b) is proved, does this satisfy element 1?

(3) On element 4, does it really mean if Lachlan knew or believed his container was being used in some way and there was a risk that it could be the precursor in his trial, and therefore it was irresponsible for him to allow the use of his container?""

135His Honour answered the first question ""No"". In relation to the second question his Honour gave the following direction:

""He has to know generally that he is importing some type of tablet. He does not have to know anything about it really, just that it is some type of tablet, otherwise he cannot be intentionally importing the substance in the boxes. That is as far as that element goes. So when I look at your question, 'If element 4(b) is proved, does this satisfy element 1?' Well you need to consider both elements. The first element is, he has to intend to import some type of tablet. So the second deals with his state of mind at the time he imports some type of tablet and that is the element that relates to him knowing or believing the boxes contain some type of border controlled precursor or, that he was aware of the substantial risk that the boxes contained a substance that was a type of border controlled precursor and in the circumstances, known to him, it was unjustifiable for him to take the risk, et cetera. So that deals with that note.""

136In relation to the third question, his Honour gave the following direction:

""This is the element whereby the Crown has to establish beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused knew or believed that the boxes contained a substance of the type that was a border controlled precursor or, that he was aware of a substantial risk that the boxes contained a substance of the type that was a border controlled precursor and in the circumstances, know to him, it was unjustifiable for him to take the risk that the boxes contained a substance of that type.""

137On the eighth day of their deliberations, the jury asked the following question:

""If Wilson suspected that [ES] put something in the boxes and took no action to stop the importation is this tantamount to Wilson intentionally importing the tablets.""

138The trial judge answered the question stating that suspicion was not enough and referred the jury back to the written directions. He emphasised that the state of mind had to be present whilst the importation was on foot and that the importation concluded by 8 August 2008.

139The trial judge then repeated his directions regarding the first element of the offence. He stated, in relation to that element, the Crown had to prove that the appellant intentionally imported some type of drug.

140In relation to the fourth element, he then gave the following further direction:

""When you get to the other elements, and I will just refer to element 4 and I have told you repeatedly you have to be satisfied of all the elements beyond reasonable doubt, but when you get to the other elements and in particular element 4 it is clearly not sufficient that the Crown establishes a state of mind in relation to a drug generally, because you need to look at the element and element 4, 'at the time of importing the boxes the accused either knew or believed that the boxes contained a substance of a type that was a border control precursor or (b) was aware of a substantial risk that the boxes contained a substance of a type that was a border control precursor and in the circumstances known to him it was unjustifiable for him to take the risk that the boxes contained a substance of that type'. You are always looking at the question of the state of mind of the accused and you can look at what the accused did and what he did not do and the risk that he took but it always comes down to the actual state of mind of the accused.""

141Subsequently, the jury indicated that they were unable to reach a verdict on Count 1 against the appellant and Count 3 against DS and were discharged.

The conviction appeal
The submissions
(a) Ground 1
142The appellant pointed to the fact that the jury were directed that the importation could not go beyond 8 August 2008 because that was the date the authorities replaced the pseudoephedrine tablets with an inert substance.

143The appellant referred to the directions given to the jury and the course of their deliberations which we have outlined above. He submitted it was clear that the jury was unable to unanimously find beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had the requisite state of mind with respect to prohibited drugs as at 8 August 2008. He submitted there was nothing in the evidence adduced relating to events after 8 August which could have raised the appellant's level of knowledge to the point that the jury could have been satisfied the appellant had the state of mind required to make out the supply count.

144The appellant pointed out that he left Australia on 4 August 2008 and did not return until 19 August. He submitted that it followed that for the supply count to be made out he needed to have departed with full knowledge of the enterprise, the issue on which the jury was unable to agree regarding the importation count. He submitted that, in these circumstances, it was not open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had the requisite state of mind at some other stage with respect to the supply count. He submitted the evidence was not sufficient to support the proposition that the appellant had suspicion leading up to 8 August which crystallised into full knowledge at some time thereafter.

145Senior counsel for the appellant submitted at the hearing that it was not necessary for him to submit that the failure to reach a verdict on the importation count was equivalent to an acquittal on that count. He said that he relied on the inability of the jury to find the appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt on the count. He pointed out that the fourth element for s 307.11(1)(c) of the Code is recklessness which is a lower threshold than knowledge for the supply count and submitted that if the jury was not satisfied that his client was aware that there was a substantial risk the importation included a border controlled precursor, it was counter-intuitive that they could be satisfied to the requisite standard that he knew the substance imported was a prohibited drug.

146Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that, having regard to the senior position the appellant was alleged to have held within the importation syndicate, the verdict could not logically be explained by the fact that, whilst the jury was not satisfied that the appellant was aware it was a border controlled precursor, they were satisfied that the appellant was aware the substance was a prohibited drug. This was particularly the case when those said to be lower in the hierarchy, DS, Ibrahim Jidah and Yousef Jidah, were convicted of offences under s 24A of the DMT Act.

147Counsel for the appellant also referred to the questions asked by the jury to which we have referred to in par [132] above. In relation to the second question and the answer which was given, he said the only drug realistically referred to at the trial was pseudoephedrine and thus the same difficulty which confronted the jury in respect of the importation count should have confronted them in respect of the supply count.

148Senior counsel for the appellant also pointed to the final question asked by the jury to which we have referred to in par [137] above. He pointed out that the appellant had given evidence that he was concerned there was something not right about the boxes but believed it was something other than drugs. He submitted this uncertainty as to the knowledge of the appellant, as distinct from that of DS, was the reason for the question as to whether the jury could come to a guilty verdict on Count 3 but acquit on Count 1. 

149Senior counsel for the appellant also emphasised that the question asked by the jury of whether they could convict if they were satisfied of one or two of the elements, not all of them, indicated the jury was concerned with more than one element. He stated that, in those circumstances, the failure to reach a verdict could not be attributed to a failure to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew the precise identity of the drug.

150Senior counsel for the appellant summarised his submission by stating that, if the jury were not satisfied of his knowledge of the drug for the importation count, the verdict on the supply count was inexplicable and inconsistent as there was no evidence to suggest the appellant acquired the requisite knowledge of the supply after the importation ceased on 8 August 2008.

151The Crown submitted there were two fundamental problems with the appellant's argument. First, it was submitted that a failure by a jury to reach a verdict is not equivalent to a not guilty verdict and second, that it was possible to infer reasons why the jury might have agreed unanimously on the supply count but not on the importation count. The Crown emphasised that caution was necessary before concluding there was a miscarriage of justice arising out of inconsistent verdicts.

152The Crown submitted that a plausible explanation for the conviction on the supply count compared with a failure to reach a verdict on the importation count was that the counts involved different states of mind. The Crown pointed out that on the supply count, the jury had to be satisfied the appellant provided the premises knowing or believing that he was taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug of some kind but it was not necessary for the jury to be satisfied that the state of mind went to a particular type of prohibited drug. By contrast, the Crown submitted that the importation count required the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt, first, that the appellant had the intention to import a substance but also knew or believed that the substance was a border controlled precursor. The Crown pointed to the fact that the jury were directed that it had to be established that the appellant knew or believed the substance imported was specifically pseudoephedrine before the appellant could be found guilty of the importation count. 

153The Crown referred in particular to the question ""Does the accused need to have believed the boxes had pseudoephedrine in them specifically or simply a prohibited substance?"". It was submitted this was the issue which troubled the jury. The Crown referred to the statement by Hodgson JA in Standen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2011] NSWCCA 187; (2011) 218 A Crim R 28 at [23] where the possibility of these differences leading to different verdicts was accepted.

(b) Ground 2
154The appellant principally relied on the submissions made on behalf of Yousef Jidah in support of this ground (Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270 at [17]-[27]). Senior counsel for the appellant also pointed out that the importation count necessarily involved a supply, because it was not the case that the appellant was importing intending to manufacture a controlled drug himself. He submitted having regard to that fact and notwithstanding that the substance in question could be both a prohibited drug and a precursor for the purposes of the different statutes, it was inappropriate to characterise it in different ways for the purpose of bringing two different counts arising out of the same events at the same trial. He submitted that this was an abuse of process.

155As we indicated in our judgment in the appeal of Yousef Jidah, senior counsel for the appellant also submitted that this led to the indictment being bad and in those circumstances the conviction should be quashed.

156The Crown relied on the submissions to which we have referred to in the judgment on the appeal of Yousef Jidah (Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270 at [28]-[33]).

Consideration
(a) Ground 1
157In MacKenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 366-368, the plurality stated that, where factual inconsistency is said to arise by reason of different jury verdicts upon different counts in the originating process, the test is one of logic and reasonableness. Further, if there was a proper way by which the verdicts could be reconciled allowing it to be concluded that the jury performed its functions as required, that conclusion generally will be accepted. It is only where inconsistency rises to the point that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside (see also Still v R [2010] NSWCCA 131 at [60] and Dungay v R; R v Dungay [2010] NSWCCA 82 at [22]).

158In the present case, the verdicts in fact were not inconsistent as there was no verdict of acquittal on the importation count. The real issue in these circumstances, particularly having regard to the words of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), is whether the verdict was unreasonable. In considering that issue in this case, one factor which must be taken into account is the fact that the jury were unable to convict on the importation count.

159The principles governing the question of whether a verdict should be set aside as unreasonable are well established. In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 the High Court stated at [11]-[13] that the approach to be adopted was that laid down by it in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-494. The Court is required to make its own independent assessment of the evidence and if, after taking into account the primary responsibility of the jury in determining the question of guilt or innocence and the benefit of the jury having seen and heard the witnesses, the Court is left in doubt as to the reasonableness of the verdict, the doubt in most cases is a doubt that the jury should have experienced. Further, the appellate court's reasons should disclose its assessment of the capacity of the evidence to support the verdict (BCM v The Queen [2013] HCA 48; (2013) 88 ALJR 101 at [31]).

160A verdict will not be unreasonable if the review of the evidence shows only that it would have been possible for a jury to reach a different outcome. As was stated by Hayne J in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559 at [113], for the verdict to be set aside as unreasonable, the jury must have, as distinct from might have, had a reasonable doubt (Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreeing).

161However, it is not sufficient for a verdict to be reasonable that there was evidence on which a jury could convict. So much is made clear from the passage of M v The Queen supra cited in SKA v The Queen supra at [13]. If, after giving full weight to the primacy of the jury, the court is left in reasonable doubt as to the verdict, it is only where the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving the doubt can a court conclude there was no miscarriage of justice (see also MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [26] and [53]-[56]).

162This Court in R v TK [2009] NSWCCA 151; (2009) 74 NSWLR 299 suggested at [135] (per Simpson J, McClellan CJ at CL agreeing at [1] and Latham J agreeing at [204]) that where the unreasonableness is said to be based on the existence of inconsistent verdicts, the issue is not just whether the verdict was open on the whole of the evidence but whether it was open on the whole of the evidence having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances (including the fact the jury acquitted on one or some counts), whatever can be discerned as to the explanation for the acquittals and whatever insight can be gained into the jury's thinking and reasoning.

163We have set out the directions made by the learned trial judge above; there was no challenge to these directions. The written direction on the importation count stated that the jury had to be satisfied that the appellant either knew or believed the boxes contained a substance of the type that was a border controlled precursor or that there was a substantial risk that the boxes contained such a substance (see par [120] above). That direction can be contrasted with a direction given in relation to the supply count to which we have referred to in par [122]. His Honour repeated the direction concerning the importation count on two occasions during his summing-up (see pars [126] and [128] above) and in answer to the questions asked by the jury (see pars [133], [135] and [140] above).

164The questions asked by the jury were asked after they had entered a verdict of guilty on the supply count involving a prohibited drug. Question 2 of the first set of questions draws the distinction between the appellant knowing the boxes contained pseudoephedrine or simply a prohibited substance. The response by the trial judge focused on the need for the jury to be satisfied that the appellant knew or had a belief that the boxes contained a border controlled precursor, namely pseudoephedrine (see par [133] above).

165The subsequent questions demonstrating concern about the fourth element of the importation count must be considered in that context. In particular, the question concerning belief of one or two of the elements but not all of them was capable of referring to the distinction between a belief that it was a drug that was being imported as distinct from a border controlled precursor. The trial judge was careful to draw that distinction in his directions (see pars [135]-[136] above).

166There was thus an explanation for the failure to reach a verdict on the importation count whilst convicting on the supply count, namely, the jury was satisfied that the appellant knowingly supplied his premises in connection with the supply of a prohibited drug whilst not being satisfied that he knew or believed the prohibited drug was a border controlled precursor. The question remains whether it was open for the jury to reach this conclusion.

167We have set out the evidence above. There was no issue that what was imported was a prohibited drug nor that it was a border controlled substance. The only issue is the appellant's knowledge of the presence of the drug in his container which was to be delivered to his warehouse. Relevantly it should be noted that it was the appellant who contacted the supplier of the products in container TTNU (see par [33]). Immediately thereafter, there was the first (allegedly coded) telephone call in which ES reminded the appellant ""My girlfriend's waiting"" and to which the appellant replied ""but she hasn't got back to me"". That was followed by the communication of 15 July 2008 concerning ""your girlfriend's horse"" (see par [37] above). It is significant that the appellant was only able to give a date the horse was running after the reference to the girlfriend. It was certainly open to the jury to infer this conversation was not about racehorses, particularly when on the same day the appellant contacted his Customs broker asking when the first container would arrive and immediately thereafter gave ES information consistent with that date whilst informing him that ""[war] stories"" would arrive in early August. As we have indicated above the first container in fact arrived on 18 July.

168On 8 August 2008, the appellant was informed of a delay in the arrival of the second container. We have set out the two conversations between the appellant and ES on that day in pars [49] and [50] above. The conversations clearly related to delays in an importation and the second one indicated a concern that other people were in the know. It is significant that in a conversation clearly about an import, the appellant was told not to return home. In a later conversation, ES told him not to return home until ""the horse"" had been sold (par [56]). It would be open to a jury to infer that in fact what the appellant was being told was not to return home until the importation had been successfully completed.

169We have also set out the conversations between ES and the appellant after the container containing the prohibited substance had been cleared. Significantly that conversation which ostensibly dealt with the appellant's father's prostate test results took place just over an hour after the appellant had received news of the clearance of the container. It was the appellant's evidence that this was an unfortunate coincidence. The subsequent conversations between ES and the appellant were consistent with a successful conclusion of a venture.

170We have also set out the explanations given by the appellant for these conversations. Some of them defy credibility. He stated that Royale Colourstones had taken over as his consignor without his knowledge. That is inconsistent with the fact that he was asked on 26 June 2008 to contact ""royale_colour@yahoo.com"" and request a product list and that he did so and received a product list (pars [32]-[35] above). It is also inconsistent with his email to his custom broker at par [36] above. The appellant's explanation of the conversation of 8 August, namely that he believed ES was bringing something into Australia to evade tax liabilities, first shows that he was aware that ES was secretly importing something using the appellant's container and raises the question why he did not ask what was in the container if he did not know.

171The appellant asserted that the conversations and SMS messages between him and ES on 5, 7 and 11 August 2008 concerned the racehorses ""Rich Hussy"" and ""War Stories"". We have set out the substance of these conversations above (see pars [44], [46] and [56]). The conversations of 5 August and 7 August were contemporaneous with inquiries made by the appellant of his Customs broker and DS as to the whereabouts of the container. Further, they must be read in the context of the conversation of 8 August between the appellant and ES which took place immediately after the appellant was informed that a hold had been placed on the container. These conversations and SMS messages were evidently about delays in getting the container cleared. Moreover, the conversation of 11 August concerning a sale of a horse immediately followed an inquiry to his Customs broker about clearance of the container. 

172It is difficult in these circumstances to give any credence to the appellant's explanations of the communications which took place between him and ES and it was certainly open to the jury acting reasonably to reject them. We are satisfied the jury was correct in rejecting these explanations and concluding beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew or believed that prohibited drugs were being transported in the container. It does not necessarily follow from that that the jury must have also had no reasonable doubt that the appellant knew or believed he was importing a border controlled substance in his container. To the extent that any residual doubt may be said to exist as to the jury's verdict on the supply count, it is satisfied by virtue of the advantage which the jury had in seeing and hearing the witnesses.

173It follows that this ground of appeal is not made out.

(b) Ground 2
174The appellant adopted the submissions made on behalf of Yousef Jidah (see Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270 at [17]-[27]). The only additional submission was that as the same substance was imported it was factually inconsistent to bring the charges. However, there was nothing inconsistent in charging importation of a border controlled precursor and in addition the supply of a prohibited drug as the substance was a border controlled precursor for the importation count and a prohibited drug for the purpose of the supply count. Indeed, it is inherent in the appellant's submissions on Ground 1 (that a conviction on one count and a failure to convict on the other resulted in an inconsistent verdict) that the counts themselves were not inconsistent.

175Otherwise for the reasons given in our judgment in relation to Yousef Jidah (Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270 at [34]-[58]), this ground is not made out.

176It follows that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

The sentence appeal 
177The application for leave to appeal is against a sentence of imprisonment for 16 years and 2 months, comprised of a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months and an additional term of 5 years and 8 months, imposed in relation to the supply count. That sentence was imposed against a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. 

178The appellant was sentenced in accordance with the principles in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.

179He relied upon four grounds of appeal:

(1)His Honour sentenced the appellant on an erroneous factual basis, being on a basis inconsistent with the verdict of the jury; 

(2)His Honour took into account matters that would have constituted a separate offence for which the appellant was not convicted;

(3)The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive; and

(4)The appellant suffers a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence imposed upon his co-offender ES. 

180The first two grounds concern the fact that the jury was unable to agree on the importation count. 

181The complaint about disparity, as the fourth ground of appeal, is limited to a comparison with the sentence imposed on ES following his plea of guilty on 8 February 2012 to aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring this appellant to import a commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine, a border controlled precursor, contrary to ss 307.11(1) and (2) of the Code. ES was sentenced to imprisonment for 9 years and 11 months, comprised of a non-parole period of 6 years and an additional term of 3 years and 11 months. His sentence was discounted by 40 per cent for his plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities. His appeal against that sentence was dismissed (ES v R [2014] NSWCCA 268).

The facts for sentencing purposes
182The Crown case against the appellant on the supply count was that he had made his warehouse available to those who he knew were to exercise control over the boxes containing the pseudoephedrine after the container had cleared Customs, knowing that it was intended the boxes containing the drugs would be isolated and unpacked and the drugs extracted for on-supply. 

183As concerns the extent of the appellant's knowledge, his Honour was satisfied that he ""well knew before"" the container arrived in Australia, that is to say well before the container was delivered to his warehouse, that there were prohibited drugs secreted within it. Further, his Honour was satisfied that although the appellant acted at the behest of ES, the principal (with whom he had a shared understanding that the prohibited drugs would be supplied using his warehouse as the receiving and clearing depot), he knew prior to travelling to Thailand on 4 August 2008 of the nature of the overall drug enterprise in the critical supply phase and was aware that in making his warehouse available he would be taking part in the supply of hundreds of kilograms of a prohibited drug. 

184His Honour made the following additional findings of fact for sentencing purposes:
(a)The appellant's role in providing the warehouse was a critical aspect of the enterprise. It provided a cloak of legitimacy to the importation of the drugs and provided a cover to avert suspicion and detection;

(b)The appellant took active steps to facilitate the enterprise whilst he was in Thailand by deputising DS and maintaining constant communication with DS, ES and the Customs broker;

(c)The appellant was absent from Australia by design, so as to distance himself from the importation but, more particularly, to distance himself from any involvement with the reception of the imported container at his warehouse;

(d)The appellant played a very senior role in the enterprise which involved a substantial level of planning; and

(e)There was evidence of a considerable degree of cooperation between various people, including the appellant, there was ""much determination"" and he was a senior member of the ""team"".

The appellant's subjective circumstances
185His Honour accepted that the appellant was a person of otherwise excellent character who had contributed a great deal to the community. He also accepted that the appellant was unlikely to reoffend and that he had excellent prospects of rehabilitation, all of which afforded him some basis for leniency. 

The sentences imposed on other offenders
186In referring to the sentences already imposed upon Ibrahim Jidah and Yousef Jidah (co-offenders described by his Honour respectively as ""the escort"" and the ""van driver"") his Honour noted that they each had criminal records which denied them some level of leniency. His Honour also noted that although both co-offenders were sentenced prior to the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen supra, in his view the non-parole periods (of respectively 10 years and 3 months imposed on Ibrahim Jidah and 8 years and 9 months on Yousef Jidah) were the minimum that could properly have been imposed having regard to the objective gravity of their offending with respect to the supply count, being the same supply in which the appellant was knowingly involved. This appellant does not complain about any disparity with the sentences imposed on either Ibrahim Jidah or Yousef Jidah, although they complain that their sentences give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance when compared to the sentence imposed on this appellant and DS (see Ibrahim Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 269 and Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270). 

Ground 1: His Honour sentenced the appellant on an erroneous factual basis, being on a basis inconsistent with the verdict of the jury 
Ground 2: His Honour took into account matters that would have constituted a separate offence for which the appellant was not convicted
187In large part, the submissions in support of the first two grounds of appeal depend upon the submission that the verdict on the supply count, and the jury's lack of unanimity on the importation count, must be taken to mean that they were satisfied that the appellant only formed the requisite state of mind with respect to the pseudoephedrine he was knowingly concerned in supplying after 8 August 2008 (that is to say after the container arrived in Australia), and that his Honour was in error in finding that his knowledge preceded that date. 

188That submission was also advanced in support of the appeal against conviction. For the reasons we gave in dismissing the appeal against conviction at par [167]-[172] above, we are satisfied that the evidence at trial amply supported a finding that the appellant's state of mind as to the contents of the container preceded the date of its arrival in Australia. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the appellant's knowing involvement in the supply of pseudoephedrine he believed to be in the container, also preceded that date.

189Because there was no necessary finding embedded in the jury verdict as to when the appellant knew (or believed) that the container was to be delivered to his warehouse, it was a matter for the trial judge when sentencing to consider that question for sentencing purposes referable to the evidence led at trial (see Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1), as it was for his Honour to make other findings concerning the appellant's conduct as a person who had knowingly participated in the supply of a large commercial quantity of prohibited drugs referable to that evidence. In so doing he was constrained only by the principle in The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383 such that he could not take into account any part of the appellant's conduct that would have warranted him being convicted on the importation count. His Honour said: 

""I am required to find facts which are consistent with the verdict of the jury and also in this case facts which do not offend the principle of De Simoni. As I said, I am mindful that the alleged importation offence upon which the jury could not agree had a specific mental element, particularly as to the nature of the drug.""

190His Honour made no finding that the appellant knew or believed that what was in the container was a border controlled precursor or that he intended to use, or believed that another person intended to use it to manufacture a border controlled drug.

191In oral argument on the appeal, the De Simoni principle was said by the appellant's counsel to have been breached by his Honour's consistent reference to ""the enterprise"" when describing what he referred to as the appellant's ""active steps"" in ""the enterprise"" and what he described as the critical and senior role he performed in the notional hierarchy of offenders in ""the enterprise"", since in so doing he could only have been referring to ""the enterprise"" as the importation. That being so, it was submitted that the appellant was sentenced for conduct integral to the importation of the drugs when he was not criminally liable for that conduct. 

192Were the various interrelated findings of fact, summarised in par [184](a) - (e) above, referable only to what the Crown alleged to have been the appellant's involvement in the importation count (or relied upon at trial only as proof of that fact) then, consistent with the principle in De Simoni, those findings would not have been available to inform the appellant's criminality for sentencing purposes on the supply count. The evidence was not, however, limited in that way. It also informed the extent of the appellant's knowledge of the use to which his premises were to be put in supplying those drugs, in the sense that it established that he knew a shipping container of drugs from Thailand was to be delivered to his premises upon its clearance through Customs and when that would occur. The fact that he maintained contact with DS to facilitate clearance through Customs was not limited to the successful importation of the container (for which he was not to be sentenced), it also impacted directly on the success of the enterprise in its supply phase for which he was to be sentenced. That evidence also provided a basis upon which his Honour reasoned to the conclusion that the appellant knew that the drugs he was knowingly concerned in supplying would be well in excess of 5 kg, the large commercial quantity of the drug under the DMT Act. 

193The extent of the appellant's knowledge or awareness of what was to occur in the supply phase is to be distinguished from the case where a person knowingly takes part in a supply of drugs by the provision of premises unaware of the provenance of the drugs; the form in which they are to be delivered; how they might be accessed; or the way in which they are to be handled in preparation for their on-supply. His Honour found that this appellant played a senior role in the supply of the drugs by making his premises available, well knowing the scale of the enterprise that had the on-supply of the drugs as its ultimate objective. For his Honour to have ignored the overall context in which the drugs were to be made available to be on-supplied would have deprived the Court of evidence directly relevant to a consideration of the extent of the appellant's knowledge of the supply in which he was a knowing participant, the circumstances in which he became involved and the role he performed. The extent of the appellant's knowledge of the drug that he was knowingly concerned in supplying, including its provenance, quality and weight, was critical to his Honour making an informed assessment of the appellant's criminal culpability. 

194It is fundamental to the duty of the trial judge when sentencing to focus on what an offender did in committing an offence, in particular, where the offence involves a large number of offenders, a feature inherent in large scale drug importing and trafficking (see The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270). The task of identifying what an offender did is also an exercise which, as a matter of practical necessity, involves referring to the context in which the particular offending occurred and an offender's knowledge of the surrounding circumstances. To have done otherwise in this case would have given the sentencing exercise an air of artificiality. We do not consider that his Honour's analysis of the appellant's role in the supply has either explicitly or implicitly included what may also have been the role he performed as an importer of the tablets. To the extent that his knowledge of the enterprise and its ultimate objective spanned both the import phase and the supply phase, on a fair reading of the sentencing remarks, it cannot be fairly said that his Honour sentenced the appellant for any offending in the import phase that was not also comprehended by his knowing involvement in the supply of what was imported. 

Ground 3: The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive
195For the appellant to successfully challenge the sentence for the supply count on the ground that it is manifestly excessive, it is necessary for this Court to be satisfied that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust, having regard to the principle that there is no single ""correct"" sentence and that judges at first instance should be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of settled sentencing principles and consistency in sentencing approach (see Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325-326, Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25] and Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [58]-[59]). 

196Whether the appellant's sentence is manifestly excessive is a conclusion. It is not necessary for any patent error in the sentencing process of the judge's sentencing reasons to be identified; it is the examination of the sentencing outcome that dictates whether it can be shown that the sentencing discretion has miscarried. 

197For the reasons already discussed in considering grounds 1 and 2, we are unable to discern any error in his Honour's assessment of the appellant's criminal culpability on the supply count, nor anything to suggest that the appointment of his role in the drug syndicate was in error. Neither is it suggested (and nor could it be) that his Honour imposed a sentence contrary to the approach mandated by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen supra by utilising the standard non-parole period of 15 years for any purpose other than as a legislative guidepost in imposing a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months. 

198His Honour also said he would afford the appellant some leniency having regard to his subjective circumstances. It was not submitted on the appeal that the sentence imposed suggested that insufficient weight was given to those circumstances as part of the synthesising of all matters relevant to the sentencing exercise. 

199We are not persuaded that the sentence imposed on this appellant, against a maximum of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years is manifestly excessive. To the contrary, for the gravity of the appellant's offending as a supplier of prohibited drugs in an enterprise of this scale and design, the sentence was well within the exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion.

Ground 4: The appellant suffers a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence imposed upon his co-offender [ES]
200In respect of the fourth ground of appeal, it was essentially submitted that despite the different maximum penalties that attach to the importation of the pseudoephedrine as a border controlled drug under the Code and the supply of it as a prohibited drug under the DMT Act (respectively 25 years imprisonment, and life imprisonment, to which a standard non-parole period of 15 years applies), and despite the fact that ES's sentence was heavily discounted for his plea of guilty and assistance, there remains a marked disparity between ES's discounted head sentence of 16 years and 6 months and the sentence imposed on the appellant (ES's sentence being only 4 months longer), such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. 

201It was submitted that ES's criminality as the ""mastermind"" of the importation (the role attributed to him by the trial judge when sentencing), in contrast to the appellant's knowing concern in the supply of the drugs that had been imported (by providing his premises for the purposes of unpacking and distributing the drugs), substantiates his complaint and that this Court should intervene and re-sentence the appellant to correct the disparity.

202The principle of parity derives from the fundamental norm of equal justice. In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462, at [28] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, their Honours said of equal justice:

""It requires, so far as the law permits, that like cases be treated alike. Equal justice according to law also requires, where the law permits, differential treatment of persons according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of the law. As Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 608, [65]:

'Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect.'""
(References omitted).

203The sense of grievance complained of when the sentence for one offender is compared relative to that of a co-offender or co-offenders is to be assessed objectively governed by considerations of substance rather than form. It is only triggered where differences in the sentences imposed on co-offenders are disproportionate to relevant distinctions in the role each played in the commission of the offence (even if the roles might be differently described or involve different conduct) and in their subjective circumstances. There are necessarily degrees of both similarity and difference in the criminal conduct of co-offenders and in their subjective circumstances. In some cases, this requires that different sentences be imposed. However, it is only where the discrepancy between sentences is not reasonably explained by the degree of difference between co-offenders and their offending that the disparity is such that appellate intervention is required. For there to be a justifiable sense of grievance, the disparity must be ""gross"", ""marked"" or ""glaring"" (see the discussion by Howie J in Crystal Lee England v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [61]-[67]).

204In Gill v R [2010] NSWCCA 236 at [58], McColl JA (with whom RS Hulme and Latham JJ agreed) observed that an applicant faces considerable obstacles in invoking the parity principle in circumstances where a sentence, said to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, was imposed by a sentencing judge who was aware of the sentences imposed on co-offenders and it is clear that the sentence is structured in that knowledge.

205In our view, the trial judge, in sentencing, was in an optimum position to assess the differences and similarities in the role both this appellant and ES played in an enterprise in which they occupied positions of seniority in a notional hierarchy of offenders, an enterprise which had as its ultimate objective the supply of hundreds of kilograms of pseudoephedrine. His Honour was also in the best position to take account of such differences in their subjective circumstances as was material to the sentencing exercise in recognition of parity principles. 

206Relativity in the sentences of this appellant and ES can be explained not only by the senior roles they performed in an enterprise that had supply as its ultimate objective, but by what they did in ensuring its success, despite the differences in the counts upon which they were ultimately convicted. We do not regard such differences in their subjective circumstances, as identified, as having any bearing. Ultimately, we are not persuaded that the appellant's sense of grievance is objectively justified.

2765468,Wingrove-Pryce v R [2014] NSWCCA 290,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offences and sentence:The applicant was tried by a jury before Judge King SC in the District Court at Sydney between 13 May and 21 May 2013.  
2The indictment pleaded three counts:
Count 1 - On or about 5 February 2012 at Watsons Bay the applicant attempted to indecently assault AP.
Count 2 - On or about 5 February 2012 at Watsons Bay the applicant had sexual intercourse with AP without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting.
Count 3 - On or about 5 February 2012 at Watsons Bay the applicant attempted to indecently assault AP.
3On 21 May 2013 the jury acquitted the applicant of Counts 1 and 2, but found him guilty of Count 3.  On 23 August 2013 his Honour dismissed the charge without proceeding to a conviction pursuant to s10(1)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
4A Notice of Intention to Appeal Against Conviction was filed on 23 October 2013 on behalf of the applicant.  The expiration date of that notice was subsequently extended to 30 June 2014.
5The applicant relies upon one ground of appeal against conviction:
Ground 1 - The verdict of guilty on Count 3 is unreasonable or cannot be supported in terms of s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in light of the acquittal on Counts 1 and 2.
Crown case and evidence at trial
6The Crown case was that on 5 February 2012 the applicant kissed the complainant on her lips without her consent.  The Crown alleged that on the same date after the kiss and after the complainant had fallen asleep, the applicant engaged in penile/vaginal intercourse with her without her consent.  The Crown alleged that on 5 February 2012 in the afternoon the applicant put his hand inside the bikini pants of the complainant without her consent.
7The element in dispute in respect of Counts 1 and 2 was consent.  In respect of the third count, the conduct was denied.  The only direct evidence in relation to each offence came from the complainant.  There was no forensic or medical evidence in relation to the sexual intercourse.
8The complainant and the applicant were trainees serving at the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) training establishment, HMAS Watson.  On the evening of 4 February the complainant and two female friends attended a local hotel.  Before leaving HMAS Watson the complainant sent the applicant her mobile telephone number and they exchanged thirteen messages in which the complainant suggested that the applicant should come out with her.  He declined and stayed in his room in the accommodation block.  While at the hotel, the complainant had one alcoholic drink.
9At 11.55pm the applicant sent the complainant a message saying ""You coming to hang or what?"".  At 12.11am the complainant replied ""I'll be there in five"".  The applicant went to a room occupied by Melissa Gay and Chevy Watson where he had been invited by the complainant on the basis that there would be a movie playing on the television.  After he entered the room, the applicant took up a position sitting on the floor.  There were four other people in the room at this time.  Ms Gay was lying on the top of a double bunk bed.  Messrs Watson and McPhee were sitting on the bottom bunk.  Mr Palmer, who was moderately affected by alcohol, was lying on the floor and was soon asleep.  
10The complainant arrived and took up a position on the floor next to the applicant.  She was wearing shorts and a t-shirt.  The complainant sat facing the television with her back leaning against a chair.  Her legs were outstretched.  The applicant moved to a position where he was lying on the floor in front of the complainant, his head in her lap.
11Later the lights were turned off and the complainant and applicant lay on the floor side by side.  Initially they shared a single pillow but subsequently Ms Gay gave the complainant a second pillow.  Later she placed a sheet over the complainant and the applicant, who were facing each other as they lay on the floor.  Shortly thereafter the television was turned off.
12The applicant attempted to kiss the complainant who moved away from him and told him she did not wish to do so.  Initially the complainant's evidence was that the applicant had not actually kissed her but tried to.  When she was recalled, she said that ""He tried to kiss me and he also kissed me at one point"".  This was the evidence as to Count 1.  
13The applicant's case in respect of Count 1 was that the kissing occurred but that it was consensual.
14The complainant fell asleep next to the applicant on the floor.  Later in the early hours of the morning, the complainant said that she awoke to find the applicant on top of her with his penis inside her vagina.  She said her shorts and underwear had been removed and that the applicant was pushing his penis into her vagina.  
15The complainant said that she attempted to push the applicant away but he was too heavy.  She said that when she attempted to push him in the chest, he grabbed her wrists and held them forcefully on each side of her head.  She said that the harder she struggled, the more force the applicant used to hold her wrists.  She said she struggled to breathe and ""was really scared and wanted him off me"".
16The complainant said that after about five minutes ""all of a sudden"" the applicant removed his penis from her vagina and ejaculated on her stomach.  The applicant then lay down next to her and she did not move or cry out.  She said that thereafter she remained awake.
17The applicant did not deny that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with the complainant but maintained that at all times it was consensual.  No-one else present in the room was awake at the time when this sexual intercourse took place.  None of the Crown witnesses gave evidence that they had any knowledge or awareness at the time that the sexual intercourse between the applicant and the complainant was occurring.
18The complainant's evidence was that she did not go to sleep, was awake when the other people in the room woke and that she did not put on her shorts until the others had woken.  The complainant did not scream out or complain to anyone in the room.  This was the evidence in relation to Count 2.
19Later that morning, the complainant said that she got up, found her shorts and underpants and put them back on.   When she had a shower the complainant noted that there was semen on her groin and stomach areas.  Her vagina was sore and there were bruises on her wrists and knees.
20There was evidence from Mr Watson and Ms Gay that at 7am the complainant and the applicant were still asleep on the floor facing each other and that the complainant was fully dressed.
21Later still that morning the complainant went with other trainees, including the applicant, to Pancakes on the Rocks where they had breakfast.  There the applicant pushed his way next to the complainant when some photographs were being taken.   After breakfast, the group walked around some nearby markets and the applicant attempted on a number of occasions to hold the complainant's hand but each time she pushed his hand away.
22Still later on the same day the complainant, the applicant, other members of the group and two other trainees went to Camp Cove Beach.  The applicant drove his own vehicle to the beach with the complainant in the front seat with Ms Gay and Mr McPhee in the rear of the vehicle.  The applicant was unable to find a parking spot so those two trainees were dropped off at the beach and the complainant remained in the car while the applicant drove back to HMAS Watson.  The complainant did not discuss either Count 1 or Count 2 with the applicant because she was still in shock in relation to those offences.  The applicant and the complainant then returned to the beach where they joined the other trainees.
23The group went swimming.  While the complainant was in the water and facing the beach on at least three occasions she said that the applicant came up behind her, put his arms around her and attempted to insert his hand inside the bikini bottom of the swimming costume she was wearing.  Each time he did so, the complainant tried to push the applicant away.  
24That version of events was somewhat different to that which she had given when making her statement to the police.  In her statement she said that the applicant had put his hand ""under my swimmers"".  The complainant said that she had had enough of this behaviour and walked up to the beach.  This was the evidence in relation to Count 3.
25When she left the water the complainant made a complaint about Count 3 to trainees Bugden and Palmer.  She told them that she wanted the applicant to leave her alone.  Mr Palmer gave the complainant a hug to prevent the applicant from approaching her again.  Later some of the trainees (but not the applicant) were having dinner.  The applicant sent a number of SMS messages to the complainant in which he said he wanted to talk to her.  The complainant informed Messrs Bugden and Palmer of this and they sent SMS messages to the applicant with a view to having him desist.
26When she returned to the Base, the complainant went to the room of another trainee, Ms Adock.  The applicant was there and the complainant told him that she did not want to have anything to do with him and that he was to leave her alone.  The complainant then went and had a shower.  Later the complainant went to the bar with Ms Adcock and there joined Messrs Bugden and Palmer.  The applicant was also present playing pool at an adjacent table.
27Shortly thereafter Mr Bugden accompanied the complainant to a nearby spare room where they talked.  When he asked her about the bruises on her legs, the complainant broke down and told him about the offence in Count 2.  The complainant told Mr Bugden that she did not want anyone else informed.  The complainant returned to her own quarters and retired for the night.  She noted, but ignored, an SMS on her mobile telephone that had been sent by the applicant.  
28On 6 February 2012 the complainant passed by but ignored the applicant.  She then ran away from where she had seen him.  Later that day, the complainant spoke with the officer of the day but declined the opportunity to speak about the ""incident"".  
29On 7 February 2012 the complainant took steps to report that there had been an assault to Naval personnel and to a Dr Green.  She did not describe the incident to Dr Green in any detail, but was provided with some medication.  That afternoon the complainant made a report of the offences to Paddington Police.  She was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where she was seen and examined by Dr Pfeiffer.
30On 8 February 2012 the complainant made a statement to police and photographs were taken of her.  On 16 February 2012 the complainant made a second statement to police.  
31Evidence was given by other trainees who were at the beach when the events making up Count 3 occurred.  The evidence of Ms Gay was that while they were swimming, she noticed a lot of the time that the applicant was trying to wrap his arm around the complainant's waist and that the complainant would continuously swim away.  When they returned to the beach, she observed that the applicant sat next to the complainant. 
32Ms Gay said that she saw the applicant try to wrap his arms around the complainant's waist ""four to five times"" and that he did so while the complainant was facing away from him, with him swimming up behind her.  She said that she was less than one metre away and could ""clearly"" see the applicant grabbing the complainant around the waist.  She said that on other occasions she was a bit further away and was watching the complainant, not the applicant.
33Mr Palmer gave evidence that he saw the complainant and the applicant in the water ""mucking around"" and that they were together the whole time.  He said that the applicant would have his arms around the complainant and would throw her, pick her up and throw her.  He said that later the complainant told him that the applicant was ""feeling her up"" but that he did not see that.  She told him that the applicant was ""feeling her up"" when throwing her and ""stuff like that"".
34Mr Bugden gave evidence that he saw the applicant swimming with the complainant and that they were ""mucking about in the water"".  He said that the applicant was ""putting his arm around her waist"" and that he saw the applicant touch the complainant on the stomach ""one or two times"".  When the complainant returned to the beach, she told him that the applicant was ""hitting on her"".
35The applicant did not give evidence in the proceedings.
Submissions
36The applicant submitted that the jury's verdict in relation to Count 1 could only have been reached on the basis either that they did not accept the evidence of the complainant on the issue of consent or that they did not consider the conduct involved being indecent.  The applicant submitted that it must have been the former.  In relation to the acquittal on Count 2, the applicant submitted that the most likely explanation for this verdict was that the jury rejected the evidence of the complainant that she did not consent to sexual intercourse with him.  The applicant submitted that in relation to Count 2, the jury's verdict amounted to a rejection of the complainant's evidence that she was asleep and that she did not consent.  This was because on her evidence there was no possibility that she was simply mistaken about that fact.
37The applicant submitted that there was no significant difference between the Crown evidence in relation to Counts 1 and 2 and Count 3.  He submitted that each relied solely upon the complainant's uncorroborated evidence and involved assessments by the jury of her reliability and credit, having regard to the significant inconsistencies, disparities and contradictions contained in the various accounts she provided of the incidents of 5 February 2012.
38The applicant submitted that there was no rational basis upon which the jury could have rejected the complainant's evidence in relation to Counts 1 and 2 but be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in relation to Count 3.  He submitted that having had a reasonable doubt with respect to the complainant's evidence on Counts 1 and 2, there was no rational basis on which the jury could have accepted beyond reasonable doubt her evidence in relation to Count 3.
39The applicant relied upon the following observation by Spigelman CJ in Regina v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; 52 NSWLR 82 at [34] where his Honour said:
""34    In the common case of multiple sexual assaults against a single complainant, often over a period of time, juries frequently acquit on some charges and convict on others. The issue raised by Jones is to determine when an acquittal so affects the credibility of the complainant that, in combination with other factors, a conviction was not open to the jury. A court of criminal appeal must perform this task whilst acknowledging the role of the jury as emphasised in M v The Queen, MacKenzie and Jones quoted above.""
40The applicant submitted that based on the way in which the Crown case was argued, the credit of the complainant must have played a significant part in the jury's reasoning in relation to the two acquittals and should have resulted in a reasonable doubt in relation to Count 3.  He submitted that in the majority of sexual assault cases involving inconsistent verdicts, there was some rational explanation for the different verdicts.  He submitted that no such reason could be shown in this case and that the verdict of ""guilty"" in relation to Count 3 was unreasonable and should be set aside.
41The applicant submitted that the inconsistencies of the complainant in this case in the various statements made to police and the evidence given under oath, together with the surrounding circumstances of the alleged offending (including the lack of any corroborating evidence despite the physical proximity of other witnesses at the time of the alleged offending), lead to the inevitable conclusion that the guilty verdict on Count 3 was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the acquittals on Counts 1 and 2.
Consideration
42The principles to be applied in cases such as this have been stated on a number of occasions.  In MacKenzie v R [1996] HCA 35; 190 CLR 348 the plurality (Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) said at 366:
""3.  Where, as is ordinarily the case, the inconsistency arises in the jury verdicts upon different counts of the originating process in a criminal trial, the test is one of logic and reasonableness. A judgment of Devlin J in R v Stone is often cited as expressing the test:

""He must satisfy the court that the two verdicts cannot stand together, meaning thereby that no reasonable jury who had applied their mind properly to the facts in the case could have arrived at the conclusion, and once one assumes that they are an unreasonable jury, or they could not have reasonably come to the conclusion, then the convictions cannot stand.""

4.  Nevertheless, the respect for the function which the law assigns to juries (and the general satisfaction with their performance) have led courts to express repeatedly, in the context both of criminal and civil trials, reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense. Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted.  If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury.  In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge's instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Alternatively, the appellate court may conclude that the jury took a ""merciful"" view of the facts upon one count: a function which has always been open to, and often exercised by, juries.  The early history of New South Wales was affected by English juries which, in the face of clear evidence, declined to find the value of goods stolen sufficient to attract the punishment of death, thereby affording to the offender the alternative punishment of transportation. Australian decisions have acknowledged that the role of the jury continues to be ameliorative in this respect.  In R v Kirkman, in the Supreme Court of South Australia, King CJ (with the concurrence of Olsson and O'Loughlin JJ) observed:

""[J]uries cannot always be expected to act in accordance with strictly logical considerations and in accordance with the strict principles of the law which are explained to them, and courts, I think, must be very cautious about setting aside verdicts which are adequately supported by the evidence simply because a judge might find it difficult to reconcile them with the verdicts which had been reached by the jury with respect to other charges. Sometimes juries apply in favour of an accused what might be described as their innate sense of fairness and justice in place of the strict principles of law. Sometimes it appears to a jury that although a number of counts have been alleged against an accused person, and have been technically proved, justice is sufficiently met by convicting him of less than the full number. This may not be logically justifiable in the eyes of a judge, but I think it would be idle to close our eyes to the fact that it is part and parcel of the system of administration of justice by juries. Appellate courts therefore should not be too ready to jump to the conclusion that because a verdict of guilty cannot be reconciled as a matter of strict logic with a verdict of not guilty with respect to another count, the jury acted unreasonably in arriving at the verdict of guilty.""
We agree with these practical and sensible remarks.""
43In Markuleski Spigelman CJ (with whom Wood CJ at CL; Grove and Simpson JJ and Carruthers AJA agreed) said in the paragraphs before that relied upon by the applicant:
""31 Nothing in Jones casts any doubt on the appropriateness of a jury accepting a witness' evidence in one respect, whilst retaining a reasonable doubt about the commission of events about which that same witness is the only substantive witness. 

32    Indeed, in a case handed down by the High Court exactly one week after Jones (KBT v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 417) Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 424 emphasised the importance of the instruction traditionally given in this respect: 
""As the trial judge correctly instructed the jury in his summing up, it was open to the jury to accept some parts of M's evidence and to reject others."" 
33     The appropriateness of the direction traditionally given has also recently been confirmed by McHugh J in KRM v The Queen [2001] HCA 11; 75 ALJR 550 at 558 [36]; 178 ALR 385 at 395 [36] where his Honour said: 

""[36]  It has become the standard practice in cases where there are multiple counts, however, for the judge to direct the jury that they must consider each count separately and to consider it only by reference to the evidence that applies to it (a ""separate consideration warning""). The universal giving of a separate consideration warning and the omission of a universal propensity warning indicates that the giving of a separate consideration warning is ordinarily sufficient to avoid miscarriages of justice in cases such as the present. This indication is confirmed by the many cases where juries acquit accused persons of some charges and convict them of others where the presentment contains multiple counts involving the same or similar offences. Indeed, so freely do juries acquit of some charges and convict of others on presentments with multiple counts that appellate courts often hear arguments that there is such an inconsistency in the verdicts that the convictions are unsafe and must be set aside [60] cf Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439.""""
44In MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [34] Gleeson CJ Hayne and Callinan JJ said:
""34 Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury's decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasised in MacKenzie. They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, every juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence. In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution.  A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others.  Thirdly, there is the consideration stated by King CJ in R v Kirkman, and referred to in later cases: it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only. And there may be an interaction between this consideration and the two matters earlier discussed.""
45As the authorities cited make clear, the fact that an acquittal has been entered does not necessarily mean that the jury disbelieved the complainant.  It may simply mean that the jury was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to some element of the offence or, as was pointed out in MFA, the jury may be looking for some extrinsic element for corroboration.
46The decision of the jury in this case, however, was made easier because unlike Counts 1 and 2, which depended entirely upon the evidence of the complainant, there was extrinsic evidence from Crown witnesses which supported her evidence which formed the basis for Count 3.  
47There was evidence from Messrs Bugden, Palmer and Ms Gay that they saw the applicant on a number of occasions approach the complainant in circumstances where the events described by the complainant could have occurred.  Ms Gay was able to say that she saw the applicant place his hands around the complainant's waist on a number of occasions, as did Mr Bugden, who also saw the applicant touch the complainant on the stomach ""one or two times"".  Moreover, Messrs Palmer and Bugden gave evidence of complaint by the complainant shortly after she left the water.  This kind of corroboration was lacking in relation to Counts 1 and 2.
48That of itself is sufficient to distinguish Count 3 from Counts 1 and 2 and to provide a reasonable explanation for the jury's verdict.
49There are, however, other considerations which lead to the same result.  As the applicant accepted in relation to Count 1, the jury may well not have been satisfied that there was any element of indecency associated with an attempt on his part to kiss the complainant.  It is also not without significance that on the complainant's evidence, after she made it clear that she did not want the applicant to kiss her, he did not renew his attempts.  Such a circumstance gave ample room for the jury to have a reasonable doubt that the applicant had the requisite mens rea for an attempt to indecently assault the complainant so as to make out the elements for Count 1.
50In relation to Count 2, the jury could well have been left with a reasonable doubt as to whether the applicant knew, or was reckless as to the absence of consent, by the complainant - given that it was night in a darkened room.  There is no evidence of the complainant's reactions (if any) to the applicant's actions as he sought to initiate sexual intercourse.  In the course of doing so, the applicant removed the complainant's shorts and underwear (again without any evidence of any response, negative or otherwise, from the complainant).
51It can be accepted that on the Crown case there was available a sound argument that the applicant must have at least been reckless as to whether the complainant was asleep or otherwise not consenting.  That conclusion, however, required the jury to draw the necessary inculpatory  inferences and in the circumstances of a criminal trial those inferences were required to be the only rational inferences available on all the relevant evidence.  Without more evidence as to the behaviour of the applicant and the complainant at the time of the sexual intercourse, the jury could well have been left with a reasonable doubt as to the applicant's knowledge or recklessness concerning the absence of consent.
52By way of contrast, in Count 3 the complainant explicitly conveyed to the applicant that she was not consenting to him touching her by her immediate and continued efforts to push him away which culminated in her leaving the water to escape his unwanted advances and efforts to fondle her.
53In relation to Count 2, there was also a significant discrepancy which may well have led to the jury having a reasonable doubt as to whether the elements of the offence had been made out.  It was the complainant's evidence that she did not go to sleep after the sexual intercourse and that she was not wearing her shorts and underpants when the others awoke.  In contrast, Ms Gay and Messrs Watson and McPhee deposed that when they awoke in the morning, they observed the complainant asleep on the floor and that when she and the applicant woke up and that the complainant was wearing her clothes.
54There was, of course, no similar discrepancy in either Count 1 or Count 3.
55Applying the recognised test of ""logic and reasonableness"" the jury's verdicts in relation to Counts 1, 2 and 3 were well open to them.  This ground of appeal has not been made out.
56The orders which I propose are:
(1)Leave to appeal granted.
(2)The appeal is dismissed.
57ADAMS J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
58R A HULME J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2765470,Ninness v R [2014] NSWCCA 288,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Davies J.

2HIDDEN J: I agree with Davies J.

3DAVIES J: The Applicant pleaded guilty to three offences as follows:

1. Knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime being an amount of $258,985. The maximum penalty for this offence is 15 years imprisonment;

2. Supplying not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely 365.09g of methylamphetamine. The maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment and/or 3,500 penalty units. The offence carries a standard non-parole period of 10 years.

3. Supply a prohibited drug being 15.620kg of cannabis. The maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment and/or 2000 penalty units. 

4On 26 June 2013 the Applicant was sentenced by Judge Maiden SC to an aggregate sentence of a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months commencing 16 October 2012 and expiring 16 July 2019 with an additional term of 2 years and 3 months expiring 15 October 2021. His Honour identified the indicative sentences for each count as follows:

1. Knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime - 4 years imprisonment; 

2. Supply a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine - 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years; 

3. Supplying cannabis - 4 years.

5A Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on 28 June 2013 and extensions were obtained until 28 March 2014. The Notice of Appeal was not filed until 24 April 2014. Accordingly, the Applicant requires an extension of time to appeal. 

Facts

6The facts may be briefly stated.

7On 18 October 2011 police attended the Applicant's residence at Belmont North and executed a search warrant. During the search, police located $8,300 cash on a desk in a downstairs study room and an additional $10,000 in a black bag on the floor of the study. Within a black shopping bag under the study desk were six packages containing $50,000, $50,000, $50,020, $49,000, $29,450 and $10,000 respectively. Each package of cash was contained within vacuum sealed plastic. A further $1,315 was located in the offender's wallet. The total of the cash was $258,985. 

8The police also located three vacuum sealer machines and an amount of unused plastic for use in the machines. The plastic matched the plastic used to wrap the cash. 

9In the storage room underneath the internal staircase police located five packages of cannabis each weighing approximately 450g. A further three packages of cannabis were located each weighing approximately 4.5kg. These packages were made up of ten one pound packages. A ninth package of cannabis was located containing approximately 137g. 

10Those packages of cannabis had a total weight of 15.620kg being the indictable quantity of cannabis. 

11In other parts of the study police located various plastic resealable bags containing amounts of cocaine and methylamphetamine. The total amount of methylamphetamine was 365.09g, amounting to a commercial quantity.

12Police also located seven packages of white powder vacuum sealed in plastic totalling 13.539kg. This substance was tested and found to contain Dimethyl Sulphone otherwise known as Methylsulfonyl Methane. This substance is commonly used as a cutting agent in the manufacture of amphetamine based prohibited drugs. 

13The police also located on a wall shelf beside the study desk a .22 calibre single shot pistol loaded with a .22 calibre round. 

14They also located nine ampoules of testosterone. 

15The matters relating to the pistol, the steroids, the cutting agent and the cocaine were subsequently dealt with by Judge Maiden pursuant to s 166 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). His Honour dismissed some of the charges in relation to those matters and otherwise imposed sentences which were wholly concurrent with the sentences on the three principal counts. No appeal is brought in respect of those sentences. 

Grounds of appeal

16The Applicant has used different numbering of the grounds of appeal in his submissions from the numbering in the Notice of Appeal. The Crown has adopted the same approach. I shall therefore refer to the grounds in the manner they are described in the written submissions. 

1A. The sentencing judge erred in his finding that the Applicant did not have a mental condition that would fall within any of the ""Muldrock v R type situations that would give rise to the consideration of normal sentencing factors"" (RoS p.7). The sentencing judge also erred in his finding that the Applicant exaggerated his conditions in a way so as to attract the perceived difficulties he may have in custody in an attempt to attract the sympathy of the Court.

2. The sentencing judge erred by giving the standard non-parole period determinative significance in the sentence of the offence of supply not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine.

3. The sentencing judge erred by failing to properly assess the objective seriousness of the offence. 

4. The sentencing judge erred by considering the perceived harm caused by methylamphetamine as a relevant factor in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence.

5. The sentencing judge erred by failing to take into account the relevant objective factors of the quantity of the drugs in the context of the statutory regime and the purity of the drugs.

6. The sentencing judge erred by taking into account the applicant's conduct of the sentencing proceedings as a matter relevant to specific deterrence.

7. The sentencing judge erred by failing to take into account the mitigating factor under s. 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that the applicant does not have a prior record.

8. The aggregate sentence and the individual sentence for the offences of supply prohibited drugs were manifestly excessive. 

Subjective features

17The Applicant was born on 5 April 1979. The Sentencing Judge found that he appeared to have been raised in a decent family background. He was able to attend schools although with some difficulties. Those difficulties were effectively related to a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder [ADHD] when he was approximately 13 years of age by a psychiatrist, Dr Gordon Serfontein, now deceased. The Applicant was treated in his early years with a number of medications but Dexamphetamine proved the most useful for him. 

18For a number of years after leaving school the Applicant successfully ran a baking business initially in partnership but ultimately on his own account. 

19He apparently worked long hours in his business, sometimes working 18 hour days. This appears to have been a contributing factor to the breakdown of his marriage. He commenced using amphetamines and ultimately sold the business at the end of 2008. This left him financially independent without the need to work. The Sentencing Judge related that fact to the time when the Applicant became involved in the supply of drugs, chiefly methylamphetamine.

20The Applicant had a minimal criminal record. On 20 July 2009 he had two counts of possess prohibited drug and an attempt to possess a prescribed restricted substance dismissed under s 10, and on 19 October 2010 he was fined $1,740 and disqualified from driving for six months for exceeding the speed limit by more than 45km per hour. 

Extension of time

21The Crown in written submissions opposed the extension of time because there was no explanation for the delay and because the appeal was said to be without merit. The principles are dealt with partly in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37 at [13], [29], [32]-[33] and [44]-[45] and Golossian v R [2013] NSWCCA 311 at [22]-[31]. 

22An affidavit was then prepared by the solicitor for the Applicant purporting to explain the delay. The explanation in the affidavit is inadequate but the period of the delay was small and would ordinarily not stand in the way of an extension being granted. In those circumstances I would extend the time for the bringing of the appeal.

Grounds of appeal

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in his finding that the Applicant did not have a mental condition that would fall within any of the ""Muldrock v R type situations that would give rise to the consideration of normal sentencing factors"" (RoS p.7). The sentencing judge also erred in his finding that the Applicant exaggerated his conditions in a way so as to attract the perceived difficulties he may have in custody in an attempt to attract the sympathy of the Court.

23This ground was concerned with the Applicant's assertion that he suffered from ADHD and that the most effective treatment for this disorder, the use of the drug Dexamphetamine, was not available to him within the prison system. Whilst it was suggested in submissions initially made to the Sentencing Judge that this ought to result in a non-custodial sentence, the submissions before this Court were to the effect that the Applicant's custody would be more onerous for him by reason of his not being appropriately medicated. 

24In his Remarks on Sentence the Sentencing Judge relevantly said this:

In the original submissions of Mr Korn, Mr Korn submitted that the
offender's mental condition is a relevant matter to be considered, and it is. However, having considered the reports and having had the opportunity of seeing the offender on two occasions give evidence, I am of the view that he does not have a mental condition that would fall within any of the Muldrock v R type situations that would give rise to the consideration of the normal sentencing factors. Indeed, in my submission, and based upon the report of Dr Chen (scil. Dr Chew), I am of the view that the offender, has exaggerated his conditions in a way so as to advance the perceived difficulties he may have in custody in an attempt to attract the sympathy of the Court. What is clear from his time in custody is that three consultant psychiatrists who have seen him in situ have not diagnosed ADHD. In respect of the other psychiatrists, their opinions have been largely based upon a history given by this offender. ...

Submissions were also made which involved the diagnosis under the Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, DSM-4, fourth edition, as submitted, and in my mind there is no mental condition or what might be described as mental disorder that avails itself to this offender to seek any ameliorating circumstance in respect of his offending. 

It is my view that in respect of the subject matters that the offender cannot have any benefit for his time in custody because of what he has stated as his ADHD or condition.

25The Applicant submitted that the evidence did not enable the Sentencing Judge to come rationally to the view that the Applicant did not have ADHD and/or that the Applicant did not require medication, in particular, Dexamphetamine medication. The Applicant further submitted that it was not open to the Sentencing Judge to find that the Applicant did not have a mental condition that would fall within any of the Muldrock v R type situations (as so described). 

26The Applicant was critical of the Sentencing Judge's acceptance of Dr Chew and submitted that the Sentencing Judge had no proper basis to disregard the clear and informed opinions of Dr Hampshire, Dr Pickering and Dr Kneebone.

27The Applicant submitted that because the Sentencing Judge accepted Dr Chew's evidence that had significant flow-on effects including a finding that the Applicant exaggerated his conditions, and a rejection by his Honour of Dr Hampshire's evidence that Dexamphetamine was not available within the prison system. 

28Finally, the Applicant submitted that it was not open to the Sentencing Judge to conclude that the Applicant had exaggerated his conditions in a way so as to advance perceived difficulties he might have in custody in an attempt to attract the sympathy of the Court. 

29The evidence that the Sentencing Judge had before him on this issue consisted of the following:

(a) The oral evidence on two separate occasions of the Applicant;

(b) The oral evidence of the Applicant's mother;

(c) The oral evidence of Roslyn Pavey, the nurse manager of the Hunter Cluster for Justice Health;

(d) A report of Dr Gerald Chew, a consultant psychiatrist for Justice Health, dated 16 May 2013 and his oral evidence; 

(e) A report from Dr John Pickering, a psychiatrist, dated 15 October 2012; 

(f) A report from Dr Robert Hampshire, a psychiatrist, dated 4 December 2012;

(g) A letter from Gary Forrest, Executive Director Clinical Operations (Custodial Health) dated 14 January 2013; and

(h) A letter from Paul Grimmond, Service Director Operations & Nursing at Justice Health.

30Both the evidence of the Applicant and his mother was to the effect that the Applicant had suffered from and been diagnosed with ADHD since he was a relatively young child, and that he had been treated by Dr Gordon Serfontein, subsequently by a psychiatrist Dr Miller, and thereafter by Dr Hampshire since the Applicant's arrest. 

31The evidence in the reports of Dr Pickering and Dr Hampshire was that there was clear evidence of the Applicant suffering from ADHD both as a child and in his adult life. Both of those doctors supported the Applicant's evidence that the only medication that assisted that condition was Dexamphetamine. 

32In his report Dr Chew diagnosed the Applicant as suffering from an adjustment disorder with depressed mood. He said that the disorder was predominantly in remission because he was being treated with Zoloft. 

33Dr Chew said that the Applicant had a fairly clear diagnosis of childhood/adolescent ADHD. He added this:
It should be noted that the while (sic) the diagnosis of Juvenile ADHD is very well established and accepted, there is some controversy around the diagnosis of Adult ADHD. Most psychiatrists now agree that there is a proportion of patients who would meet the criteria for Adult ADHD but however this is certainly smaller than the proportion that could be diagnosed with a Juvenile ADHD. ... On presentation today Mr Ninness did not present objectively with any gross signs of ADHD. ... I also note that the two other psychiatrists have seen him in custody, Dr Bench and Dr Herps had not specifically recommended Dexamphetamine or other stimulant treatment for his ADHD. 

34Dr Chew also referred to the difficulties of prescribing stimulants in custody because they were regarded like currency by inmates, and standover tactics were employed that posed a safety risk to the patient. He also noted that the treatment of ADHD was not solely based around medications. He said there were well accepted psychosocial principles including a highly structured environment with regular routines to help manage ADHD symptoms. 

35Dr Chew said that he did not believe Dexamphetamine treatment was currently indicated. He thought that the symptoms reported by the Applicant since stopping Dexamphetamine were more consistent with a long term mild withdrawal-type syndrome which is seen clinically post withdrawal of long term amphetamine use. He did not believe his functioning would be significantly impaired without Dexamphetamine in custody. 

36Dr Chew's oral evidence was to similar effect. He accepted that the Applicant may still have Adult ADHD but he thought it was unlikely. He did not doubt that Dr Pickering, Dr Hampshire and Dr Kneebone (a third psychiatrist referred to in Dr Hampshire's report) had formed the opinion that the Applicant did suffer from lifelong ADHD and he accepted that if those Doctors had been regularly seeing the Applicant for 12 months whilst he was in the community on bail their opportunity to make a fuller diagnosis might be better than Dr Chew's. It should be noted, however, that the evidence strongly suggested that Dr Pickering had only seen the Applicant on one occasion and it was unclear from Dr Hampshire's report how often or over what period of time Dr Kneebone had seen the Applicant. 

37The evidence from Ms Pavey concerning the policy of Corrective Services in relation to the provision of Dexamphetamine was that a patient had to be seen by two psychiatrists who formed the view that Dexamphetamine should be prescribed. If they found that it was clinically appropriate it would be prescribed. At the time Ms Pavey gave her evidence the Applicant had been seen only by Dr Chris Bench. Dr Bench had diagnosed the Applicant with depression and poly-substance dependence. He did not indicate that Dexamphetamine was indicated. It was anticipated that the Applicant would be seen by a second psychiatrist, perhaps Dr Chew. 

38In cross-examination, Ms Pavey also identified as a policy consideration for the provision of Dexamphetamine the case of a prisoner coming into custody in respect of drug charges who had a history of illicit drug use. She said that questions about that matter would need to be asked of Dr Chew. The issue was not taken up with Dr Chew.

39Ms Pavey's evidence was generally consistent with the letter from Gary Forrest, Executive Director Clinical Operations (Custodial Health) dated 14 January 2013. His letter said this:

Generally there is a specific authorisation required to commence stimulant medication for ADHD and this applies both in the community and in custody. If a person enters custody and is already subject to specific authorisation for ADHD medication by the community prescriber, JH & FMHN will continue this treatment.

In circumstances where there is no current specific authorisation for such medication and a person comes into custody, JH & FMHN will commence such medication if it is deemed to be clinically appropriate. 

40To similar effect was a letter from Paul Grimmond, Service Director Operations and Nursing for Justice Health. His letter of 30 January 2013 noted, however, that JH&MHN required confirmation from the prescribing psychiatrist, Dr Miller, of all the medications that the Applicant was currently prescribed. It was not clear if that confirmation was provided. There was evidence, however, that Dr Miller had been uncooperative in providing material requested by the Applicant's lawyers for the sentencing hearing. Significantly, Dr Miller was not called to give evidence. 

Consideration

41There is no evidence in the present case, even accepting that the Applicant has suffered and continues to suffer from lifelong ADHD, that this condition had anything to do with his offending so that sentencing factors such as specific and general deterrence and retribution would not be relevant in the way discussed in R v Muldrock [2012] NSWCCA 108. The relevance of ascertaining if the Applicant suffered from ADHD at the time of sentence and at the present time concerned whether, if he did, he could access Dexamphetamine in custody. 

42There were three considerations associated with this matter. The first was whether or not the Applicant suffered from ADHD as an adult and continued to do so at the time of the sentencing hearing. The second consideration was, if he did suffer from ADHD, what impact that condition had on him in custody. The third consideration was whether it could be said that in no circumstances would Dexamphetamine be provided for the Applicant or any other person suffering from ADHD in custody. 

43As far as the first consideration is concerned, it was a question of fact whether the Applicant suffered from ADHD. The Sentencing Judge had available to him considerable evidence about the matter but, significantly, no evidence from Dr Miller who had been the Applicant's long term treating psychiatrist. In this regard, the Applicant complained that the Sentencing Judge said that he was not prepared to hear from Dr Miller. 

44It is necessary to set out the whole of the exchange between the Sentencing Judge and the Applicant's counsel which occurred on 15 February 2013. At this stage of the sentencing proceedings, evidence had been given by the Applicant (for the first time) and his mother. The reports from Dr Hampshire and Dr Pickering, and the letters from Gary Forrest and Paul Grimmond had been tendered. Neither Ms Pavey nor Dr Chew had given evidence. 

45The Applicant's counsel informed his Honour that the Applicant had been visited by Dr Christopher Bench, a psychiatrist who told the Applicant that he could not prescribe Dexamphetamine. The transcript then discloses the following:

... those are precisely what he was told, so our understanding your Honour is that despite what is being said at the top, it is not in fact happening. I know your Honour, we all want to finalise the matter. But my position your Honour is that we are -practically speaking as a result of what has happened, we are practically giving the Corrective Services every opportunity to show that this man will be properly medicated. That's not happening. If it finally becomes clear that in fact it isn't going to happen, then I am going to ask your Honour whether your Honour will allow me to re-open the sentence proceedings and address you on the fact that it doesn't appear that he will be medicated and either ask your Honour to find exceptional circumstances, with a view to either non-custody or what would otherwise be an absurdly low amount of custody.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Korn, I don't want to waste your client's time and perhaps his parents' money, thinking that he will not be serving a lengthy custodial sentence. This is not a matter for exceptional circumstances. I have looked at the psychiatric reports and I am concerned about the lack of history given in them. The treating doctor here in Newcastle, I have no evidence from. None. And I have a history that initially from not Dr Pickering, Dr Hampshire, that was wrong. Frankly, it's not going to alter what I do as I see it as being a matter which will change the outcome, as I sit her. If I'm wrong about that well someone will correct me.

KORN: Your Honour asked me the position, I've indicated, your Honour's responded, so I'm in your Honour's hands. The simple reality is, can I just say this your Honour, the simple reality is that gaol is never intended to be pleasant, but for this man in his circumstances, every day is-

HIS HONOUR: Mr Korn I have to make a finding to his credit whether I accept what he has said on oath and frankly, at the moment without, as I've said, what would have been the best evidence, which is his treating doctor in Newcastle here, I haven't got the best evidence because all the other opinions are based upon information given by him. Simple as that.

KORN: Would your Honour allow me the-

HIS HONOUR: Beg your pardon?

KORN: Would your Honour allow me, in those circumstances, to in fact seek to call Dr Miller?

HIS HONOUR: Look this man had his chance.

KORN: I'm just asking your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: You have had more than enough chances. In terms of the preparation, I've never seen a case where so much time has been prepared on matters that ultimately weren't there. Where Dr Miller was available. He was available at that time. In terms of reopening, why wasn't he called then? He was available before, he's available now. I'm not - I'll hear form the crown but my preliminary view is that I'm not prepared to hear from him. From him or anyone else, frankly.

KORN: As I say I'm in your Honour's hands.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown do you wish to say anything at this stage?

WATSFORD: Your Honour I'm of the same view as yourself. The matter has some age to it and there's been plenty of opportunity to address these issues along the way and really the boat's left your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And indeed the evidence that Dr Miller was approached before Dr Hampshire went and saw the prisoner in Kempsey it's all been there so I'm going to put it in for judgment. I don't have any days that are clear at the moment until 4 or 5 April.

KORN: Until?

HIS HONOUR: 4 or 5 April. I'll make it 5 April. I'll stand the matter over for sentence to 5 April. Court will adjourn, thank you. Sorry, and bail is formally refused. (emphasis added)

46Two things can be said about that exchange. The first is that the Sentencing Judge expressed a preliminary view only. It was always open to counsel for the defence to have pressed the matter. Secondly, and far more significantly, although the matter was stood over to 5 April for sentence, Mr Korn sought, and was given, leave to call the Applicant for a second time to give evidence about the fact that he had not been able to access Dexamphetamine whilst in custody. 

47The result of that evidence and submissions that followed was that the matter was again adjourned in an endeavour to get notes from Justice Health and Dr Bench. 

48The matter was then mentioned again on 11 April 2013 when the Crown indicated that they might issue a subpoena for someone from Justice Health to attend. It was then mentioned again on 2 and 6 May 2013. On 15 May 2013 the hearing resumed with evidence taken from Ms Pavey. Ms Pavey's evidence was that the second psychiatrist was to examine the Applicant. That led to the sentence hearing again being adjourned so that a report from that doctor could be made available. The matter was then mentioned on 30 and 31 May 2013 and came back before the Sentencing Judge on 17 June 2013 when Dr Chew's evidence was taken and submissions were completed. 

49No attempt was made by the Defendant in all of that time to obtain evidence from Dr Miller whether documentary or in person. The Sentencing Judge's preliminary view expressed on 15 February 2013 was clearly one of frustration due to the delays in the case (the matter had already been before him on 14 December 2012, 30 January 2013, 31 January 2013, 1 February and 8 February). It is clear that his Honour expected to sentence the Applicant on 5 April. The Sentencing Judge did not adhere to his preliminary view that no-one else could be called because further evidence was taken from the Applicant as well as evidence from Ms Pavey and Dr Chew.

50Any complaint that the Sentencing Judge acted unfairly in relation to Dr Miller is rejected. 

51The Sentencing Judge had the considerable advantage of hearing from Dr Chew and receiving his detailed report. A reading of Dr Chew's evidence showed that he was prepared to make appropriate concessions and, particularly, to accept that other professionals might have a different view from him about the existence and/or prevalence of Adult ADHD. 

52There was no challenge to Dr Chew's evidence about Dr Bench's and Dr Herps' assessment of the Applicant and their view that he did not need Dexamphetamine. 

53The evidence of Dr Chew was open to be accepted by the Sentencing Judge in contradiction of the Applicant's own evidence about the difficulties that he had in motivation and focussing when in custody. 

54This was not a case where there was no evidence capable of supporting the Sentencing Judge's conclusion that Dr Chew's evidence was to be accepted despite evidence to the contrary from Dr Pickering, Dr Hampshire and the Applicant. The Applicant's mother's evidence was fairly peripheral to the issue of the condition of the Applicant when in custody.

55Nor did the Applicant advance his own credibility by his assertion, noted by the Sentencing Judge, that Dr Chew only saw him for five minutes. Quite apart from Dr Chew's evidence to the contrary, a fair reading of his report would inevitably lead to the conclusion that the Applicant's evidence in that regard was unreliable.

56A factor influencing the judge's decision was Dr Hampshire's unqualified statement that Justice Health did not prescribe psycho-stimulants to inmates as a matter of policy and that his psychiatric illness would go untreated in custody. Dr Hampshire provided no basis for that conclusion which is likely to have been outside his expertise in any event. The statement was contrary to the evidence of Ms Pavey, Mr Forrest and Mr Grimmond.

57The complaint involved in this ground of appeal is a complaint about the fact-finding of the Sentencing Judge. In McBeth v R [2009] NSWCCA 235 McCallum J (McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J agreeing) said at [30]:

Many of the applicant's grounds concern the sentencing Judge's findings of fact. It must be recalled, however, that the task of this court is confined to determining whether there was error in the sentencing of the applicant on the principles stated in House v R [1936] HCA 40 ; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. This court's power to substitute its own findings of fact for those of the trial judge arises only if the Judge ""mistakes the facts"" in the sense there understood. It is necessary to establish that there is no evidence to support the finding, or that the evidence is ""all one way"", or that the Judge has misdirected himself: R v O'Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397 at 401 per Hunt J, Carruthers and Wood JJ agreeing.

58There is no occasion for this Court to substitute its own findings of fact in this case where there was evidence led upon which the judge based his findings.

59I would reject this ground of appeal.

Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred by giving the standard non-parole period determinative significance in the sentence of the offence of supply not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine

60In his Remarks on Sentence his Honour made the following references to the standard non-parole period (SNPP). First, when referring to each of the offences charged and the maximum penalties he noted that the supply of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine had a SNPP of ten years. His Honour added this:

It will be seen from the three matters to which the offender has pleaded guilty that the second matter, that is the supply of methamphetamine, carries the most serious sanction, and it has a standard non-parole period of ten years. I will refer to this matter later.

61His Honour next mentioned the SNPP when dealing with general deterrence as follows:

Secondly, in respect of the question of general deterrence, in respect of the second matter of the supply of methamphetamine, Parliament has prescribed that this particular matter have a standard non-parole period of ten years. That particular matter requires the Court to consider what is an appropriate sentence, and I do take that into account in the orders that I am about to make.

62Finally, when his Honour was dealing with the indicative sentences he said this:

In respect of the second offence, that is the methamphetamine supply, and taking into account that Parliament has prescribed the ten year standard non-parole period, that would be a sentence which would have imposed an eight year term with a non-parole period of six years.

63The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge made no reference to the SNPP as a legislative guidepost. Rather, he gave it determinative significance in assessing general deterrence and in considering the appropriate sentence. 

64Nothing in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 requires a sentencing judge to refer to the SNPP as a legislative guidepost. Nor can it be inferred from any omission to mention the SNPP as a legislative guidepost that determinative significance has been given to it. His Honour was, however, required to have regard to the SNPP as well as the maximum penalty. The Remarks that he made, and which are quoted above, do no more than make appropriate reference to the SNPP as a consideration. Nothing in the Remarks suggest his Honour applied a two stage process: Muldrock at [28]. 

65The Applicant submitted further that his Honour's approach to the indicative sentences indicates that the SNPP played a determinative role in the sentencing process. The Applicant submitted that if the Sentencing Judge correctly complied with s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the notional starting point for the commercial supply offence would have been 10 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 8 years. That, it was submitted, shows that the SNPP was given determinative significance. 

66The Applicant's submission is misconceived. It seems to start from, and finish at, the premise that if the indicative non-parole period is similar to the SNPP then determinative significance must have been given to the SNPP. In the light of the Sentencing Judge's assessment that the matter was most serious (see [69] below) and where the quantity of the drug exceeded the minimum weight for a commercial quantity by a not insignificant amount, it cannot be said that the indicative sentence was unduly influenced by the SNPP.

67I would reject this ground of appeal.

Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred by failing to properly assess the objective seriousness of the offence

Ground 4: The sentencing judge erred by considering the perceived harm caused by methylamphetamine as a relevant factor in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence

Ground 5: The sentencing judge erred by failing to take into account the relevant objective factors of the quantity of the drugs in the context of the statutory regime and the purity of the drugs.

68It is convenient to deal with these grounds together. 

69In the course of his Remarks on Sentence his Honour said this:

In respect of the objective seriousness of this matter, it must be considered one, the weight of the drugs, 360 grams approximately of methamphetamine, 15 and a half kilos of cannabis and $260,000 in cash, most of it packaged, ready not for banking certainly in a deposit book, as his mother may have done for him in his baking business, but for secreting. In that regard these matters are most serious, and the Court of Criminal Appeal is clear as to what is to occur to persons who deal in drugs in our community in this way. As is well known in the Hunter area, serious crimes are committed by persons on methamphetamine and, to a lesser extent, in this Court's experience, amphetamine, and if persons are going to hold, deal or use such quantities as 360 grams, they should understand clearly the terror and destruction that can cause not only to the users but also to members of the community, who feel the consequences of the persons who use this material in criminal enterprises. (emphasis added)

70The Applicant submits that those Remarks fail to make any proper assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. In particular, the collective reference to ""the matters are most serious"" provides no insight as to how the Sentencing Judge assessed the commercial supply matter. It was submitted that what was said in this passage, particularly the reference to the Court of Criminal Appeal, indicates that the statement was not an articulation of the objective seriousness of the offences. 

71In Delaney v R; R v Delaney [2013] NSWCCA 150 Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Harrison and Beech-Jones JJ agreed) said at [56]:

[56] While it is true that his Honour did not in terms assess the objective gravity of the offending, he did specifically refer to the factors which bore upon its objective seriousness. His Honour took account of the amount involved, the role of the appellant, the nature of the conduct and the period over which it took place. While it may have been preferable for his Honour to have made a specific assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending, he did implicitly do so. I am satisfied that the factors to which his Honour referred were relevant and important and were given proper weight in the sentencing process. While his Honour may not have expressly determined the objective criminality of the offences, he clearly took that into account. 

72In Simpson v R [2014] NSWCCA 23 the sentencing judge was dealing with a count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a count of sexual intercourse without consent. The judge said this in his remarks on sentence:

Having regard to the degree of violence, the physical hurt inflicted, the form of forced intercourse and the circumstances of humiliation I am more than satisfied that these are objectively very serious offences.

That was the extent of the judge's remarks concerning the objective seriousness of the offences.

73The applicant in that case submitted that the sentencing judge erred in not making a more precise assessment of where in the range of objective seriousness the offence lay. Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Adams and R A Hulme JJ agreed) said at [27]:

His Honour did all that was required of him by assessing both offences as being ""objectively very serious offences"".

74It seems clear to me in the present case that his Honour was assessing the objective seriousness of the offending when he said ""these matters are most serious"". He introduced that section of his Remarks with the words ""in respect of the objective seriousness of this matter"". He then went on to consider matters which could only be described as the objective offending. 

75Whilst it would have been clearer if his Honour had considered the three offences separately in assessing objective seriousness, I do not consider that his Honour fell into error in approaching the matter in the way he did. 

76The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge failed to consider the relevance of the quantity and purity of the drugs particularly because his Honour did not relate the quantities to the categories in Schedule 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). However, weight and purity of drugs are not the only consideration in fixing a sentence for supply or importing: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [67] - [69]; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [33]. His Honour had limited evidence of the purity of what was seized and that varied between 12% and 52.5%.

77As noted earlier, the amount of the methylamphetamine was not insignificantly greater than the commercial quantity threshold, and the amount of cannabis was, as the Applicant acknowledged, above the midrange for an indictable quantity. His Honour's reference to the weight of each drug demonstrates that he did not overlook the quantity of the drug in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending in each case.

78The Applicant further submitted that the Sentencing Judge's reference to the perceived harm of the supply of the drug methylamphetamine introduced into the assessment of objective seriousness a matter which was already inherent in the objective seriousness of the crime. Reference was made to the statement of Howie J in R v Dang [2005] NSWCCA 430 where his Honour said at [29]:

This Court no longer approaches the evaluation of the seriousness of a particular supply offence by distinguishing between different types of drugs according to the perceived dangerousness of the drug being supplied. Rather the Court has stressed that the appropriate consideration is the relevant statutory regime and the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence. 

79I do not read his Honour's statement about the harm caused by methylamphetamine and amphetamine as forming part of his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. The submission that his Honour fell into error by comparing the relative danger of different drugs should be rejected. To criticise his Honour for the inclusion in passing of the phrase ""and, to a lesser extent"" in the passage set out in [69] above is to engage in an unhelpful armchair analysis of remarks, no doubt delivered in the course of a busy list, with a view to finding error.

80I do not consider that error has been demonstrated in this regard.

81I would reject these grounds of appeal.

Ground 6: The sentencing judge erred by taking into account the applicant's conduct of the sentencing proceedings as a matter relevant to specific deterrence

82In his Remarks on Sentence the Sentencing Judge said this:

The second matter is this, in respect of this offender there is a need for specific deterrence, that is a person who has used his skills and abilities to deflect his attention and his criminality must be warned that if he wishes to rely upon the sympathy of courts, then the Court upon finding that the basis of that sympathy is non-existent that he should be warned that it will not be tolerated.

83The Applicant submitted that it was an error to take into account the manner in which the Applicant conducted himself at the sentence proceedings. Reference was made to what Johnson J said in R v Wilkinson (No 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [62] where he cautioned against post-offence conduct being taken into account in the assessment of objective seriousness of the crimes themselves. The Applicant accepted that the Applicant's conduct at the sentence might be relevant to a lack of remorse and prospects of rehabilitation but submitted that the Sentencing Judge took into account his conduct as a punitive factor relevant to specific deterrence.

84The Sentencing Judge appears to have been referring to his earlier expressed view in the Remarks:

that the offender has exaggerated his conditions in a way so as to advance the perceived difficulties he may have in custody in an attempt to attract the sympathy of the Court. 

85The Remarks might also be thought to relate to the question of remorse or its absence, although that was dealt with in the following paragraph by the Sentencing Judge who described it as ""the next matter"". What, however, does seem clear is that the Remarks complained of were not being used in the consideration of the objective seriousness of the offending.

86His Honour was, in any event, quite correct to say that for the present Applicant specific deterrence was an important consideration. I do not read his Honour's Remarks as suggesting the Applicant's conduct during the sentencing proceedings was taken into account as a punitive factor relevant to specific deterrence.

87I would reject this ground of appeal.

Ground 7: The sentencing judge erred by failing to take into account the mitigating factor under s 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that the applicant does not have a prior record

88The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge made no express reference to aggravating or mitigating factors under s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and, in particular, that the Applicant had no prior criminal history. The Applicant submitted that he was thus entitled to be treated more leniently and that the failure to make reference to his lack of criminal history was a significant error.

89Whilst it is true that the Sentencing Judge made no mention of the Applicant's criminal record, in fact the Applicant had received two s 10 dismissals in 2009 for two counts of possessing a prohibited drug and attempting to possess a prescribed restricted substance. In addition, he was fined $1,740 for exceeding the speed limit by greater than 45 km per hour in September 2010. Whilst this was by no means a significant criminal history, three of the offences involved drugs or prescribed prohibited substances, a matter of some relevance to a number of the present offences.

90This Court has said more than once that prior good character and lack of a criminal record are of reduced significance in drug offences: Redfern v R [2012] NSWCCA 178 at [23]; R v Cheikh [2004] NSWCCA 448 at [50]; R v Leroy (1984) 13 A Crim R 469 and R v Nemes (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 28 August 1997, unrep).
91Although his Honour did not mention s 21A or the factors listed by reference to the section, his Remarks show that he did not overlook relevant factors such as the Applicant's plea of guilty, his prospects of rehabilitation and the matter of remorse.

92I do not consider that this ground has been made out.

Ground 8: The aggregate sentence and the individual sentence for the offences of supply prohibited drugs were manifestly excessive

93The Applicant submitted that the indicative sentence for the offence of commercial supply dominated the sentencing exercise and resulted in a sentence that exceeded the criminality of the individual offences and the totality of the criminality. The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge should have found that the objective seriousness of the offence fell at the lower end of the range. The Applicant further submitted that whilst it was open to the Sentencing Judge to reject the Applicant's evidence as to the role he played, there was limited evidence as to the role to justify a sentence of the order imposed.

94The Applicant pointed to the fact that the Remarks on Sentence made no reference to comparative cases or statistics.

95The Applicant pointed to the following factors that should have resulted in a lesser sentence:

(a) He was 32 at the time of sentence;

(b) The quantity of the prohibited drug (365.09g) was at the lower end of the commercial range;

(c) The purity of the drug was relatively low with most of it being approximately 12%);

(d) The sentencing judge found that his role was 'packaging and distributing drugs';

(e) The sentencing judge did not make a finding of any aggravating factors prescribed in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act; 

(f) He had no prior convictions;

(g) He had undertaken rehabilitation whilst on bail to overcome his amphetamine addiction; and 

(h) He pleaded guilty in the Local Court.

96The Applicant pointed to three cases in particular which it was said provided assistance in showing that the sentence in the present case is manifestly excessive. 

97In R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78 the Appellant was convicted of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The weight of the drug was 371.3g. The purity of the drug in three separate containers was 14.5%, 14% and 6% which was described by Grove J as being of extremely low purity. He had been sentenced to a non-parole period of 10 years with a total term of 13 years and 4 months. There was no discount for any plea or assistance. The sentence was reduced on appeal to a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months with a total term of 7 years. The appellant claimed that the drugs were not his and that he was simply asked to collect a parcel and keep it at his house until it was collected. He claimed not to know what the substance was but suspected it may have been heroin. 

98This Court said that the evidence was such that he could not be shown to be the owner of drugs and he had to be sentenced on the basis that he was not a principal in any transaction or intended transaction but only as a courier or storeman. 

99In Cao v R [2013] NSWCCA 321 the Applicant was charged with supplying methylamphetamine on an ongoing basis, supplying not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine and four firearms offences. In addition, there was, on a Form 1, a charge of possession of ammunition without authority and two charges of having goods in custody reasonably suspected of having been stolen. The total effective sentence was 8 years 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months. The notional starting point was 11 years and 4 months from which a deduction of 25% was made for the early plea. The amount of methylamphetamine was 749.6g with a purity of 79%. The Applicant's prior criminal record was regarded as relatively insignificant. The offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of the drug was regarded by the Sentencing Judge as above midrange. The Court held that the sentence could not be said to be manifestly excessive. 

100In Jeffrey v R [2012] NSWCCA 36 the Applicant pleaded guilty to knowingly taking part in the supply of not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine and to a charge of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime. On the first count of supply he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years with a balance of term of 3 years. On the second count he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months with a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months. The total effective sentence was a non-parole period of 5 years with a balance of term of 3 years.

101The amount of the drug was 513.9 grams of liquid methylamphetamine. The proceeds of crime was $46,700 in cash. The Applicant had a criminal history that did not entitle him to any leniency. He had served a sentence of 2 years imprisonment for some of those offences. At the time of the subject offences he was on a s 9 bond for driving whilst disqualified. This Court rejected the submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive.

102A review of those and other cases confirm the view I hold that the sentence imposed in the present case was within the range of appropriate sentences, albeit in the upper part of that range. It cannot be said, however, that the sentence is ""unreasonably or plainly unjust"": Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [6]. 

103A number of factors justify the sentence imposed. First, unlike in Blair, the Applicant in the present case cannot be regarded as a mere courier or storeman, and the Sentencing Judge did not so regard him. Secondly, as the photographs show, the Applicant was involved in a significant drugs supply enterprise. The amounts of money located, the vacuum sealer machines, the cutting agent, the variety of drugs and prohibited substances, and the way the drugs were packed all attest to the extent of the Applicant's involvement.

104Thirdly, the fact that a firearm was found is a significant matter aggravating the criminality. In Cao Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Simpson and Hall JJ agreed) said:

[35] This Court has said on a number of occasions that an offender's criminality is more serious where he or she possesses a firearm as part of their involvement in crimes, such as trading in illegal drugs. In R v Amurao [2005] NSWCCA 32 at [69] RS Hulme J said:

[69] ... It behoves the Courts to discourage any tendency for such objects to become just tools of trade for those whose activities are outside the law.""

This is particularly so in relation to the possession of a concealed weapon such as the key-ring pistol which was not capable of lawful use.

105Fourthly, there were two different kinds of drugs involved. Possession of two different types of drugs cannot be regarded as one episode of criminality. In Luu v R [2008] NSWCCA 285 a joint judgment of this Court (Giles JA, Latham J and Matthews AJ) said:

[32] Possession of the two different kinds of drugs giving rise to the ""deemed supply"" offences is not properly regarded as one episode of criminality. There were two deemed supplies, as there would be two (or more) actual supplies were the different drugs to be sold to two (or more) purchasers in the course of the applicant's drug dealing. Nor is the criminality in the possession of the pistols, and two pistols one of which was a prohibited pistol involves greater criminality than one, to any substantial degree reflected in the sentences for the drug offences. The drug dealing could be carried on without firearms; that the applicant had them in his possession in connection with his drug dealing was significant additional criminality, and there was no double counting. The Firearms Act gives effect to the significant legislative policy of strict control upon the possession of firearms, and offences against it inimical to that policy called for substantial recognition in their own right: see R v Cromarty [2004] NSWCCA 54; R v Tolley [2004] NSWCCA 165.

106Finally, the indicative sentences show that the supply of cannabis offence and the proceeds of crime offence were effectively only accumulated by 9 months non-parole with a 1 year additional term on the supply methamphetamine charge. The penalties for the s 166 offences were also made entirely concurrent with sentence for the three offences the subject of the appeal.

107Most of the matters to which the Applicant pointed to as justifying a lower sentence (in [95] above) have been discussed elsewhere in this judgment. None of those matters, individually or collectively, justifies a lesser sentence.

Conclusion

108I propose the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.

2765482,GAR - Application for an inquiry into conviction pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 1734,"DECISION
Introduction
1By application dated 2 March 2014, the applicant sought, pursuant to Division 3 of Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), a further inquiry into his conviction in 2002 for the offence of sexual intercourse without consent.  The applicant was sentenced in respect of that offence to imprisonment for a term of six years commencing on 5 April 2002 and expiring on 4 April 2008, with a non-parole period of four years and six months.
2The applicant's appeal against his conviction was dismissed and leave was refused to appeal against his sentence: GAR v R [2003] NSWCCA 224 (the Original Appeal). In February 2009, Barr J referred the case pursuant to s 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act. The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the appeal: GAR v R (No. 1) [2010] NSWCCA 163 (the Review Appeal).
3The applicant seeks a further order under s 79(1)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act that an inquiry be held, or in the alternative, an order under s 79(1)(b) that the matters be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The Court's discretion to make an under s 79(1) arises only ""if it appears that there is doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case"". In Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 252 Johnson J summarised the relevant authorities and referred at [8] to the need for there to be ""available material which, as a matter of practical reality, gives rise to a relevant sense of unease or disquiet"".
4The present application was based on the following two pieces of evidence:(1)An affidavit of RM sworn on 15 July 2012 in which RM deposed that when he spoke to ER on the morning of 14 January 2002, she did not say anything to him about the applicant sexually assaulting her; and(2)A page from a medical report of Dr Sterrett, who had examined ER on 14 January 2002.
5The applicant contended that the effect of (1) was that there is no evidence of consistency of complaint.  He submitted that the effect of (2), which his representatives previously overlooked, was to indicate that the medical evidence did not corroborate the entirety of ER's evidence, and in particular her evidence that the applicant scratched her face.
6In order to assess the relative importance of these items it is necessary to consider the factual background, what occurred at the trial and subsequently.
Factual background
The trial
7The applicant was charged on indictment as follows:
1.That he on 13 January 2002 at Doonside did without consent detain ER with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely to keep the said ER in his custody and under his control.
2.Further that he on or about 14 January 2002 at Doonside did have sexual intercourse with ER without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting.
8On 21 October 2002, the trial commenced in the District Court before Judge Naughton and a jury.  On 1 November 2002, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the first count and guilty on the second count.
9I am indebted to the summary of the trial contained in the reason for decision of Miles AJ, who, together with Spigelman CJ and Bell J, constituted the Court of Criminal Appeal in the Original Appeal.
The Crown case at trial
10The complainant, ER, and the applicant were divorced shortly before 13 January 2002, after having been married for approximately 20 years.  They had a son and a daughter, E, who, in January 2002, was 12 years old and lived with ER at Doonside. On the morning of 13 January 2002, the applicant went to ER's home.  E was at home when he arrived.  ER arrived later in response to a phone call.
11When ER arrived home, the applicant swore and shouted at her.  After they went inside, he pinned her against the kitchen sink for about an hour and a half, during which time he moved back and forth approximately a foot and a half away.  ER remained in the kitchen for a further period, during which the applicant did not allow her to move from the area.  They moved into the dining room.  Throughout this period, the applicant was abusive and made threats against her and a man referred to as RM.
12Between lunch time and approximately 5 pm, the applicant was alternatively calm and abusive.  He refused ER's request that he leave and, when she wanted to go for a walk with E, he said they could only go if he went with them.
13At about 11 pm, E went to bed.  ER again asked the applicant to leave and he refused.  At around midnight ER went to bed.  She remained fully dressed.
14About 15 minutes later, the applicant came into ER's bedroom. ER said ""Don't do this to me G.  Please don't do this to me.""  The applicant responded by threatening to silence ER, and then threw her back on the bed, removed her clothing and had forced penile intercourse with her.  Afterwards, he threatened her and followed her to the bathroom.  On returning to the bedroom, the applicant set ER's alarm clock and lay on the bed next to her.  When the alarm sounded at 4 am, the applicant left, but threatened to return.
15After the applicant left, ER went to the bathroom where she vomited and then showered.  After she had dressed she sat in the dining room for some time, before calling RM.  At about 6 am, E came into the dining room and spoke to ER.  She then rang the police who came to her home at approximately 11.20 am.  One of the officers gave evidence about the content of the conversation with ER.  Later that afternoon, ER attended Westmead Hospital, where Dr Sterrett took a history from her, examined her and prepared a report which was tendered.
16The evidence in the Crown case was given by ER, E and the police officers who attended the Doonside home and carried out the investigation.  The Crown also relied on the report of Dr Sterrett. Photographs of ER's injuries were admitted into evidence.  RM was not called as a witness.  Detective Senior Constable Crompton gave evidence that he had been unable to contact him for a statement.
The defence case at trial
17The applicant, who gave evidence, said that he went to ER's house for the purpose of inviting his daughter on an outing, and that he became concerned about what she told him about herself and RM, who was much older that she was.  When ER returned home, the applicant discussed his concerns with her. He acknowledged that the discussion was at times heated, particularly in relation to RM (whom he suspected of abusing his daughter). He neither restricted ER's movements nor prevented her from leaving.  As the afternoon wore on, the applicant and ER became more conciliatory. When E went to bed ER invited him to have intercourse with her in her room.  Consensual intercourse then took place several times. The applicant left early in the morning.
ER's evidence at trial regarding contacting RM
18Because of its importance to the present application I shall summarise the evidence at trial of ER's communication with RM on 14 January 2002.
19In her evidence in chief, ER stated that, after the applicant left the house, and she had vomited and showered, she rang a friend.  At that stage of her evidence, she did not say that she had said anything to RM about what occurred.
20In cross-examination, ER was asked a series of questions about RM.  It was part of the defence case that the applicant had attended the Doonside residence because he was concerned about the nature of RM's relationship with his daughter and wanted to discuss it with ER.  E had previously made a complaint in the presence of her parents and others that RM had sexually abused her.  Although E subsequently admitted that this claim was false - an admission she adhered to in her evidence during the trial - the applicant's evidence was that he remained concerned about RM's contact with her. In the context of questions as to why she would ring RM before checking on the welfare of her daughter, the applicant's counsel put to ER in cross-examination the following part of her statement to police:""later on that morning I called my friend, RM, and told him what happened.""  
21ER agreed in cross-examination that she had done this.  Shortly afterwards she reiterated that she had rung her friend (RM) ""and told him what the applicant had done to me"".
Dr Sterrett's report
22Because of the importance placed by the applicant on a page of Dr Sterrett's report, I propose to set out its significance in the context of the evidence given at trial by ER and other evidence in the Crown case.
23ER gave evidence at trial that her injuries included:""scratches where he'd dug his fingernails into the, on my face when he had his hand over my face"".  
24On the morning of 15 January 2002 photographs were taken of ER, including a photograph of ER's face.  ER identified herself in the photograph.  In answer to a question in chief as to whether she recognised anything of significance in terms of the incident on 14 January 2002 she referred to scratches and marks on the left-hand side of her face, on the lower cheek.  When asked how extensive the scratches were, ER stated: ""My face was sore, it was more internally than the scratches.  The scratches were there but my face internally was very, very sore.""
25ER was cross-examined about the injuries to her face. It was put to her that she had not told Dr Sterrett about the scratches; that Dr Sterrett had not said anything to her about them; and that there was no evidence of scratching to her face. It was also put to her that the only thing he noted about her face was that there was redness to her left eye. She denied each of these propositions. The foundation for this cross-examination appears to have been the page of Dr Sterrett's report, which forms part of the basis of the present application, which was where Dr Sterrett's relevant finding on examination was recorded.
26In closing address the applicant's counsel referred to this evidence in support of a submission that the sexual assault did not take place. He made specific reference to the fact that there was no mention of scratches in the medical documentation.
Original Appeal
27One of the grounds in the Original Appeal was that the trial judge erred in law in directing and/or failing to direct the jury adequately or properly as to complaint and/or the effect of complaint.  In addressing that ground, Miles AJ (with whom Spigelman CJ and Bell J agreed) referred to the following aspects of the evidence that the trial judge summarised, in his directions, as complaint evidence:
1.ER's evidence in relation to ringing RM, and, in cross-examination, that she had ""told him what had happened.""
2.The evidence of the daughter, E, that after she woke and saw her mother in the dining room, she said ""Mum I'm calling the police.""  ER replied ""No, don't.""  The daughter responded ""I know he raped you.""  ER replied ""Yes he did.""  The daughter then rang the police.
3.Evidence about which his Honour said there was no dispute, namely that the police ""received a complaint from the complainant that morning she had been raped by the accused.""
4.Evidence of Constable White, who accompanied Constable Wharfe to the house about 11.30 am on 14 January 2002 and heard ER say to Constable Wharfe, ""He wouldn't let us leave the house, and I couldn't call anyone, when I went to bed, he came in and raped me"".  This evidence was also not challenged.
5.A certificate admitted under s 177 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) signed by Dr Sterrett, recording that ER arrived at the Westmead Hospital on 14 January 2002 and gave a history of abuse by her ex-husband including ""threats against her life, holding her down with physical force (hand on face and throat) and vaginal rape with penile penetration and, she believed, ejaculation"".
28The Court concluded that the trial judge's directions in relation to the evidence of ER said to amount to a complaint to RM were inaccurate.  Miles AJ referred to relevant authorities, and said: ""evidence of complaint is no longer admitted in effect to bolster or strengthen the credit of the complainant, but as evidence of the facts intended to be represented"".  Miles AJ said further at [47]:""The fact of the telephone call in itself was irrelevant.  Arguably it might have been relevant for her to say in evidence that she 'told him what happened', but the probative value of her telling RM 'what happened' was well outweighed by the likelihood of unfair prejudice, the jury being invited in effect to speculate upon what it was that she said to RM.  Hence evidence that she told him 'what happened', if it had been objected to, was likely to have been rejected on discretionary grounds under s 135 or 137 of the Evidence Act.Since the evidence went no higher than establishing that the complainant told RM 'what happened'. The jury should not have been left in the situation where they had been instructed that the complainant had made a complaint to RM.""
29Notwithstanding Miles AJ's conclusion that the directions on the complaint evidence were inaccurate in so far as ER's statements to RM were concerned, rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules was applied and leave was refused in respect of that ground on the following bases:  (1)the evidence was not objected to;(2)ER was cross-examined about her statement to RM, presumably to impugn her credit by investigating possible inconsistency; and  (3)no direction was sought at the end of the summing-up.
Review Appeal
30The basis for Barr J's referral of the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal for the Review Appeal was a statement that E was said to have made to her father, on a visit to Long Bay Gaol (in the company of a friend of her father's, John Carroll), that she had not heard anything that night and that her mother had told her to say that she had on the grounds that that the police ""wouldn't believe her [ER] by herself"".  It was also alleged that E had made a similar statement to the applicant's sister, JC, and to a former friend of ER.
31The applicant initially contended that ER had procured E to give fabricated evidence at the trial which implicated him.  However, following E's oral evidence on the appeal, the applicant reframed this ground to allege that E had given false evidence against the applicant ""at the behest of"" ER.  He argued that in light of the fresh evidence about E having lied in her evidence, the Court should be satisfied as to his innocence or at least entertain a reasonable doubt about his guilt so as to warrant quashing the verdict and ordering a retrial.  The applicant contended:
(i)E's evidence on which reliance was placed, was ""fresh"";
(ii)E's evidence was credible, cogent and plausible;
(iii)in the context of the evidence given at trial, the fresh evidence was likely to have caused the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt as to the applicant's guilt; 
(iv)alternatively, there was a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, may have acquitted the applicant on the basis of the evidence as a whole, including the fresh evidence.
32Both E and ER gave evidence at the hearing of the Review Appeal.
33At the Review Appeal, E recanted her evidence at trial that she had heard noises at 2am, including her mother saying, ""Please don't [GAR], please don't"". The Court noted that the applicant's counsel did not put to E at trial that she had not heard her mother say those words. At the Review Appeal E also recanted her evidence at trial that she had heard her father say to her mother: ""I don't care what you call it but I call it revenge"" and that she had also heard her father say at 4am before slamming the front door, ""Well, I'm fucking going"". E also recanted the evidence she had given at trial that when E had got up the following morning she found her mother in the dining room, crying, and told her mother that she was calling the police. E's evidence at trial was that her mother said, ""No, don't"" to which E responded, ""I know he raped you"", to which her mother responded, ""Yes, he did."" E's evidence at trial was that, after this exchange, she called the police immediately.
34At the Review Appeal, E gave evidence that she discussed the contents of her police statement with her mother and that she had felt pressured to help her mother at trial.
35The Court on the Review Appeal found the evidence that E gave in the Review Appeal (which, if accepted, would have seriously undermined the Crown case and ER's credibility), to be ""neither cogent, credible nor plausible"" (at [151] (c)). The Court considered that E was prepared to agree to anything that was put by the applicant's counsel which reflected favourably on the applicant. In any event, the Court considered that, even without E's evidence, there was sufficient evidence to satisfy the jury of the applicant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
36By contrast, the Court found ER's evidence given on the Review Appeal that she did not know what her daughter had or had not heard in the early hours of 14 January 2002 and denied having seen E's statement or discussed its contents with her  ""not only credible but cogent"" (at [151] (c)).
37The Court dismissed the appeal.
Previous applications for review of conviction
38The applicant has made two applications to the Court for a review of the conviction, each of which has been declined.
The present application
39As referred to above, the present application is based on the following two pieces of evidence, which will be considered in turn:(1)An affidavit of RM sworn on 15 July 2012 in which RM deposed that when he spoke to ER on the morning of 14 January 2002, she did not say anything to him about the applicant sexually assaulting her; and(2)A page from the medical report of Dr Sterrett that recorded his findings on examination of ER on 14 January 2002. 
The affidavit of RM sworn 15 July 2012 
40The applicant contended that the effect of the affidavit was that there was no evidence of consistency of complaint.  The Attorney-General contended that, apart from the evidence of the fact that ER had complained to RM, there was other evidence of complaint which was of greater probative value and remains unchallenged.  
41I accept the Attorney-General's submission. The evidence of ER's reporting of the matter to police on the morning following the alleged offence is powerful evidence of complaint. Whether or not she chose to tell RM is not to the point, except in so far as it had some potential to reflect on the credibility of her evidence in cross-examination that she told him ""what happened"". However, since the contents of her conversation with RM that morning were not explored, it is difficult to see how it could affect her credibility that she did not tell him (assuming RM's evidence is accepted) that she had been sexually assaulted. 
42The applicant submitted that RM's evidence bolstered the credibility of E's evidence on the Review Appeal.  The evidence given by E and ER on the Review Appeal and the Court's assessment of it are referred to above.
43 In my view, RM's evidence cannot affect the assessment by the Court on the Review Appeal of the relative credibility of E and ER. Further, the Court on the Review Appeal excluded from its consideration ER's evidence that she had rung RM and told him ""what happened"". 
44In these circumstances, evidence from RM that ER did not tell him that she had been sexually assaulted does not, in my view, give rise to any doubt or question as to the applicant's guilt.
Dr Sterrett's report and the evidence of ER about scratches to her face
45The applicant submitted that the effect of Dr Sterrett's report, which his representatives previously overlooked, was to indicate that the medical evidence did not corroborate the entirety of ER's evidence, and, in particular, her evidence that the applicant scratched her face. 
46The first answer to this submission is that it was not overlooked. The applicant's counsel used the report to cross-examine ER at trial about her injuries. There was no error in the applicant's counsel's closing submission and, accordingly, the jury was not misled.
47In the Original Appeal, Miles AJ, in summarising the Crown case said, erroneously, that Dr Sterrett's report had included a reference to scratches on the left side of ER's face. It is difficult to see what difference that error could have made to the reasonableness of the conviction since the error was made on appeal. Although Miles AJ's summary was accepted by the applicant and the Crown for the purposes of the Review Appeal, the Court that heard the Review Appeal engaged in debate with the Crown about whether there was evidence, other than ER's evidence, of injuries to her face. The Crown accepted in argument that it was not possible to ascertain from the photograph whether ER's face was scratched. The Crown did not refer to Dr Sterrett's report in this context. In these circumstances the Review Appeal Court cannot have been misled by the error in the summary.
48At [37] of the reasons in the Review Appeal, the Court said: ""Annexed to Dr Sterrett's report are diagrams where he indicated the location of two abrasions, one to each elbow posteromedially and each about 1 cm long and 3 cm wide and contusions to the inner aspect of her legs at the position of ER's knees.   Accordingly, it is clear that the physical evidence of the injuries to ER as described by Dr Sterrett is entirely consistent with the injuries ER said she sustained during the struggle with the applicant.""
49In my view, a fair reading of this paragraph indicates that the Court was relying upon the consistency between Dr Sterrett's report of injuries to ER's elbows and the inner aspect of her legs and her evidence of those injuries. The absence of reference to scratches on ER's face showed, in my view, that they did not form part of the Court's conclusion about the consistency between ER's description of her injuries and Dr Sterrett's report. 
50As referred to above, the applicant's counsel at trial put to the jury the submission now sought to be agitated.  I do not regard this matter as giving rise to any doubt or question as to the applicant's guilt.
Conclusion
51The applicant submitted that the evidence of RM and the relevant page of Dr Sterrett's report supported E's claim that she was manipulated to give false evidence to support her mother; demonstrated that ER lied about telling RM ""what happened""; and that she lied about there being scratches to her face that were pointed out to her in hospital. For the reasons given above, I do not consider either of these matters to be capable of affecting the jury's assessment, or for that matter the Court that heard the Review Appeal, of the credibility of either E or ER.
52I am not satisfied that any of the matters relied upon by the applicant gives rise to any doubt or question about his guilt.  Accordingly the application is dismissed.

		18 December 2014",2014-12-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765491,R v Clarke [2014] NSWSC 1746,"Judgment
1R A HULME J:  Michael Bruce Clarke (the offender) was found guilty by a jury on 16 October 2014 of the murder of Ms Deborah Wolfgram at Hamilton South, a suburb of Newcastle, on 19 September 2013.
2Murder is a crime that has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life and there is also prescribed a standard non-parole period of 20 years.  Those are legislative guideposts that I am required to take into account in the assessment of sentence along with all of the other facts and circumstances pertinent to the offence and the offender.
The deceased
3I am grateful to those family members who provided victim impact statements that were read this morning.  They were dignified and eloquent expressions of the extreme grief that the offender's actions have caused.  By all accounts, Deborah Wolfgram was a beautiful, loving, trusting and inspiring person.  She was not a person to judge others; she was kind and caring to all.  Her loss will be felt forever by those who were close to her.  Whilst, necessarily, what I have to say in sentencing the offender will be primarily concerned with him and the circumstances of his crime, it should not be thought that I have not firmly maintained in my mind sincere sympathy for Ms Wolfgram's parents and siblings.  Again, I extend my condolences. 
Facts
4The offender lived in a modest bedsit-type flat in Fowler Street, Hamilton South.  It was accommodation that seems to have been facilitated for him by the Wesley Mission.   He was a man who was prone to drinking to excess and smoking cannabis.  Some of the people in the complex of unit blocks in that area with whom he associated seemed to have had the same predilection.   The evidence in the trial indicated that alcohol and drug abuse were quite a significant problem for him in that when he was interviewed by the police after having spent a month in custody he said that with enforced abstention his head was the clearest it had been for 10 years.
5The offender commenced drinking on 18 September 2013 at about lunchtime.  By about midnight or 1am when he went to bed it seems that he had consumed a lot of alcohol and cannabis.  He was, however, a person who had developed a tolerance to such substances and it is difficult to say with any certainty how badly he was affected.  It seems safe to say, however, that he was significantly intoxicated, but not to the extent that he was incapable of forming the intention required to establish the charge of murder.
6Ms Wolfgram was socialising with others at the offender's flat on the evening of 18 September.  It does not seem that they were all that well known to each other.  There was certainly no suggestion of any animosity between them.  When the offender retired to his bedroom to go to sleep, Ms Wolfgram was on the couch in the lounge room.  She had been provided with a pillow and a blanket.
7The following morning the offender contacted a friend, Mr Christopher Little, at about 8.30am and said that he was in trouble and needed to talk.  Mr Little went over to the offender's place and they went for a drive.  The offender told him that he had killed a girl; he had ""snapped"" and hit her.  He said that he had thought about ringing the police but could not because he did not want to go to gaol.  He said he woke up in the morning thinking it was a dream but the girl was dead.  He had put the bed over the body so that no one would see it.  He intended to get rid of the body in the Belmont sand dunes.
8Mr Little was deeply troubled by this and contacted the police.  Detective Sergeant Kelvin Wink and other police went to the offender's home in the mid to late afternoon of 19 September.  The offender admitted that there was a dead body in his flat.  He was arrested.  The deceased's body was found naked, wrapped in a blanket underneath an upturned mattress in the offender's bedroom.  Her clothing was in a garbage bag in his wardrobe.  The scene was indicative of the fatal assault having occurred in the bedroom but that is not entirely clear.
9A post-mortem examination revealed that Ms Wolfgram had died of the effects of blunt force trauma.  She had received a number of heavy blows to the head, primarily to the left side of her face.
10The offender agreed to be interviewed by police.  He protested that he had been so intoxicated that he was unable to recall all that had happened.  But he did give an account, in effect, that he had been woken by someone who he could not identify looming over his bed.  This awakened in him thoughts of his uncle looming over him when he was in bed when he was a teenager.  He had been a victim of sexual abuse by his uncle and this revived his fears of being sexually assaulted again.  He told police that he had punched the person as hard as he could.  His defence at trial was that he had responded in self-defence, genuinely believing that in order to defend himself it was necessary for him to take hold of the person by the throat and belt him or her to the head until the person was motionless.  He told police in this interview that it was only when he awoke the following morning that he realised the person who he had struck out at was Ms Wolfgram.
11I should mention that Ms Wolfgram was a 55-year-old woman who was 5 feet 5 inches tall and very slight; she weighed some 43 kg.  
12While the offender was still being held in custody at the Newcastle police station on 20 September he contacted the investigators and indicated that he was troubled by his inability to recall what had happened and that he was deeply remorseful.  He also indicated a desire to make reparation to the deceased's family.
13About a month later, the offender made contact from Cessnock Correctional Centre with Detective Wink.  He indicated that he had some further recollection of what had occurred.  Arrangements were made for him to be brought to Newcastle police station and another interview was conducted.  In this interview, the offender claimed that through a process of dreams, nightmares and flashbacks he had recalled that when he was woken in the early hours of 19 September he had thought that the person who was in his bedroom was a former girlfriend with whom he had had a falling out and who bore him animosity and had previously threatened him with knives.
14The Crown Prosecutor argued before the jury that given these inconsistent accounts, the offender's claim of having acted in self-defence was incredible.  Further support for that proposition was derived from the evidence of Mr Little.  He had said that during his conversation with the offender on the morning of 19 September he had suggested that the offender should go to the police and claim that he had been attacked and had responded in self-defence.  Mr Little suggested this so as to curry favour, or not get off side with the offender.  Mr Little's evidence was disputed.  But the manner in which he gave it indicated to me that whilst he may have been mistaken about some aspects, he was genuinely doing his best to tell the truth.  Demeanour is often a misleading thing in the assessment of the credibility of a witness, but in Mr Little's case I gained the distinct impression that he was a witness who did not want to give evidence against a friend but felt compelled  to do what was right.
15I can well understand the jury's rejection beyond reasonable doubt of the offender's claim to have acted in self-defence.  The offender's various explanations for what occurred included a number of inconsistencies and matters not supported by objective evidence that were identified in the written submissions of the Crown Prosecutor.  It is difficult to be sure about the truth of any such matters.
16But that leaves the offender's actions in so savagely beating Ms Wolfgram difficult to understand.  I do accept that his significant degree of intoxication had something to do with it.  I accept the Crown's concession that he acted with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, rather than to kill.  But there remain quite a number of matters that are unexplained.  Why was Ms Wolfgram in the deceased's bedroom (assuming the assault occurred there, which is not completely certain)?  What interaction was there between the pair before he initiated his murderous assault?  How did her clothing come to be removed?  Why was her body left bleeding on the offender's bed for a period of time before being wrapped in a blanket and then ""hidden"" under the upturned mattress?  
17There is also a question as to whether the offender was serious when he spoke to Mr Little of intending to dispose of the body in the Belmont sand dunes.  In relation to this, I accept Mr Little's evidence, particularly having regard to the fact that he reported soon after to Senior Constable Todd Clayton that the offender was going to dispose of the body.  Further support derives from the unchallenged evidence of Ms Kim James.  She said that on 19 September the offender had asked to borrow her car at 4.30am the next morning in order to go to Swansea.
18The best I can do is to conclude that the fatal assault was something that occurred on the spur of the moment.  Something occurred between the pair that caused the offender to, as he put it, ""snap"".  He continued striking Ms Wolfgram to the head until he realised that she was no longer moving.  He thereafter made a rudimentary attempt to conceal her body with a view to a possibility of later disposing of it.  I accept that intoxication influenced the offender's actions and thinking, although by no means should I be taken as suggesting that it provides any excuse.
19This was an unplanned spur of the moment killing where grievous bodily harm was intended.  It was not a sustained attack, but it did not need to be to achieve the offender's purpose.  It did not involve the use of any weapon but did involve heavy repeated blows with the offender's fists to a vulnerable part of his victim's body.  It must have been an attack of considerably savagery. Mr Fitzgerald, counsel for the offender, submitted that the objective seriousness of the offender ""falls to the lowest range in the spectrum for the crime of murder"". The Crown Prosecutor submitted that it was below mid-range.  I am prepared to accept the latter but am not prepared to accept that it is in the lowest range.
Personal circumstances of the offender
20The offender is now 44 years old.  He is the second oldest of five siblings.  He was brought up in Caves Beach.  He told Dr Olav Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, that his childhood was mostly happy but it was marred by having been sexually assaulted by an uncle.
21He was educated to Year 10 level.  He excelled at sports. He completed an apprenticeship as a gardener and has a certificate in horticulture.  He was self-employed as a tree lopper for many years but for the 10 years or so before his arrest he had mainly worked as a bar manager.
22He had never married.  He has a child from a previous relationship who is now aged 11 but who he has not seen for the past three years. He has been visited in gaol by his mother, his sister and one of his brothers. 
23Alcohol and drugs have marred his life.  He told Dr Nielssen that he was a regular drinker and in the months leading up to the murder he was drinking more heavily than in the past.  He was also using cannabis at a dangerous level; he would start when he woke in the morning and continue throughout the day.  The offender also told Dr Nielssen that ""it doesn't take much to burr me up when I am drinking"" and that he had been in numerous altercations when affected by alcohol in the past.  He said ""if ever I am in any sort of trouble it usually comes down to alcohol"". 
24The offender's criminal record is unsurprising having regard to this history.  There are drink driving, assault and sundry other offences, all dealt with by magistrates in the Local Court by way of fines and bonds.  This is the first time he has been imprisoned.
25The history obtained by Dr Nielssen and his review of medical records indicated that the offender had been thought to suffer from mental ill health for some years and had been prescribed a variety of medications.  Dr Nielssen made the diagnoses that the offender suffers from ""Substance use disorder""; ""Substance induced hallucinosis"" and possibly ""Bipolar mood disorder"".   The first of those is unsurprising.  The second diagnosis was made on the basis of an account given by the offender of having auditory hallucinations and the perception that other people were aware of what he was thinking, presumably something triggered by chronic heavy cannabis use.  Dr Nielssen was somewhat guarded about the third condition, given that it was partly based on a diagnosis made by a general practitioner after a single interview in 2008.  Dr Nielssen did not elicit a history of aspects which might confirm it.
26The history provided to Dr Nielssen included that the offender had consumed a substantial amount of alcohol and cannabis on the day and during the night of the offence.  I am prepared to accept that because it coincides with witnesses descriptions of him being extremely intoxicated. 
27The offender has been receiving antipsychotic medication in gaol in order to treat the hallucinosis.  Dr Nielssen considered that this is a condition that is likely to have a full remission over time and he may be able to withdraw from such medication.  However, he also noted that the offender is at increased risk of later episodes of psychosis because of the effect of long term substance use and past symptoms.  Ongoing psychiatric review was recommended.
28Dr Nielssen noted some positive qualities in the offender.  He had what the doctor considered a relatively limited criminal history.  He had shown an ability to hold down long term employment and has family support.  He was seemingly well regarded in the prison environment and had expressed what the doctor thought was an appropriate level of remorse regarding the death of Ms Wolfgram.
29The report of Dr Nielssen concluded with the opinion that the offender's main problem was substance use.  He considered that his longer-term prognosis would be directly related to how he is able to manage this condition in the years following his release from prison.
30A positive indicator of the offender's attitude to dealing with this issue is provided in the testimonial of his uncle (who I hasten to add is not the one who sexually abused him as a child).  Mr Leonard Steele is an ""Alcohol and Other Drug Worker"" who facilitates AA meetings in Cessnock Correctional Centre.  He confirmed the offender's attendance at these meetings and said that the offender also encouraged the attendance of other inmates dealing with similar issues.  It was Mr Steele's opinion that when the offender is sober, ""he is one of the most caring people I know"". 
31I also received a testimonial from the offender's mother.  Amongst other things, she confirmed that his life had been adversely affected by the sexual abuse he suffered as a child.  She also confirmed her continuing support for him.
32Another testimonial from a person who had known the offender more in the past than in recent years indicated that he was a person of many good qualities before his descent into drug and alcohol abuse.
Assessment of sentence
33On the question of remorse, I accept Mr Fitzgerald's submission that the offender has always acknowledged being responsible for committing the acts that caused the death of Ms Wolfgram.  He is to be given credit for the trial being conducted with that acknowledgment.  However, I am not persuaded that he is genuinely remorseful.  Dr Nielssen thought he was, but did not really explain why.  He also noted that the offender continued to maintain a claim of having acted in self-defence.  I am prepared to accept that the offender is regretful, but that is far as I am prepared to go.
34It was submitted that the offender is unlikely to reoffend and has good prospects of rehabilitation.  However, these issues very much depend upon his ability to deal with his drug and alcohol issues and they present a long-term challenge for the offender.  He seems to be motivated at present to deal with them, but how he manages once released back into the community is difficult to forecast given the entrenched nature of the problem.  The real concern is his candid concession to Dr Nielssen of the connection between his abuse of alcohol and violent conduct.  I consider that his prospects of rehabilitation are, at most, reasonable.
35There is some history of mental ill health as I have mentioned.  It is not something that seems to have had any bearing upon the commission of the offence.  It warrants a slight reduction in the emphasis to be given to general deterrence but is otherwise not of any great significance.  Other purposes of sentencing remain pertinent, particularly the imposition of adequate punishment for the offence, personally deterring the offender, recognising the harm he has caused, making him accountable and denouncing his conduct. 
36The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 19 September 2013 and so his sentence must be backdated in order to take this into account.
37Mr Fitzgerald submitted that there were special circumstances warranting a reduction of the proportion of the sentence to be represented by the non-parole period.  I have considered this issue but have determined that no adjustment is warranted.  The parole period allowed for when the non-parole period is at the usual three quarters of the total term will be sufficient to deal with issues to assist the offender upon his release into society.  The non-parole period I have in mind is necessary to reflect the gravity of his crime as well as all of the other aspects relevant to sentence.
Sentence
38Convicted.
39Sentence to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 16 years 6 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 5 years 6 months.  That is a total sentence of 22 years.  
40The sentence is to date from 19 September 2013.  The non-parole period will expire on 18 March 2030 and the total term will expire on 18 September 2035.

		05 December 2014",2014-12-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765501,LB v R [2014] NSWCCA 295,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: On 5 May 2013 the appellant was arraigned in the District Court at Griffith on an indictment that contained a single count of sexual intercourse without consent with a person under the age of 10 years, and an alternative count of attempted sexual intercourse without consent with a person under the age of 10 years. The offence was alleged to have been committed between 15 September 2008 and 15 October 2008. After a 5 day trial, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the principal count, but guilty on the alternative count. On 12 July 2013 Haesler DCJ sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 2 years commencing on 9 May 2013, with a non-parole period of 6 months.

2The appellant appeals against the conviction. He has not sought leave to appeal against the sentence. 

3Prior to trial, application was made on the appellant's behalf, pursuant to s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), for an order that the appellant be tried by judge alone. That was opposed by the Crown. On 3 May 2013 Haesler DCJ refused to make the order, giving reasons for that decision. That refusal gave rise to the first pleaded ground of appeal. 

4At about the same time, application was made on behalf of the appellant for the exclusion of certain evidence of the complainant. On 3 May 2013, in a separate judgment, Haesler DCJ rejected that application also, giving reasons. The refusal is not the subject of any ground of appeal. However, by Ground 2, it is asserted on behalf of the appellant that, having regard to subsequent events, his Honour ought to have reversed that ruling and directed a verdict of not guilty, and that (notwithstanding that no application that he do so was made) failure to take those steps constituted error of law. Finally, by Ground 3, it is asserted on behalf of the appellant that the verdict of guilty was ""unsafe and unsatisfactory and not supported by the evidence"". 

The Crown Case

5What follows is an outline of the case the Crown sought to make at trial. 

6The complainant was born in October 2000. The appellant was his ""step-cousin"" - that is, was the step-son of the complainant's uncle. (In fact, the relationship was more complicated than that, but the precise relationship is immaterial for present purposes.) The appellant was about eight years older than the complainant. 

7At the end of September 2008 (on a date that cannot be precisely ascertained) a family birthday party was to take place at the home at which the complainant lived with his mother (DB), her husband (SB), and the complainant's sister (NS). Also present at the party were the complainant's maternal grandparents (DBS and KS), the appellant and his step-father (GB), DB's sister (AS) and AS's partner (DO). GB is a brother of SB. The complainant's family lived in a town in the southwest of NSW. 

8At the time, the complainant was seven years of age; the appellant about 15 years of age. It was the Crown case that the appellant told the complainant to go into his (the complainant's) bedroom, where he committed an act of penile/anal penetration (or, alternatively, attempted to do so). The event was partly witnessed by the complainant's sister, NS, then aged six. The complainant made almost immediate complaint to his grandmother, DBS. She challenged the appellant, who denied any wrongdoing. 

9No official report was then made. It was not until June 2009, 21 months later, that a report - by anonymous telephone call - was made to the Department of Family and Community Services (""DFACS""). No action was then taken upon that report. A review two years later prompted an officer of DFACS to contact police.

10The complainant and his sister, NS, were separately interviewed by a police officer (Senior Constable Mark Beltrame) in November 2011. The complainant was then 11. NS was then nine. Each interview was video recorded. The appellant's grandmother (DBS) and others present at the party at various times made statements to police. 

11For the purposes of Ground 3 of the appeal it will be necessary to examine the evidence more closely than the above outline. 

The trial

12Following the interlocutory ruling to which I have referred, a jury was empanelled on Monday, 5 May 2013. The trial commenced with the evidence of the complainant followed by that of his sister, NS. The evidence of both of these witnesses was given in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) concerning vulnerable witnesses: see Ch 6 Pt 6 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Their evidence in chief was given by having the jury shown the video recordings of their November 2011 interviews with police: s 306U. Their oral evidence was given by closed circuit television: s 306ZB.

13Other witnesses to give evidence were DBS, KS, AS, DB, DO, Cindy Blackett (a DFACS caseworker), and Mark Beltrame (the officer of police in charge of the investigation). 

14On 8 May, when the Crown evidence was complete, senior counsel who appeared for the appellant sought a direction known as a ""Prasad direction"": R v Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 101. A ""Prasad direction"" is a direction, rarely given, at the close of the Crown case, (or at any time thereafter) that a jury may, without hearing more, return a verdict of not guilty. Haesler DCJ acceded to the application, and advised the jury, clearly, and in some detail, of their rights in this respect. The jury elected to hear more. 

15The appellant did not give or call evidence. Following the Prasad direction, counsel addressed. The judge summed up in a manner that has not attracted criticism. The jury returned the verdicts set out above.


The grounds of appeal

16Three grounds of appeal were pleaded, as follows:

""1. His Honour erred in not directing the trial to be heard by Judge alone.

2. His Honour erred in not reversing his original decision and excluding the complainant's evidence-in-chief in the form of his interview, and then directing a verdict of not guilty. 

3. The verdict of the jury was unsafe and unsatisfactory and not supported by evidence.""

17At the commencement of the appeal, senior counsel for the appellant advised the Court that Ground 1 was no longer pressed. He acknowledged that Ground 2 was, in reality, co-extensive with, or dependent upon, Ground 3. It will therefore be convenient to deal first with Ground 3.

Ground 3: unreasonable verdict?

18As indicated above, for the purposes of considering this ground, it is necessary to look more closely at the Crown evidence. As also mentioned above, the evidence in chief of both the complainant and NS was given in the form of their video recorded interviews. 

19The incident the subject of the indictment was alleged to have occurred in September or October 2008 when the complainant was seven years of age. The interviews of the complainant and NS with police took place on 3 November 2011 and 15 November 2011 respectively, when the complainant was 11 and NS was nine. Each was therefore relating events that had occurred three years earlier, when they were, respectively, seven and six years of age.

20The transcript of the complainant's evidence shows clearly that he was reluctant, at least at first, to talk about the event. For example, he was asked about the birthday party and was then asked:

""Did you tell someone something at the party?""

(This was a reference to what he was alleged to have said to his grandmother immediately after the event, to which I will return.) In the interview, he assented to that question, but when asked if was able to say what it was that he had said, he said ""no"". When asked why, he said:

""'Cause it was somethin' not nice."" 

He said that he had told his ""nan"" that something had happened, and when asked what that was, he said:

""Well, [the appellant] was yucky to me.""

When asked what he meant by ""yucky"", he said ""rude, like ---""

21When asked what he meant by saying that the appellant was ""rude"", he said: 

""I can't remember, but he was rude. That's it, that's all I remember.""

He was asked again what he had told his grandmother and he answered:

""He was being rude to me and that was it. And then nan and his dad had a fight, and then that was it, and then we had the party, 'cause we were settin' up the party.""

22The complainant said that the appellant had been ""rude"" to him, but when asked if he could say more about the appellant being ""rude"", he said he did not really know, and that was because ""he was only young"". 

23As time went on, the complainant became more expansive. He told Senior Constable Beltrame that he was playing in his bedroom and the appellant walked in, and:

""He just dragged me from where I was playin' and chucked me on the bed."" (answers to questions 171 and 172)

and: 

""Went rude. Went rude, and then --- he was being rude. And then he took off back outside, and then I told me nan."" (answer to question 173)

24A little later (in answer to question 291, when asked about his answer that the appellant had chucked him on the bed, and had been, ""rude"", and asked to explain that), the complainant said: 

""Well, I made a mistake there. He just went back and got a drink, and then come back in, and I was asleep.""

25He then said that he had told his grandmother that the appellant was being ""rude"" to him. He said that this was because his sister had told him:

""[The appellant] was being rude to you while you were asleep.""

26A little later, he said:

""Well, he put his private in my bum, and that was it. And then I cried, and then I went and told Nan."" (answer to question 348)

He said that ""his private"" was his ""rude part"", also called a ""doodle"".

27When asked to relate everything that had happened from start to finish, the complainant said:

""Well, we were settin' up, and then [the appellant] said Go in your room. And then he come in and done it, what I said. And then I went and told nan, and then nan had an argument with uncle [G] [GB, the appellant's step-father] and then they, I think they went and got drinks ..."" (answer to question 359)

28The complainant said:

""Like, put his like, rude part in my bum, and that, and then I cried, and ... to nan then. He pulled my pants down and then done it, and then I quickly ran to nan, after I pulled my pants up, and then I went to nan and told, and then he, nan told his dad, and then [the appellant] got called out, like, to his, his dad, and it started, like, again, like havin' an argument again."" (answer to question 379)

He was asked what it felt like and he said:

""Yuck. It hurt, and he's tryin' to stop me from crying, like, trying to give me stuff, and I was sayin', no, no, I'm goin' to tell. Then he knew he was going to be in trouble."" (answer to question 396).

29He said that he was crying, the appellant tried to stop him by saying that he would buy the complainant a scooter but the complainant said that he was going to tell. He said that he was crying because it hurt (answer to question 443). 

30Some corroboration of the central allegation could be found in the evidence of NS. In her interview, she said:

""Well, my brother was lyin' on his bed and then, then my cousin, [the appellant] went in there, then he was sittin' with [the complainant] and I was, I was outside. And then when I came inside to see what [the complainant] was doing, my, my cousin told me to go away, and then I went away and went to tell nan that he told me to go away. And then [the complainant] came out and told nan."" (answer to question 37)

31NS said that she saw the complainant lying on his bed. Also in the room was the appellant. Later, she said that the appellant was also on the bed next to the complainant. She said that when she came into the room the appellant was ""on top of [the complainant]"". The complainant was lying on his stomach and rolled on his back because he was going to read a book, and he told the appellant to get out but the appellant did not leave the room (answer to question 58). She said that both had their clothes on. She said that the complainant was lying face down with his stomach on the bed, the appellant was lying on top of the complainant, with his stomach towards the complainant's back. She said:

""[The appellant] was trying to be rude to [the complainant]. ... He was trying to put his rude part into his bum."" (answer to questions 78 and 79) 

32She said that the complainant told her that the appellant was ""trying to stick his rude part in my bum"" and that caused her [NS] to run out and tell their grandmother. She said that the complainant told her to tell their grandmother that:

""... [The appellant] is trying to stick his rude part in."" (answer to question 95)

She said that the complainant was upset and crying. 

33It may here be observed that the evidence of both the complainant and NS was that immediate complaint was made to DBS. DBS confirmed that the complainant had approached her and confirmed that he had made a report of a sexual offence. However, her evidence differed somewhat from that of the complainant and NS. Her evidence was that she went to the house at about midday, but had to return to her home and to a supermarket (about 20 minutes drive away) to pick up some provisions. She did so, and returned to the party, but had to make a second trip to her home and the supermarket. It was when she was about to make the second trip that the complainant approached her and said that he wanted to go with her. He was quiet and upset, and she took him with her. She said that while they were at her house, the complainant told her that ""[the appellant] was rude to him"". She said:

""He said he put his rude thing in his bottom."" 

She said that the complainant told her that it hurt, and said:

""I'm not lying, nan, it hurt.""

She said that both were crying. 

34DBS said that she returned to the party with the complainant and confronted the appellant in the presence of others. She said that the appellant responded:

""What, what did I do?"" 

35She said that her confrontation with the appellant included her saying in the presence of the others:

""Well, [the appellant] put his dick in [the complainant's] bottom ...""

36She said that SB and GB spoke to the complainant, insisting that the appellant did not, and would not, do what the complainant had alleged. The complainant maintained that he did. After some repetition of this, the complainant then said:

""No, I didn't, I was lying."" 

37In cross-examination, DBS agreed that, in her initial statement to police, she had said that she was so angry that she had walked home, which took her about 4 or 5 hours. Subsequently, she realised that she had made a mistake and confused the incident at the birthday party with another incident at another event from which she had walked home. 

38There was other evidence that the complainant was upset. For example, DO (who was then in a relationship with the complainant's maternal aunt, AS) gave evidence that the complainant was upset and crying. 

39The complainant was 12 years of age when he gave evidence. The transcript of the cross-examination runs to 60 pages. At a relatively early stage, the following questions were asked and answers given:

""Q. Is it true that [the appellant] put his penis, or tried to put his penis, into your bottom?
A. Yes.

Q. I suggest to you that he didn't try and do that, what do you say to that?
A. I don't know.

...

Q. When you were outside and you were helping set up you say [the appellant] told you to go to your room?
A. Yes.

Q. What if I say to you he didn't say that to you. What would you say back to me?
A. You're lying.

...

Q. What if I say to you that when you were inside the room that [the appellant] didn't pick you up and throw you on your back on the bed, what do you say to that?
A. That's not true.

Q. What if I say to you that [the appellant] didn't pull your pants and underpants down in your bedroom that day?
A. That's not true.

Q. That he didn't place his penis near your bottom that day?
A. That's not true.

Q. That he didn't put his penis in your bottom that day?
A. He did.

Q. But you don't know whether it went in or not, do you?
A. No.

Q. I suggest to you, and you might say whether this is not a lie or not, that in fact it was you that asked [the appellant] to go into the room that day?
A. No.

Q. That you popped your finger in his bottom and said, 'Here I'll give you a Hopoate'?
A. No.

Q That he gave you one back?
A. No.

Q. In the same way, he put his finger in your bottom and with your clothes on?
A. No."" 

40Earlier, the complainant had said that he had never heard of a rugby league player called John Hopoate. It was nevertheless suggested to him that he and the appellant used to take part in a game in which they would give each other a ""Hopoate"", meaning that they would ""pop"" their fingers in somebody's bottom, outside their clothes and push it a little bit. 

41At the very end of the cross-examination, the following is recorded:

""Q. You said in your interview there that you were asleep in the room when [the appellant] came back in?
A. Yes.

Q. You said you didn't know [the appellant] came back in but his (sic) sister told you?
A. Yes.

Q. Did your sister tell you what [the appellant] did to you?
A. Yes.

Q. Did you know yourself what [the appellant] did to you before your sister told you?
A. No.

Q. So you rely entirely on your sister and what she told you to tell us about what [the appellant] did, is that the case?
A. Yes.

Q. That is the truth is it?
A. Yes.

Q. So you don't know yourself what [the appellant] did to you?
A. No.

Q. Is that what you say?
A. No.""

Resolution

42The principles to be applied in the resolution of a ground of appeal that a verdict of guilty is unreasonable or not supported by the evidence are well established. They were stated in Whitehorn v The Queen [1983] HCA 42; 152 CLR 657 as follows: 

""The question which an appellate court has to decide when called to consider whether a verdict ought to be set aside because it would be unsafe, unjust or dangerous to allow it to stand is 'whether the appellate court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty ... to say that the Court of Criminal Appeal thinks that it was unsafe or dangerous to convict, is another way of saying that the Court of Criminal Appeal thinks that a reasonable jury should have entertained such a doubt. The function which the Court of Criminal Appeal performs in making an independent assessment of the evidence is performed for the purpose of deciding that question. The responsibility of deciding upon the verdict, whether of conviction or acquittal, lies with the jury and we can see no justification, in the absence of express statutory provisions leading to a different result, for an appellate tribunal to usurp the function of the jury and disturb a verdict of conviction simply because it disagrees with the jury's conclusion. We do agree that in many cases the distinction will be of no practical consequence; it will be merely a matter of words. That will not generally be the case where questions of credibility are decisive. However, whether it matters from a practical point of view or not, in a particular case, it is not unimportant to observe the distinction that the trial is by jury, and (absent other sources of error) the jury's verdict should not be interfered with unless the Court of Criminal Appeal concludes that a reasonable jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt.""

43These principles have been adopted, or re-stated, from time to time: see Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] [1984] HCA 7; 153 CLR 521; M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. With those principles in mind, I turn to make the necessary assessment. 

44The written submissions on behalf of the appellant drew attention to what was said to be inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainant, and the evidence of NS. It was contended that:

""Ultimately, the evidence is the complainant said he did not in fact know what the appellant did, and was only told about this by his sister.""

This was a reference to the cross-examination of the complainant and extracted above [41]. It became the focal point of the oral argument.

45It was also pointed out that NS said that she did not see what had happened but only learned about what had happened when the complainant told their grandmother.

46It is correct, as was submitted, that ultimately there was no witness (other than the complainant) who gave evidence of seeing what had occurred. This is hardly surprising, and is the usual position in allegations of sexual misconduct. 

47I do not accept that the evidence either of the complainant or of NS is as deficient as was suggested. It is true, as I have been at some pains to point out, that the complainant was initially reluctant, in the police interview, to be drawn on what had happened. But he eventually did give a reasonably clear account of what he said had occurred between himself and the appellant. 

48It is also true that the complainant's grandmother gave evidence that, on the day of the events, the complainant said that he was ""lying"". However, that was said in the context of DBS's evidence that this ""admission"" was made after considerable pressure placed upon the complainant. In my opinion, it is likely that the jury gave it no weight at all. For myself, I would accord it no weight. 

49Both the complainant and NS were very young at the time of the events in question. Their first account of these events (other than that given by the complainant to DBS) was given three years later. It is hardly surprising that there are some discrepancies. These would be of much greater concern if it were not for the evidence of complaint made at the time. The complaint that was made was entirely consistent with the accounts given by the complainant and NS in their recorded interviews. 

50I recognise, also, that the evidence of NS was that the complaint was made to the appellant's grandmother while they still at the house. DBS's evidence was that the complainant told her what had happened after they had left the house, done some shopping, and returned to her property. I do not regard this of major significance. The evidence is clear that there was a confrontation at the house, and that DBS challenged the appellant. The evidence is also clear that the complainant was upset and crying while at the house. 

51I am satisfied that the jury was in a position to evaluate the evidence of all witnesses. I am also satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to justify the verdict. For my own part, the evidence of immediate complaint is of considerable significance. I am satisfied that the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence of which he was convicted. 

52The oral argument focussed heavily upon what was said to be a ""retraction"" by the complainant of his evidence. This was said to have occurred in those answers he gave at the end of the cross-examination, when he acceded to the proposition that his entire account of the events came from his sister NS, and that he personally had no knowledge of the events of which he gave evidence. 

53Two things may be said about this. First, as was pointed out by the bench during argument, the complainant gave evidence that what was done to him ""hurt"" him. This can hardly have come from his sister. Second, the so-called ""retraction"" came at the end of a lengthy cross-examination. This was one of those cases in which the advantage of the jury in observing the manner in which the evidence was given must not be underestimated. Moreover, those answers have to be seen in the light of the whole of the complainant's evidence.

54It was argued that, if those answers were not to stand as a retraction of the complainant's earlier evidence, the appropriate course, which was not taken, was for the Crown prosecutor to have sought leave under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), to cross-examine the complainant. I do not accept this. It was entirely open to the Crown prosecutor to address the jury with respect to the complainant's demeanour (which he did). It was the role of the jury to assess the weight to be given to those answers in the light of the whole of the circumstances of this trial. I would reject Ground 3 of the appeal.

55After the Court had reserved its judgment, and after the preparation of these reasons, senior counsel for the appellant sought leave to rely upon an additional authority. The Court received no objection from the Crown. The additional authority is Douglass v The Queen [2012] HCA 34; 290 ALR 699, with particular reference to paragraphs [40]-[48]. There was no submission to identify any principle sought to be extracted from those paragraphs.

56Douglass was an appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia. The proceedings involved an allegation of sexual misconduct by a grandfather on his three year old granddaughter. The trial was by judge alone. The reasons given by the trial judge for conviction were held (by the High Court) to be inadequate. The conviction was, nevertheless, upheld in the Court of Criminal Appeal.

57The High Court found also that the reasons given by the Court of Criminal Appeal for upholding the conviction were unsatisfactory. The complainant had initially denied any behaviour of the kind alleged on the part of her grandfather, and gave inconsistent accounts of the location of the incident of which she ultimately gave evidence. The High Court found inconsistency in the approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal to the impact on the fact finding exercise of the complainant's very young age. The High Court quashed the conviction.

58The decision in Douglass resulted from an examination of the evidence in the trial, by the application of the principles stated in the cases cited above (see [43]). I have already undertaken that exercise. In deference to the application for leave to rely upon Douglass, I have reconsidered my conclusion. I am unable, however, to find that the reasoning in Douglass alters that conclusion. While I recognise, and have given weight to the inconsistencies in the evidence that I have already mentioned, the immediacy of the complaint is a powerful factor in the overall assessment of the adequacy of the evidence to support the conviction.

Ground 2: the evidence of the complainant

59Objection was taken, pre-trial, to the evidence of the complainant. Two bases for the challenge were identified. The first was that, at least in the circumstances of this case, the giving of the complainant's evidence, by playing the recording of his police interviews, undermined the fundamental principle that a person accused of a criminal offence is entitled to a fair trial. The manner in which the complainant was questioned by police amounted to cross-examination, which would not have been permitted if the complainant had given his evidence in chief from the witness box, in the traditional way. The second basis of the objection lay in s 137 of the Evidence Act, which requires, in a criminal trial, exclusion of prosecution evidence if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused person. Haesler DCJ rejected both objections, giving reasons. It is of some interest that the present ground does not raise a challenge to that decision; rather, the ground is that, by reason of the oral evidence given by the complainant, it should now be seen that the prejudicial effect of the evidence is outweighed by its probative value: Evidence Act, s 137. The oral evidence upon which reliance was placed was that passage in the complainant's evidence in which he acceded to the suggestion that his knowledge of what had happened derived from his sister.

60Central to the ground is an assessment of the reliability of the complainant's evidence. The assessment of credibility, or reliability, is essentially a matter for the jury. It is not a question of admissibility, at least in terms of the balancing exercise that must be taken for the purposes of s 137 of the Evidence Act. 

61No application was made for re-consideration of the decision to admit the complainant's evidence. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. 

62Since, in my view, such application would have been devoid of merit, I would refuse leave to argue this ground of appeal. In any event, it was conceded on the hearing of the appeal that Ground 2 stood or fell with Ground 3. I would reject Ground 2 of the appeal.

63In my opinion, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 

64The order I propose is: 

(1) Appeal against conviction dismissed. 

65ADAMS J: I agree with Simpson J, in particular in respect of her Honour's consideration of the complainant's evidence. As to this evidence, I wish to make the following comment. As the excerpts from the transcript of the complainant's evidence set out by Simpson J show, there are some significant inconsistences in his account, certainly well capable of being regarded as adversely affecting its reliability. However, these inconsistencies could well be more apparent than real. Much depends on an assessment of the tone and expression of the questioning as well as the answers. These aspects of oral evidence are especially important, to my mind, in evaluating the testimony of a child aged twelve. In a case such as this, the significant advantage afforded the jury in seeing and hearing the evidence over an assessment made by the Court on reading the transcript will be, generally speaking, substantially greater than if the witness were adult. Thus, although the transcript by itself gives rise in my mind to a concern about the reliability of the complainant's account of what happened to him, in this case the jury's advantage is such as to allay my doubts about it.

66R A HULME J: My assessment of the evidence in the trial accords with that of Simpson J. I agree with her Honour's reasons and the order she proposes.

2765503,Cunneen v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2014] NSWCA 421,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The applicants - Margaret Cunneen, Stephen Wyllie and Sophia Tilley - were summoned to a public inquiry by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (""the Commission""). The inquiry concerned allegations that Ms Cunneen and Mr Wyllie, with the intention of perverting the course of justice, counselled Ms Tilley to pretend to have chest pains to divert police from conducting a blood alcohol test at the scene of an accident.

The applicants commenced proceedings challenging the inquiry on the basis that the allegations could not constitute ""corrupt conduct"" under the Independent Commission Against Corruption 1988 (NSW) (""the Act""). Section 8(2) of the Act relevantly provides that conduct which could constitute an attempt to pervert the course of justice could constitute ""corrupt conduct"" if it could adversely affect the exercise of official functions by a public official. 

The applicants also requested an order that the Commission provide reasons for its decision to investigate the allegations and to hold a public inquiry: Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), r 59.9(4). The primary judge, refusing the request, held the order would be ineffective as the Commission was not required to produce documents or divulge information in court: s 111(3) of the Act. The primary judge ultimately dismissed the proceedings. The applicants sought leave to appeal.

Held, granting leave and (by majority, Bathurst CJ dissenting) allowing the appeal,

1. The meaning of ""adversely affects"" in s 8(2) only extends to conduct that has the capacity to compromise the integrity of public administration. Unlawful conduct that falls within the second limb of s 8(2) is not ""corrupt conduct"" unless it could lead a public official to exercise his or her functions dishonestly, partially or otherwise improperly: [67], [71]-[75], [92] (Basten JA); [188]-[190] (Ward JA)

2. The alleged conduct could amount to an attempt to pervert the course of justice but it was not ""corrupt conduct"" within the meaning of s 8(2) as it could not be said a police officer (or other public official) might be led to exercise his or her powers improperly: [90], [92] (Basten JA); [195] (Ward JA)

(Bathurst CJ dissenting)
3. Conduct will have an adverse effect where it limits or prevents the proper performance of a public official's functions. The alleged conduct fell within the meaning of s 8(2) as it had the potential to divert the police officer from investigating a suspected offence: [22]

(Ward JA, Bathurst CJ agreeing; Basten JA not deciding)
4. The primary judge did not err in his construction of s 111 of the Act and there was no error disclosed in the exercise of his discretion to refuse the request for reasons that would warrant appellate intervention: [28] (Bathurst CJ); [156] [160] (Ward JA)

House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499; A v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2014] NSWCA 414 applied.

Consideration of whether the decision of the Commission to conduct a public inquiry was legally unreasonable: [111]-[117] (Basten JA); [206] (Ward JA).



			Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: I have read the judgments of Basten JA and Ward JA in draft. Their Honours have set out the facts giving rise to the proceedings and it is unnecessary to repeat them. I have the misfortune to differ from their Honours on the question of whether the alleged conduct of the applicants could constitute corrupt conduct within the meaning of s 8(2) of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (the Act). I can state my reasons shortly.

The relevant statutory provisions

2Section 2A of the Act describes the principal objects of the Act in the following terms:

""2A The principal objects of this Act are:

(a) to promote the integrity and accountability of public administration by constituting an Independent Commission Against Corruption as an independent and accountable body:

(i)to investigate, expose and prevent corruption involving or affecting public authorities and public officials, and

(ii) to educate public authorities, public officials and members of the public about corruption and its detrimental effects on public administration and on the community, and

(b) to confer on the Commission special powers to inquire into allegations of corruption.""

3Section 3 of the Act defines corrupt conduct as having the meaning given by Pt 3 of the Act. Section 3 also defines public authority to include the New South Wales Police Force and public official to include a member of that force. The section also defines public officials to include a judge, magistrate or holder of any other judicial office.

4Sections 7 and 8 of the Act contain the definition of corrupt conduct. They provide as follows:

""7(1) For the purposes of this Act, corrupt conduct is any conduct which falls within the description of corrupt conduct in either or both of subsections (1) and (2) of section 8, but which is not excluded by section 9.

(2) Conduct comprising a conspiracy or attempt to commit or engage in conduct that would be corrupt conduct under section 8 (1) or (2) shall itself be regarded as corrupt conduct under section 8 (1) or (2).

(3) Conduct comprising such a conspiracy or attempt is not excluded by section 9 if, had the conspiracy or attempt been brought to fruition in further conduct, the further conduct could constitute or involve an offence or grounds referred to in that section.

8(1) Corrupt conduct is:

(a) any conduct of any person (whether or not a public official) that adversely affects, or that could adversely affect, either directly or indirectly, the honest or impartial exercise of official functions by any public official, any group or body of public officials or any public authority, or

(b) any conduct of a public official that constitutes or involves the dishonest or partial exercise of any of his or her official functions, or

(c) any conduct of a public official or former public official that constitutes or involves a breach of public trust, or

(d) any conduct of a public official or former public official that involves the misuse of information or material that he or she has acquired in the course of his or her official functions, whether or not for his or her benefit or for the benefit of any other person.

(2) Corrupt conduct is also any conduct of any person (whether or not a public official) that adversely affects, or that could adversely affect, either directly or indirectly, the exercise of official functions by any public official, any group or body of public officials or any public authority and which could involve any of the following matters:

(a) official misconduct (including breach of trust, fraud in office, nonfeasance, misfeasance, malfeasance, oppression, extortion or imposition),
(b) bribery,
(c) blackmail,
(d) obtaining or offering secret commissions,
(e) fraud,
(f) theft,
(g) perverting the course of justice,
(h) embezzlement,
(i) election bribery,
(j) election funding offences,
(k) election fraud,
(l) treating,
(m) tax evasion,
(n) revenue evasion,
(o) currency violations,
(p) illegal drug dealings,
(q) illegal gambling,
(r) obtaining financial benefit by vice engaged in by others,
(s) bankruptcy and company violations,
(t) harbouring criminals,
(u) forgery,
(v) treason or other offences against the Sovereign,
(w) homicide or violence,
(x) matters of the same or a similar nature to any listed above,
(y) any conspiracy or attempt in relation to any of the above.

(3) Conduct may amount to corrupt conduct under this section even though it occurred before the commencement of this subsection, and it does not matter that some or all of the effects or other ingredients necessary to establish such corrupt conduct occurred before that commencement and that any person or persons involved are no longer public officials.

(4) Conduct committed by or in relation to a person who was not or is not a public official may amount to corrupt conduct under this section with respect to the exercise of his or her official functions after becoming a public official.

(5) Conduct may amount to corrupt conduct under this section even though it occurred outside the State or outside Australia, and matters listed in subsection (2) refer to:

(a) matters arising in the State or matters arising under the law of the State, or

(b) matters arising outside the State or outside Australia or matters arising under the law of the Commonwealth or under any other law.

(6) The specific mention of a kind of conduct in a provision of this section shall not be regarded as limiting the scope of any other provision of this section.""

5Section 9 of the Act contains a limitation on the definition in s 8. So far as relevant it provides as follows:

""9(1) Despite section 8, conduct does not amount to corrupt conduct unless it could constitute or involve:

(a) a criminal offence, or

(b) a disciplinary offence, or

(c) reasonable grounds for dismissing, dispensing with the services of or otherwise terminating the services of a public official, or

(d) in the case of conduct of a Minister of the Crown or a member of a House of Parliament-a substantial breach of an applicable code of conduct.""

6As each of Basten JA and Ward JA have pointed out, s 8(2) of the Act imposes two requirements. First, that the conduct could adversely affect, either directly or indirectly, the exercise of official functions by any of the persons or bodies referred to in the subsection (the first limb). In this context ""could"" in my opinion refers to a reasonable possibility that the conduct would have such an effect. 

7Second, it is necessary that the conduct could involve one of the matters referred to in s 8(2)(a)-(y) of the Act (the second limb). In this context ""could"" means that a jury properly instructed could reasonably conclude that the offence had been committed: See Greiner v Independent Commission Against Corruption (1992) 28 NSWLR 125 at 136.

8In the present case it is convenient to deal with the second limb first.

Perverting the course of justice

9The applicants contended that the conduct referred to in the summons could not constitute the offence of perverting the course of justice. For the reasons given by Basten JA, I am unable to agree. However, a consideration of the elements of the offence does provide assistance in dealing with the question of whether or not the first limb of the subsection is satisfied.

10It is clear that merely interfering with a police investigation will not constitute the offence. The circumstances where such interference will constitute the offence in question were explained by Mason CJ and Brennan and Toohey JJ in The Queen v Rogerson [1992] HCA 25; (1992) 174 CLR 268. In that case Mason CJ after stating that police investigations do not themselves form part of the course of justice, made the following remarks (at 277-278):

""It is well established at common law and under cognate statutory provisions that the offence of attempting or conspiring to pervert the course of justice at a time when no curial proceedings are on foot can be committed. That is because action taken before curial or tribunal proceedings commence may have a tendency and be intended to frustrate or deflect the course of curial or tribunal proceedings which are imminent, probable or even possible. In other words, it is enough that an act has a tendency to frustrate or deflect a prosecution or disciplinary proceeding before a judicial tribunal which the accused contemplates may possibly be instituted, even though the possibility of instituting that prosecution or disciplinary proceeding has not been considered by the police or the relevant law enforcement agency. So, in Kalick v. The King, it did not matter whether the police officer intended to institute a prosecution; it was sufficient that, being apprehensive of a prosecution, the accused gave a bribe to prevent it. Action taken to prevent the institution of a prosecution is as much an interference with, or impairment of, the administration of justice as action taken to obstruct the conduct of a prosecution after it has been commenced. 

Accordingly, I agree with Brennan and Toohey JJ. that an act which has a tendency to deflect the police from prosecuting a criminal offence or instituting disciplinary proceedings before a judicial tribunal, or from adducing evidence of the true facts, is an act which tends to pervert the course of justice and, if done with intent to achieve that result, constitutes an attempt to pervert the course of justice and can ground the offence of conspiring to pervert the course of justice.""
(References omitted).

11Whilst Brennan and Toohey JJ dealt with the issue in the following terms (at 283-284):

""Although police investigations into possible offences against the criminal law or a disciplinary code do not form part of the course of justice, an act calculated to mislead the police during investigations may amount to an attempt to pervert the course of justice. An act which has a tendency to deflect the police from prosecuting a criminal offence or instituting disciplinary proceedings before a judicial tribunal or from adducing evidence of the true facts is an act which tends to pervert the course of justice and, if done with intent to achieve that result, amounts to an attempt to pervert the course of justice. It impairs the court's capacity to do justice in the actual circumstances of the case. In Kalick v. The King, a bribe to a policeman to induce him not to prosecute for an offence against the Saskatchewan Temperance Act was held to be a corrupt interference with the due 'administration of justice' for the purposes of s. 157 of the Canadian Criminal Code. Anglin J. said:

'It is quite immaterial whether the police officer actually intended or contemplated instituting a prosecution. It suffices that the appellant gave the bribe with intent to head off such a proceeding. The due administration of justice is interfered with quite as much by improperly preventing the institution of a prosecution as by corruptly burking one already begun.'

We respectfully agree. The gravamen of the offence of an attempt to pervert the course of justice is an interference with the due exercise of jurisdiction by courts and other competent judicial authorities. As the courts exercise their necessary and salutary jurisdiction to hear and determine charges of offences against the criminal law only when their jurisdiction is invoked, an act which has a tendency to deflect the police from invoking that jurisdiction when it is their duty to do so is an act which tends to pervert the course of justice. Subject to a limited discretion not to prosecute, it is the duty of the police to prosecute when offences are committed.""
(References omitted).

12It is important to note the emphasis placed by each of their Honours on the fact that the conduct is intended to frustrate or deflect the course of a criminal or tribunal proceeding (in the case of Mason CJ) or of impairing the Court's capacity to do justice in the actual circumstances of the case (in the case of Brennan and Toohey JJ).

The construction of s 8(2) of the Act

13The task of construing the subsection must begin with a consideration of the text itself, taking into account the context, including the general purposes and policy of the provision: Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Territory Revenue (Northern Territory) [2009] HCA 41; (2009) 239 CLR 27 at [47]. Context is important as statutory construction requires deciding what is the legal meaning of a provision by reference to the language of the instrument viewed as a whole: Certain Lloyd's Underwriters v Cross [2012] HCA 56; (2012) 248 CLR 378 at [23], [24], [68] and [88] and Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355.

14The definition of corrupt conduct contained in s 8 of the Act, as Gleeson CJ pointed out in Greiner v Independent Commission Against Corruption at 129, is wide and in a number of respects unclear. In the same case Priestley JA described at 182 s 8 as intending to cast a very wide net. He stated that the unifying idea is that in the interest of honest and impartial exercise of official functions by public officials any conduct adversely affecting such exercise is prima facie to be regarded as corrupt. He said at 183 that the prime aim of s 8 was to bring a broad area of conduct, detrimental to the public interest, within the investigative reach of the Commission.

15In dealing with s 8 of the Act, there are a number of textual matters which should be noted. First, s 8(6) provides a specific mention of a kind of conduct in one provision of the section does not limit the scope of any other. Thus, the width of s 8(2) is not limited by any of the provisions in s 8(1).

16Second, the first limb of s 8(2) of the Act unlike s 8(1), does not direct itself expressly to any form of misconduct or potential misconduct by a public official. The misconduct, or potential misconduct, is picked up in the second limb of the subsection, which could include, but is not limited to conduct of the nature of that referred to in s 8(1).

17Third, the width of s 8(2) of the Act would mean that in many cases conduct will fall within both s 8(1) and s 8(2). This does not provide a reason for reading down the scope of the latter section. As I have indicated, to do so would be contrary to s 8(6).

18Fourth, it does not seem to me to be outside the contemplation of the legislature that each limb of the section would be satisfied by the same set of facts. That invariably would be the case in respect of conduct falling within s 8(2)(a) of the Act, which conduct would also appear to fall within s 8(1). However, the same result would apply in relation to other sections, for example, bribery of a public official, which would fall within s 8(2)(b).

19In these circumstances, I agree with Basten JA and Ward JA that the critical question is what is meant by the expression ""adversely affecting directly or indirectly the exercise of official functions"".

20Basten JA (judgment [71]) has expressed a view that what is referred to is conduct which has the capacity to compromise the integrity of public administration. Whilst there is much force in what his Honour says, I would prefer to focus on the words of the section. However, applying that test, in my opinion the alleged conduct falls within the section, in particular for the reasons which I have given in pars [24] and [25] below.

21Ward JA (judgment [188]) has expressed the view that for the first limb of the section to be satisfied it is necessary for the conduct to have the capacity to divert the relevant public officer from the proper exercise of his or her functions. Again, I would prefer to focus on the words of the section, which when applied have the result referred to below.

22In my opinion if the conduct in question limits or prevents the proper performance of the public official's function, then the first limb will be satisfied. In the present case the conduct had the potential effect of diverting the police officer from the performance of an investigation into a suspected crime. This in my opinion is sufficient to satisfy the first limb of the subsection, assuming the second limb is made out.

23That does not mean that any conduct designed to mislead a police officer will be corrupt conduct within the meaning of s 8(2) of the Act. As the courts have made clear, such conduct without more will not constitute perversion of the course of justice. It is only where the conduct has the tendency to deflect the police from invoking the jurisdiction of the court, when it is their duty to do so, that the offence will be committed: The Queen v Rogerson at 284.

24There is a more fundamental reason why the first limb is attracted. The conduct complained of could have the tendency to frustrate or deflect the course of possible curial or tribunal proceedings or to impair the court's capacity to do justice in the particular circumstances of the case: The Queen v Rogerson at 277 per Mason CJ and 284 per Brennan and Toohey JJ. It must be remembered that judges and magistrates are public officials and a court comprises a body of public officials: Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), s 25, District Court Act 1973 (NSW), s 12 and Local Court Act 2007 (NSW), s 12.

25Conduct which could impair the court's capacity to do justice in the particular case is conduct which in my opinion could adversely affect at least indirectly the exercise by a court of its official functions. For this reason alone the first limb of the subsection is made out.

26I appreciate that my reasoning necessarily involves the conclusion that any offence of perverting the course of justice or attempting to do so will fall within the subsection. This is not surprising where the essence of the offence is to impair the court's capacity to administer justice, something at the core of our legal and political system.

27For these reasons the alleged conduct falls within s 8(2) of the Act. This of course does not involve forming any view as to the merits of the underlying allegation.

28On the other issues in the appeal I agree with Basten JA and Ward JA.

29In these circumstances in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

30BASTEN JA: The Independent Commission Against Corruption (""the Commission"") is currently investigating an allegation involving the three applicants. The allegation under investigation was first set out in a notice given to the first applicant, Ms Margaret Cunneen SC, with a summons requiring her to attend a compulsory examination pursuant to s 30 of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW) (""the ICAC Act""). That examination was scheduled for 1 August 2014.

Procedural background
31On 29 October 2014 each of the applicants received a summons from the Commission, dated 27 October 2014, requiring them to attend to give evidence at a ""compulsory examination"", although the notice also referred to a ""public inquiry"". A ""compulsory examination"" is conducted in private: ICAC Act, s 30(5). A ""public inquiry"" is, unless the Commissioner directs otherwise, to be held in public: s 31(8). Despite the confusion in the Commission's notice, it was common ground that it intends to conduct a public inquiry, which has been deferred pending determination of these proceedings. The allegation identified in the notice of 27 October 2014 was as follows:

""That on 31 May 2014 Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen SC and Stephen Wyllie, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, counselled Sophia Tilley to pretend to have chest pains, and that Sophia Tilley, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, did pretend to have chest pains, to prevent investigating police officers from obtaining evidence of Ms Tilley's blood alcohol level at the scene of a motor vehicle accident.""

32The time for the commencement of the public inquiry identified in the notice was Monday, 10 November 2014. On 4 November 2014 the applicants filed proceedings in the Common Law Division seeking a declaration that the Commission was acting without jurisdiction and orders restraining the Commission from continuing its investigation.

33The matter was listed before Hoeben CJ at CL on 5 November 2014. In addition to filing the summons, the applicants issued a notice to produce documents directed to the Commission and a notice under the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""the UCPR""), r 59.9, seeking reasons for two decisions, namely (a) the decision to investigate the allegation and (b) the decision to hold a public inquiry. By arrangement with the parties, the notice to provide reasons was addressed first, and, the Commission indicating that it would not comply with the notice to give reasons, the primary judge declined the applicants' request that he order it to do so. 

34The matter then proceeded to a hearing on 6 and 7 November on the substantive issues raised by the applicants. On 10 November the primary judge dismissed the applicants' summons and delivered his reasons for judgment: Cunneen v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2014] NSWSC 1571. 

35An application for leave to appeal was filed the following day. On 11 November Macfarlan JA gave directions and fixed the hearing of the leave application (and the appeal, if leave were granted) for Tuesday, 18 November 2014. He noted an undertaking from senior counsel for the Commission that it would not proceed with a public inquiry until the determination of the appeal.

36The primary judge noted that ""the urgency associated with the hearing of this summons is clear"": at [8]. Accepting that view, the matter was disposed of with exemplary expedition. However, the need for urgency is not entirely clear. The Commission having fixed a public inquiry to commence on 10 November, it was no doubt administratively convenient that the matter not be delayed or, if delayed, for only a short period. Further it is proper that matters concerning the integrity of the public administration of justice be dealt with as expeditiously as practicable, without compromising the proper consideration of the issues raised.

37The appellate proceedings having been listed with unusual expedition in this Court, it is desirable that they be determined as expeditiously as possible. Nevertheless, the effects on other litigants which may result from that high degree of expedition does not seem to be warranted by a sufficient pressing public interest.

Issues on appeal
38The draft notice of appeal identified sixteen grounds, which can be grouped in four categories. The first (request for reasons), challenged the refusal of the primary judge to order, pursuant to UCPR r 59.9(4), that the Commission provide reasons for its decisions to investigate the applicants in connection with the allegation and to hold a public inquiry: grounds 1-7.

39The second category alleged error in construing the first limb of s 8(2) of the ICAC Act: grounds 8, 9 and 13. Ground 9 alleged that the Commission took into account an irrelevant consideration, namely the status of the first applicant as a deputy senior crown prosecutor, when the conduct sought to be investigated was unrelated to her role as a public official. The grounds otherwise identified a 'gateway' issue, namely that the allegation did not provide a basis for an inquiry into corrupt conduct, as defined in the ICAC Act.

40The third category identified a separate issue with respect to the operation of the second limb of s 8(2), namely whether the allegation could involve conduct constituting an offence, under s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), of perverting the course of justice: grounds 10-12.

41The fourth category concerned the challenge to the decision to hold a public inquiry pursuant to s 31 of the ICAC Act. This category comprised grounds 14-16.

42The issues raised concern the scope of the Commission's functions and powers and involve matters of public importance in relation to the public administration of the State. The Commission did not ultimately oppose leave: accordingly the applicants were granted leave to appeal in the course of the hearing. The applicants should, in due course, file the draft notice of appeal in the Registry.

43It is convenient to deal first with the grounds in the second and third categories, which in substance alleged that the investigation being undertaken by the Commission did not fall within the scope of its statutory functions. For the reasons given below, that ground should be upheld. That being so, the other matters fall away. The question of reasons becomes moot, as does any issue as to the validity of the decision to hold a public inquiry. 

44One other matter should be noted at the outset, namely that the Commission appeared as the active respondent in these proceedings. The Commission is certainly not a court, nor a tribunal in the usual understanding of that term. Rather, it is an investigative body which can hold inquiries and make reports to Parliament, amongst other functions. To the extent that it is required to exercise these functions, as it must do, impartially and without interest in the conduct or result of the investigations, it is undesirable that it become engaged in adversary proceedings with persons whose conduct is subject to investigation: see The Queen v The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13; (1980) 144 CLR 13 at 35-36. As the High Court stated, ""[i]f a tribunal becomes a protagonist in this Court there is the risk that by so doing it endangers the impartiality which it is expected to maintain in subsequent proceedings which take place if and when relief is granted.""

45There is a qualification to that principle (although itself regarded as ""exceptional"") where the submissions to be made are limited to the powers and procedures of the tribunal. These principles should apply to the Commission. At least in so far as the matters to be dealt with are limited to statutory gateway to the exercise of its investigative functions, no issue arises as to the propriety of the Commission itself appearing and presenting legal argument as to the scope of its authority.

The investigative function
46As senior counsel for the Commission correctly stated, the power being exercised by the Commission is to be found in s 13 of the ICAC Act, which, so far as relevant provides:

13 Principal functions

(1) The principal functions of the Commission are as follows:

(a) to investigate any allegation or complaint that, or any circumstances which in the Commission's opinion imply that:

(i) corrupt conduct, or
(ii) conduct liable to allow, encourage or cause the occurrence of corrupt conduct, or
(iii) conduct connected with corrupt conduct,
may have occurred, may be occurring or may be about to occur,
...

(2) The Commission is to conduct its investigations with a view to determining:

(a) whether any corrupt conduct, or any other conduct referred to in subsection (1)(a), has occurred ...

(3) The principal functions of the Commission also include:

(a) the power to make findings and form opinions, on the basis of the results of its investigations, in respect of any conduct, circumstances or events with which its investigations are concerned, whether or not the findings or opinions relate to corrupt conduct, and
(b) the power to formulate recommendations for the taking of action that the Commission considers should be taken in relation to its findings or opinions or the results of its investigations.

47Although it is clear that the Commission can investigate conduct which is not itself corrupt conduct and, of course, conduct which may, upon investigation, prove not to be corrupt conduct, the concept of ""corrupt conduct"" is central to the exercise of the principal function identified in s 13(1)(a) and (2)(a). The temporal element was fixed by events which had occurred, although the possibility of repercussions in the future which might involve corrupt conduct could not be dismissed. The case as presented by the applicants, without demur from the Commission, was that the allegation of which the applicants had been notified must itself involve corrupt conduct. Accordingly, it is necessary to consider the meaning of that term, as defined in s 8. There are constraints on the definition identified in s 9, but nothing turned on these for present purposes.

48Part 3 of the ICAC Act is headed ""Corrupt conduct"". Section 7(1) provides:

7 Corrupt conduct

(1) For the purposes of this Act, corrupt conduct is any conduct which falls within the description of corrupt conduct in either or both of subsections (1) and (2) of section 8, but which is not excluded by section 9.

49Both parties approached the matter in this Court (and it would appear before the primary judge) on the basis that the Commission's authority was to be found within that part of the definition of corrupt conduct which appears in s 8(2) of the ICAC Act, or not at all. There are indeed two parts to the definition of ""corrupt conduct"", set out in s 8(1) and s 8(2). It is not possible to understand the scope of s 8(2) without reference to s 8(1). As expressly recognised by s 7(1), particular conduct may fall within both subsections. It is clear that the drafter has sought to be comprehensive without seeking to establish two separate and independent provisions. Accordingly, both must be addressed together.

Scope of Commission's power to investigate
(a) definition of corrupt conduct
50Section 8 relevantly provides:

8 General nature of corrupt conduct

(1) Corrupt conduct is:

(a) any conduct of any person (whether or not a public official) that adversely affects, or that could adversely affect, either directly or indirectly, the honest or impartial exercise of official functions by any public official, any group or body of public officials or any public authority, or
(b) any conduct of a public official that constitutes or involves the dishonest or partial exercise of any of his or her official functions, or
(c) any conduct of a public official or former public official that constitutes or involves a breach of public trust, or
(d) any conduct of a public official or former public official that involves the misuse of information or material that he or she has acquired in the course of his or her official functions, whether or not for his or her benefit or for the benefit of any other person.

(2) Corrupt conduct is also any conduct of any person (whether or not a public official) that adversely affects, or that could adversely affect, either directly or indirectly, the exercise of official functions by any public official, any group or body of public officials or any public authority and which could involve any of the following matters:

(a) official misconduct (including breach of trust, fraud in office, nonfeasance, misfeasance, malfeasance, oppression, extortion or imposition),
(b) bribery,
...
(g) perverting the course of justice,
...
(x) matters of the same or a similar nature to any listed above,
(y) any conspiracy or attempt in relation to any of the above.

...
(6) The specific mention of a kind of conduct in a provision of this section shall not be regarded as limiting the scope of any other provision of this section.

51While s 8(6) expressly requires that one provision not be read down by some implication deriving from the scope of another, it is nevertheless necessary to read the section as a whole, and in the context of the objects of the Act (s 2A), the functions of the Commission (Pt 4), including the reporting functions set out in Pt 8. 

52It is not necessary to set out the provisions of Pts 4 and 8, but reference will be required to the language of s 2A, which reads as follows:

2A Principal objects of Act

The principal objects of this Act are:

(a) to promote the integrity and accountability of public administration by constituting an Independent Commission Against Corruption as an independent and accountable body:

(i) to investigate, expose and prevent corruption involving or affecting public authorities and public officials, and
(ii) to educate public authorities, public officials and members of the public about corruption and its detrimental effects on public administration and on the community, and

(b) to confer on the Commission special powers to inquire into allegations of corruption.

53The structure of s 8(1) and (2) is of some importance. It is in form and effect a definition of ""corrupt conduct"", as is recognised by s 3(1), corrupt conduct. The use of the adverb ""also"" in subs (2) indicates that subs 8(1) is the primary part of the definition. Of the four paragraphs in subs (1), all apply to the conduct of a public official, but par (a) applies to the conduct of any person, whether or not a public official. The evil or mischief at the heart of par (a) (complemented by (b)) is the dishonest or partial exercise of an official function. The provision covers both dishonesty and partiality on the part of a public official and conduct of a second person which may seek to induce or encourage dishonesty or partiality on the part of a public official. Thus, to take an obvious example, the offering of a bribe to an electoral officer by a private person could fall within par (a) because it could adversely affect the honest and impartial exercise of the electoral officer's functions.

54The word ""also"" has a second significance: it indicates that subs (2) is intended to extend the scope of the definition in subs (1). The first limb of subs (2) mirrors subs (1)(a), incorporating the concept of an adverse effect, but omitting the reference to ""honest or impartial"" exercise of official functions. The omission of that qualifying phrase must be taken to allow for adverse effects which do not fall within the concepts of dishonesty and partiality. By way of balance, the second limb is a restriction on the operation of subs (2), namely that the conduct could involve any of the long list of crimes and other official misconduct, which concludes with a dragnet of matters of the same or similar nature to those listed: par (x). 

55How the list operates is less clear. Subsection (2), like subs (1)(a), must be given a distributive operation. That is, it applies to the conduct of both public officials and others. To the extent that it applies to the conduct of others, that conduct must nevertheless be capable of adversely affecting the exercise of an official function by a public official. The comparison between subs (1)(a) and subs (2) with respect to the conduct of those who are not public officials may be paraphrased as follows (using the term ""private person"" to refer to someone other than a public official): the former provision catches any conduct of a private person which could adversely affect the honest or impartial exercise of official functions; the latter provision catches conduct which both falls within the list and could adversely affect the exercise of official functions in an unspecified manner.

56There is undoubtedly much overlap between the scope of s 8(1) and s 8(2): the first step is to identify in what manner the latter extends the former with respect to conduct of a private person. That involves asking what sort of adverse effect on the exercise of official functions is envisaged by subs (2). For example, a dishonest statement as to the sale price of a property, for the purpose of reducing an assessment of duty, might involve an offence under Pt 8 of the Taxation Administration Act 1996 (NSW) and thus be a form of ""tax evasion"" for the purposes of subs (2)(m). The result might be that an official assessed an inadequate amount of duty, but in doing so the official would be acting honestly, impartially and in accordance with his or her statutory obligations.

57By way of an example closer to the present case, the fact that a driver tells a lie about his health in order to avoid being breathalysed in circumstances where the driver thinks his blood alcohol level is above the prescribed limit, would not involve any dishonest or partial conduct on the part of the police officer, who would be exercising a discretionary power appropriately according to the facts which the officer reasonably believed at the time. The question is, in each case, whether the result of the conduct of the private person, namely that a tax payer avoids paying his or her full legal liability or a potential offender escapes prosecution, attracts the description of conduct which ""could adversely affect ... the exercise of official functions by any public official"". (In each case the conduct would appear to satisfy the second limb.)

58The applicants submitted that the two limbs of s 8(2) could be satisfied only by separate acts or omissions. Were that not the case, the submission continued, any criminal conduct which fell within the list could become the subject of investigation by the Commission. This submission cannot be accepted in its terms. There is nothing in the statutory language which requires two separate acts, as distinct from an act which has two prescribed characteristics. On the other hand, many circumstances will involve conduct having at least two elements. Furthermore, there is substance in the underlying premise, namely that subs (2) must not be read in a way which gives no work to the first prescribed characteristic, so that any conduct falling within the list of unlawful activities (primarily criminal) would suffice to engage the functions of the Commission.

59Whether subs (2) requires one or more than one activity in a particular case will depend upon two elements. First, in a practical sense, it will make a difference whether the conduct which is the subject of the first limb of subs (2) is the conduct of a private person or a public official. Secondly, it will depend on the nature of the unlawful conduct. 

60In one sense, the applicants' submission may have depended upon an assumption as to the scope of the term ""conduct"", which is not a defined term and is to be understood in the natural and ordinary meaning of the word. That meaning depends upon the context in which it is used and the circumstances to which it may apply. To take a simple example of a bribe offered to a police officer to overlook criminal conduct, there could be a single course of conduct or two separate activities each constituting conduct. Thus, the offering of a bribe by the private person would constitute corrupt conduct satisfying both characteristics identified in subs (2). Acceptance of the bribe could fall within the subs (1) or subs (2), but in the latter case because it is conduct which could adversely affect the exercise by the officer of his or her official functions. It might be thought to be an awkward reading of the provision (and this may be part of the applicants' submission) to fit within it the conduct of the corrupt police officer as being both the ""conduct of any person"" and having the effect of compromising ""the exercise of official functions by any public official"", being the same person. Such conduct would more naturally fall within subs (1)(b). How that issue should be addressed is not critical for present purposes: rather, the applicants' case must turn upon the meaning of ""adversely affects"" and its contingent form ""could adversely affect"".

61If subs (2) were satisfied whenever a private person understates his or her income in order to avoid paying the full amount of tax, the first limb of subs (2) will be deprived of effect, so long as the conduct constituted (in this example) ""tax evasion"" under the second limb. To the extent that such conduct might fall within a possible understanding of conduct which adversely affects the exercise of official functions, because the result is to reduce public revenue, that reading should not be accepted. Some more limited understanding must be given to the term ""adversely affect"". The appropriate limitation must be derived from the statutory context.

62On one view, the ordinary meaning of corrupt conduct would require a partial or dishonest exercise of an official function by a public official. However, to read the first limb of subs (2) as so limited would render it superfluous, because it would then cover precisely the same conduct as subs (1)(a). The omission of that language from subs (2) must have been deliberate, not to avoid overlap, but to allow a broader field of conduct to be identified. 

63There are two respects in which the first limb of subs (2) expands the coverage of subs (1). First, it expands the scope of pars (b), (c) and (d) of subs (1), which are restricted to the conduct of public officials and, in the case of (c) and (d), former public officials. Subsection (2) is not so limited: it applies generally to conduct of private persons and public officials.

64Secondly, the apparent purpose of subs (1)(c) and (d) is to expand the concept of dishonest or partial exercise of an official function to conduct involving a ""breach of public trust"" or ""misuse of information or material that he or she has acquired in the course of his or her official functions"". Thus, subs (2) would, on one construction of the expression ""adversely affect"", cover the conduct of a private person designed to achieve a breach of public trust by a public official, where the conduct of the private person would not fall within subs (1)(c). It could also cover the conduct of a public official who seeks to have others breach public trust or misuse information obtained in the course of their official functions. 

65No doubt there might be a serious question as to whether such conduct could also fall within the concepts of dishonesty or partiality which limit the operation of subs (1)(a) and (b), but the drafter having adopted different language one should assume it was not superfluous or otiose, but expansive of the other paragraphs.

66On this approach, the first limb of subs (2) will, first, cover the exercise of official functions in a way which may not properly be characterised as dishonest or partial; secondly, cover the activities of both private persons and public officials which would not necessarily fall within subs (1), but thirdly, impose a constraint on the term ""adversely affect"" which is consistent with the ordinary understanding of corruption affecting public authorities and public officials. This approach excludes from the scope of the Commission's functions conduct which may be unlawful but does not involve corruption or corrupt conduct because it does not compromise public administration. By contrast, a tax payer offering a benefit to a public official in order to curry favour, with the intention of avoiding an inquiry into one's actual income, would constitute a form of corruption. Thus the adverse effect on public administration arises in the latter case, but not in the former.

67Such an approach derives contextual support from the language of s 2A, set out at [52] above, identifying the principal objects of the ICAC Act. The explicit mischief to which the Act is directed is ""corruption involving or affecting public authorities and public officials"" and the detrimental effect of such corruption on ""public administration and on the community"". It is evident from this language, and the two-limbed structure of s 8(2), that the Act is not concerned with, nor does it require investigation of, all unlawful conduct which could adversely affect public administration even quite directly, such as tax evasion and revenue evasion: see s 8(2)(m) and (n).

68Senior counsel for the Commission submitted that such an approach would run foul of the principle that one not use the ordinary meaning of the defined term in order to give meaning to the definition. Further, to the extent that the scope of the definition is being approached by reference to the broad purposes of the Act, as stated in s 2A, that section merely picked up ""other parts of speech and grammatical forms of the [defined] word or expression"", which should be given ""corresponding meanings"", pursuant to s 7 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW). 

69While it may be accepted that the purpose of s 7 is to give an expanded operation to a statutory definition, it may be doubted whether ""corruption"" bears the necessary relationship to the defined term ""corrupt conduct"" to fit within the linguistic operation identified in s 7. More importantly, there is no rigid principle which requires that a statutory definition, which itself requires interpretation, should be abstracted from its statutory context, given a meaning and then reinserted in an operative provision. The Act, including any defined terms, should be read as a whole: context is often important and sometimes determinative. 

70This Court considered the use of the defined term to understand a definition in Tovir Investments Pty Ltd v Waverley Council [2014] NSWCA 379. There can be no universal rule against such an approach; in the present circumstances, the preferable approach is to have regard to both the apparent purpose expressed in the principal objects of the Act, which do not themselves use the defined term ""corrupt conduct"", and the ordinary meaning of corruption in relation to the administration of the government. 

71On that basis, the reference in s 8(2) to conduct which could ""adversely affect"" the exercise of an official function should be understood to refer to conduct which has the capacity to compromise the integrity of public administration, rather than simply, for example, adversely affect government revenue.

72There are two further factors to be noted. First, it may have been implicit in the Commission's approach that some different analysis is required with respect to perverting the course of justice. In other words, the nature of the offence may be such that any conduct having that effect will be conduct which adversely affects, or could adversely affect, the exercise of official functions by a public official. 

73If that approach were to be accepted, it would mean that, at least with respect to such conduct, the careful construction of s 8(2), involving two separate characteristics, would be otiose. The justification for reading the concept of adverse affectation differentially in this way was not articulated. It is not consistent with conventional approaches to statutory interpretation.

74How this reasoning might operate may appear more clearly after reference is made below to the concept of perverting the course of justice. However, the statutory construction may be identified briefly as follows. Interference with or deflection of a police investigation does not of itself constitute perverting the course of justice. However, where such conduct is intended, and tends, to have the effect of deflecting officials from undertaking a criminal prosecution, it may interfere with (and thus pervert) the course of criminal justice as administered by a court. 

75However, the police officer to whom the private person lies or seeks to mislead, will not be compromised in any of the senses referred to above. That officer will not be deflected from an honest and impartial exercise of his or her functions, nor inveigled into a breach of public trust, nor into misuse of information acquired in an official capacity. Thus the first characteristic identified above would not be satisfied. Nor is there any clear reason for thinking that it should be satisfied in such circumstances. The short point may be stated in somewhat incomplete terms as follows: where the conduct of an individual is unlawful within one of the paragraphs in subs (2), but that conduct does not (and does not have the capacity) to lead a public official into dishonest, partial or otherwise corrupt conduct, subs (2) will not catch the conduct. 

76Secondly, it has not been necessary for the purposes of this analysis to determine whether the concept of a ""breach of public trust"" involves something other than the dishonest or partial exercise of an official function, so as to give pars (b) and (c) different applications. It should be assumed that the drafter intended that the different language covered different conduct. In Greiner v Independent Commission Against Corruption (1992) 28 NSWLR 125 Gleeson CJ said at 135:

""Reverting to s 8(1), the two concepts involved in that provision which were regarded by the Commissioner as relevant are those of partiality, and breach of public trust. As it happens, the only form of breach of public trust relied upon was partiality and therefore, for practical purposes, it became unnecessary to explore the meaning of the expression 'breach of public trust'.""

77Mahoney JA, who took a somewhat different approach to that of Gleeson CJ and Priestley JA, did discuss to a limited extent the concept of ""breach of public trust"". After referring to some historical precedents, Mahoney JA stated at 165F:

""It is not necessary to attempt a precise definition of the term where used in s 8(1). It includes the misuse of an office or of the powers of an office in circumstances such as the present. The Commissioner concluded that Mr Greiner and Mr Moore used their position, their power and the influence it gave them to procure the preferment of Dr Metherell for the purpose of achieving for them a political advantage and, perhaps, in the case of Mr Moore, to assist a friend. This is a use of the trust confided in them for a purpose for which it was not given.""

78Broadly speaking, this reflects the concept of improper purpose in administrative law, which extends beyond the concepts of honesty and impartiality. 

(b) status of first applicant
79It is unnecessary to deal with a further ground of challenge raised by the applicants to the decision to investigate the allegation. The submission assumed that the status of the first applicant as a Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor was a factor taken into account by the Commission in determining to hold an investigation (and a public inquiry). That inference should be accepted, having regard to the description of the subject matter and nature of the inquiry stated by the Commission. 

80By characterising the status of the first applicant as ""an irrelevant consideration"", the applicants were invoking the principle that a decision-maker errs in law, and may exceed his or her jurisdiction, by taking into account a consideration which, within the statutory boundaries of the jurisdiction being exercised, is impermissible or ""forbidden"": M Aronson and M Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (5th ed, 2013, LawBook Co) at [5.30], referring to Ballantyne v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 239; (2007) 5 DDCR 97 at [113]; see also Duffy v Da Rin [2014] NSWCA 270; (2014) 312 ALR 340 at [43]. 

81Once it is found that the investigation did not fall within the statutory confines of the Commission's powers, this ground falls away. That is because those constraints which are described as irrelevant or impermissible considerations are best understood as limits on the scope of a power which has been engaged, rather than limits on the engagement of the power. Thus, where the power is unavailable, it is illogical to ask whether the Commission erred in deciding whether to exercise the power on an impermissible basis. Such an exercise of discretion is inconsistent with the absence of the power. 

(c) perverting the course of justice
82The applicants separately contended that s 8(2) was not engaged because none of the aspects of unlawful conduct identified in the second limb was satisfied. The only paragraph relied on by the Commission was (g), which refers to ""perverting the course of justice"", together (if needed) with par (y), ""any conspiracy or attempt in relation to any of the above.""

83The applicants submitted below that interfering with a police investigation at the scene of a motor accident did not constitute perverting the course of justice at a time when there were no proceedings before any court or tribunal. That proposition was said to derive from the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Einfeld [2008] NSWCCA 215; (2008) 71 NSWLR 31 (Bell JA, RS Hulme and Latham JJ) at [89]. Einfeld involved an appeal from a refusal to quash counts in an indictment involving offences under s 319 of the Crimes Act. Section 319 makes it an offence to do any act ""intending in any way to pervert the course of justice"", the offence carrying a maximum term of 14 years imprisonment. The applicant, having received a penalty notice with respect to a speeding offence, was charged with falsely making a statutory declaration that he was not the person in charge of the vehicle at the time of the offence. That constituted a contravention of traffic legislation as well, potentially, as involving an offence under Pt 7 of the Crimes Act, entitled ""Public justice offences"". 

84The Crimes Act, Pt 7, provides that ""[a] reference in this Part to perverting the course of justice is a reference to obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the course of justice or the administration of the law"": s 312. The application in Einfeld to quash the counts of the indictment alleging contraventions of s 319 turned on whether the language of s 319, read in conformity with s 312, expanded the concept of ""the course of justice"" beyond that established for the purpose of common law offences, so as to cover the exercise by any government authority of functions in applying and enforcing the law of the State, otherwise than through criminal prosecution. 

85The primary judge in Einfeld, James J, had concluded that the statutory declaration made in response to a penalty notice for a traffic offence did not constitute an attempt to pervert the course of any criminal prosecution: accordingly, the counts should have been set aside unless the common law offence was expanded by s 312. James J held that it was expanded; the Court of Criminal Appeal rejected that view. The applicants submitted that the concept of perverting the course of justice required a narrow reading in the light of a passage in the reasoning of the Court of Criminal Appeal at [89]:

""In our opinion, the scheme of Pt 7 does not suggest that Parliament intended to include police investigations within the umbrella of 'the course of justice' for the purpose of the offence of perverting the course of justice.""

86This submission takes one sentence out of context in a way which changes the meaning of the judgment, read as a whole. 

87The reasoning commenced with acceptance of the principles derived from the judgments of the High Court in The Queen v Rogerson [1992] HCA 25; (1992) 174 CLR 268 in similar terms to those set out by Mason CJ at 277-278:

""It is well established at common law and under cognate statutory provisions that the offence of attempting or conspiring to pervert the course of justice at a time when no curial proceedings are on foot can be committed. That is because action taken before curial or tribunal proceedings commence may have a tendency and be intended to frustrate or deflect the course of curial or tribunal proceedings which are imminent, probable or even possible. In other words, it is enough that an act has a tendency to frustrate or deflect a prosecution or disciplinary proceeding before a judicial tribunal which the accused contemplates may possibly be instituted, even though the possibility of instituting that prosecution or disciplinary proceeding has not been considered by the police or the relevant law enforcement agency....

Accordingly, I agree with Brennan and Toohey JJ that an act which has a tendency to deflect the police from prosecuting a criminal offence or instituting disciplinary proceedings before a judicial tribunal, or from adducing evidence of the true facts, is an act which tends to pervert the course of justice and, if done with intent to achieve that result, constitutes an attempt to pervert the course of justice and can ground the offence of conspiring to pervert the course of justice.""

88The ""course of justice"" is thus the proceeding before a court or judicial tribunal; to deflect such a proceeding even before it has been commenced may constitute perverting the course of justice. A police investigation does not itself fall within ""the course of justice"" but the effect of deflecting a police investigation may be to deflect the course of justice. In this sense, the statement from Einfeld at [89] (set out above and relied upon by the applicants) is strictly correct, although, abstracted from its context, it could be misread.

89The context in Einfeld was as follows. Part 7 of the Crimes Act was inserted by the Crimes (Public Justice) Amendment Act 1990 (NSW), Sch 1. Part 7, Div 5 abolished certain common law offences, including the offences of perverting the course of justice and attempting or conspiring to pervert the course of justice: s 341. The primary offence was replaced with s 319. The Court in Einfeld described this as effecting a government decision ""to codify the law of this State with respect to public justice offences"", at [87]; see also [65]. (It is not necessary for present purposes to consider whether Pt 7 involved ""codification"": unless all common law offences were abolished, which s 341 did not in terms purport to do, the term may be misleading.) Einfeld, therefore, was not addressing the common law offence considered in Rogerson. The question was not whether the exposition in Rogerson applied, but rather whether the scope of s 319 had been significantly expanded by the new definitional provision in s 312. The Court held that there was no such expanded operation; but there was no suggestion that the scope of the statutory offence did not extend as far as the common law offence discussed in Rogerson. The Court did not hold that deflecting a police investigation could not amount to perverting the course of justice. There was a problem in the expanded concept in s 312, as the Court identified it at [90]:

""We do not see how the expression 'the administration of the law' could be interpreted to apply to the police investigation of crime without also applying to the activities of other public officials whose functions include applying and enforcing the laws of the State.""

90The Court concluded that the expression ""the administration of the law"" in s 312 ""differs little, if at all, from the expression 'the course of justice' as explained in Rogerson"": at [99]. In the present case, it was likely apparently that the police would seek to test the third applicant, following her motor vehicle accident, to determine her blood alcohol level. On the alleged facts, subject to the investigation, her anxiety to avoid that outcome could reasonably give rise to the inference that the test might reveal a level above the prescribed minimum, so as to constitute an offence under, for example, s 112 of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW). Such a reading would be likely to result in the issue of a court attendance notice commencing proceedings for an offence. To act with intent to prevent that outcome would be to attempt to pervert the course of justice (and, if the attempt succeeded to commit the substantive offence).

91This ground of objection must fail. The primary judge was correct to dismiss this ground of challenge in the summons.

(d) power to investigate - conclusion
92On the construction of s 8 adopted above, the conduct of the applicants did not fall within the scope of s 8(2). Assuming that the advice given by the first and second applicants was acted upon by the third applicant and assuming that, as a result, the police were dissuaded from undertaking a blood alcohol reading in respect of the third applicant at the scene of the accident, it could not be said that the police officer acted otherwise than honestly and impartially in taking steps in accordance with his or her understanding of the circumstances. There was no suggested breach of public trust, in the sense of a statutory power being used for an extraneous purpose, nor any allegation of the misuse of information acquired in carrying out an official function.

Public hearing
(a) the statutory considerations
93In the light of the last conclusion it is not necessary to address the separate challenge to the decision of the Commission to hold a public inquiry under s 31 of the ICAC Act. However, it is desirable to identify the nature of the challenge raised, in the absence of available reasons for the decision, and the issues with respect to the rejection of the challenge by the primary judge.

94In earlier times it was common practice to anonymise proceedings dealing with unproven claims of misconduct against professionals, particularly lawyers and medical practitioners. The rationale behind this approach was that a professional was dependent upon his or her (usually his) reputation for integrity, which could be unjustifiably (and possibly irreparably) damaged by the dissemination of unproven allegations. A change in approach was signalled by Raybos Australia Pty Ltd v Jones (1985) 2 NSWLR 47. The new approach gave priority to principles of open justice, which should prevail except in cases where disclosure of a party's identity would undermine the proper administration of justice. Prior to that time it was commonplace to see reports under the title, for example, In re A Solicitor and the Legal Practitioners Act [1971] 2 NSWLR 113 and In re A Solicitor; Ex parte the Prothonotary (1939) 56 WN(NSW) 53.

95Similar protection was commonly provided in those days to medical practitioners in disciplinary proceedings. However, once there was an independent investigative agency responsible for considering complaints of medical misconduct, there was pressure to abandon the practice because publication of the practitioner's name was apt to bring forth further complaints which would not otherwise have been reported and investigated. No one suggests that these developments should be turned back; indeed, in the present age of instantaneous electronic communication, such a step would probably be impractical. Nor is professional reputation so jealously guarded today. On the other hand, there is a value in the privacy of investigations into unproven allegations which deserves to be considered by an investigative body with powers to undertake either private or public inquiries. Particularly is that so where the potential damage to reputation (and intrusions on personal privacy) result not from the considered assessment and reporting of an investigation but from public examination, often involving questions put in colourful terms and denials which are disregarded.

96The statutory mandate of the Commission to promote the integrity and accountability of public administration should not be diminished by too ready an adoption of implied constraints. However, the Commission itself is described in its principal object as ""an independent and accountable body"". Its accountability is primarily to the Parliament: ICAC Act, Pt 5A (through the Inspector) and Pt 7. However, what is now seen as an essential institution in maintaining public accountability of government administration must temper its use of public inquiries by a careful consideration of where the public interest referred to in s 31(1) lies. There is a risk that the function of preventing breaches of public trust may be undermined if the Commission, lacking a power to do more than make findings, form opinions and formulate recommendations for the taking of action by others, should come to see the denunciation of what it believes to be corrupt conduct through a public inquiry as necessarily an end in itself.

97Just as directors of public prosecutions in most jurisdictions publish guidelines allowing a degree of transparency with respect to prosecutorial decisions, one might expect the Commission to publish guidelines as to the circumstances in which it holds public inquiries. No such guidelines were in evidence. While no doubt the existence of guidelines might invite further applications for judicial review and remove flexibility from the statutory power of the Commissioner to make such decisions, there is a cost to be paid. If this Court considers that the decision to hold a public inquiry was capricious or arbitrary, it may require the Commission to hold its hand until further decision-making process has been undertaken.

98Absent reasons and guidelines, the applicants' challenge had to rely on the fact of the decision viewed in the context of the statement of mandatory considerations in s 31(2). The relevant parts of s 31 are as follows:

31 Public inquiries

(1) For the purposes of an investigation, the Commission may, if it is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so, conduct a public inquiry.

(2) Without limiting the factors that it may take into account in determining whether or not it is in the public interest to conduct a public inquiry, the Commission is to consider the following:

(a) the benefit of exposing to the public, and making it aware, of corrupt conduct,
(b) the seriousness of the allegation or complaint being investigated,
(c) any risk of undue prejudice to a person's reputation (including prejudice that might arise from not holding an inquiry),
(d) whether the public interest in exposing the matter is outweighed by the public interest in preserving the privacy of the persons concerned.

99Although the inquiry is to be held in public, the Commission may decide to hold part of the inquiry in private and may hear closing submissions in private: s 31(8), (9) and (10). The section is followed by a note referring back to s 17(2) which requires that a public inquiry ""shall be conducted with as little emphasis on an adversarial approach as is possible."" What is meant by ""adversarial"" in this context is not entirely clear. There is no suggestion that an inquiry undertaken by the Commission involves competing parties: rather, in practical terms, there is the Commission undertaking investigative functions on the one hand and the person whose conduct is under investigation on the other. It would be consistent with that role if the Commissioner conducting an inquiry were to insist that the evidence of a witness should be explored openly and thoroughly, with contradictory material put to the witness, but without aggressive questioning implying disbelief on the part of the questioner to the answers given.

100The first mandatory consideration must be read within the broad ambit of the ICAC Act. Thus the objects of the Act include exposing corruption and educating public authorities, public officials and members of the public about corruption and its detrimental effects on public administration and on the community: s 2A. At one level, those factors will usually militate in favour of a public inquiry. On the other hand, the Commission has power to prepare a report in relation to any matter that has been the subject of an investigation, and shall furnish reports to each House of Parliament: s 74(1) and (4). In considering whether to conduct a public inquiry, with potential adverse effects on individuals whose conduct is under investigation, consideration will be given to whether the functions of exposing, and educating about, corruption may best be served by the publicity attendant upon a report involving considered findings and recommendations.

101The second consideration, namely the seriousness of the subject matter of the investigation, has a number of facets. An allegation or complaint may be treated seriously because of its source, because of its subject matter or because of the potential consequences of the conduct complained of. In some circumstances the seriousness of the allegation may militate in favour of a public inquiry but in others, perhaps where the allegation is of very serious misconduct but of a highly contestable kind, this factor may militate against taking that step.

102So far as par (c) is concerned, the risk of ""undue prejudice"" to a person's reputation will usually arise from holding an inquiry rather than not holding one, although the latter possibility is recognised. How it will operate in a particular case is obviously a matter for discretionary judgment.

103Paragraph (d) requires what will usually be obvious, namely the need to weigh the public interest in exposing the matter, against the competing public interest of protecting the privacy and reputations of those who may be adversely affected by public exposure of their affairs.

104The factor which should have weighed heavily in the present case was that the conduct in question had two aspects. On the one hand, the public officials who may have been adversely affected in the conduct of official functions were police officers. The conduct could have led them not to take steps which might have revealed the commission of an offence, but which would not have affected in any way the honest and impartial exercise of their functions, being the primary aspect of corrupt conduct.

105The other aspect of the conduct was the concern that the first applicant, a public official directly involved in enforcement of the criminal law as a prosecutor, might, in a personal capacity, have demonstrated a willingness to undermine mechanisms for law enforcement when the interests of a close friend of a relative so invited. On one view, given what is known from the allegation, the preferable course to public exposure might have been a report with a recommendation that the Director of Public Prosecutions take whatever action was deemed appropriate in the circumstances. However, senior counsel for the Commission submitted that the Court should draw no inferences as to the scope of the evidence or the seriousness of the conduct from the mere statement of the allegation.

(b) reasonableness review
106The proper balancing of the factors, both known and unknown, was a matter for the Commission. The satisfaction of the relevant Commissioner can be reviewed on conventional administrative law grounds. The challenge mounted by the applicants with respect to the decision to hold a public inquiry relied in substance, if not in form, on the concept of ""legal unreasonableness"" where the focus of the challenge is on the outcome of the exercise of the power, rather than on the reasoning process of the decision-maker: Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v Singh [2014] FCAFC 1; (2014) 308 ALR 280 at [47] (Allsop CJ, Robertson and Mortimer JJ). That distinction was derived from a discussion of the reasons of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li [2013] HCA 18; (2013) 249 CLR 332; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMDS [2010] HCA 16; (2010) 240 CLR 611, in Singh at [44]. The process required that an inference be drawn in circumstances where it is not known how the decision was reached. The discussion in Singh at [44] continued:

""In those circumstances, the exercise of power is seen by the supervising court as lacking 'an evident and intelligible justification'. Gageler J also uses language suggestive of review for legal unreasonableness being concerned with an examination by the supervising court of the outcome of the exercise of power ....""

107In considering the standard of legal reasonableness, the Full Court noted that ""the indicia of legal unreasonableness will need to be found in the scope, subject and purpose of the particular statutory provisions in issue in any given case"": at [48].

108The Court further noted the proposition in Li at [14], in the judgment of French CJ, that a statutory provision conferring broad discretionary powers with respect to procedure do not remove any obligation to act according to law in the exercise of the statutory functions of the decision-maker, which is ""not excused from compliance with the criteria of lawfulness, fairness and rationality that lie at the heart of administrative justice albeit their content is found in the provisions of the Act and the corresponding regulations and, subject to the Act and those regulations, the common law.""

109This Court recently had occasion to consider the approach required by the decision of the High Court in Li in Arnold v Minister Administering the Water Management Act 2000 [2014] NSWCA 386 at [89]-[93]. After referring both to the joint reasons and the reasons of Gageler J in Li and noting the latter's comment that, with respect to Wednesbury unreasonableness, ""the stringency of the test remains"", Tobias AJA (Meagher and Barrett JJA agreeing) noted that ""the threshold required to be satisfied by the appellants is extremely high."" Nevertheless, that language should not be taken out of context: the test applied to the Minister's decision was ultimately to ask whether it lacked ""an evident and intelligible justification when its provisions are considered as a whole"", adopting the joint reasons in Li at [76]: see Arnold at [118].

110The applicants relied upon the so-called ""principle of legality"" to support a restrictive view of the powers of a statutory commission with investigative functions, where the exercise of the powers will infringe on the liberties, freedoms and rights of ordinary citizens. The Commission, not accepting that principle as valuable in the present context, submitted that the range of functions conferred by the legislature on the Commission was deliberately broad and carried the necessary implication that it was for the Commission, not the court, to be satisfied as to the available scope of the powers in relation to a particular factual context: see generally, the discussion in A v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2014] NSWCA 414 at [27]-[30]. That discussion will not be repeated here.

(c) reasoning of primary judge
111Whether the decision to hold a public inquiry in the present case was tainted by legal error need not be determined, given the conclusion that the conduct did not fall within the first limb of s 8(2): the inquiry may not be held, or the investigation otherwise pursued. However, it is desirable to refer to the findings of the primary judge with respect to the holding of a public inquiry.

112The primary judge noted that ""[t]he thrust of the plaintiffs' submissions is that no reasonable or rational decision-maker could form the view that the public interest in conducting a public hearing outweighed any risk of undue prejudice to their reputations"": at [112]. He further stated that a ""similar argument"" had been raised before Harrison J in A v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2014] NSWSC 1167 at [76]-[77]. That proposition was capable of misleading. The point in issue in the present case was the reasonableness of the Commission's decision to hold a public inquiry, having held a (private) compulsory examination. The issue in ""A"" was whether the Commission had acted reasonably in issuing a summons for the purpose of a private examination, a question which was remote from the considerations set out in s 31 of the Act with respect to public inquiries.

113The primary judge continued at [115]:

""A public hearing is one of a number of available methods of progressing an investigation under the Act. It would be a surprising result were the Court to hold that the investigation was within jurisdiction, but that the decision that it was in the public interest to hold a public hearing was entirely unreasonable. Presumably that would mean that the investigation would have to be conducted in secrecy, despite the fact that it involved serious allegations against, amongst others, a senior public officer. That secrecy in the conduct of the hearing would not prevent the final report being provided to Parliament and made public pursuant to s 74 of the Act.""

114On one view, there is an implicit assumption in this passage that such investigations should not be conducted ""in secrecy"" and it would be a ""surprising result"" if a decision to hold a public hearing was, in the circumstances of the case, ""entirely unreasonable."" However, as explained above, there might be very pressing reasons why the subjection of a public official to an examination in public in circumstances where no conclusions had yet been reached would speak powerfully against such a course. To refer to the possibility of a final report revealing the nature of the conduct is not a factor which counts in favour of a public hearing. The damage which can be done to a reputation, possibly rendering the continued holding of public office untenable, in circumstances where denials may later be accepted or, apparently serious conduct may be held to be a minor infraction, tend in favour of caution in exercising the power to hold a public inquiry.

115The primary judge continued:

""[116] Where allegations relating to interference with the course of justice are raised against persons, one of whom who holds senior office in the administration of justice in the State, and where the facts asserted in the allegations are such as to warrant further investigation, it cannot plausibly be said that no rational or reasonable decisionmaker could reach the view that a public hearing should not be held.

[117] It is trite to observe that most persons to be investigated by the defendant would consider that the investigation would cause 'disproportionate embarrassment and damage' to their reputation. But the discretion lies with the defendant. I am not satisfied that the plaintiffs' submissions meet the high threshold of legal irrationality necessary to make out their complaint in respect of s 31 of the Act.""

116It may be accepted that the Commission would not act under s 31 unless satisfied that the allegations were sufficient to ""warrant further investigation"". However, that is not the test: the question is whether they were sufficient to warrant the holding of a public inquiry. Further, there is a question as to whether the primary judge was correct to assume that the applicants had to meet ""the high threshold of legal irrationality"" in order to obtain relief. There is a difference between serious unreasonableness and irrationality. 

117While the applicants' complaints about the reasoning of the trial judge were not unfounded, it was by no means clear that, on the limited evidence before him, he was wrong to reject the challenge to the decision to hold an inquiry.

Request for reasons
118Again, it is not necessary to determine the applicants' challenge to the refusal of the trial judge to order the Commission to supply reasons for its decisions. Part 59 of the UCPR deals with ""judicial review proceedings"". Rule 59.9 is in the following terms:

59.9 Special procedure where public authority is defendant

(1) This rule applies to proceedings for judicial review in which relief is sought in relation to a decision of a public authority.

(2) The plaintiff may, within 21 days of commencing proceedings against a public authority or within such other time as the court may direct, serve on the public authority a notice requiring the public authority to provide to the plaintiff:

(a) a copy of the decision, and
(b) a statement of reasons for the decision.

(3) A statement of reasons for the decision must:

(a) set out findings on material questions of fact, and
(b) refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based, and
(c) explain why the decision was made.

(4) If:

(a) the public authority does not comply with a notice under this rule within 14 days of service, or
(b) the plaintiff has not served a notice within the time prescribed by subrule (2),

the plaintiff may apply to the court for an order that the public authority provide the plaintiff with a copy of the decision and a statement of reasons for the decision.

119The primary judge noted a submission that this was a relatively new provision ""introduced on 15 March 2013"": at [17]. That was correct only in the sense that Pt 59 itself commenced on that date. The procedural power to require reasons commenced with Practice Note No 119: see (2001) 50 NSWLR 660. 

120In the course of the hearing before the primary judge, the Commission resisted any obligation to give reasons, relying on the terms of s 111 dealing with ""secrecy"". The key aspects of that provision are as follows:

111 Secrecy

(1) This section applies to:

(a) a person who is or was an officer of the Commission, and
...

(2) A person to whom this section applies shall not, directly or indirectly, except for the purposes of this Act or otherwise in connection with the exercise of the person's functions under this Act:

(a) make a record of any information, or
(b) divulge or communicate to any person any information,

being information acquired by the person by reason of, or in the course of, the exercise of the person's functions under this Act.

Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 12 months, or both.

(3) A person to whom this section applies shall not be required:

(a) to produce in any court any document or other thing that has come into the person's possession, custody or control by reason of, or in the course of, the exercise of the person's functions under this Act, or
(b) to divulge or communicate to any court any matter or thing that has come to the person's notice in the exercise of the person's functions under this Act,

121Subsection 111(2) requires that an officer of the Commission not divulge or communicate to any person any information acquired by reason of or in the course of exercising functions under the ICAC Act. Because of the express terms of subs (3), that obligation should not be understood to preclude communication to a court. Subsection (3) states that an officer of the Commission shall not be required to divulge or communicate relevant matters to any court. However, neither provision prevents a voluntary disclosure by an officer, no doubt in the exercise of his or her functions under the ICAC Act, by means of a statement of reasons. 

122The primary judge noted that on 4 November 2014 the Commission produced reasons for the decisions, in apparent compliance with the notice served upon it. Although the applicants insisted and the Commission accepted that the reasons supplied did not comply with r 59.9, the application sought, in substance, further and more complete reasons, but without the applicants' revealing what had been provided. This was an unsatisfactory basis to pursue an application under r 59.9(4), which empowers the court to direct that a public authority provide a statement of reasons where there has been non-compliance with a notice. Identification of the defects in the reasons supplied would no doubt have allowed a focused identification of the interrelationship of s 111 and r 59.9. In any event the issue need not be addressed further.

Conclusions
123The applicants are entitled to the relief sought in the summons, to the extent of a declaration that the Commission had no authority to investigate the matter identified in the summons by reference to the general scope and purpose of the proposed public inquiry and the nature of the allegation or complaint being investigated.

124The Court should make the following orders:

(1) Grant the applicants leave to appeal from the orders made in the Common Law Division on 10 November 2014.

(2) Direct the applicants to file within seven days the draft notice of appeal contained in the white folder.

(3) Set aside the orders made in the Common Law Division dismissing the applicants' summons and reserving costs.

(4) Declare that the Commission has no power to investigate the allegation involving the applicants identified in the summons issued to the applicants dated 27 October 2014.

(5) Grant the parties leave to file within 14 days any application for an order as to costs, in the absence of which, the respondent is to pay the applicants' costs in this Court and in the Common Law Division.

125WARD JA: By summons filed 11 November 2015, the applicants have sought leave to appeal from a decision by Hoeben CJ at CL (Cunneen v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2014] NSWSC 1571) refusing to grant the declaratory and other relief sought by them in relation to the following decisions made by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC): first, the decision to conduct an investigation into certain allegations made against the applicants and, second, the decision to hold a public inquiry into those allegations. The applicants also complain as to his Honour's refusal to order ICAC to provide them with a statement of reasons for the respective decisions pursuant to r 59.9(4) of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (UCPR). The application for leave to appeal was listed to be heard concurrently with the appeal.

Background

126In or about July 2014, the first applicant, Ms Cunneen SC, was summoned by ICAC pursuant to s 35 of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW) (ICAC Act) to appear and give evidence at a compulsory examination on 14 August 2014. Such examinations are required to be held in private (s 30(5)). The summons notified Ms Cunneen that the compulsory private hearing was for the purposes of an investigation into two allegations, the only relevant allegation now being that:

Margaret Cunneen SC on 31 May 2014, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, counselled Sophia Tilley [the third applicant in the present proceedings] to fake chest pains and that Sophia Tilley, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, did fake chest pains to prevent investigating police officers from obtaining evidence of Tilley's blood alcohol level at the scene of a motor vehicle accident.

127Ms Cunneen is a deputy senior Crown prosecutor. Ms Tilley (the third applicant in these proceedings) is the de facto partner of Ms Cunneen's son, Stephen Wyllie (the second applicant in these proceedings).

128The applicants' solicitor, Mr Cockburn, has deposed that he appeared, with ICAC's leave, at the private hearing and compulsory examination on 1 August 2014, presumably there intending to refer to 14 August 2014. Nothing is before the Court as to what transpired on that occasion.

129Subsequently, by letters dated 29 October 2014, each of the applicants was served with a summons by ICAC to appear before it to give evidence at a public inquiry to be conducted on 10 November 2014. The summons served on Ms Cunneen (which was substantially in the form of that served on the other applicants) stated that the public inquiry was being conducted for the purposes of an investigation of an allegation or complaint of the following nature:

That on 31 May 2014 Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen SC and Stephen Wyllie, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, counselled Sophia Tilley to pretend to have chest pains, and that Sophia Tilley, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, did pretend to have chest pains, to prevent investigating police officers from obtaining evidence of Ms Tilley's blood alcohol level at the scene of a motor vehicle accident.

130This summons, unlike the earlier summons, made specific reference to Ms Cunneen's position as deputy senior Crown prosecutor. 

131The applicants then commenced proceedings by summons dated 4 November 2014 in the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court, seeking declaratory and other relief pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). The relief sought included urgent injunctive relief restraining ICAC from continuing to investigate, and conducting a public inquiry into, the said allegations.

132In connection with that application, the applicants' solicitor served on ICAC a notice to produce documents requiring production of any complaint made to ICAC and documents relating to the decisions to investigate and to conduct a public hearing. (No call was ultimately made on that notice to produce.) At the same time, a notice to public authority was served on ICAC pursuant to r 59.9 of the UCPR requiring ICAC to provide the applicants with a copy of each of the respective decisions and a statement of reasons for each of the decisions.

133The notice to public authority also set out the requirements under r 59.9(3) as to the contents of a statement of reasons for decision, those being that the statement must: set out findings on material questions of fact; refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based; and explain why the decision was made.

134ICAC declined to comply with the r 59.9 notice. No point was taken as to the temporal aspects of r 59.9, it being accepted that the matter was to be dealt with as a matter of urgency having regard to the scheduled date for the commencement of the public inquiry. 

135On 5 November 2014, Hoeben CJ at CL heard as a preliminary issue an application by the applicants for an order pursuant to r 59.9(4)(a) UCPR that ICAC provide a statement of reasons for the decisions in question. His Honour refused that application. Following a hearing on 6 November 2014 as to the substantive application, his Honour dismissed the applicants' summons.

Primary judgment

Ruling as to r 59.9 notice

136In arguing against the order sought by the applicants for the provision of reasons, ICAC invoked the secrecy provisions contained in s 111 of the ICAC Act. Its contention was that an order for provision of a copy of the decisions would offend s 111(3)(a) of the ICAC Act and that an order for provision of a Statement of Reasons would offend s 111(3)(b).

137Section 111(3) of the ICAC Act provides that:

(3) A person to whom this section applies shall not be required:

(a) to produce in any court any document or other thing that has come into the person's possession, custody or control by reason of, or in the course of, the exercise of the person's functions under this Act, or

(b) to divulge or communicate to any court any matter or thing that has come to the person's notice in the exercise of the person's functions under this Act,

except for the purposes of a prosecution or disciplinary proceedings instituted as a result of an investigation conducted by the Commission in the exercise of its functions.

138Included in the persons to whom s 111(3) in its terms applies is a person who was or is an officer of the Commission (s 111(1)(a)). ""Officer of the Commission"" is defined in s 3 as including, inter alia, both a member of staff of the Commission and a person engaged by the Commission under s 104B to provide services, information or advice.

139Section 111(4) permits the disclosure of such information in a number of circumstances, one being where it is in accordance with a direction of the Commissioner if the Commissioner certifies that it is necessary to do so in the public interest.

140His Honour accepted (at [32]) that r 59.9 is a form of subordinate legislation directed to the power of the Court generally and that the Court should have regard to the provisions of s 111 of the ICAC Act when determining whether to make an order pursuant to r 59.9 in a case such as this.

141His Honour referred to the first instance decisions in A v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2014] NSWSC 1167 (at [15]) and Hagan v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2001] NSWSC 890 (at [18]-[20]), in both of which it had been held that a person answering a notice to produce addressed to ICAC was a person to whom the secrecy provisions in s 111(3) applied. His Honour followed those decisions and concluded that s 111 applied to notices to produce or other compulsory processes such as a notice under r 59.9 UCPR directed to ICAC ([33]).

142His Honour took into account the practical effect of the prohibitions in s 111(3) on the efficacy of any order which the Court might make, concluding that if orders of the kind sought by the applicants were to be made, ICAC would not be obliged to comply with them and hence that such orders would be ineffective ([35]-[36]). The applicants maintain that this, in effect, wrongly puts ICAC above the Court.

143His Honour also had regard to various matters as affecting the exercise of the discretion of the Court, namely that: ICAC's Counsel had said that it would not comply with such an order ([37]); the investigation was at its earliest stage and therefore that it might well be that the refusal of ICAC to provide a statement of reasons was because to do so would be prejudicial to the conduct of the investigation as it would require the premature disclosure of material ([38]); there is no general duty at common law to give reasons for administrative decisions ([39], citing Public Service Board of NSW v Osmond [1986] HCA 7; (1986) 159 CLR 656); and that any argument as to prejudice to the investigation would not exist once ICAC had concluded the investigation by completing a report at which stage an application for judicial review could be sought on the basis that the investigation was never within jurisdiction and/or that no public hearing should have been held ([40]). As to the last point, his Honour acknowledged that an application for judicial review after a report had been completed would not be entirely satisfactory since reputational damage would already have occurred, but referred to authority in which it was recognised that a positive finding and quashing of a report could still be of considerable value ([40], citing Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10; (1992) 175 CLR 564).

144As an addendum to his earlier observations, his Honour noted (at [42]) that at 5pm on 5 November 2014 (i.e., after the application for the r 59.9 order had been heard), ICAC had provided a two page letter to the applicants which his Honour described as providing reasons ""for its decisions or decision"". His Honour was there referring to what he had been told about the letter since the applicants had objected to its tender and it was not admitted into evidence. The letter was therefore not before his Honour nor was it before this Court. 

145It appears from the transcript of the proceedings before his Honour on 6 November 2014 that ICAC's Senior Counsel, Dr Kirk SC, described the letter as ""dealing with reasons relating to the decision to conduct a public inquiry involving [the applicants]"" (T 28.35). Dr Kirk fairly conceded that his Honour would be likely to reject the tender for the reasons that had led to a similar ruling in Haque v Commissioner of Corrective Services [2008] NSWSC 253; (2008) 216 FLR 271. 

146At the hearing before this Court, Dr Kirk accepted that the Court could proceed on the basis that the letter related only to the decision to conduct a public inquiry and indicated that it was not a complete statement of reasons of the kind required under r 59.9(3) UCPR. (Hence the submission by ICAC on this appeal, to the effect that even if the discretion were to be re-exercised no order for reasons should be made because reasons had already been provided, even if accepted would not address the whole of the applicants' complaint as to the non-provision of a statement of reasons, there being no suggestion that any reasons for the first decision had been provided.)

Dismissal of applicants' summons

147As to the substantive relief sought by the applicants, his Honour rejected a submission that the failure by ICAC to provide reasons for its decision to conduct an investigation meant that it was acting beyond power in proceeding to conduct the investigation ([45], [47]) and concluded that nothing had been put by the applicants to suggest that (assuming there was jurisdiction to conduct the investigation) the decision to do was so irrational and illogical as to be beyond the jurisdiction of ICAC ([48]).

148At [59], his Honour rejected the construction of s 8(2) for which the applicants contended (and still contend), namely that, in order to constitute ""corrupt conduct"", the conduct must satisfy each of two separate criteria and that those criteria should not be conflated. His Honour was also not persuaded that the principle of legality would apply to read down the grant of jurisdiction to ICAC ([67]). At [69], his Honour said: 

""By reference to [the guidance given by Gageler and Keane JJ in Lee (No 1) v NSW Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39, (2013) 87 ALJR 1127 at [313]-[314]], I am of the opinion that the same conduct can satisfy both tests for the purposes of the application of s 8(2). The conduct does not have to be separate and distinct, nor for that matter should the conduct necessary to meet the first test be regarded as more important than that required to meet the second test, if in fact the conduct is different. As appears from s 8(2) it is fundamental to the defendant's role that it investigate criminal offences.""

149As to other matters raised by the applicants, his Honour rejected the submission that ICAC had taken into account an irrelevant consideration when having regard (as it was apparent from the terms of the summons it had done) to the status of Ms Cunneen as someone holding a senior office with the Director of Public Prosecutions ([73]) and rejected the applicants' submission that the conduct alleged against them failed to satisfy the second limb of s 8(2) because it could not possibly amount to any of the matters set out in s 8(2)(a)-(y) ([83]).

150As to the decision to hold a public inquiry, his Honour accepted that the relevant jurisdictional fact was ICAC's state of satisfaction that it was in the public interest to do so ([104]). His Honour was not satisfied that the applicants had met what he referred to as the high threshold of legal irrationality necessary to make out this complaint ([117]).

Leave to appeal

151Leave to appeal is required pursuant to s 101(2)(r) of the Supreme Court Act. ICAC did not oppose the grant of leave to appeal. As the appeal is one that clearly raises important issues of principle, this Court, at the commencement of the concurrent hearing of the application for leave, granted leave to appeal and the matter proceeded on that basis.

Grounds of appeal

152The draft notice of appeal raises 16 grounds of appeal, which I propose to deal with in three groups: first, as to the refusal of his Honour to order the provision of a statement of reasons (grounds 1-7); second, as to the proper construction of s 8(2) of the ICAC Act and whether the conduct alleged on the part of each of the applicants fell within the definition of ""corrupt conduct"" for the purposes of s 8(2) (grounds 8-13); and, third, as to the decision of ICAC to conduct a public inquiry into the allegations made against the applicants (grounds 14-16).

153Insofar as the refusal to make a r 59.9 order was dealt with by his Honour as a matter of discretion, ICAC has served a draft notice of contention seeking to uphold that decision on the basis that the Court had no power to make the order sought by the applicants. 

Grounds 1-7 - refusal to make an order under r 59.9(4) UCPR

154In essence, the applicants contend that his Honour erred in his construction of s 111 of the ICAC Act, and that the two first instance decisions to which his Honour referred (Hagan and A v ICAC) were wrongly decided in this regard. The applicants argue that s 111(3) is not to be construed as applying to individuals acting on behalf of ICAC when producing documents under the rules of the court. They emphasise the distinction between an individual carrying out a function on behalf of ICAC and ICAC itself as a separate corporate entity.

155Alternatively, the applicants argue that if s 111 does have the operation for which ICAC contends (which they maintain involves impermissibly reading words into s 111(1)) then it is constitutionally invalid on the basis that it impermissibly curtails the Supreme Court's ability to determine the extent to which ICAC committed jurisdictional error in making the impugned decisions and offends the institutional integrity of the court.

156The same arguments were considered by this Court in A v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2014] NSWCA 414. For the reasons there given, grounds 3-5 of the applicants' notice of appeal are not made out.

157That said, I see a distinction between the situation that was before this Court in A v ICAC and that in the present case. Here, the applicants sought an order for the provision by ICAC of a statement of reasons. At least insofar as this would involve the preparation of a new document created for the purposes of compliance with a court order, in my opinion it would not be something that came into the possession of the relevant person for the purpose of exercising a function under the ICAC Act per se. Therefore, I consider that there is force to the submission by the applicants that a statement of reasons produced in compliance with a Court order is not (or at least not necessarily) a document falling within s 111(3). Nevertheless to the extent that the statement of reasons sought in the present case was one that required the disclosure of documents or material otherwise caught by s 111(3) the difficulty considered in A v ICAC remains.

158ICAC argued that the Court would not make an order that would, in effect, require or direct the Commissioner to make a certification under s 111(4)(c) of the kind that would be necessary to permit disclosure by an officer of ICAC of information otherwise prohibited to be disclosed, as this would amount in effect to an impermissible merits review of the decision not to comply with the r 59.9 notice. However, that does not address the possibility that an order made under r 59.9(3) could be tailored so as not to infringe upon the secrecy provisions of the ICAC Act, including dispensing with some of the requirements as to the content for a statement of reasons under that rule. 

159In any event, that issue does not arise in the present case, since there was no application by the applicants for a more limited r 59.9 statement of reasons.

160As to the other challenges made by the applicants to the exercise of his Honour's discretion, I am not persuaded that the applicants have pointed to anything that discloses error in the House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 sense that would warrant appellate intervention. 

161His Honour's reference to the investigation being at the ""earliest"" or ""very early"" stage may or may not be factually correct. This Court has no knowledge of what has occurred in relation to the investigation since July 2014 other than that Ms Cunneen's lawyer attended before the Commission on the day scheduled for the compulsory examination. However, the comment made by his Honour as to the stage of the investigation was in the context that there might well be the potential for the disclosure of material sought by the applicants to be prejudicial to the conduct of the investigation. The possibility of such prejudice was expressly adverted to in National Companies and Securities Commission v News Corp Ltd [1984] HCA 29; (1984) 156 CLR 296 at 323-324 and is a matter of common sense. There was no error in contemplating such a possibility in the present case. 

162The applicants further contend that his Honour erred in taking into account (or placing as much weight as he did on) the proposition that any prejudice to the investigation would not exist once the investigation was complete. They contend that his Honour did not properly consider the corollary to this observation, including such matters as the significant reputational damage that individuals may suffer (and which may not be compensable) and the removal of fundamental rights such as the right to silence as a consequence of the relevant decisions (see [6.17] of the applicants' submissions). The lack of prejudice to an investigation by disclosure of reasons once the investigation is complete follows logically from the premise that the investigation is complete, so there can have been no error in taking that into account. What seems to be challenged by the applicants in this regard is whether his Honour erred in balancing the potential prejudice to the investigation with the potential prejudice to the persons being investigated. His Honour's reasons reveal that his Honour did take into account the reputational damage to the applicants as one of the factors affecting the exercise of his discretion to make an order under r 59.9. 

163I am not persuaded that his Honour has been shown to have erred in the exercise of his discretion not to order the provision of a statement of reasons. Even if his Honour had been shown to have been in error in refusing to make the order sought, I agree with the submission by ICAC that this would not support the relief claimed by the applicants as to the invalidity of the impugned decisions.

164Grounds 1-7 of the appeal have not been made out. It is therefore not necessary to consider ICAC's notice of contention.

Grounds 8-13 - s 8(2) of the ICAC Act

Meaning of ""corrupt conduct"" in ss 8(1)(a) and (2)

165Basten JA has set out in his reasons the relevant provisions of the ICAC Act and I do not propose to repeat them here.

166Relevantly, ICAC is empowered to conduct a compulsory examination (s 30) or a public inquiry (s 31) for the purposes of an investigation if it is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so. When considering whether it is in the public interest to conduct a public inquiry, ICAC must consider the four matters set out in s 31(2). If the conduct the subject of the proposed examination or inquiry does not fall within the definition of ""corrupt conduct"" then ICAC could not investigate the conduct. 

167Here, the summons issued pursuant to s 35 makes clear that the general scope and purpose of the public inquiry was to gather evidence relevant to the matters being investigated for the purpose of determining the matters referred to in s 13(2) of the ICAC Act. Those matters include whether any corrupt conduct (or conduct liable to allow, encourage or cause the occurrence of, or connected with, corrupt conduct) has occurred, is occurring or is about to occur (s 13(2)(a)). 

168""Corrupt conduct"" is defined in s 7(1) as being any conduct which falls within the description of corrupt conduct in either or both of ss 8(1) and (2) but which is not excluded by s 9; and as including conduct comprising a conspiracy or attempt to commit or engage in conduct that would be corrupt conduct under s 8(1) or s 8(2) (s 7(2)). It is clear from the definition, therefore, that the legislature contemplated that the same conduct might fall within both ss 8(1) and (2).

169It was not contended in the present case that the alleged conduct fell within the definition of ""corrupt conduct"" in s 8(1). The critical question was whether it fell within the definition in s 8(2). 

Proper construction of s 8(2) 

170The applicants contend, as they did before the primary judge, that it is not sufficient that there be an allegation of conduct that could involve one of the matters listed in s 8(2)(a)-(y), such as an allegation of an attempt to pervert the course of justice. Rather, they contend that there must also be an allegation of conduct that satisfies the first ""limb"" in s 8(2) and that these should not be conflated. The applicants contend that conduct that adversely affects or could adversely affect the exercise of official functions by a public official within the meaning of the first limb in s 8(2) is conduct that goes beyond what would ""ordinarily"" be involved in the crime of perverting or attempting to pervert the course of justice. Emphasis is placed on the policy and purpose of the ICAC Act, being the investigation of corruption; not of crime generally.

171In my opinion a textual analysis of s 8(2) supports the conclusion that conduct is not corrupt conduct within the meaning of that section unless it satisfies both of the criteria there set out and, in relation to the first criterion, that it has at least the potential adversely to affect the exercise of official functions in the sense of corrupting the exercise of those functions having regard to the concept of corruption on which the ICAC Act focuses. This is necessary to give a meaningful operation to the adverb ""adversely"" in the first limb of s 8(2).

172Before turning to what meaning is imported by the use of that adverb, I note the following features of the sub-section (which were considered in the course of submissions at the hearing and have been developed in Basten JA's reasons).

173First, the word ""also"" in the opening words of s 8(2) suggests that this subsection is introducing into the concept of corrupt conduct some conduct that is at least additional to and perhaps wider than the conduct defined in s 8(1). (The applicants maintain that s 8(2) does not widen the scope of s 8(1) but, rather, that the word ""also"" simply means that s 8(2) is introducing another variation of corrupt conduct.) 

174It is clear from s 7(1) that the legislature contemplated that conduct might fall within both s 8(1) and s 8(2), so the latter provision may not necessarily have been intended to have a wider operation than the former. Nevertheless, some extension of the concept of corrupt conduct beyond that in s 8(1) can be found in the two respects noted by Basten JA (namely that the conduct in s 8(2) is not limited to that of a public official or former official and that it may encompass conduct referred to in s 8(1)(c) and (d) in relation to breach of public trust or misuse of information).

175Second, while the first part of the definition in s 8(2) broadly mirrors the definition of corrupt conduct in s 8(1)(a), it omits the adjectives (""honest or impartial"") that in s 8(1) qualify the words ""the exercise of official functions by any public official ..."". This must mean that it encompasses conduct that could adversely affect, either directly or indirectly, the exercise of official functions by any public official, whether or not what is potentially so affected is the honesty or impartiality of the official in the exercise of those functions. This suggests that the subjective intention of the official is not necessarily relevant when considering the definition of corrupt conduct in s 8(2).

176Third, the phrase introduced by the conjunction ""and"" makes it clear that in order to fall within the definition of corrupt conduct in s 8(2) there must be conduct that satisfies both the first part of the definition (i.e., conduct ""that adversely affects or could adversely affect either directly or indirectly the exercise of official functions by any public official ..."") and the second part of the definition (i.e., conduct which could involve any of the matters thereafter listed). (The relevant matters for the purposes of the present case are those listed in s 8(2)(g) - perverting the course of justice - and s 8(2)(y) - any conspiracy or attempt in relation to any of the above.) There is nothing to suggest that the same conduct, whether the same or different elements of that conduct, could not satisfy both aspects of the definition.

177Fourth, in both s 8(1)(a) and the first part of the definition in s 8(2) what is required is not necessarily that the conduct have an actual adverse effect on the exercise of the relevant official functions. It is sufficient that there be the potential for the exercise of those functions to be adversely affected. 

Meaning of ""adversely affect""

178That brings me to the meaning to be attributed to the adverb ""adversely"" for the purposes of s 8(2). What is required (whether in terms of actual or potential effect) is that the conduct have an adverse effect on the exercise of the relevant official functions. 

179It is not sufficient for the purposes of s 8(2) (or for that matter s 8(1)(a)) that the exercise (or in s 8(1)(a) the honest or impartial exercise) of official functions by a public official has been or could be affected in some way by the alleged conduct which is to be the subject of the investigation. The requirement is that the conduct in question have at least a potential adverse effect on the exercise (whether honestly and impartially, or otherwise) of those functions.

180Whether ""adversely"" permits or requires a consideration of the actual or potential outcome or result of the exercise of the relevant public official's functions or simply of the manner of exercise of the relevant official functions is not altogether clear. What is clear is that the adverse (or potential adverse) effect must be on the exercise of those functions. It may be that such an effect can be discerned by reference to the potential or actual manner or outcome of the exercise of those functions but something more is required than that the conduct has the potential to cause a public official to exercise his or her functions differently than he or she might otherwise have done but for the conduct.

181The applicants point to the principal objects of ICAC (set out in s 2A of the ICAC Act), which focus on the (undefined) concept of ""corruption"", and to the statutory direction for ICAC, as far as practicable, to direct its attention to serious corrupt conduct and systemic corrupt conduct (in s 12A of the Act).

182ICAC contends that the word ""adversely"" in s 8(2) refers to conduct that affects (in the sense of directs, changes or has a consequence on) the exercise of official functions in a way that ""has an adverse consequence"" in the sense that (though not necessarily being conduct that is unlawful, criminal or amounts to misfeasance in public office), it diverts the decision-making function in a way that is adverse to the course of public administration. ICAC's submission, in short, is that ""adversely"" connotes a diversion to the course of public administration which can reasonably be seen as adverse.

183ICAC argues that the word ""adversely"" introduces a subjective and inherently evaluative element as to which it is for ICAC to form the relevant opinion. ICAC accepts that in reaching that opinion it must act honestly and reasonably.

184The applicants submit that ICAC's construction of s 8(2) would expand ICAC's powers beyond the scope contemplated in the second reading speech made by the then premier in relation to the legislation (Hansard Legislative Assembly, 26 May 1988, 672-685, by Premier Greiner, at 674-675) and would leave both the word ""and"" and the first limb of s 8(2) with no work to do. 

185ICAC submits that conduct that involves perverting the course of justice or attempting to pervert the course of justice will almost invariably satisfy both characteristics in s 8(2). If so, then there is force to the applicants' contention that the first limb of s 8(2) will have no work to do in that context. ICAC submits that the focus of s 8(1) is on the exercise of official functions but that the focus on s 8(2) is on the ""other side of the equation"", namely serious or criminal conduct being conduct that must at least have a potential ""adverse"" effect on the public administration of justice. In the course of argument, Dr Kirk accepted that if there were conduct that involved, say, an attempt to pervert the course of justice but it was conduct that (because of its misguided nature or manner of exercise or otherwise) would inevitably fail, then the first criterion in s 8(2) would not be satisfied. 

186The adverb ""adversely"" in the first limb of s 8(2) should be construed having regard to the scope and purpose of the ICAC legislation (see Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union [2004] HCA 40; (2004) 221 CLR 309 at [23] per Gleeson CJ and at [182] per Kirby J in dissent). 

187The focus of the ICAC Act is on corruption in the public sector. 

188What is required by the first part of the definition, in my opinion, is that the conduct the subject of the relevant allegation be conduct that has at least the potential to affect the exercise of the relevant public official's functions in a manner adverse to the public administration of justice in the sense of diverting the proper exercise of those functions. 

189Conduct which could have a potential effect on the exercise of official functions in the sense that it might cause a different decision to be made or the functions to be exercised in a different manner but which does not have the potential to cause any ""corruption"" in the exercise by the public official of his or her functions, or which could have no adverse outcome when viewed from a public corruption perspective, is not conduct that could ""adversely"" affect the proper exercise of official functions in the relevant sense.

190In other words, if there is conduct which, though it might involve an attempt to pervert the course of justice, could not have the potential ""adversely"" to affect the exercise of official functions in the sense of diverting the proper exercise of those functions, such conduct would not in my opinion fall within the definition in s 8(2).

Application of that construction in the present case

191ICAC points out that driving in excess of relevant blood alcohol levels is an offence pursuant to s 110 of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW); and notes that the allegation the subject of investigation refers to investigating police officers seeking to obtain evidence. It submits that where a potential offence is at stake, and an act is done or counselled or procured with an intent to impede the gathering of evidence in relation to that potential offence, then this is not only conduct falling within the concept of perverting or attempting to pervert the course of justice but is also conduct that could have a harmful effect on the public administration of justice.

192In the present case, the allegation the subject of investigation is one that focuses on an attempt to pervert the course of justice. 

193I agree with Basten JA's conclusion (at [92]), for the reasons that his Honour there gives, that the conduct the subject of the allegation described in the s 35 summons is not conduct that could adversely affect the exercise of official functions by the investigating police officers at the scene of the motor vehicle accident. Therefore, the alleged conduct does not fall within the definition of corrupt conduct s 8(2) and ICAC does not have jurisdiction to conduct the investigation.

194Accordingly, ground 13 of the grounds of appeal is made out and the appeal must be allowed.

195It is not necessary in light of that conclusion to consider the contention of the applicants that the alleged conduct would not satisfy the second limb of s 8(2). Had it been necessary to determine, I would have concluded that the alleged conduct could involve an attempt to pervert the course of justice as that offence is explained in The Queen v Rogerson [1992] HCA 25; (1992) 174 CLR 268 at 283-284. There, Brennan and Toohey JJ held that while the ""course of justice"" only commences when the jurisdiction of a court or some other judicial authority is invoked, misleading police in the course of their investigations into crime can amount to an attempt to pervert the course of justice. I agree with Basten JA that the primary judge did not err in rejecting this contention of the applicants. 

Grounds 14-16 - decision to conduct public inquiry pursuant to s 31 of the ICAC Act

196Grounds 14-16 relate to the decision to hold a public inquiry. It is contended that his Honour erred in finding that there had been no jurisdictional error in relation to that decision.

197The first basis on which the applicants maintain that the decision to hold a public hearing was not authorised by the ICAC Act and was beyond the power conferred by s 31 is that the investigation itself was not authorised. For the reasons set out above, I agree with that contention. 

198It is not therefore necessary to consider whether, as the applicants also contend, the decision was beyond power because of the absence of the existence of a jurisdictional fact (that being identified by them as whether ICAC considered the matters it was required to by s 31(2)) or because ICAC took into account an irrelevant consideration in the decision to conduct a public inquiry, namely, Ms Cunneen's public role as deputy senior Crown prosecutor.

199As to the first of those matters, the applicants accept that it may be inferred from the contents of the summons that the Commissioner had regard to the matters mandated by s 31(2)(a) and (b) (i.e., the benefit of exposure to the public, and making it aware, of corrupt conduct and the seriousness of the allegation or complaint) but submit that there is nothing to indicate that regard was had to the mandatory considerations in s 31(2)(c) and (d) (i.e., any risk of undue prejudice to a person's reputation and whether the public interest in exposing the matter is outweighed by the public interest in preserving the privacy of the persons concerned).

200The applicants contend that, having regard to: the nature of the allegations made against them; the nature of the conduct alleged against them; and the disproportionate embarrassment and damage to their reputations that the conduct of a public inquiry is likely to occasion, even assuming ICAC did take into account the factors mandated by s 31(2)(c) and (d), it could not rationally and logically have reached the necessary state of satisfaction. They emphasise that the reputational damage likely to attend the holding of a public inquiry (particularly given the first applicant's public role) as a factor that is so great that the decision to hold a public inquiry lacks an evident and intelligible justification. (Pausing there, this submission in itself demonstrates why the first applicant's public role could not have been an irrelevant consideration.)

201The primary judge's reasoning on this issue has been summarised by Basten JA (at [112]-[113]). The applicants maintain that his Honour erred in proceeding on the basis that they had to meet a high threshold of legal irrationality and they call in aid the analysis in Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v Singh [2014] FCAFC 1; 308 ALR 280, to which Basten JA has referred. 

202As to the question whether the Commissioner could reasonably have been satisfied that the allegations were sufficient, if proper regard were had to the mandatory requirements of s 31(2) of the ICAC Act, to warrant the holding of a public inquiry, I have been troubled. I accept that what was alleged against the applicants was conduct that could amount to the offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice. It was conduct that was alleged to have been committed in the respective applicants' private capacities. 

203The first applicant's public role was in my opinion a relevant consideration to be taken into account in assessing the risk of undue reputational prejudice to the first applicant by the holding of a public inquiry and in assessing whether the public interest in exposing the matter was outweighed by the public interest in preserving the privacy of the persons concerned.

204Dr Kirk emphasised that what is to be assessed there is the risk of ""undue"" reputational prejudice and that this Court does not know anything about what has transpired in the investigation to date and as to the scope of the proposed public inquiry. If, for example, the three applicants had already been examined in a private hearing and no further witnesses were to be called at the public inquiry then one might readily conclude that the factors in s 31(2) would weigh against a public inquiry, since the benefit of exposing matters to the public could presumably be equally achieved by publishing a report without the need for a public inquiry. However, as Dr Kirk was instructed to confirm to the Court, ICAC's position is that this Court cannot draw any inference from the evidence before it as to the scope of the proposed public inquiry. Nor can any inference be drawn as to what preceded the decision to conduct a public inquiry.

205The likelihood of reputational damage to the first applicant must be high, given her public role. There seems to be no obvious prejudice that might arise, in terms of reputational damage to the applicants, from the matter proceeding not by way of public inquiry but instead by way of compulsory examination. One might expect that the public interest in exposing any corrupt conduct that were found to have been established following an investigation of the allegations would be able to be met by the publication of a report as to the outcome of the investigation following a private compulsory examination of the relevant witnesses. Mr Moses SC argues that there is no public interest in holding a ""show trial"". 

206Nevertheless, without knowing what, if anything, transpired at the compulsory examination on 14 August 2014 and what other steps may have been taken to investigate the allegations, I am not satisfied that the applicants have established that the decision to hold a public inquiry could not reasonably have been justified had each of the mandatory factors been properly considered by the Commissioner and hence I am not satisfied that the decision must be taken to have been unreasonable or made without proper consideration of the mandatory factors. Hence, I would not have found that his Honour erred in rejecting the challenge to the decision to hold a public inquiry.

Relief

207By way of relief, the applicants' draft summons sought not only to set aside the orders made by his Honour but, inter alia, the following declarations and orders:

(3) A declaration that the respondent is exceeding its jurisdiction in conducting an investigation under the Independent Commission Again Corruption Act 1988 (ICAC Act) into the allegations that, on 31 May 2014, the first and second appellants, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, counselled the third appellant to pretend to have chest pain, and that the third appellant, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, did pretend to have chest pains, to prevent investigating police officers from obtaining evidence to the third appellant's blood alcohol level at the scene of a motor vehicle accident"" (Allegations).

(4) A declaration that the decision of the respondent made under section 31 of the ICAC Act to hold a public inquiry into the Allegations is invalid and a nullity.

(5) An order restraining the respondent from continuing to investigate the Allegations.

(6) An order restraining the respondent from conducting a public inquiry into the Allegations under section 31 of the ICAC Act.

208ICAC submits that if the applicants succeed on grounds 13 and/or 14-16 then the appropriate relief is simply the making of the declarations sought in prayers 3 and 4. It is submitted that injunctive relief is inappropriate (referring to Financial Services Council Ltd v Industry Super Australia Pty Ltd [2014] FCAFC 92; (2014) 222 FCR 455 at [37]-[39)) and that the applicants' position would be vindicated by allowing the approval and granting the declarations sought. I agree.

Conclusion

209I agree with Basten JA that there was no power for ICAC to conduct an investigation into the allegation as described in the summons issued pursuant to s 35 of the ICAC Act because the alleged conduct did not fall within the definition of ""corrupt conduct"" in s 8(2) of the Act. I agree that the orders proposed by Basten JA should be made.

Introduction

4This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions against a sentence imposed on the respondent for an offence of aggravated dangerous driving contrary to s 52A(4) of the Crimes Act 1900, to which he had pleaded guilty. He was sentenced on 17 March 2014 to a term of 3 years imprisonment commencing on that date with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months. The maximum term of imprisonment applying to the offence is 11 years. There is no standard non-parole period. The sentence reflects a discount of 25% arising from the respondent's timely plea of guilty.

5The offender's driving caused a collision which resulted in the infliction of grievous bodily harm on the victim with permanent debilitating effects. The circumstance of aggravation was that the offender had, at the time of impact, the prescribed concentration of alcohol, as it happened, 0.206 grams of alcohol per 100 ml of blood. 

Facts

6These were, in substance, not controversial and no submission was made in this Court that the factual findings of the learned sentencing judge should not be accepted. The following account is largely taken from his Honour's remarks on sentence. 

7The respondent was, at the time of the accident, the holder of a provisional licence but no point, one way or the other, depends on this. During the evening before the accident the respondent had been drinking with some friends at a hotel in Milperra and had returned to a house in Warwick Farm where he continued drinking homemade alcohol throughout the evening and into the early hours of the morning. At 6 am his friends contacted an ambulance after finding him difficult to rouse and he was taken to Liverpool Hospital and admitted at 8.11 am. When examined by the doctor he was drowsy and obviously intoxicated. His level of consciousness had improved. Blood tests were ordered together with intravenous thiamine and he was observed for a period of time to ensure that he was not developing evidence of a serious toxidrome in the form of an evolving acidosis or QT prolongation. About three hours after his admission his blood alcohol concentration was 0.363 g/100ml. He remained under observation until about 3.30 pm, with his condition gradually improving. He had been walking freely to the toilet and was back to a normal level of consciousness. On reassessment, he was deemed medically safe for discharge. He was ultimately discharged at 3.27 pm on 26 August 2012. 

8At 4.34 pm that afternoon the respondent was driving his motor vehicle in a general northerly direction along the Northern Road Llandilo where there was a gradual right bend approximately 300 m south of the site of the accident. At this time the victim, Mr Krajsic (36 years old at the time) was driving his motorcycle in a southerly direction. The respondent's vehicle crossed the double centre unbroken lines entering the southbound lane and collided with the motorcycle. Just before this, another vehicle travelling in front of the motorcycle was forced off the road to avoid collision with the respondent's car. The driver thought he saw the respondent's head on his chest and it is possible he had fallen asleep. The road conditions had nothing to do with the accident. The respondent's vehicle was at least four metres over the centre line at the time of impact. 

9Mr Krajsic was thrown on to the front windscreen of the respondent's car and vaulted over it. He suffered a fractured pelvis requiring surgical fixation, fractures to four ribs, displaced spinal fractures, spinal cord injury, cardiac arrest and renal failure. He has been left with no movement in his left leg and partial strength in his right leg which might improve if he were to have further surgery. He has no sexual function. He is permanently wheelchair-bound and needs assistance showering and dressing and with other routine activities. He suffers considerable pain and discomfort. He cannot work at all in the security field where he had been employed for 18 years before the accident. Of course he can no longer play sport. The financial impact has been significant and he was, at the time of the sentencing, on a disability pension. The sentencing judge's description of the injuries as catastrophic is entirely justified. 

10Witnesses and police officers at the scene observed the respondent showing signs of intoxication including his being unsteady on his feet, his eyes being bloodshot and smelling strongly of intoxicating liquor. He was arrested at 4.55 pm and at 6 pm his breath alcohol reading was 0.206 g/210l. 

11Dr Judith Perl, a forensic pharmacologist, stated in a report forming part of the agreed facts that, ""based on the breath analysis result and on elimination rates, the accused's BAC at the time of the collision would have been not less than 0.221g/100ml ... with his most likely BAC being 0.229g/100ml... [and, further] taking the difference between the breath analysis and blood analysis results and considering the time interval between the two results, such would indicate the accused had an elimination rate of 0.24g/100ml/hour ... [Based] on this elimination rate and on the breath analysis result, at the time of the collision the accused's BAC would have been 0.242g/100ml... [which is] the offender's most probable BAC at the time of the collision"". Dr Perl also reported that ""the symptoms of intoxication displayed by a person are dependant on their experience with alcohol"" and noted that - 

""The accused did display signs of drunkenness or significant intoxication ... consistent with his BAC being above 0.2g/100ml. However, the intensity of the symptoms were certainly less than one would expect in a 'social' drinker at this level. Therefore, given his BAC as determined by the breath analysis (and considering his BAC as determined by the blood in hospital) such would strongly suggest to me ... that the accused had a much higher level of tolerance than an average social drinker"". 

12The respondent gave evidence in the proceedings. The sentencing judge accepted his evidence that he woke up in hospital and had no recollection of the intervening period. He thought he was an honest young man. The respondent's evidence was to the effect that he was on a drip and he felt tired, lethargic and confused but did not feel drunk although he was confused about his discharge. He said, ""I didn't feel too bad, not really, I just felt ...[pretty] tired and lethargic and [pretty] confused"". He elaborated, ""I believe I felt pretty alert, like I was ... just a bit more confused about the events that had happened before, like I've never been on a drip and waking up, it was just like a - like a weird sort of feeling for me, like I didn't know - I didn't know what that was"". He said he believed the drip would have flushed the alcohol from his system. He took a taxi from the hospital to the car and intended to pick up his car and drive home. He said that, while he was driving, he ""didn't feel any worse than I normally would like as far as I can recall no"". He did not suggest he had fallen asleep. As I understand his evidence, he attributed the ""weird"" feeling to having been in hospital on a drip but insisted that when he got into his car, he ""felt okay"". He recalled the collision. 

13The sentencing judge said, ""Obviously he thought he was able to drive and ... he was clearly wrong"". His Honour concluded - 

""In my view [the respondent] clearly had the subjective but erroneous belief that he was in a position to drive if he actually thought about to any significant extent. He said he never had been hospitalised before, this was a very different experience for him and ... I accept his evidence in that regard and that the doctor said he was, ""right to leave"". He made the assumption, again erroneous, that he was okay to drive.""

14In dealing with the respondent's culpability, the sentencing judge said -

""... This case and it's consequences arose because of his own conduct, his own conduct in binge drinking ... to an extent where an ambulance had to be called to take him to hospital and where his readings were at this extraordinarily high level for such a period of time. On any view it is an abandonment of responsibility ... I find that there was a substantial degree of moral culpability, it is not excused in my view by the fact that he was discharged from hospital. It is not excused by the fact that he chose to get a taxi [in order] to drive ... [when he] could have got the taxi to take him straight home. It is equally clear, and I find that there was a substantial degree of impairment, constituted by the facts that I have outlined.""

""... I cannot agree with... the submission [by defence counsel] that the decision [to drive] did not demonstrate a comprehensive abandonment of his personal responsibility. That does not arise simply by leaving the hospital, it arises by any young man going and driving after such a significant binge drinking exercise. It may be that he was not aware of the effect of it and the impact of it, but he must have been aware he had been drinking and for a very substantial period and was substantially affected by it."" [Emphasis added.]

Speed camera photographs tendered on the proceedings showed that at 3.54 pm (about an hour before the accident) the respondent's car was travelling at 71 km/h in a 60 km/h zone on a large arterial road at Mount Pritchard. However, it was not suggested by the Crown that the respondent was speeding at the time of the collision. 

Subjective features

15His Honour accepted the truthfulness of the respondent's evidence and did not detect any effort on the respondent's part to try to minimise the seriousness of the offence and his culpability. His Honour accepted that he thinks about the matter every day and is very concerned about what has happened to the victim as well as his family. He accepted, therefore, that he was fully and genuinely remorseful. The respondent comes from a supportive family in rural Victoria and seems to have lived and worked since the age of about 20 years. He has had employment as a stable hand and is likely to go back to that work to assist his parents in the operation and management of their horse stables. A number of references both from the respondent's family and others who knew him were tendered confirming what his Honour said about his own observations of the respondent in the witness box, ""that he has been traumatised and scarred by this particular incident"". The respondent has no prior convictions. The respondent had a history of binge drinking and Dr Jacmon, a clinical psychologist, whose report was tendered in the sentencing proceeding diagnosed chronic alcohol abuse. It may be accepted also that, at the time of the offence, the respondent had recently broken up with his girlfriend and was suffering depression. 

Special Circumstances

16The sentencing judge found special circumstances which justified a variation in the statutory ratio provided by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). His Honour said -

""I do find special circumstances in this case, contrary to the reservations expressed by the Crown. Here is a situation where the age of the offender, his lack of antecedents, his family support, his employment history and the network of assistance available to him and the work possibly available to him (and I am sure his family will provide him work) is that he would benefit from a longer period of time on parole ... I do think that the offender has extremely good prospects of rehabilitation. I think this event will affect him, I think it will have a lasting effect on him, perhaps not as lasting and long term as the effect on the victim but certainly will have an effect on him and I do make a finding that special circumstances is warranted ... that is of itself a mark of some generosity to the offender, particularly by the reduction that I am proposing.""

Discussion

17The fundamental ground of appeal is that the sentence, including the non-parole period, was manifestly inadequate, in particular, in failing to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence. It was also submitted that the sentencing judge erred in his approach to finding special circumstances, which led him to impose a manifestly inadequate non-parole period. 

18In R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252; 134 A Crim R 53, Spigelman CJ summarised common features of these cases as follows - 

""[204] A frequently recurring case of an offence under s52A has the following characteristics.

(i) Young offender.
(ii) Of good character with no or limited prior convictions.
(iii) Death or permanent injury to a single person. 
(iv) The victim is a stranger. 
(v) No or limited injury to the driver or the driver's intimates. 
(vi) Genuine remorse. 
(vii) Plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value.""

The guidelines earlier promulgated in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209, which required some adjustment, inter alia, in light of the critique in Wong v The Queen (2001) 76 ALJR; 185 ALR 233, were varied to the following effect (see [215]-[231]) - 

""Aggravating factors: 

(i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted.
(ii) Number of people put at risk.
(iii) Degree of speed.
(iv) Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse.
(v) Erratic or aggressive driving
(vi) Competitive driving or showing off.
(vii) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk.
(viii) Ignoring of warnings.
(ix) Escaping police pursuit.
(x) Degree of sleep deprivation. 
(xi) Failing to stop.

""The presence of factors pars (iii)-(ix) may indicate that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. When the presence of such a factor can be so described, which involves an element of judgment on which sentencing judges could reasonably differ, then it can be said to be present to a material degree for purposes of determining an appropriate sentence. 

""The period of three (in the case of death) or two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm), once the threshold of abandoning responsibility has been reached, is a starting point. The presence of additional aggravating factors, or their increased intensity, will determine the actual sentence. 

""In the case of the aggravated version of each offence under s52A, an appropriate increment to reflect the higher maximum penalty, and what will generally be a higher level of moral culpability, is required. Other factors, such as the number of victims, will also require an appropriate increment."" (Emphasis added.)

19It is not necessary, in my view, to burden this judgment with further references to other observations made in this Court as to the effect of Whyte and the nature of the offence. They do not take the matter further in point of legal analysis but merely, if I may say so with respect, apply the principles in the particular circumstances under consideration. The sentencing judge, after setting out the subjective material (mentioned above), stated - 

This is a difficult situation, a very difficult sentencing exercise because, unusually I have an offender whom I, first, regard as honest, secondly, from a hard working background and thirdly, from a good family, who is concerned about what he is doing. This is not somebody who has been arrogant in his disregard for people generally.

Although fleshed out, this is not significantly more than is already taken into consideration in paragraphs (i), (ii) and (vi) of the typical case.

20In her written submissions, the Crown prosecutor in this Court referred to the view expressed in Application by the Attorney General No 3 of 2002 (The PCA Guideline Judgment) [2004] NSWCCA 303; 61 NSWLR 305; 147 A Crim R 546 - 

[101] ... It is a matter of common knowledge that at the level of intoxication represented by a reading of 0.15 the person must have consumed a quantity of alcohol that would not only manifestly influence his or her driving skills but have led the person to appreciate that fact or, at least the risk of it. 

[102] A person, who commences to consume alcohol outside his or her home, must appreciate that he or she runs the risk of reaching a level of intoxication at which it is a criminal offence to drive a motor vehicle. As alcohol is continuously consumed, not only does that risk increase but also the potential seriousness of the offence increases. At the high range level of PCA it could rarely, if ever, be suggested that the person lacked this appreciation at some point of time before the decision was made to get behind the wheel of motor vehicle. These observations may be trite, but they must be kept in mind when consideration is given to the level of criminality involved in driving at the high range PCA and the appropriate punishment necessary to reflect it.

21The sentencing judge appears to have accepted that the respondent genuinely believed that he was ""okay to drive"". This was a generous finding. However, it was plainly a drunken assumption - indeed, one which most drunken drivers make - but it does not seem to me that his Honour went so far as to accept that the respondent was not aware that his ability to drive was compromised. On the face of it, this suggestion, however, was made at some points by the respondent in his evidence and appears to have been accepted by the sentencing judge. However, It should be borne in mind that the sentencing judge's remarks on sentence were ex tempore, with the key points at the end, as I understand his Honour, being the conclusions that the offence was a very serious one which involved, as cited above, the respondent's ""comprehensive abandonment of his personal responsibility"" and that ""he must have been aware he had been... substantially affected by [his drinking]"". The evidence to my mind permitted no other conclusion.

22It was also submitted by the Crown that the sentencing judge overlooked the seriousness of the injuries suffered by the victim. I do not accept this submission. His Honour set out these injuries in some detail and described them as ""catastrophic"".

23The real case made by the Crown is that, having regard to the respondent's criminal culpability of a high order and the permanent serious injuries suffered by the victim as a result, the sentence is so manifestly inadequate that it bespeaks error in evaluation of the relevant circumstances although no particular error can be demonstrated.

24The response made by Mr Lange of counsel on behalf of the respondent is that the sentencing judge made all the necessary findings as to seriousness, not put in issue by the Crown, including the consequences for the victim. Referring to the sentencing judge's finding that the respondent believed he was ""okay to drive"", Mr Lange submitted that ""there was no conscious or irresponsible abandonment of responsibility"". However, as is evident from the passages from his Honour's remarks on sentence, quoted above, his Honour rejected this submission and found to the contrary. With respect, this conclusion was inevitable. It is plain that, although the respondent may not have appreciated quite what was affecting him (which I find difficult to accept, but defer to the sentencing judge's view in this respect), he must have realised, had he considered the question of his fitness to drive in any genuine way, that he should not be driving. Mr Lange submitted that the sentence is not itself so low as to demonstrate error: it accords with Whyte and the JIRS statistics, which show that the sentence was in the upper third of sentences imposed, 33 out of 49 sentences being shorter than 3 years. In respect of the non-parole period, he emphasised what he calls ""the comparative severity of the sentence imposed"" is even more apparent since, of the 42 non-parole periods imposed, 33 were shorter than that imposed on the respondent.

25Taking the characteristics to which the Chief Justice referred in Whyte at [204]: the respondent, aged 27 years at the date of the offence, is not a young offender; he is of good character with no prior convictions; his driving caused a very serious permanent injury to the victim, a stranger; there was no injury to the respondent; his remorse was genuine; his plea entitled him to a 25% discount to the sentence which would otherwise have been appropriate. The relevant aggravating factors are: the injuries inflicted on the victim were catastrophic; the respondent drove for something like 50 km on ""major and busy arterial roads"" whilst in a heavily intoxicated state; the number of people put at risk should be accepted as substantial; he was heavily intoxicated; his driving was erratic in that he drove onto the wrong side of the road for a significant distance before colliding with the victim's motorcycle. A propos of the Crown prosecutor's submission in this Court that the objective seriousness approached the most serious category, it is relevant to note that other seriously aggravating factors mentioned by Spigelman CJ were not present: there was no competitive driving or showing off, there was no ignoring of warnings or escaping police pursuit, aggressive driving or failing to stop. Although the objective seriousness of the respondent's offence was by no means in the lower range, it also did not fall within or approach the most serious class of case. The guideline that a sentence of less than two years imprisonment would not generally be appropriate does not suggest any upper range; it proposes, in qualified terms, a minimum term.

26The sentencing judge made no reference to the objectives of sentencing or to how the sentence imposed achieved those objectives. However, as Simpson J pointed out in R v Millwood [2012] NSWCCA 2 at [64] (with whom Bathurst CJ and Adamson J agreed) this is not a necessity: ""sentencing is a daily task undertaken in the District Court and the objectives are plainly well known to those who perform that function"". Furthermore, his Honour referred to and said that he acted in accordance with Jurisic and Whyte, both of which refer to the significance of general and specific deterrence. 

27To the extent that the sentence exceeds the guideline, it may be accepted that it conforms with Whyte, but that does not go far. Mr Lange candidly conceded that the statistics are of limited value without reference to the actual cases which they reflect. The only case to which he referred us was Millwood, in which the Crown appeal against sentence was dismissed. In that case the respondent was sentenced, in respect of one count of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death to a term of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and in respect of one count of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm (arising out of the same accident) a sentence of 2 years with a non-parole period of 9 months, overall an aggregate term of imprisonment of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months. A discount of between 15-20% was allowed. Certainly, the sentence in relation to the second count was distinctly lower than that imposed in the present case. However, the harm (though substantial) suffered by the victim was very much less than that suffered by the victim in the present case; the respondent was not nearly so intoxicated as in this case and his subjective features were very much more significant. 

Conclusion 

28In my respectful view the sentence under appeal did not reflect adequately the objective seriousness of the respondent's offending, given the extent of his intoxication, the period and distance he drove before the collision, the fact that he must have appreciated he was unfit to drive had he given the question any genuine thought whatever his befuddled mind led him to believe about his being permitted to leave hospital, and the permanent and greatly debilitating injuries to the victim. Accepting that the respondent's subjective features are significant, it is nevertheless my respectful conclusion that the sentence was so manifestly inadequate as to demonstrate a misapplication of principle, though not patent, by the sentencing judge. In my view the appropriate starting point for this offence could not appropriately be less than 6 years imprisonment, yielding a head sentence of 4 years and 6 months when the utilitarian discount is applied. 

29The non-parole period requires to be reconsidered at all events and it is not necessary to consider whether the sentencing judge erred in this respect. A critical issue is the respondent's alcohol abuse, and his high level of depression in part arising from the accident and the significant harm he caused to the victim (as distinct merely from the imprisonment he must undergo). As Dr Jacmon observed, depression is frequently associated with alcohol abuse and relapse prevention therefore is not only desirable in the respondent's case but also in the public interest. Accordingly, it seems to me that a lengthier period than otherwise would be available under the statutory formula of parole is desirable. This is particularly so in light of the increased non-parole period which must inevitably have the effect of lengthening the respondent's isolation from society and, in particular, his family support. The length of time spent in custody does not reduce, but rather increases the need for supervision in a case such as the present in the hope that rehabilitation which has hopefully been effected in the gaol environment can be reinforced in the challenges presented by the outside world. The proposed non-parole period of 2 years 9 months is approximately the same percentage of the head sentence as that allowed by the sentencing judge. 

30It is, therefore, necessary to consider the residual discretion of the Court to decline to interfere with the sentence despite this conclusion. In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49 (where the offences concerned the cultivation of a substantial crop of cannabis plants), the principal question concerned the significance of different sentences that had been imposed on co-offenders of the appellants and whether parity principles required adjustment of their sentences. French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said (omitting most references) - 

""[35] In a Crown appeal against sentence in New South Wales, the Court of Criminal Appeal is invariably asked to exercise its powers under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act to impose upon a convicted person a heavier sentence than that imposed by the primary judge ... Assuming the Court of Criminal Appeal considers the sentence under appeal to be inadequate on account of error by the primary judge, two questions arise. Their answers involve the exercise of the different discretions conferred by s 5D. They are: 

1. Whether, notwithstanding the inadequacy of the sentence, the Court should decline, in the exercise of its ""residual discretion"" under s 5D, to allow the appeal and thereby interfere with the sentence appealed from. 

2. To what extent, if the appeal is allowed, the sentence appealed from should be varied. 

[36] A primary consideration relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion is the purpose of Crown appeals under s 5D which, as observed earlier in these reasons, is ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons"" ... That is a limiting purpose. It does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges. It provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion ... 

[42] Other circumstances [than disparity] may combine to produce injustice if a Crown appeal is allowed. They include delay in the hearing and determination of the appeal, the imminent or past occurrence of the respondent's release on parole or unconditionally, and the effect of re-sentencing on progress towards the respondent's rehabilitation. They are relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion. The guidance afforded to sentencing judges by allowing the appeal should not come at too high a cost in terms of justice to the individual.""

31The circumstances referred to in the last paragraph do not appear to be present in the present case. Nor do I think that the sentence I propose would cause injustice to the respondent. It is but moderately increased. The contrasting situation of the victim, who suffered serious permanent disabling injuries and is in constant pain, deserves consideration as well in the exercise of the Court's discretion. 

Orders

32I propose the following orders - 

1. The appeal is allowed.

2. The sentence is quashed and, in lieu thereof, the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years 6 months commencing 17 March 2014 comprising a non-parole period of 2 years 9 months and a balance of term of 1 year 9 months. 

3. The respondent will be eligible to be considered for release on parole on 17 December 2016.

2765510,Nand v R [2014] NSWCCA 293,"Judgment

1GLEESON JA: I agree with Schmidt J. 

2SCHMIDT J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal the sentences imposed upon him by Norrish DCJ for pleas which he entered in January 2012 to two offences of sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The applicant's case is that the sentences were severe and manifestly excessive. 

3The applicant committed the two offences on 16 December 2010 at Newtown Railway Station. The victim was an unconscious 18 year old woman. He was arrested while committing the second offence. The applicant was then at liberty on parole in respect of prior offences of assault with an act of indecency and aggravated break and enter, which he had committed in 2008. The applicant's parole for those offences was revoked on his arrest.

4The applicant was sentenced by Norrish DCJ in April 2012. A trial in September 2011 had been adjourned and the plea was entered in January 2012, prior to the second hearing due to commence on 30 January. That followed legal advice which the applicant had received from new legal advisers engaged in November 2011. 

5The maximum penalty for each offence was 14 years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period 7 years. The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years, 6 months commencing on 24 October 2011, with a non-parole period of 7 years, 6 months for the first s 61I offence. He was sentenced to a term of 10 years, 6 months commencing on 24 April 2012, with a non-parole period of 7 years, for the second offence. The total term imposed was 11 years, with a non-parole period of 7 years, 6 months. The applicant is eligible for parole on 23 April 2019. His sentence will expire on 23 October 2022. He also received a $500 fine on a s 66 certificate, for a small amount of cannabis found in his possession on arrest.

6Three grounds of appeal were pressed by the applicant, who appeared unrepresented at the hearing of the appeal. They were:

(1) False advice received from incompetent legal representatives being Van Houten Law.

(2) Expert Medical Reports tendered by the defence were not considered by the sentencing judge.

(3) Sexual assault inflicted upon the applicant during childhood was not adequately taken into account by the sentencing judge.


7Affidavits sworn by the applicant's former legal representatives, his solicitor, Rodney Van Houten and his counsel, Gemunu Kumarasinhe and Derek Shridhar, were received at the hearing of the appeal, without objection. They were not required for cross-examination. The applicant also made further short oral submissions in support of written submissions which he had earlier filed.

Ground 1 - false and incompetent legal advice

8The applicant's case on appeal was that he ought to have received a lesser sentence than that imposed, which was severe in the circumstances. He had not entered an earlier plea, he claimed, because the advice he had received from his original legal representatives was inadequate; he was intoxicated at the time of the incident; he had not received any evidence prior to committal; and he had first seen the CCTV photographs and his mobile phone footage on 28 November 2011. Had he received proper advice earlier, he would have entered a plea and received a 25% discount on his sentence. 

9I am satisfied that this ground of appeal was not made out.

10Firstly, it must be considered that the overall sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years, 6 months was not a heavy sentence for the applicant's offences, given their gravity, which was high. The sentence also reflected relevant aggravating and mitigating factors revealed on the evidence and paid proper regard to the maximum penalty of 14 years and the standard non-parole period of 7 years which applied to those offences. The latter were two statutory guideposts to which his Honour had to have regard, in undertaking the instinctive synthesis by which a sentence must be determined (see Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27]) and Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357).

11The offences for which the applicant was sentenced were very serious as his Honour found. The agreed facts tendered at the sentencing hearing revealed that the victim had arrived at Newtown Railway Station at about 3.40am on 16 December 2010, heavily intoxicated. She sat on a bench on platform 1, where she passed out. She was then suffering from insomnia and had not slept for three days.

12The applicant got off a train at about 5.10am. The events which followed were captured by the station's CCTV camera and partially by footage which the applicant himself recorded on his phone, actions which Norrish DCJ found cast considerable light on his actual level of intoxication at the time.

13The applicant approached the victim and stepped back when another commuter walked past. When that person had his back to the applicant and the victim, the applicant lowered the front of his shorts and thrust his penis towards the victim, on the Crown case, pushing it into the victim's mouth over a period of about 40 seconds. He then lifted his shorts and bent over the victim for about two minutes. He then lowered his shorts again and moved the victim, whose limp hand could be seen over the side of the bench. He finally moved to face the victim, who was then lying along the bench with her feet towards him. 

14A train stopped and the applicant's activities drew the attention of alighting passengers. He stepped away from the bench and his erect penis was filmed, protruding from the top of his shorts. He was then holding something in his right hand. He then thrust his exposed penis towards the victim's head for another period of over 40 seconds, continuing even while commuters who had alighted from yet another train, walked past.

15The applicant then moved to the end of the bench and placed his penis into the victim's vagina, thrusting forward a number of times. He held the victims left leg in the air and pulled on her jeans, which had been partially removed. 

16The applicant was then using his mobile phone to record the assault. It showed the applicant thrusting his penis into the victim's mouth while her eyes were closed; placing his penis into her mouth, while make various derogatory comments; trying to pull her jeans completely off; and police speaking to him.

17Police attended at about 5.18am, after a witness had reported at 5.15am seeing people engaging in sexual intercourse at the railway station. They observed the applicant with the victim, who was lying on her back with her legs in the air. Her right jeans leg had been totally removed and the left leg partially removed. The applicant's shorts were below his waist. He covered himself as police approached. The police officers' voices woke the victim, whose vagina was exposed. 

18Both the victim and the applicant were arrested. The victim's intoxication and level of consciousness later became apparent. The victim asked police whether the applicant had touched her. The victim said that she did not recognise the applicant's name and had not consented to sexual activity. 

19Witnesses described the victim variously as having been ""pretty unconscious"" and that she was ""pretty limp, she didn't look awake and looked to be unconscious, her eyes were closed and she wasn't moving"". 

20The applicant told police that they had known each other for six years. That was untrue. He also wrongly identified her as ""Natalie"". The applicant was charged with sexual assault and cautioned. He telephoned his mother and told her that ""I'm sorry mum, I've got myself into trouble, got caught having intercourse at a train station"". 

21The applicant then consented to forensic procedures, but declined to be interviewed, or to provide the access code for his phone. He was found to be in possession of cannabis.

22The applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing which was not only inconsistent, it contradicted the agreed facts and on appeal has been shown to be untrue in parts. Various documents were tendered, including was an April 2012 pre-sentence report, as well as February 2012 reports from Associate Professor Woods, a psychologist; from two psychiatrists, Dr Allnut and Dr Teoh; and an April 2012 report from another psychiatrist, Dr Kavanagh. They had all examined the applicant, who had given them differing accounts of relevant matters, accounts which also differed in various respects from the agreed facts and his evidence. 

23Understandably, his Honour formed an adverse view both of the reliability of the accounts which the applicant had given to those who examined him and of the truthfulness of his evidence. 

24Associate Professor Woods saw the applicant on 2 and 8 February 2012. He recorded that the applicant's account was:
""Mr. Nand stated that he recalls leaving his friend's home in a heavily intoxicated (illicit drugs and alcohol) state and of beginning to walk to the railway station. His next and reportedly vague memory is that of arriving at Central railway station and then alighting from the train at Newtown railway station. Mr. Nand stated that he (vaguely) recalls a) the victim asking him for a cigarette and b) each fondling the other. Mr. Nand was adamant that his next memory is that of being led from the railway station by police and then being at the police station. When repeatedly challenged in relation to his reports of having no memory of most of the night prior and what it [sic] alleged to have occurred, Mr. Nand was adamant that he has no memory of assaulting the victim.

With regard to his attitude in relation to the offences, Mr. Nand stated that notwithstanding his inability to remember what occurred, he is ashamed of his actions, that what he did was wrong, and that it was in response to this that he chose to enter a plea of guilty.""

25His Honour observed as to this account:

""If that be the assertion of the accused to Mr[sic] Woods it is materially false. Frankly, in the scheme of things, [sic] is patently absurd and reflects, as his evidence reflected before me, no real contrition on his part.""

26That conclusion was well open on the evidence.

27Dr Allnut recorded that on 3 February 2012 the applicant told him that:
""After this he said his memory was hazy; he recalled taking a train to Quakers Hill intending to return home; he said he passed out and woke up at Central station having taken the wrong line; by the time he had woke up at Central station he had lost his jacket and shirt but still had his bag on his back; he could not recall getting off the train at Central station; his brief stated he was at Ashfield, Central station and Town Hall station but he had no recollection of this.

He recalled getting off at Newtown station he thought because he wanted to have a cigarette; he said the victim asked him for a cigarette; he did not recall giving her one; she asked him if he had gone to some clubs and he said no; he then recalled approaching her; he could not recall if he gave her a light for her cigarette; from then on he said he had no clear recollection of what happened; his next memory was of something happening between him and the girl, something sexual, her touching him and him touching her.

He then recalled the Police saying ""what are you doing, put that sh*t away""; he recalled getting handcuffed; his next recollection was arriving at Newtown Police station; he called his mother and a pastor that he was getting charged.""

28Dr Teoh recorded that on 10 February the applicant told him that he had only a vague recollection of the conversation with the victim, who he did not know.

29In the April 2012 pre-sentence report which was prepared after consultation with the applicant in March, it was observed that the applicant claimed limited memory of the offences, due to his level of intoxication. He said he understood the seriousness of his offences and accepted full responsibility for them, but emphasised the role that drug and alcohol taking had played.

30Dr Kavanagh's report noted that the applicant had told her in March 2012 that he remembered waking up at Central and then everything was a blur until he got to Newtown. There he became involved in a conversation with the victim, who asked him for a cigarette. The victim had then begun to fondle him and he began to fondle her. He remembered that ""we were doing something together"", but denied remembering having sex with her. This account was also patently untrue. There was no mutual sexual activity. It was inconsistent with the agreed facts and with what was depicted on the CCTV footage, with which Dr Kavanagh had been briefed, as Dr Kavanagh observed at page 4 of her report. It was also inconsistent with parts of the applicant's evidence.

31The applicant apologised to the victim in his evidence, expressing his remorse and contrition. The applicant's evidence also included, amongst other things, that he had become remorseful for his offence, when he sobered up the day afterwards. His Honour did not consider what he had said to be genuine or timely enough to be given much weight. That conclusion was understandable, given other evidence which the applicant gave.

32The applicant was cross-examined about his various accounts and Norrish DCJ also asked him some questions. He then said that he had spoken to the victim who had asked him for a cigarette and that they had spoken about going to a club earlier that night, before he assaulted her, which he did not recall. What he did recall was her fondling him and him fondling her. He recalled her touching his leg, but he did not notice whether her eyes were open. He could recall touching her, but not where, and then being arrested. He did not remember using his phone. Nor did he remember what he told police, although he immediately realised he was in trouble, because he was in breach of his parole conditions in relation to use of drugs and alcohol. He denied being immediately aware of being in trouble because he had sexually assaulted the victim. 

33He explained, when further questioned about his remorse, that what he meant was that he was initially remorseful for being back in prison and letting his family down. He explained that he had become remorseful for what he'd done to the victim, after he was told about the iPhone footage in November 2011. 

34In response to questions asked by Norrish DCJ, the applicant then said that he had earlier been told by his previous lawyers that there was CCTV footage showing him sexually assaulting the victim and that he'd filmed the assault on his phone, around the time of committal. He also said that he had received the brief a few days before his first court date and it was then that he had realised that he had done something really wrong. He said that at the time of the assault, he ""wasn't there mentally"". The applicant also said that he first saw the footage on 28 November 2011, after he had instructed his new legal representatives and that he did not see any material prior to his committal. 

35On further questioning by his Honour, the applicant agreed that before the committal he was aware that the assault had been recorded on the CCTV footage, but he said, ""I didn't know of any of the iPhone footage"". When this was challenged he said, ""I knew I filmed it but I didn't know what was on it"", but he agreed that he knew that the victim was a complete stranger and that he had lied to police when he told them that he knew her. His explanation for having, in those circumstances, pleaded not guilty was ""[f]or the simply[sic] fact I wasn't there. I wasn't there in my mind whatsoever so I didn't know to the full extent what occurred."" 

36The applicant also said that before 28 November he had not been briefed as to the content of the iPhone video, which he understood his new legal representatives had seen for the first time on 23 November and that it was on 28 November that he first received advice as to its impact on his case.

37On further questioning by his Honour as to why he had earlier declined to provide his pin code to police, the applicant then agreed that he was then aware that he had filmed the assault and that he had rung his mother from the police station and told her that he had had intercourse at the station. Later, however, he again said that he did not know that he had filmed the assault on his phone.

38This inconsistent, contradictory evidence well explains the adverse view which his Honour took of the applicant's honesty and reliability. 

39Evidence was also called from the Senior Chaplain at Long Bay Correctional Centre, Pastor Ring, who said that when the applicant first went into custody, he found him to be in denial, not giving any consideration to his victim. It was in the past four to five weeks that he had come to some understanding of what she had gone through. 

40The applicant's sister's evidence was that the applicant was very remorseful, realising since the entry of his plea the need for him to take responsibility for his actions. Evidence from Pastor Seneviratne, who was from the accused's Christian community, was that the applicant claimed to be hazy in his recollection of the offence, which his Honour did not accept to be the genuine situation. 

41It was submitted for the applicant on sentencing, in written submissions, that he should receive a 12.5% discount for his plea and that his lack of early legal instruction to bring the matter to an end could be attributed to his degree of intoxication and substance abuse at the time of the offences. It was not suggested that the late plea was as the result of any deficiency in his prior legal representation. That, however, was raised in oral submissions, with the result that his Honour took a view of the circumstances favourable to the applicant and concluded that he should have a 12.5% discount for his late plea, observing:

""The only reason I am giving the prisoner a discount above the minimum ten per cent that ordinarily would be given in such circumstances is to recognise the saving of the victim having to come along to this Court and give evidence of this no doubt horrific experience. However, it is to be pointed out that the prisoner's complete failure to address his responsibility from the outset kept the victim in a state of uncertainty for far too long.""

42While his Honour took an unfavourable view of the honesty and reliability of the applicant's evidence, he accepted that his plea was entered late because of the legal advice he had received. On appeal, the applicant relied on Norrish DCJ's observations that:
""The prisoner gave evidence in the proceedings which was more revealing than perhaps he intended it to be. His evidence was concerned with the timing of his plea and, in the context of his expressions of contrition, for what had occurred between himself and the victim.

I interpose for a moment to point out that the prisoner did not formally plead guilty to this matter until 31 January, 2012 having been charged on the 16 December, 2010. There had been a trial date fixed for 30 January, 2012, there having been a previous trial date fixed for 19 September, 2011, the matter not proceeding because of what was claimed to be ""new evidence"" in the possession of the Prosecution. I accept from the evidence available to me that the prisoner's decision to plead guilty followed upon a conference he had with his legal advisers in November, 2011 but was not conveyed to the Crown until about 27 January. It would seem, on the way in which the matter was conducted and in the tenor of the evidence of the prisoner, that the blame for the delay in the plea of guilty was in part to be laid at the feet of the prisoner's former legal advisers. The facilitation of the pleas of guilty on the advice of the prisoner's current legal advisers is to be commended.""


43The applicant contended that in the result, inadequate account had been taken of this conclusion, with the result that he received only a 12.5% discount, rather than the 25% he would have received, if his plea had been entered earlier.

44That case was not made out. The applicant obviously has difficulty accepting responsibility not only for his offences, but also for the decisions which he made as to how he was going to conduct his case.

45As to his conduct his Honour observed:

""He gave an account as I said earlier that he did not know that he was responsible for what he did until he received the brief of evidence. He reiterated to this Court that he had no real memory of the relevant matters giving rise to the charges. He, at one point, denied telling lies to the police about his relationship with the complainant. He also, in his evidence, said that he did not know what precisely he had filmed. He claimed that he could not remember what he told the police or what he told his mother when he rang her. He seemed to suggest, as I read his evidence from the transcript, that he did not fully appreciate the extent of the allegations against him until he had a conference with his ""new"" legal advisers on 28 November, 2011. He claimed before me that he did not know that he had put his penis in the mouth of the complainant until he saw the brief, that he had told her to spread her legs out, that he said that she was tight or any of the other things that he is recorded saying on his iphone.

None of this can be true. It is contradicted not only by his own recording but by the closed circuit television showing the deliberation in which he set about sexually assaulting the complainant and the deliberation shown in the police evidence of his avoidance of responsibility by falsely pretending that he was a friend of the complainant. When asked about his assertion that he could not remember having filmed the complainant being sexually assaulted at the time the police had asked him for the password to his iPhone he said this,

""I was told that I was doing the filming but at the same time I did have my phone out but I was listening to music at the same time so I remember that because I had my music on all, pretty much the whole night so I had the iPhone always with me...in my hand so I could have been doing anything with it.""

This is, frankly, an extraordinary claim to be made on 5 April 2012, given the fact that at that stage he could not claim that he had not been informed of the allegations against him. I asked him this question,

""Q. When the police were speaking to you, you knew that you'd filmed a sexual assault, is that right?
A. I didn't think that far into it.

Q. What do you mean by ""I didn't think that far into it""?
A. Well, I was that induced on what I was intoxicated on that instant for on instinct someone asks me about my, like my mobile phone and can I get the password to it, I'm saying, no.""

Then later on he was asked,

""Q. Do you know that you'd filmed the sexual assault on your iPhone at the time you were arrested by the police?
A. I don't know.""

I regard that evidence as untruthful.

When he sought to assert in his evidence that he was truly remorseful for what he had done, he was questioned by me as to when he became remorseful for what he had done. Ultimately it was clear by his own evidence that his remorse was simply a case of feeling sorry for himself and his family that he was in the trouble that he was. He admitted in his evidence before me that his first remorse was felt by him when his lawyers had told him what he had done, as he explained it, in November 2011.

He was asked again by me,

""Q. Mr Nand, you knew after the event, immediately after the event, did you not that you'd done wrong, that you'd had sexual intercourse with a woman who was unconscious or asleep on a railway station, you knew that, didn't you?
A. I didn't know directly after the event, no.""

That evidence was clearly untruthful, in my view.""

46These conclusions were open and well explain the sentence which Norrish DCJ imposed on the applicant. 

47On appeal, the unchallenged affidavit evidence of Mr Van Houten, Mr Kumarasinhe and Mr Shridhar, who were all engaged on the day of the applicant's arrest, established that the timing of the entry of the applicant's late plea was not the result of their inadequate advice. The applicant first received advice on the day of his arrest from Mr Shridhar, while he was at Newtown Police Station. His mother was present. He was subsequently advised by Mr Kumarasinhe, who appeared for him later that day in the Local Court, when the applicant did not apply for bail. 

48Police were then seeking access to his mobile phone and his consent to a buccal swab. The applicant's instructions to Mr Shridhar were that he had had sex with a female who he knew, on a platform at Newtown railway station; that he had filmed this on his mobile phone; and that he did not want police to have his pin number, to access his phone, or to obtain the video footage.

49When Mr Kumarasinhe appeared for the applicant in the Local Court, police still wanted access to his mobile phone. The applicant also instructed Mr Kumarasinhe that he did not dispute having had sexual intercourse with the victim, but instructed that he knew her; that he had videotaped the incident; and that he did not want police to have access to his iPhone pin number. 

50The applicant later entered a plea of not guilty to the charges and the matter was listed for trial in September 2011. 

51On 7 July 2011, Mr Van Houten and Mr Kumarasinhe attended a conference with the applicant. His instructions were then that when he got off the train at the station and walked past the victim, he heard her say, ""Hey were you at the club tonight?"" He told her that he did not attend any clubs that night. They talked for a while and then the victim touched him on the penis, unbuttoned her jeans and wanted him to help her. She performed oral sex on him. A passenger on a train yelled at him. He had filmed their sexual intercourse on his phone. It was by consent and he did not want police to access the footage. He then said he could not remember his pin number. This account was patently untrue. 

52The applicant was then also reminded of the existence of the CCTV footage of the assault. He was advised of the discount available for an early plea, the standard minimum term which applied to the offences and Judicial Commission sentencing statistics. The applicant nevertheless instructed that he wished to maintain his not guilty plea on the basis of the victim's consent. 

53Mr Van Houten's retainer ceased in October 2011, after the first trial was adjourned. 

54None of this evidence was challenged by the applicant. It was inconsistent with parts of the evidence which he gave at the sentence hearing. That evidence itself was inconsistent and contradictory and contrary to aspects of the agreed facts. The applicant's evidence led Norrish DCJ, properly, to form an adverse view of the honesty and reliability of his evidence and the accounts which he had given to experts who had examined him.

55The applicant, nevertheless, submitted on appeal that his initial legal advice was inadequate; that he was not made aware of the contents of the brief, and in particular the contents of his mobile phone. The result was that he was unable to enter an early guilty plea. If he had received the necessary information and advice about the contents of his phone, he would definitely have entered an early plea. It was when he was made aware by his new legal representatives of the contents of the iPhone and the Crown case against him, that he entered his plea. 

56Those submissions cannot be accepted in the face of the uncontested evidence of Mr Van Houten, Mr Kumarasinhe and Mr Shridhar. Their evidence must be accepted, revealing as it does the falsity of aspects of the evidence which the applicant gave at the sentencing hearing. In the face of that unchallenged evidence, it is apparent that his Honour's conclusions as to the advice the applicant had received from them, were not properly available. 

57This evidence established not only that the applicant lied to police on arrest, but that he had given instructions to those who initially represented him, that he wanted to defend the charges on a basis which he knew was false. The case which he advanced in relation to his earlier legal advice before Norrish DCJ was factually incorrect. It was plainly not inadequate legal advice which led the applicant not to enter a guilty plea before the first trial. He then well knew that he had committed the offences he was charged with and had received advice of the advantages which could flow from early entry of a plea.

58On arrest the applicant was aware that the victim was a stranger and that what he had filmed on his iPhone would help establish that his claim that his intercourse with the victim had been consensual was false. That was why he wished to prevent police gaining access to the film. 

59Despite this knowledge and the legal advice he had received, in July 2011 he persisted in defending the charges on the basis that the intercourse had been consensual, even after being reminded of the existence of the CCTV footage and his iPhone recording of the assault and being advised of the discount available to him for an early plea, the standard minimum non-parole period for the offences and Judicial Commission sentencing statistics for such offences. 

60The agreed facts later tendered at the sentencing hearing in 2012 confirmed that the victim was a stranger, that the intercourse was not consensual and that he had filmed the assault on his phone. This was known to the applicant long before he received advice from his new legal advisers in November 2011.

61The evidence received on appeal also confirms the correctness of the conclusions reached by Norrish DCJ, who saw both the CCTV and iPhone footage of the assaults, that the applicant was not a reliable historian and had given evidence which could not be accepted. Those conclusions were relevant for a number of considerations in the sentencing exercise, including for an assessment of his remorse and contrition. 

62It is in those circumstances that the applicant's case on appeal, that inadequate initial legal advice had deprived him of an opportunity earlier to enter a guilty plea and to express his remorse and contrition, must be rejected. 

63Had the evidence led on appeal without objection from the applicant's former legal representatives been available to Norrish DCJ, the 12.5% discount which he received may not have been available. Section 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) requires a sentencing judge to take into account an offender's plea of guilty, but entry of such a plea does not require that a lesser penalty be imposed. That is a matter of discretion. There are circumstances in which an offender will not receive any discount, even after entering a plea. 

64In R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 the guideline judgment on utilitarian discounts given for guilty pleas, Chief Justice Spigelman explained the operation of discounts granted in the range of 10-25%. His Honour said at [153] - [158]:
""153 The determination of where, within such a range, the discount should fall in a particular case is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge. 

154 There are however two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case: 

(i) The time at which a plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial.

(ii) The complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea.

155 The top of the range would be expected to be restricted to pleas at the earliest possible opportunity and should not be given, save in an exceptional case, after a matter has been set down for trial. A discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for late pleas, e.g. on the date fixed for trial, unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial. 

156 Rare cases involving exceptional complexity and trial duration may justify a higher discount. In some cases no discount is appropriate at all. In some cases the ""discount"" will be reflected in a step down in the hierarchy of sentencing options. 

157 There are circumstances in which the protection of the public requires a long sentence to be imposed so that no discount for the plea is appropriate. (See e.g. R v Stabler (1984) 6 Cr App R (S) 129 at 131; R v Costen [1989] 11 Cr App R (S) 182 at 184). 

158 There are crimes that so offend the public interest that the maximum sentence, without any discount for any purpose, is appropriate. This includes situations in which a life sentence can be and is imposed, notwithstanding the plea. (See e.g. R v Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2, see esp per Sully J at [38]-[42])."" 


65In this case it was well open to Norrish DCJ to find that the applicant had no true remorse or contrition for his offences. It appears that the pleas were finally entered late, only in recognition of the inevitability of his conviction. 

66There was no error in his Honour's exercise of the discretion to give a utilitarian discount of 12.5% for this late plea, entered after the adjournment of the first trial, long after the applicant was advised of the benefits potentially flowing from an early plea, which he received before the first trial. In the circumstances, that was an entirely lenient approach. Had the true circumstances been revealed, in my view, the applicant would not have been entitled to any discount. 

67No error has been shown and accordingly, this ground of appeal must be dismissed.

Ground 2 - failure to examine medical reports

68The applicant's case was that his Honour failed to pay proper regard to the medical reports in evidence, which demonstrated a substantial link between his chronic and heavy polysubstance abuse and the sexual assaults which he had he suffered as a child, which he submitted played a significant part in these offences.

69This ground of appeal was also not established.

70The case advanced for the applicant in written submissions on sentencing was that at the time of the offences he was suffering from a mental disorder associated with substance abuse and that his offences had been committed while he was under the influence of substances. 

71In his evidence in chief the applicant had acknowledged that he needed treatment for drug and alcohol problems, as well as in relation to sexuality matters. He said those programs were not available to him in custody, until after sentence. He agreed in cross-examination, however, that while in custody for earlier offending, he had participated in both the SMART drug and alcohol program and the CUBIT sex offender's program, the latter continuing once a week, after he was released on parole. He was thus still receiving that treatment, when he committed the further offences for which he was being sentenced. 

72The applicant also gave an account of his earlier offending. He said he remembered that in 2004 he broke into a house to support his drug habit and sexually assaulted a woman there, although he did not remember the details of the assault, or what he had then said. He also remembered details of having broken into another house in 2006 to support his drug habit and committing another sexual offence there on a young woman.

73The applicant gave evidence of having abused drugs for over 15 years. He said that he no longer wanted to have such problems.

74Associate Professor Woods' report outlined a history given by the applicant on 2 and 8 February 2012 that the applicant had been sexually assaulted between about the ages of 9 or 10 and 12 years, by a male friend of the family who babysat him after school. He later used marijuana to stop thinking about the abuse and said that he had not disclosed the assaults earlier, because he did not want it to be thought that he was trying to make an excuse for what he had done. He also recounted a history of drug abuse from the age of 14, with weekly marijuana use increasing to daily use by age 15, use of MDMA and amphetamines, together with alcohol from age 16, weekly use of Rohypnol from age 17 or 18 and methamphetamines from age 20. This pattern persisted until his incarceration in 2007. He had used marijuana on only one occasion in custody. He had resumed drug use after his release in September 2010, because of social isolation. He had then renewed contact with former associates.

75On 3 February 2012, the history given to Dr Allnutt was of drugs and alcohol making him more impulsive; that he had been sexually abused at about age 7 or 8 by a family member; and that he had only revealed this abuse recently to his sister. He reported that ecstasy use increased his sex drive, making him feel powerful and unstoppable. 

76On 10 February 2012, the history he gave Dr Teoh was that he had used cannabis and alcohol since age 14 and heroin, ice and valium use since age 16. Prior to his arrest he smoked cannabis daily. He had received no counselling for his substance abuse apart from the SMART program. He also reported sexual abuse from age 9 to 12 by a family friend, which he had first disclosed to his mother a year previously.

77In the April 2012 pre- sentence report, the applicant gave no report of having been the victim of sexual assaults as a child. He said that his behavioural problems at school had been due to the stress of domestic violence between his parents. He reported drug abuse and suffering from depression, for which he had not sought treatment. He reported daily cannabis use from age 14, amphetamine use from age 18, at times daily use of speed and ice and thrice weekly use of ecstasy, as well as daily drinking a 700ml bottle of spirits.

78In written submissions advanced on sentence the defence case was that the applicant was not suffering from a mental illness, but from a mental disorder associated with substance abuse. In Dr Allnutt's opinion he had an underlying deviant sex drive which probably becomes uncovered when intoxicated. In the result rehabilitation which addressed both his drug and alcohol problems was imperative. Dr Teoh had diagnosed polysubstance abuse, onset from age 14, which had contributed to the offences and impaired his judgment. He required treatment for substance abuse and participation in the sex offender program. Dr Teoh also considered that his history of sexual abuse had contributed to his mental state. Dr Kavanagh did not diagnose the applicant to be suffering a major mental illness, but having a past history of depression and adjustment disorder, with significant past substance abuse and the need to examine the possibility of paraphilia.

79It was submitted orally that the programs he had earlier participated in had not had a positive effect upon him. It was accepted, however, that not reoffending was a matter for his own conscience and that he had undertaken drug and alcohol counselling while last in prison, as well as a program for sexual offenders. It was also accepted that the fact that he had abused drugs and alcohol upon release on parole, might help explain his offending, but did not excuse it. The objective seriousness of his offending was not disputed. 

80It was submitted in the context of the standard 7 year non-parole period, that the applicant's offending fell within the mid-range. Committing these offences shortly after being released in parole was also accepted as being an aggravating factor relevant to sentencing.

81Norrish DCJ paid careful attention to the medical reports in evidence, and the opinions there expressed, in light of the other relevant evidence, including the agreed facts and the applicant's own evidence and the submissions advanced for the applicant. He found, as I have explained, that the applicant was not a reliable historian and that affected the weight which could be given to the medical reports on which he relied. There was no error in those conclusions.

82Norrish DCJ concluded that insofar as the reports and opinions in evidence depended on the truthfulness and reliability of accounts which the applicant had given their authors on critical matters, he could not give them much weight. He noted that the accused's accounts of drug taking, treatment for sex, drug and alcohol abuse, and sexual abuse had varied considerably and had been inaccurate in parts. His Honour observed that:

""In each of the interviews conducted by the professionals retained by his legal advisers, the reasons given for his commission of these crimes are related to the extent of his drug and alcohol ingestion. As a historian in relation to this aspect of the matter I do not regard him as reliable. He is simply not a truthful or reliable historian. He, in some of the reports, makes claims of sexual abuse only recently reported to his family.""

83His Honour also noted references such as those in Dr Allnutt's report, to a long history of substance abuse and sexual abuse as a child. His Honour observed that the applicant's return to drug taking soon after his release on parole for prior sexual offending, together with these offences suggested that the applicant was developing the characteristics of a sexual predator. His Honour took the view that substance abuse had played a major role in the applicant's charges and convictions for sexual offending against strangers.

84His Honour considered, nevertheless, that the applicant's intoxication provided no excuse for his offending. Having seen the CCTV and iPhone footage, he found that the applicant had not been intoxicated to the extent which he claimed at the time of these offences. He also concluded that no mental disorder had contributed to the commission of the offences. He observed that:
""The fact that he is more vulnerable to crimes of sexual violence in that state represents a matter of concern as to his danger to the community in a similar way, but not exactly the same way, as Robert Vincent Veen presented to the community in the circumstances where he was dealt with in 1987 and 1988.""

85His Honour concluded:
""I have come to the conclusion, although it was not a matter dwelt upon in the course of oral submissions, that no issue on the evidence available in this Court arises requiring consideration of the principles that were summarised in the decision of R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228. In that judgment at [33] Sperling J sought to summarise where mental illness may be relevant, for example to lessen the weight to be given to general deterrence amongst other matters. Here there is no evidence of mental illness on any view of it and conduct disorder or substance abuse disorder, even if correctly diagnosed, does not explain or provide any real justification for the prisoner's conduct. Even if it could be argued for some reason that does not appear from the evidence that the weight to be given to general deterrence may be diminished to some extent by reason of the opinions of Dr Teo[sic] and Dr Allnutt and to some extent Dr Cavanagh[sic], the diminution would only be marginal and very strongly offset by what was contemplated by (as he then was) Gleeson CJ, in the decision of R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67, in which he noted that:

""The presence of a particular disability, whilst it may operate to diminish the need to be given to general deterrence, may require greater weight to be given to personal deterrence."" 

The fact that the prisoner is susceptible to acts of sexual violence when intoxicated in circumstances where he has previously been given the benefit of the Cubit Program and Smart Program in custody before he was released from custody is no comfort for the victim, the community and offers little consolation for the future. It certainly reduces the confidence one would have in the ability of the prisoner to react favourably to parole supervision.""

86His Honour thus concluded that these were objectively serious offences failing above the mid-range, not in the worst category, but not far removed from that position. He noted the humiliation caused to the victim, given that the offences had occurred in public, in view of others and that they had been filmed. He took into account aggravating matters as s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act required, namely that the applicant had previously been sentenced for serious personal violence offences; that the harm to the victim had been substantial; and that the offences were committed while the applicant was at liberty on parole. The mitigating matters taken into account were the guilty plea and that the offences had not been planned. His Honour could not find that the applicant had accepted responsibility for his actions and properly acknowledged the harm he had caused ""given the manner in which his contrition has emerged from his own version of events"". 

87His Honour also considered the need to promote the applicant's rehabilitation, but concluded that he needed to be deterred from further offending and that others needed to be deterred from offending in this way, which he found had involved ""outrageous conduct in a public place"". Those considerations, as well as ""the need to ensure that the prisoner is sufficiently punished and made to account for his crimes"", led his Honour to the view that the sentence which he imposed was required. 

88On the evidence, these conclusions were all properly open. His Honour paid proper regard to the medical reports in evidence as well as to other matters which had to be taken into account in the sentence exercise. He was entitled to give these reports the weight that he did, resting as they did on the applicant's inaccurate and unreliable accounts. 

89The sentence imposed was, in all of the circumstances of this offending, not a heavy one, despite the adverse views which his Honour formed of the applicant's evidence and the weight which could be given to the medical reports relied on. 

90The matters advanced by the applicant do not establish any error and so this ground, too, must be dismissed.

Ground 3 - sexual abuse was not adequately taken into account

91The applicant submitted that Norrish DCJ had failed to explore his subjective case of sexual abuse at a young age and had been dismissive of its impact, despite the comprehensive reference in Associate Professor Wood's report to correlations between childhood sexual assault and adverse psychological and social outcomes.

92The applicant did not give evidence about these matters at the sentencing hearing and they were not pursued in submissions. I have earlier explained the inconsistent accounts which he gave of having been the victim of sexual assaults while a child and Norrish DCJ's views as to the unreliability of his accounts and the weight which he could accordingly give to the expert reports which rested on these accounts. 

93In written submissions on appeal the applicant relied on evidence of what was submitted to have been a confession by a family member who had abused him, which he said had been tendered to this Court in September 2013. There was no such evidence. The matter was before the Registrar that day. Documents filed were not tendered then, or at the hearing of the appeal.

94After the hearing this issue was raised with the parties, who were given the opportunity to make further submissions. The Crown submitted that the material sought to be relied on was not in admissible form and did not, in any event, establish that the applicant had been sexually abused as a child, as he had submitted. At its highest, it was submitted, the material exchanged on Facebook, suggested ""two kids looking at dirty magazines and innocently acting out"".

95The appellant made no further submissions. In the result, I would not receive this material as new evidence on the appeal. Even if it were received, it would support the view taken by Norrish DCJ as to the unreliability of the various accounts given by the applicant of the sexual abuse which he claims to have suffered.

96In my view there was no error in Norrish DCJ's approach to this evidence. In Dousha v R [2008] NSWCCA 263 it was observed at [47]:
""47 The applicant conceded on the appeal that there was no direct evidence that the single incident of abuse he suffered as a child had in any way contributed to his offending as an adult. Although the psychologist's report made reference to a body of research suggesting that a percentage of sex offenders have themselves been sexually assaulted during childhood, and that this in turn has contributed to the development of aberrant sexual behaviour in adult life, she did not consider that the incident reported to her by the applicant had contributed in any way to his offending. In the absence of any causal connection of that kind (or the issue having any bearing upon the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation) I am not satisfied that the incident was relevant to the sentencing discretion (see R v Cunningham [2006] NSWCCA 176 at [67]).""

97In the applicant's case Associate Professor Woods had annexed to his report a document outlining the long term implications of childhood sexual abuse and in particular, the use of substances to self-medicate. Associate Professor Woods did not consider the applicant to be suffering from major psychiatric illness, despite his entrenched and clinically disturbing history of polysubstance abuse. He noted that Mr Nand reportedly relied on marijuana to self-medicate recurrent distressing memories of being sexually molested. 

98This was a matter to which his Honour paid regard. Norrish DCJ did not consider the applicant to be a truthful or reliable historian, but said he was unable to conclude that the applicant's claims of sexual abuse, only recently made, were false. His Honour concluded, however, that:
""There seems to be no evidence available to me of any reliability to provide any connection between those matters and the circumstances of the commission of these offences with which I am concerned."" 

99That conclusion was plainly open on the evidence. No error has been shown and in the result, this ground, too must be dismissed.

Orders

100For these reasons, I would order that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

101BELLEW J: I agree with Schmidt J.

		08 December 2014",2014-12-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765516,R v Kumar [2014] NSWSC 1747,"JUDGMENT


	
	On 4 June 2014 Raj Kumar was charged by way of indictment that, on 1 February 2012, at Colyton NSW, he murdered Rajeshwari Kumar. The accused pleaded not guilty, and a jury trial then proceeded. On 26 June 2014 the jury, by a majority of 11 to 1, found the accused guilty of murder. He comes now to be sentenced for this offence.
	
	
	The factual background, briefly, is as follows. The offender and the deceased were Fijian Indians. They were married in Fiji in about 1989, and moved to Australia, via New Zealand, some time later. Precise timings are unclear, but it was probably in the early 1990's. They have lived here ever since. They had three children: two girls, SK (born in 1990) and KK (born in 1998) and a boy, AK (born in 1999). Their relationship had deteriorated significantly over the three or four years before the killing. I shall be saying more about this later. Suffice it to say for present purposes that at the time of the killing the offender was on bail in relation to two charges of sexually assaulting the deceased. One of the conditions of his bail was that he stay away from the matrimonial home at 13B Kent Place Colyton. Accordingly, since November 2011 he had been living with relatives of the deceased in a house at Turner Street Colyton. Their son, AK, also lived there much of the time, so that at the relevant time the deceased and their younger daughter, KK, were living alone in the house at Kent Place.
	
	
	On Wednesday 1 February 2012 the deceased drove KK to school. When KK returned from school, at about 2.40 that afternoon, she found the house locked and her mother's car absent, indicating that the deceased must be away from home. This had never happened before: the deceased had always made a point of being at home when KK returned from school. For this reason, KK did not have a key to the house. After knocking on the door and receiving no response, she walked to the house in Turner Street where her father was living with her mother's relatives, and told them what had happened. Various subsequent attempts to locate the deceased proved unsuccessful, and later that evening the matter was reported to the police. The next morning police officers made their way to the rear of the Kent Place house. They entered a large covered patio area. There they saw that one of the windows into the house proper had been broken. The window looked into a room which was described as a study, containing a bed on which a woman's body was lying. One of the officers gained access to the room by putting his arm through the hole in the broken window, opening the window from the inside and then climbing through it. He found the deceased's body lying on its back. The police looked through the house which appeared to be neat and tidy. There was no indication that it had been ransacked, and no sign of forced entry other than the broken window.
	
	
	A subsequent post mortem examination showed that the cause of the deceased's death was suffocation by external airways occlusion. There was no indication that pressure had been applied to the neck, leading the forensic pathologist, Dr. Wills, to conclude that the suffocation had been caused by forcible obstruction of the deceased's facial airways. This was consistent with bruising and abrasions around her nose, mouth and chin. Given other matters at the scene, Dr. Wills considered it probable that the deceased's face had been forcibly pushed down into the bedding for at least part of the time that she had been deprived of oxygen.
	
	
	The offender has always denied that he had any involvement in the killing of his wife. The case against him was therefore a circumstantial one. When the whole of the evidence was put together it became a very strong circumstantial case. The following is a brief description of the evidence as given at the offender's trial.
	
	
	There had been increasing conflict between the offender and the deceased in the years leading up to the killing. It is likely that this was precipitated by the deceased's suspicion that her husband was having an affair with a woman in Fiji, Asha Singh. Until late 2011 the two of them continued to live in the family home, but in separate bedrooms. There was also escalating domestic violence on the part of the offender, which included sexual assaults on the deceased. The first known incidence of a sexual assault was in November 2009. The deceased did not report this to the police for another two years, but she told her local doctor about it the following month. The police first became involved in their domestic affairs in July 2011, when the deceased reported an assault by the offender and had an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (""ADVO"") taken out against him. The following month the offender himself applied for an ADVO, saying that the deceased had become verbally abusive towards him. Also in August 2011 the deceased twice attended St Marys Police Station, where she started to make a statement setting out a history of domestic violence. However she never completed this statement. The situation came to a head on 2 November 2011 when the deceased reported to the police that she had been sexually assaulted by the offender the previous month. It was then that she told them about the earlier sexual assault in November 2009. Two days later the offender was arrested and charged with two counts of sexual assault. Bail was initially denied, but was granted two days later, on 6 November, on condition that the offender not go within 100 metres of the Kent Place house except for the purpose of collecting his belongings, which was to be done in the presence of a police officer. It was then that the offender moved into the Turner Street house where the deceased's mother, brother and other relatives were living. The sexual assault charges were due to come before the Penrith Local Court on 7 February 2012.
	
	
	On the morning of 1 February, by considerable coincidence, both the offender and the deceased went to the Penrith office of the Legal Aid Commission. The deceased was seeking advice about a family law issue, while the offender was concerned about his forthcoming court appearance in relation to the sexual assault charges. The offender told the legal aid solicitor that he had seen his wife in the waiting room - something which he later denied, but I have no doubt that he did. Indeed, it is very likely that it was the sighting of his wife in this context which led to his decision to kill her.
	
	
	By about mid-morning both the offender and the deceased had left the Penrith area. The offender's van was seen at 10.18 am, driving in the direction of Colyton, while the deceased drove to the Aldi supermarket in St Marys where she bought a number of grocery items. CCTV footage shows her leaving the store at 11.27 am.
	
	
	I have already described KK coming home after school and finding the Kent Place house locked, ultimately leading to the discovery, the next day, of the deceased's body in the downstairs study. Later that day, 2 February 2012, the offender voluntarily attended St Marys Police Station and participated in an interview. He said that he had not seen his wife since 4 November the previous year. As to his movements the previous day, he said that after leaving the Penrith Legal Aid office he had gone straight home to Turner Street, where he remained until he left, that afternoon, to collect his son from school. After that his movements were well documented.
	
	
	It was not long after the offender had left the police station on 2 February that other police officers located the deceased's car in Dorothy Crescent, Colyton, not far from Kent Place. The car was unlocked, and the key was in the ignition. The offender's DNA was found on the key, although the car had been purchased after he and the deceased had separated, and he had apparently never been in it. The car also contained some of the groceries that the deceased had purchased at Aldi the previous day, although quite a number were missing. The police subsequently searched the offender's Hi-Ace van, where they found virtually all the Aldi groceries which had been missing from the deceased's car. And if this was not enough to implicate the offender in the deceased's death, a tea towel which was located beside the broken window of the Kent Place house was later found to have a bloodstain containing the offender's DNA.
	
	
	On 6 March 2012 the offender was arrested and charged with the murder of his wife. He has been in custody ever since.
	
	
	The above summary is only an extremely brief prÃ©cis of the extensive evidence given at the offender's trial. The offender himself gave evidence, in which he continued to maintain his denial that he had been in any way responsible for his wife's death. Nevertheless, the cumulative effect of the various circumstances pointed inexorably to the offender as his wife's killer, and it ultimately became a very strong Crown case.
	
	
	Nobody other than the offender knows precisely when and how the deceased was killed. In terms of the timing, there are two possible scenarios. The first, and in my view by far the most likely, is that the offender went virtually directly from the Penrith Legal Aid office to the Kent Place house, arriving there well before the deceased did. He almost certainly would have parked his van some distance away, probably in the vicinity of Dorothy Crescent, in order to prevent the deceased being alerted to his presence by seeing it in the vicinity of the house. He then gained entrance to the house by breaking the study window, and waited inside for the deceased to return home. When she did so he attacked her and ultimately suffocated her. The other possible time scenario suggested by the Crown is that he broke into the house later in the day, when the deceased was already at home. However, as already indicated, I consider the first scenario to be much more likely. In either case, after killing the deceased he drove her car to Dorothy Crescent where, before abandoning it, he removed some of the Aldi groceries and put them into his own van. He then presumably returned to the Turner Street house. In this regard, the deceased's mother said that the offender returned home at about 2.00 that afternoon. This was in direct conflict with what the offender told the police, namely that he went straight home after leaving the Penrith office, and was there by 11.00 that morning.
	
	
	It follows that this was an entirely unprovoked killing, in which the offender took the deceased by surprise in her own home and deliberately suffocated her. He has consistently denied being involved in the killing, and thus has shown no remorse. His motive almost certainly was to prevent her from giving evidence against him in relation to the charges of sexual assault, which were due back before the courts the following week.
	
	
	The Crown submissions on sentence describe this offence as ""callous and violent"", and in the mid range of offences of murder. The defence submits that it is slightly below the mid range of offences, and describes it as essentially a spontaneous offence, with little or no planning. In this regard I accept that it was probably only on the morning of the killing that the offender decided on this course of action. But it by no means follows that it was a ""spontaneous offence"", a term usually reserved for offences which occur in the heat of the moment. There was sufficient premeditation for the offender to break into the deceased's home in such a manner that the deceased, entering from her car, could never have discerned that this had happened, and then to wait for her return so that he could attack and kill her without the possibility of anybody witnessing these events. In this regard, it is clear that he intended to kill the deceased, rather than to inflict grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	In my view this offence falls within the mid range of offences of murder.
	
	
	I turn now to say something about the offender personally. He was born in Fiji in January 1960, and is thus 54 years old. He had little formal education, having left school at about the age of 14 years. Thereafter he worked as a carpenter, although without any formal qualifications. Apart from a brief time in Canada in 1980, he remained in Fiji until leaving for New Zealand in the late 1980's and then coming to Australia in the early 1990's. By that time he was married to the deceased and their oldest daughter, SK, had been born. In this country he had a stable employment history: for 15 years, until only three months before this offence, he was employed by Spotless Dry Cleaning as a driver, delivering clean sheets and towels to hotels. He has never previously been convicted of any criminal offence, but at the time of the killing was on bail in relation to the sexual assault charges involving the deceased. He must have been highly regarded by the deceased's family, for it is most unusual, to say the least, for a person who has been forced to leave the matrimonial home because of domestic violence allegations, to then move in with his wife's closest relatives. On all accounts he has a continuing relationship with his two younger children, KK and AK, who visit him in gaol, but he is estranged from his older daughter, SK.
	
	
	On 24 September 2014 the forensic psychologist, Tim Watson- Munro, interviewed the offender in Long Bay Gaol in the presence of an interpreter. His report, dated 1 October 2014, was tendered by the defence. He found the offender to be suffering from a degree of reactive depression, which essentially relates to his current circumstances. There was nothing to indicate any major psychiatric disturbance, either in the offender's presentation or his prior history. His physical health is not good, but his problems are apparently not sufficiently severe to raise issues which are relevant on sentence.
	
	
	Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Act"") sets out a number of aggravating and mitigating circumstances which are required to be taken into account on sentencing. There are two aggravating factors which are relevant in this case and are not inherent in the offence of murder. They are as follows: first, pursuant to subsection (2)(eb), that the offence was committed in the victim's home, thereby violating what should have been the deceased's reasonable expectation of safety and security. This is a significant issue in the circumstances of this case, where - as already indicated - the offender almost certainly broke into the deceased's home and then lay in wait for her to return so that he could attack her without the possibility of being observed by anyone else. The other aggravating factor, pursuant to subsection (2)(j), is that the offender was on bail in relation to the charges of sexual assault relating to the deceased. The Crown submissions also refer, in this context, to the fact that the proceeds of sale of the matrimonial home have been used to fund the offender's defence to the current charge. The defence submits, rightly in my view, that this is not a relevant circumstance. I am therefore putting it to one side for present purposes.
	
	
	The primary mitigating factors under s 21A which are relevant to this case are, first, pursuant to subsection (3)(e), that the offender has no record of previous convictions. This is undoubtedly correct, but it must be seen in the context of the fact that there had been a lengthy history of domestic abuse perpetrated by the offender upon the deceased. Given the whole of the evidence in the trial, I find this to have been established beyond reasonable doubt. The other mitigating circumstances relied upon by the defence, which are interrelated, are that the offender is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation, pursuant to subsections 21A(3)(g) and (h). I am inclined to accept this as correct. The offender faces a lengthy term of imprisonment. He will be a relatively elderly man by the time he is eligible for release, and - given that he has no previous criminal convictions - I consider it unlikely that he will offend again.
	
	
	The offender has continued to deny his involvement in this offence, and has thus displayed no remorse. This, of course, cannot be used in aggravation of sentence, but it deprives him of what can sometimes be a powerful mitigating feature.
	
	
	It is also relevant to consider the primary purposes of sentencing, as set out in s 3A of the Act. Without listing these purposes comprehensively, they effectively represent the goals of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation and denunciation. In this regard, I accept the defence submissions that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. Personal deterrence is, in the circumstances, unlikely to be relevant, but general deterrence remains a real issue, as do the remaining considerations of punishment and denunciation.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment, which is reserved for the worst cases of its kind. The Crown does not submit that this case falls within that category, nor could it in the circumstances. The standard non-parole period is 20 years. This has been recognised, since the High Court judgment in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120, as being a guidepost rather than a starting point, as had previously been considered.
	
	
	Both counsel have referred me to a number of sentencing cases, most of which involve men who have murdered their partners. I have taken these cases into consideration, but again they can operate only as guideposts. Each case must depend on its own individual circumstances. The circumstances in this case, as I have said, place the offence itself into the mid range of offences of murder. Taking into account the various other considerations relating to the offender himself, I propose to impose a non-parole period which is below the standard non-parole period, but not to a significant degree.
	
	
	The defence submits that there are special circumstances which justify the imposition of a longer parole period than specified in s 44 of the Act. In this regard it is submitted that the offender will need ongoing assistance upon his release from prison when he is attempting to reintegrate himself into the community. In view of the lengthy term of imprisonment which I am bound to impose in this matter, he will, in any event be subject to quite a lengthy parole period. Nevertheless, I propose to take this into account in slightly varying the statutory ratio between the total sentence and the non-parole period.
	
	
	Extremely moving victim impact statements were read by or on behalf of a number of the deceased's relatives, including her and the offender's three children. These statements bear testimony to the devastating effect that the deceased's violent death has had upon her family members. The Court expresses its sincere sympathy to all those whose loss has been so eloquently expressed in these statements. Nevertheless the law does not permit them to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since 6 March 2012. His sentence is therefore to be backdated to commence on that date.
	
	
	Raj Kumar, for the murder of Rajeshwari Kumar, I sentence you to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 17 years to commence on 6 March 2012 and to expire on 5 March 2029. The balance of the term will be 6 years, expiring on 5 March 2035, making a total sentence of 23 years. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 6 March 2029.

2765524,AB v Constable Joshua Hedges (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1768,"Judgment

1The background to this matter is to be found in my earlier judgment, of 21 June 2013, at [2]-[17]. In that judgment I refused an application by the plaintiff for judicial review of the magistrate's decision to set aside an order for the costs of the Children's Court proceedings which he had made in chambers. The outstanding issue is the claim for damages for breach of contract. 

2In relation to [33] of my earlier judgment, no further application for costs in the Local Court has been pursued. The issues in the claim in contract have been articulated in points of claim and points of defence. The plaintiff's case is that the parties entered into a valid and enforceable contract by the correspondence to which I referred in [7] of my earlier judgment, that is, Mr Oliveri's letter to Sergeant Palmer of 29 April 2011 offering to settle the issue of costs for $90,730, and Sergeant Somers' email of 19 May conveying his instructions to accept that offer. To understand the issues raised, it is necessary to examine more closely the course of events after the issue of costs relating to the charge of resisting an officer was remitted to the Local Court by McCallum J. 

3As I said in [25] of my earlier judgment, when the matter came back before the magistrate on 29 April 2011 it appears that his Honour understood, erroneously, that the issue had been remitted only on the question of quantum. It is apparent from the affidavits in this court that that misunderstanding was shared by Sergeant Palmer and Sergeant Somers.

4Mr Oliveri's letter conveying the settlement offer enclosed a copy of the written submissions prepared by counsel appearing for the plaintiff in the Local Court, to which I referred at [2] in my earlier judgment. The effect of those submissions was that there was no case to answer in respect of the charge of resisting an officer, and that in relation to the traffic offences the evidence failed to establish that the plaintiff had been the driver of the vehicle at the relevant time. The letter asserted that the settlement offer was open until the close of business on 20 May 2011 and that, if the matter were not resolved before that time, the plaintiff would incur further costs ""in seeking appropriate costs orders from the Court.""

5As I have said, the acceptance of the offer relied upon by the plaintiff was Sergeant Somers' email of 19 May 2011 conveying his instructions from the commander of the relevant Local Area Command to do so. Constable Hedges was stationed in that Area Command. The email went on to enquire whether Mr Oliveri required ""any further documentation in this regard"", and Sergeant Somers added that he would prepare a letter to be sent to the registrar of the court ""indicating the costs hearing can be vacated due to the agreement reached."" He enquired whether Mr Oliveri wanted him to include anything in that letter or preferred to send his own, and made a suggestion about the listing of the matter. 

6Mr Oliveri responded by an email of the same day, saying that he did not believe that any further documentation was required to settle the matter, adding that it might be best for the matter to remain in the list until payment was made ""as it may be necessary to have the Court make the orders."" On 24 May Sergeant Somers emailed Mr Oliveri to tell him that ""our procedures are such that I am unable to submit the forms which authorise payment until the magistrate actually makes the order in Court."" This led to an email from Mr Oliveri to Sergeant Somers in which he expressed the view that the need to attend court might be disposed of by filing consent orders. The orders Mr Oliveri proposed were these: 

""1. Police to pay the defendant ... costs in the amount of $90,730.

2. Cheque to be made payable to Oliveri Lawyers."" 

7Sergeant Somers responded by an email of 17 June, confirming that he had instructions ""to agree to the filing of consent orders for this matter in the amount agreed."" It was three days later that Sergeant Somers emailed Mr Oliveri to inform him that ""the prosecution in the costs matter ... withdraws the agreement to consent orders being filed."" There then ensued the further correspondence summarised in my earlier judgment at [9]-[11].

8For the plaintiff, Mr Coles QC submitted that the evidence established an agreement between the parties for the payment of costs in the amount specified. Mr Hutchings relied upon the view I expressed at [27]-[28] of my earlier judgment that an order for costs against the prosecution could not be made simply by consent, without the magistrate having found that one of the bases for that order under s 214(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 had been made out. However, Mr Coles submitted that there is nothing to prevent the parties reaching an agreement for the payment of costs without seeking an order of the court, and such an agreement would be binding. He noted that in Sergeant Somers' email of 19 May it was proposed that the costs hearing be vacated because agreement had been reached. 

9Of course, as I have said, a few days later Sergeant Somers emailed Mr Oliveri to tell him that orders of the court had to be sought, and agreement was reached as to consent orders. This, Mr Coles argued, did not alter Constable Hedges' contractual obligation. He cited a passage from the judgment of Mason J (as he then was) in Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Ltd (1979-80) 144 CLR 577. In the context of the factual issues in that case, which I need not examine, Mason J said at 607:

""But it is common ground that the contract imposed an implied obligation on each party to do all that was reasonably necessary to secure performance of the contract. As Lord Blackburn said in Mackay v Dick [(1881) 6 App. Cas. 251, at p 263]:

'as a general rule ... where in a written contract it appears that both parties have agreed that something shall be done, which cannot effectually be done unless both concur in doing it, the construction of the contract is that each agrees to do all that is necessary to be done on his part for the carrying out of that thing, though there may be no express words to that effect'.""

10Here, Mr Coles argued, the agreement was repudiated before the consent orders could be effectively entered. He submitted that the parties were contractually bound to seek the entry of those consent orders, which might have required the prosecution to concede that there was a basis for a costs order in s 214(1)(b), that is, that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause. Plainly enough, that basis was available. 

11In response, Mr Hutchings submitted that the evidence fails as to establish any contract to which his client, Constable Hedges, was a party. He observed that there was no reference to Constable Hedges in any of the correspondence upon which the plaintiff relies. In particular, he noted that Mr Oliveri's offer of 29 April 2011 to settle the costs issue was addressed to Sergeant Palmer, that the response to that offer of 19 May emanated from Sergeant Somers, and that in that response Sergeant Somers purported to be acting on instructions from the commander of the relevant Local Area Command. Accordingly, Mr Hutchings argued, the correspondence of 29 April and 19 May did not bind Constable Hedges, as the purported acceptance of the offer by Sergeant Somers was not made with his authority, express, implied or ostensible. 

12It should be noted that in the course of argument before me prior to the delivery of my earlier judgment, in response to my enquiry whether ""for all intents and purposes Sergeant Somers was representing the informant"", Mr Hutchings agreed that he was: see the judgment at [23]. However, viewed in context, I accept that that was not necessarily a concession that Sergeant Somers had the authority to bind Constable Hedges contractually. Nevertheless, for the reasons advanced by Mr Coles, I am satisfied that he did have that authority.

13Constable Hedges was the informant in the prosecution and, formally at least, is liable for any costs awarded. Of course, in practice that is not the case and he is a serving police officer subject to the discipline which that status involves, including the direction of the commander of the Local Area Command where he is stationed. On 29 April 2011, when the matter was before the magistrate after having been remitted by McCallum J, he was represented by the police prosecutor, on that occasion Sergeant Palmer. The author of the email of 19 May, Sergeant Somers, had been the prosecutor in the substantive Children's Court proceedings. It is apparent that the commander of the relevant Local Area Command gave instructions to accept Mr Oliveri's offer in his capacity as Constable Hedges' superior. 

14It should also be noted, although it is not of itself determinative of the issue, that Constable Hedges has provided no evidence in these proceedings that the various steps relied upon by the plaintiff were taken without his authority. Nor is there any such suggestion in the affidavits of Sergeant Palmer and Sergeant Somers. 

15It should also be noted that s 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act is expressed to deal with the award of professional costs against the ""prosecutor"" in criminal proceedings. The term ""prosecutor"" is defined in s 3 of the Act to mean ""the Director of Public Prosecutions or other person who institutes or is responsible for the conduct of a prosecution and includes (where the subject-matter or context allows or requires) an Australian legal practitioner representing the prosecutor."" Mr Coles pointed out that that definition would encompass Constable Hedges, as the person who instituted the prosecution in the present case, and Sergeant Somers, as the person responsible for the conduct of it. In that capacity, Mr Coles argued, Sergeant Somers was authorised to enter into correspondence with Mr Oliveri on the question of costs.

16Mr Coles' arguments are also an effective answer to Mr Hutchings' allied submission that the evidence does not establish that the offer to settle the issue of costs was ever made to a person with authority to accept it. In this context Mr Hutchings referred to a passage from the judgment of Starke J in New South Wales v Bardolph (1933-34) 52 CLR 455, at 502: 

""... contracts made on behalf of the Crown by its officers or servants in the established course of their authority and duty are Crown contracts, and as such bind the Crown. The nature and extent of the authority may be defined by constitutional practice or express instructions, or inferred from the nature of the office or the duties entrusted to the particular officer or servant. It is not every contract made or purporting to have been made by an officer or servant of the Crown on its behalf that will bind the Crown, but only such as are within the authority delegated to that officer or servant.""

17It is not suggested that the Crown (or the State) is a party to the contract in the present case. The contract for which the plaintiff contends is one between him and Constable Hedges, as the informant in a summary prosecution. 

18I am persuaded by the submissions of Mr Coles that the correspondence of 29 April and 19 May 2011 did constitute an enforceable contract for the payment of costs, to which Constable Hedges was a party. I accept that it was open to the parties to bind themselves by such an agreement without seeking an order of the court. I also accept that, if the prosecution wished to obtain consent orders, it was incumbent upon it to proceed in the manner articulated by Mr Coles. 

19In the event that I found the contract established, Mr Hutchings sought an order that it be set aside on the basis that it was formed under the influence of a mistake of fact. This was expressed in the points of defence as follows:

""... the first defendant says that it is entitled in equity to relief by way of rescission or rectification in respect of the asserted contract, which if entered into, was entered into under the influence of a material mistake of which the plaintiff 'knew or ought to have known'.""

20It is not necessary for present purposes to examine authority on this form of relief, which was succinctly summarised by Handley JA in Tutt v Doyle (1997) 42 NSWLR 10 at 14-15. Nor is it necessary to deal with Mr Coles' submission that the claim for relief should be the subject of separate proceedings, citing Spies v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1991) 24 NSWLR 691 at 696-7: see [22] of my earlier judgment.

21The points of defence do not articulate the mistake alleged. However, in written submissions Mr Hutchings asserted that it was ""tolerably clear"" that the acceptance of the offer of settlement was founded upon a mistaken belief that McCallum J had remitted for rehearing the issue of costs for all six charges, including the traffic matters. This was said to be apparent from Mr Oliveri's letter of 29 April 2011 to which, as I have said, were attached the written submissions which were before the Local Court on the day on which the charges were withdrawn and the original application for costs was made. The letter stated that those submissions would be relied on if a rehearing were to proceed. The letter also enclosed the tax invoices for Mr Oliveri and for counsel of July 2010, obviously relating to the original proceedings in the Children's Court.

22However, there is no evidence from Constable Hedges asserting such a mistaken belief. Nor is there any suggestion to that effect in the affidavits of Sergeant Somers or Sergeant Palmer. Moreover, the transcript of the proceedings before the magistrate on 29 April 2011, when Sergeant Palmer and Mr Oliveri were present, records that his Honour said:

""The Supreme Court said I made an error in not considering the issues of costs in relation to one of the charges. That's been remitted back to this court, to deal with the issue of costs in relation to one charge, a charge of resist police.""

23The fact that Mr Oliveri in his letter of the same day attached the written submissions which were originally before the magistrate, asserting that they would be relied upon, does not convey that the costs of the proceedings generally were to be re-agitated. It is consistent with an intention to rely upon so much of them as was relevant to the rehearing, that is, the costs of the charge of resisting an officer. Equally, although the original tax invoices of solicitor and counsel were enclosed with the letter, the offer to reduce them by $17,000 is consistent with the recognition of a more limited claim. The claim of mistake of fact in this respect is not made out.

24In para 2 of the points of defence, recording the decision of McCallum J and referring to the brief hearing before the magistrate on 29 April 2011, it is noted that the magistrate ""indicated the only issue was quantum."" That was not referred to in the written submissions as a mistake of fact founding equitable relief. As I have said, Sergeant Somers and Sergeant Palmer deposed to the same misunderstanding, and reference was made to it by Mr Hutchings in oral submissions on this aspect of the matter. 

25Nevertheless, I understood Mr Hutchings to be referring to it as an additional matter demonstrating a misunderstanding of the basis of McCallum J's remitter of the issue, rather than as a discrete basis for relief. Mr Coles characterised it, in any event, as a mistake of law rather than one of fact. Moreover, Mr Oliveri's letter of 29 April 2011, asserting reliance upon the written submissions as to the merit of the prosecution in the event of a rehearing, clearly anticipated that entitlement to costs under s 214 would, if necessary, be litigated. This matter could not provide a basis for rescission or rectification consistently with the principles summarised by Handley JA in Tutt v Doyle (supra).

26Accordingly, I am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount which was the subject of the contract, $90,730. However, the plaintiff also seeks as damages the costs expended in opposing the application to set aside the consent order made by the magistrate on 6 March 2012, an amount of $41,723. Mr Coles submitted that they were damages properly considered as ""arising naturally, ie according to the usual course of things,"" from the breach of contract: Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 156 ER 145. 

27This aspect of the matter has troubled me, but I have concluded that those costs do not meet that test and are not recoverable. The entry of the consent order in the circumstances in which it occurred was an unexpected development, as the parties were expecting to deal with the matter on the day appointed for the rehearing, 28 July 2011. The entry of the order was irregular for the reasons I have given in my earlier judgment at [24]-[28], and it had to be set aside. That was so notwithstanding the fact that it was consistent with the contract the parties had entered into. It was open to the plaintiff to consent to the order being set aside without prejudice to his contractual rights.

28I shall consult the parties about the formal orders to be made and hear argument on costs.

2765529,R v Tabbah; R v Tiriaki (No 6) [2014] NSWSC 1764,"Judgment
1Mathew Hedges was murdered on 31 December 2011, at his home at Chester Hill, when he was hit in the chest by a single gunshot fired late at night through a lounge room window by Wassim Tiriaki, who was standing outside, with Salim Tabbah.
2On 9 May 2014, a jury found Salim Tabbah guilty of manslaughter, having not been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was guilty of Mathew Hedges' murder. The jury found Wassim Tiriaki guilty of that murder. 
3On sentencing the facts on which the two offenders must be sentenced have to be determined, consistently with the jury's verdicts (see R v Isaacs (1999) 41 NSWLR 374).  Any facts adverse to the offenders must be proven beyond reasonable doubt and any that are favourable, on the balance of probabilities (see The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [27] - [28]).
4At trial the Crown's case against each accused was a circumstantial one, but there was no issue that Mathew Hedges had been killed by a single shot fired at close range by the gun in evidence.  Both offenders gave evidence denying any involvement in Mathew Hedges' murder, in Mr Tiriaki's case, other than receiving the gun and other items found the following day by police in his brother's bin, where he had disposed of them.  The jury's verdicts reflect that the offenders' denials were not accepted.
5On sentencing there was no issue between the parties that given the evidence and the two verdicts reached, the jury was satisfied that it was Mr Tiriaki who fired the shot which killed Mathew Hedges, intending either to kill him or to inflict grievous bodily harm; that Mr Tabbah was with him; that the two offenders were party to a joint criminal enterprise and had gone there to break and enter into Mathew Hedges' home, while armed, intending to commit a robbery there; and that Mr Tabbah had contemplated that Mr Tiriaki intended to threaten Mathew Hedges with the gun, which he knew might be loaded, or that he had contemplated the possibility that Mr Tiriaki might discharge the gun.
The issues on sentencing 
6The jury did not accept the offenders' case at trial, that the Crown's circumstantial case against each of them, which rested in part on DNA evidence, was incapable of proving their guilt of any offence beyond reasonable doubt.  The evidence which they then gave did not shed any light on how Mathew Hedges came to be shot.   They have never given any explanation for what they did and still deny any involvement in his death.
7What was in issue in Mr Tiriaki's case on sentencing was whether the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that he had fired the gun intending to kill Mathew Hedges, as the Crown submitted, or whether it established only that when he fired the shot, he had a hastily formed intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, having been startled by Mathew Hedges, as was submitted for Mr Tiriaki.  
8The Crown's case was that given the evidence as to the circumstances in which Mathew Hedges was killed by a single gun shot to the chest fired at close range, when considered with ballistic and other evidence, he must be sentenced on the basis of an intention to kill.
9The case advanced for Mr Tiriaki was that the evidence established that there was no premeditation to shoot, let alone to kill or harm; that the use of the loaded firearm was not the subject of overt agreement or understanding; that the firing of the shot was unplanned; that it was an unexpected development outside the scope of the offenders' joint criminal enterprise; and that the shot was fired in panic, without any great thought or contemplation, or intention to kill.  It was submitted that the one shot was fired in response to Mathew Hedges approaching the window while yelling, which was likely to have spooked Mr Tiriaki, with the result a stupid, reactive and senseless decision on his part.  In the result it was not open to find that he had formed an intention to kill.  
10It was also submitted that the aftermath of the shooting supported that conclusion, given the unprofessional and shambolic way that the things used in the offence had been disposed of at Mr Tiriaki's brother's house.  Mr Tiriaki's record and background also supported this conclusion.
11In Mr Tabbah's case there is a question as to whether the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt only that he had contemplated that Mr Tiriaki intended to threaten Mathew Hedges with the gun which he knew might be loaded, or that he had contemplated the possibility that Mr Tiriaki would discharge the gun.
12There was also an issue between the parties in relation to any finding of special circumstances, to which I will return.
Findings
13There was no issue between the parties that the evidence established that the offenders went to Mathew Hedges' home, having planned to rob him, either of drugs or money or both.  That was established by the evidence.  The offenders had masks, gloves, a loaded gun, a knife and other materials which would all be of assistance to them in such a robbery. Those were the things found by police at Mr Tiriaki's brother's home the next day, where Mr Tiriaki had disposed of them in a bin, on his evidence during the night before.  The knife was found on the ground nearby.  Mr Tiriaki and Mr Tabbah's DNA was later found on various of those items and on 6 March 2012 they were both arrested and charged with Mathew Hedges' murder.
14I am satisfied that the evidence did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tiriaki and Mr Tabbah went to Mathew Hedges' home having planned to kill him, but it does establish beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tiriaki did not act in panic when he shot Mathew Hedges and that he intended the likely result of the shot which he fired, namely death.  It also establishes beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tabbah contemplated the possibility that Mr Tiriaki would discharge the gun.
15The factual basis upon which the offenders are to be sentenced is as follows. 
16The offenders went to Mathew Hedges' home, having planned and prepared to rob him.  They first removed the fly screen of one of the lounge room windows.  At that time the lights in the lounge room were off, but the television was on and two young boys aged 15 and 16 years were in the room watching the TV.  
17One of the boys saw a shadow at the window and the other heard the noise of the fly screen being removed.  They both got up to have a look, one asking ""who's that?"" and the other hearing someone outside saying ""let me in"".  The boys heard the window being smashed and both fled.  Mr Tiriaki and Mr Tabbah did not.  They remained outside, waiting.
18One of the boys ran to get Mathew Hedges, who was asleep in his bedroom nearby, with his girlfriend, who was still awake and the other went to check on the other two children asleep in another bedroom in the house.  Mathew Hedges got up to investigate and went into the lounge room, closely followed by his girlfriend.  
19Mathew Hedges went straight towards the window, asking ""who the fuck is there?""  His girlfriend heard glass breaking and a shot being fired.  She saw Mathew Hedges drop to the ground and also felt the heat of the bullet passing her arm.  The bullet struck Mathew Hedges' finger, but that did not deflect the shot, which struck him in the chest, inflicting a fatal wound.  
20Mathew Hedges' mother had been woken by shouting and was getting up to investigate, when she heard the gunshot.  She ran to the lounge room where she found Mathew Hedges lying on the ground with a bullet wound to the chest. 
21It was only then that the two offenders fled on foot.
22This evidence establishes that Mr Tiriaki did not panic.  Having gone to Mathew Hedges' home to rob him, the offenders remained standing outside the window, even after they had disturbed the two boys watching TV in the lounge room.  Instead of leaving on being disturbed, they broke the window and asked to be let in.  They could have left when the boys ran to get help.  Instead, they remained outside, waiting at the window.  They did not flee even when Mathew Hedges entered the lounge room and approached the window, asking who was there.  It was then that Mr Tiriaki fired a fatal, single shot at close range, which hit Mathew Hedges in the chest.  It was only then that the offenders fled.
23Why Mr Tiriaki shot Mathew Hedges has never been explained.  What all of this evidence did establish beyond reasonable doubt, however, was that what the two offenders did that night was the result of planning, given what they were wearing and had taken with them; that it was contemplated that Mr Tiriaki would be armed with a loaded gun; that it might be discharged; that the shot which killed Mathew Hedges was fired deliberately; and that the shooting was not the result of any panic. 
24The offenders did not themselves physically ever enter the house and so they could have left at any time.  They broke into the house by removing the flyscreen and breaking the lounge room window while that room was illuminated by the television, which the boys were watching.  On the evidence they were unquestionably able to see into that room better than those inside could see out.  
25It is apparent from what they did that attracting the attention of those inside the house, was the offenders' purpose.  They had the opportunity to leave when they were detected, but instead they waited outside.  Even when Mathew Hedges entered the lounge room and approached the window, asking the offenders who was there, they could have left.  Instead Mr Tiriaki fired the shot which killed Mathew Hedges.  It was only then that the offenders departed.  
26This evidence not only establishes beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tabbah had contemplated that Mr Tiriaki would discharge the gun, it also proves beyond reasonable doubt that the result of the shot which Mr Tiriaki fired was likely to be more serious than merely grievous bodily harm.  It was not fired as the result of any panic, but deliberately and at close range, into Mathew Hedges' chest.  That establishes beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tiriaki intended the likely result of his actions, namely Mathew Hedges' death. 
27The two offenders must be sentenced in accordance with these findings.
The Court's sentencing task
28It is necessary to give some explanation of the sentencing task which the Parliament has imposed on this Court, to explain the sentences which will be imposed on the two offenders. 
29The sentence imposed on each offender must reflect the gravity of the particular offence which he has committed, viewed objectively (see R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354). 
30In arriving at that sentence the Court must bear in mind the purposes of sentencing specified in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Those purposes are: ""(a)  to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, (b)  to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, (c)  to protect the community from the offender, (d)  to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, (e)  to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, (f)  to denounce the conduct of the offender, (g)  to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community."" 

31Each sentence must be fixed in light of the maximum penalty applicable to the crime in question.  In the case of murder, that maximum is life imprisonment under s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). In the case of manslaughter, it is 25 years imprisonment under s 24 of the Crimes Act.32Section 61(1) of the Act requires that a sentence of life imprisonment be imposed on an offender, if the Court is satisfied that the offender's level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme, that the community's interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence. It is a matter for the Crown to establish that an offence falls within s 61(1) (see R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; 59 NSWLR 557).
33In this case the Crown did not seek the imposition of such a sentence on Mr Tiriaki, submitting that his offence fell at, or above, the mid-range of seriousness of such offences.  Mr Tiriaki's case was that it fell below the mid-range of such offences.  
34In Mr Tiriaki's case it must also be borne in mind that by s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the Parliament has imposed a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment for an offence of murder falling in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of such offences.  A non-parole period is the minimum period that an offender will serve in prison, before being eligible to be released on parole for the balance of the sentence imposed for the offence.  There is no standard non-parole period imposed for the offence of manslaughter.
35Both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period, in the case of Mr Tiriaki, are factors which must be taken into account on sentencing, as the High Court explained in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.   
36Under s 21A of the Act on sentencing the Court is also required to consider identified aggravating and mitigating factors revealed by the evidence in each case, as well as any other objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offender's offence.  Consideration must also be given to questions of general and specific deterrence in each case, as well as the principles of parity and totality, if relevant.  
37The sentence imposed on each offender must finally ensure that there is a reasonable proportionality between the sentence imposed and the circumstances of the particular crime committed (see R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152 at [15]). 
38Attention must also be paid to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which requires that the balance of the term of the sentence imposed on an offender must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period imposed, unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances which warrant a departure from that ratio.  
39If there is to be any such adjustment, it must not be such as to reduce the non-parole period below the minimum term which justice requires the offender to serve for the offence he has committed (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623 at 628).
Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006
40It is finally also necessary to mention the effect of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW), which applies to ""serious violence offences"", which include the offence of murder (see s 5A). The effect of this Act is that the State can apply to the Supreme Court for an order that the offender continue to receive supervision or remain in detention (see s 5E).  If the Court is then satisfied, to a high degree of probability, that the offender would be a ""high risk offender"", that is an offender who poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if not kept under supervision, it may make an order for extended supervision (see s 5F).  An order for continuing detention may be made if the Court is then satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order (see s 5G).
Victim Impact Statements
41Victim impact statements were received from Mathew Hedges' parents, which were both read in Court.  Mrs Hedges read her own statement.
42Both statements were moving.  Every person who heard them will have understood the sorrow, grief and anger which those who loved Mathew Hedges felt over his awful death and in Mrs Hedges' case, will have appreciated the very difficult task which she undertook in reading her statement out in open Court, in front of the offenders and members of the public present. 
43How these statements may be taken into account in this sentencing exercise will, I am sure, have been explained to Mathew Hedges' family, by reference to the case law which the parties are agreed must be applied to them and which I have followed (see R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76; MAH v R [2006] NSWCCA 226 at [60]-[62]; SBF v R [2009] NSWCCA 231; 198 A Crim R 219 at [89]-[90] and Josefski v R [2010] NSWCCA 41; 217 A Crim R 183 at [37]).
44It is to be hoped, however, that through these proceedings they  will all gain some peace of mind not only by an understanding of what the evidence has revealed about how Mathew Hedges came to be murdered, but also by their experience of how our society and its criminal justice system, has dealt with that terrible crime.
45For my own part, I extend to all of Mathew Hedges' family and friends, my deepest sympathy for his death, the loss which they have suffered and the very understandable grief and anguish it continues to cause them.
Mr Tabbah's case
46Mr Tabbah's case was that there was a complete dearth of evidence as to what had occurred before the two offenders arrived at Mathew Hedges' home and little explanation for his offence.  That was why, it was argued, his manslaughter would be found to have been committed on an aid and abet basis.
47Reliance was placed on the report provided by the forensic psychologist Mr Bradley Jones as to Mr Tabbah's background and history of offending, which had resulted in his institutionalisation and which would provide a basis for a finding of special circumstances in his case, as would his evidence of the conditions of custody in which he was held, which it was submitted were particularly punitive, and which would not promote his rehabilitation in the way that conditions of custody were ordinarily designed to promote.
48It was, however, accepted that Mr Tabbah's criminal history posed a difficulty on sentencing, showing as it did that on earlier occasions when released on parole, he had committed other offences shortly after release.  This, it was submitted, would be accepted as leading to the conclusion that there was a need for his eventual gradual release into the community during a period of extended parole, during which treatment for his conditions could be sought.  In the result protection of the community would not be considered paramount in his case.
The seriousness of Mr Tabbah's offence
49Sentencing Mr Tabbah raises questions of some complexity.  The sentencing task must begin by an assessment of the nature and seriousness of his offence.
50Mr Tiriaki and Mr Tabbah went to Mathew Hedges' home intending to rob him.  Drugs were found at Mathew Hedges' home and evidence was led which suggested that he was not only a drug user, but a drug supplier, who had been supplying drugs from his home.  That does not lessen the seriousness of Mr Tabbah's offence.  As Howie J discussed in R v Frazer [2007] NSWSC 1449 at [25]:""The criminal law does not discriminate between unlawful homicides on the basis of the effect upon the community of the death of the victim. It acts on the understanding that all life is precious and the taking of human life is of the greatest seriousness regardless of the identity of the victim or the impact of the death on others.""
51While Mr Tabbah's offence was less serious than the murder of which Mr Tiriaki was convicted, the evidence establishes that his was a very serious offence of manslaughter, resulting as it did in Mathew Hedges' death during the robbery which the two offenders had planned to commit together, by breaking in, late at night at Mathew Hedges' home, when he would be most vulnerable, while armed with a loaded gun.
52Instead of fleeing, as he could have, when they were detected by the two boys awake inside the lounge room, Mr Tabbah remained to assist Mr Tiriaki, knowing that he had a loaded gun and contemplating that the gun would be discharged, as I have explained.  That must all be taken into account when sentencing Mr Tabbah.
53In Mr Tabbah's case the jury's verdict reflects that it was not established beyond reasonable doubt that he intended Mathew Hedges to suffer death or serious injury as a result of his own actions.  That may not be overlooked when sentencing Mr Tabbah for his offence.  Nevertheless, as I have explained, the evidence establishes that Mr Tabbah's moral culpability for his serious offending was also unquestionably high and must be reflected in the sentence imposed upon him.
54Like murder, manslaughter also involves the unlawful killing of another person.  The maximum penalty imposed by the Parliament for that offence is, as I have said, 25 years imprisonment.  That is a statutory guidepost which must be considered as one of the many factors which must be taken into account in arriving at a proper sentence in Mr Tabbah's case.  There is, however, no standard non-parole period for this offence.  Nor is it possible to identify a range of sentences for manslaughter offences of which account should be taken, given the nature of such offences. 
Aggravating factors
55There are however, various aggravating factors specified in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which must be taken into account when sentencing Mr Tabbah.  They include that:(d)  the offender has a record of previous convictions;(e)  the offence was committed in company;(ea) the offence was committed in the presence of a child under 18 years of age;(eb)  the offence was committed in the victim's home;(g)  the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial;(j)  the offence was committed while the offender was on conditional liberty in relation to an offence or alleged offence;(n) the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity.

56The evidence of what the offenders had with them when they went to Mathew Hedges' home established that the offence was the result of prior planning, as I have already said.  Mr Tabbah was in company with Mr Tiriaki when they broke into Mathew Hedges' home, where he was with his children, nephews, girlfriend and mother.  Mr Tabbah's offence unquestionably resulted in substantial harm to them all. That the offence was committed even though the presence of children became apparent to the offenders when they were breaking into the lounge room, must also be taken into account. 
57Also to be taken into account is that Mr Tabbah has a long and serious criminal record, commencing in 2004.  His offences include serious driving offences, assault, destroying or damaging property, robbery in company, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, robbery while armed with an offensive weapon, and assaulting law enforcement officers. 
58Since 2005 he has been released on parole three times.  On two prior occasions he has committed further offences while on parole and had his parole thereupon revoked.  On this occasion he had been released on parole in November 2011 and was still on parole when he committed this offence in December 2011.  
59Mr Tabbah has also repeatedly been dealt with for offences committed while in custody, including fighting, assaults and damage to property.  His offending includes an offence under s 60A of the Crimes Act of assaulting an officer, whilst in custody on remand for this matter.  He has entered a plea for that offence, for which he is yet to be sentenced.  
60This serious record certainly permits no leniency in Mr Tabbah's sentencing exercise.
Mitigating factors
61No mitigating matters specified in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were identified to be relevant on Mr Tabbah's sentencing, but it was submitted that it was proper to take account of the efficiency of the conduct of his trial, given that the only cross-examination which was pursued related principally to DNA evidence.  While that did not evidence remorse, it evidenced a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, which it was proper to take into account in his favour.  
62In R v Doff [2005] NSWCCA 119 at [58] the view was taken that the making of extensive admissions and refraining from resort to technical objections of no merit did show a willingness to facilitate the course of justice.  In other cases it has been recognised that where trials have been shortened by the reduction in the number of witnesses required, or the way in which technical evidence was adduced ""in short hand fashion"", that, too, is appropriate to take into account as facilitating the course of justice. 
63In Mr Tabbah's case, I accept that some account should be taken of the efficient way in which this trial was conducted on his part.  The approach adopted was, it must be accepted, in contrast to that adopted in Mr Tiriaki's case.
Mr Tabbah's personal circumstances
64Mr Tabbah's personal circumstances must also be taken into account on sentencing.  He is still a young man, aged only 22 at the time of this offence.
65Unchallenged affidavit evidence was given on sentencing by Mr Tabbah as to his onerous conditions in custody.  Mr Bradley Jones' report was also tendered.  
66The history which Mr Tabbah gave Mr Jones was not given by way of sworn evidence.  Ordinarily such accounts must be approached with some caution, given that it has not been tested.  In this case, however, Mr Tabbah gave affidavit evidence on sentencing and was not required for cross-examination and so the history he gave Mr Jones must be accepted as unchallenged. 
67Mr Tabbah's evidence established that he first went into juvenile detention in February 2005.  He was released in April 2006 and returned to custody in August 2006.  He was again released in November 2006.  He went into adult custody in February 2008.  He then spent a year in segregation and received a maximum security classification.  In September 2009 he received an extremely high security designation.  He was released in November 2011.
68While in adult custody Mr Tabbah was placed in the Individual Violent Offender Intervention Program and was held in the Security Threat Group Intervention Program.  Since returning to custody in March 2012 he has again been given a High Risk Management Unit designation and was placed in the High Risk Management Unit.  Since then he has been out of segregation for only about three months.  He has also been placed on Behaviour Level Management Programs.  
69Mr Tabbah's evidence was that his custody in the High Risk Management Unit is more onerous than when he had an extremely high security designation.  This affects the number and basis upon which he can receive non-legal visits.  He is not permitted to have food or drinks brought to him during such visits.  Those to whom he makes telephone calls must be approved.  He does not have access to the gym or oval and he is held in custody in small spaces, as the result of which, he says, he has developed short sightedness.  He has limited opportunity to associate with other inmates and then for a maximum of two hours per day.  As a result he feels depressed and lonely.  He has more limited opportunity to spend money on buy ups and is barred from having all of his personal property and electrical items.  
70Mr Tabbah also described his conditions of escort, which involve him being strip searched, handcuffed and shackled at the ankles, while guarded in a modified vehicle.  Those conditions have not altered from those which applied when he had an extremely high security designation.  Nor has his access to other activities.  He is still not able to participate in religious activities in the way that those who do not have such restrictions are permitted to do.  He also has no access to education and training courses, apart from English language studies and has no opportunity to work.
71Mr Jones' report outlined a history given by Mr Tabbah, of being one of two children, raised in a strict environment, where corporal punishment was regularly used by his father.  He has never met his sister and has had no contact with his mother since he was aged four years, when his parents separated.  He was largely raised by his grandmother and described having a violent and abusive relationship with his father.  He reported having had a restrictive upbringing and that when he engaged in delinquent behaviour, he was beaten with fists, sticks and other implements.  
72Mr Tabbah developed antisocial behaviours as an adolescent, to gain peer acceptance.  His increasing anger and aggression resulted in early cessation of schooling and the development of an ""us against them"" view, which unfortunately, has carried into adulthood.  
73Mr Tabbah denies any drug or alcohol abuse.  He reported experiencing significant inexplicable anger from approximately 12 years of age, which has continued.  He reports that he then began associating with older peers and began engaging in fighting, to appear cool and be liked.  He was academically average at school, but was often disciplined for disruptive behaviour.  He was expelled from school in year eight for fighting and soon afterwards went into juvenile detention, when aged 15.  He has never pursued other education or employment, as the result of his frequent incarceration.
74Mr Tabbah has engaged in many fights while in custody and says that he has experienced racial vilification and abuse from other inmates, which was not sanctioned by staff, but resulted in him not being able to control or manage his intense anger.  The result was that extreme force has had to be used on occasion to subdue him.  On one occasion he was seriously assaulted.  He also quickly developed strong anger towards prison officers and an ""us and them"" approach.
75Mr Tabbah acknowledged being easily angered by trivial events and almost immediately responding with violence, as the result of which he would escalate the violence and sustain serious injuries.  He has had many periods of incarceration for violent offences as a result, as well as negative interaction with prison officers while in custody.
76Mr Tabbah also said that he had suffered significant head and facial injuries in prison; that he had been beaten unconscious; and that he twice believed he would be killed.  He reported experiencing agitation day and night without triggers, nightmares, flashback memories of previous assaults and panic responses when approached by prison officers.
77Mr Jones' opinion was that Mr Tabbah was likely to have become institutionalised, having spent approximately six and a half years in custody since aged 15 years.  He explained that this is a process where an inmate is shaped and transformed by the institutional environment in which they live in custody, with the result that the norms of prison life are incorporated into habits of thinking, feeling and acting.  To survive the prison experience, the inmate culture, patterns of behaviour and interacting with others are internalised, in ways which may be counterproductive outside prison.  
78Mr Jones explained that this process may have more effects on those who enter institutions early in life, with significant psychological costs the result.  Release can then be traumatic, with disorientation resulting, as well as behaviours counterproductive to re-entry into the community, whose effects impede successful reintegration.  Mr Jones considered that:
""Regrettably, further incarceration of Mr Tabbah is likely to solidifying (sic) a personal identity that runs counter to the prosocial identity he will need to successfully navigate his re-entry into society.""
79In the result Mr Jones assessed Mr Tabbah as posing a high risk of committing further violent offences.  He diagnosed him to be suffering intermittent explosive disorder, antisocial personality disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder 
80Mr Jones also considered that treatment in custody to manage and decrease his risk of recidivism would be in Mr Tabbah's interest, but that treatment of his symptoms could only occur to a limited capacity, given the nature of correctional facilities and the difficulty of providing him the necessary treatment there.  In Mr Jones' view such treatment could only be appropriately provided in the community, with strict compliance with a treatment plan.
Deterrence
81The circumstances of Mr Tabbah's offence and his personal circumstances are such that ordinarily there could be no question that both general and specific deterrence must feature in the sentence which is imposed upon him.
82Given the evidence of Mr Tabbah's mental disorders there must, however, in my view be some lesser weight given to the role which general deterrence plays in his sentence (see Muldrock at [53] - [54]).  Nevertheless, I take the view that some account must be taken of such deterrence, because on the accounts which Mr Tabbah gave Mr Jones, it is apparent that he does have insight into his behaviour and understands the gravity of his actions, when he acts violently towards others (see R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 51 - 52).
83Also to be considered is that Mr Tabbah unquestionably poses a very serious risk of committing further, serious offences of violence, both while in custody and on release.  Mr Tabbah, on his own account, has not only a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law which binds us all, but also appears to have uncontrollable rage, the response to which is repeated, serious violence. 
84I am satisfied that in his sentence it follows that considerable  weight must accordingly be given to personal deterrence and the protection of the community (see: Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477 and R v Rice [2004] NSWCCA 384; 150 A Crim R 37 at [26]; R v Abboud [2005] NSWCCA 251 at [33]; R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at [54]).
Totality and parity
85It was submitted for Mr Tabbah that he had spent a considerable period in custody before committing this offence; that the Court must be mindful of not imposing a crushing sentence upon him; and that while a significant custodial sentence must be imposed upon him, the principle of totality applied.  Accordingly, he should be sentenced so as not to put at risk any incentive that he might have to rehabilitate himself; not to induce a feeling of hopelessness; and not to destroy any expectation that he may have a useful life after release.
86Despite these submissions, I am satisfied that the principle of totality does not arise for consideration in Mr Tabbah's case.  Totality is a principle of sentencing concerned with multiple offending, but it does not arise to be considered simply because an offender has a long, serious criminal record of repeated offending in the past.
87In Mr Tabbah's case, the position is that he was sentenced in 2008 to a four year term, which expired on 17 February 2012.  He was not released on parole until 14 November 2011, because of sentences imposed on him in September 2009 for other offences, the first of which expired on 17 February 2012 and the second on 14 November 2011, when he was released on parole.  
88This offence was committed in December 2011, after Mr Tabbah's release on parole for his 2008 offence.  That parole was never revoked and may not be considered as having been notionally revoked (see Skondin v R [2006] NSWCCA 59 at [16] - [17]). 
89Mr Tabbah's sentence for his 2008 offence expired on 17 February 2012.  He was arrested on 6 March 2012 and charged with Mr Hedges' murder.  He has been held in custody solely referable to the offence for which he is now being sentenced, until he committed another offence in custody, to which he has now pleaded guilty and for which he will be sentenced in the District Court, after this sentence has been imposed.
90It follows that while the principle of totality will arise to be considered in that further sentencing exercise in the District Court, the principle  does not apply in this sentencing exercise, given that Mr Tabbah's last sentence expired on 17 February 2012; that his parole for his 2008 offence was never revoked; and that on 6 March 2012 he was arrested and held in custody referable to this offence.
91Accordingly, I have not taken the principle of totality into account in this exercise.
92That Mr Tabbah and Mr Tiriaki were co-offenders engaged in the same criminal enterprise when Mathew Hedges was shot, means that the parity principle requires consideration.  
93Applying the parity principle when co-offenders are convicted of different offences raises particular difficulties (see Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 and Jimmy v R (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [230]).  The principle seeks to ensure that even though different sentences must be imposed upon the offenders, given the different offences for which they are being sentenced and the differences in their particular circumstances, which must be taken into account in their respective cases, that the sentences imposed also endeavour to ensure that justice is done between them.  I have accordingly taken account of the principle of parity in sentencing Mr Tabbah.
Special circumstances
94Mr Tabbah submitted that special circumstances would be found in his case, notwithstanding his entrenched recidivism, given the harsh and onerous nature of his custody, the evidence of his institutionalisation and the evidence that his rehabilitation would be furthered by an extended period of supervision, where he would benefit from treatment not likely to be available to him in custody.
95I accept that the evidence does establish that Mr Tabbah's custody will be harsh.  This evidence and the opinions expressed by Mr Jones as to Mr Tabbah's institutionalisation and his need for considerable treatment, if his repeated resort to serious violence is to have any prospect of being brought under control, must be properly to be taken into account, in deciding whether special circumstances should be found in his case.  I also accept that the evidence establishes that Mr Tabbah has suffered social, educational, psychological and occupational disadvantages in his relatively young life and that he is at considerable risk of further institutionalisation, entrenched recidivism and serious reoffending, given his uncontrollable anger and resort to violence.  
96I have given these matters careful consideration and have concluded that while a relatively lengthy sentence must be imposed upon him for his serious offence, he will need a long period of careful supervision in order to re-adjust back into the community, to ensure that he receives necessary treatment and does not re-offend.  There is, however, a minimum period which he must spend in custody to reflect the seriousness of his crime.  Accordingly, there can only be a small reduction to the non-parole period to which he will be sentenced, that being the minimum period which Mr Tabbah must spend in custody for his serious offence.
97Accordingly, I do find special circumstances. The resulting adjustment to the non-parole period is intended to result in Mr Tabbah receiving a sufficient period of conditional and supervised liberty, to assist in the protection of the community on his release and to maximise the prospect that he will not reoffend, by pursuing treatment not readily available to him in custody.  
98Whether Mr Tabbah becomes eligible for such parole at the end of his non-parole period will, of course, depend on his ongoing conduct in custody.  That lies entirely in his own hands.
Mr Tiriaki's case
99Mr Tiriaki's case was that it would be concluded that he had not fired the shot which killed Mathew Hedges without premeditation or planning; that Mr Tabbah's manslaughter conviction compels the conclusion that the robbery did not involve, to Mr Tabbah's knowledge, the use of a firearm, or at least a loaded firearm; that firing of the shot was unexpected, unplanned and outside the scope of their joint criminal enterprise; that it was probably fired in panic and without substantial thought or contemplation; and that there was no intention to kill, but only a hastily formed intention to cause grievous bodily harm.  It was submitted that the objective seriousness of his offence would be assessed to have been below the mid-range.
100The presence of Mathew Hedges' family when he was killed in his home was accepted to be an aggravating factor, which had to be taken into account, but that the fact that Mathew Hedges had brought illegal substances into his home, from where he sold them while his family lived there, was submitted to render this aggravating factor less serious than it would otherwise have been.
101Given Mr Tiriaki's relevant subjective factors, including his age, lack of serious prior criminal record, medical conditions and mental state, it was submitted that it would be concluded that there was considerable room still for leniency in sentencing him; that rehabilitation was possible; and that on release Mr Tiriaki would not pose a danger to society.  In the result, special circumstances would be found, so that Mr Tiriaki would receive close, extended supervision upon release from custody to parole.
The seriousness of Mr Tiriaki's offence
102As I have explained, the maximum sentence of life imprisonment is reserved for extreme offences of murder. This was explained in R v Lewis [2001] NSWCCA 448, where it was observed at [60]:
""Because the life sentence provided by s.61 of that Act does not contemplate any prospect of relief in the future, no matter how distant, it should be reserved for crimes of the utmost heinousness: Chung [1999] NSWCCA 330, Ibbs v. R. (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-2, Twala NSWCCA 4/11/94, Fernando (1997) 95 A Crim R 553 at pars.344-4 Harris at 423.""

103In Mr Tiriaki's case, I am satisfied that the Crown's submissions as to the objective seriousness of his offence must be accepted. This was a very serious offence, involving as I have explained the murder of a young man, shot late at night at close range in the chest, after being woken by intruders there to rob him, when he was at his most vulnerable, asleep with his family in his own home.  Nevertheless, while I am satisfied that this was clearly a very serious example of murder, the parties' common ground that the evidence established that this is not a case of the most extreme kind, for which a life sentence must be imposed, must be accepted. 
104The 20 years standard non-parole period and the maximum sentence of life imprisonment for the offence of murder are statutory guideposts which must be taken into account, as I have explained in sentencing Mr Tiriaki.  The evidence unquestionably reveals that objectively, this was a very serious offence, in my assessment falling somewhat above the mid-range of such offences.   
105As I explained earlier, that the offenders went to Mathew Hedges' home intending to rob him of drugs or money, does not ameliorate the seriousness of this cold blooded killing of a defenseless man, woken late at night by his nephews, who had disturbed the offenders, while he was asleep at his home, where he ought to have been safe.  
106On the evidence this was an offence quite out of character for Mr Tiriaki, given his background and prior record, to which I will return.  Whatever be the explanation for the decisions which led him to commit this awful offence in December 2011, Mr Tiriaki's moral culpability for this serious offending was unquestionably high.  
107While the evidence did not establish that the offenders went to Mathew Hedges' home having planned to kill him, as I have explained the robbery that they went there to commit was planned and the shot which Mr Tiriaki fired was not fired in panic, but deliberately.  Mr Tiriaki waited outside with Mr Tabbah, instead of fleeing as he could have when they were detected by the two boys, remaining even when they ran to get help and when Mathew Hedges entered the lounge room to investigate.  Mr Tiriaki then deliberately shot Mathew Hedges to the chest at close range, intending the likely result of the shot which he fired, namely the death which followed.  Mr Tiriaki's moral culpability for that awful offending was unarguably significant, which must be reflected in the sentence imposed upon him.
 Aggravating factors
108The various aggravating factors specified in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which must be considered in Mr Tiriaki's sentencing exercise are that:(d)  the offender has a record of previous convictions;(e)  the offence was committed in company;(ea) the offence was committed in the presence of a child under 18 years of age;(eb)  that it was committed in the victim's home;(g)  the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial;(j)  the offence was committed while the offender was on conditional liberty in relation to an offence or alleged offence;(n) the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity.

109That Mathew Hedges' two nephews and two of his young children were at his home with his mother and girlfriend, when he was killed must be taken into account.  As I have explained that children were present became apparent when the offenders were disturbed.  That they were all substantially harmed by this awful experience must also properly be taken into account in this sentencing exercise.
110Mr Tiriaki does not have a serious record like that of his co-offender, but he has not led a blameless life.  On the evidence of his sister and brother, this offence was, however, out of character, committed at a time when his brother had warned Mr Tiriaki against pursuing his association with certain persons.  That was certainly good advice, which Mr Tiriaki regrettably did not heed. 
111Mr Tiriaki has a limited record of convictions, including driving offences, an aggravated break and enter in company offence in 2007 and an assault in 2008.  He was also on a bond at the time he committed this offence.  This will be his first custodial sentence.  This record must be taken into account, but I accept, as was submitted for Mr Tiriaki, it is a record which still permits some leniency in this sentencing exercise.
Mitigating factors
112Mitigating matters which may be taken into account on sentencing Mr Tiriaki specified in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act include that:
(g)  the offender is unlikely to re-offend,
(h)    the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender's age or otherwise.
 113Given the evidence of Mr Tiriaki's past, including his past work background, pursued despite the serious injury he suffered to his back as a child, the absence of alcohol or serious drug abuse, his family background, their continuing support, and that in custody Mr Tiriaki has pursued education opportunities available to him and has not committed further offences, I am of the view that there is room for hope that Mr Tiriaki has prospects of rehabilitation and that he will not reoffend in future.  
114That will, of course, finally depend on him and the choices which he makes in the future, including whether he chooses to pursue his use of illicit drugs and association with other offenders.  With the ongoing support of his family, I consider that there are prospects that he will take a different path in the future.
115Given the serious nature and circumstances of this offence, however, a murder committed in pursuit of drugs for financial gain through robbery, for which Mr Tiriaki has never accepted any responsibility, there is no basis in the evidence on which a positive conclusion can presently be formed that he is unlikely to reoffend.  His prospects of rehabilitation have to be assessed in the light of that conclusion, but still I consider that rehabilitation is possible, particularly given Dr Neilssen's opinion, to which I will return, but it is not certain.
Mr Tiriaki's personal circumstances
116Mr Tiriaki's personal circumstances must also be considered.  Evidence was led from his brother.  Medical reports relating to the back injury which he suffered in a car accident while aged 12 years were tendered, as well as a report from the psychiatrist, Dr Nielssen, who had examined Mr Tiriaki.  A letter from Chaplain Farhan Khalil was also tendered.  
117Mr Tiriaki is a young man who was aged only 21 at the time of this offence.  The medical reports of Dr Gerard Glancey and Dr Peter Conrad from 2005 - 2007, confirm the serious injury which Mr Tiriaki suffered as a child and its ongoing physical consequences for him over time, about which his brother also gave evidence.  Dr Glancey's opinion was that Mr Tiriaki's decline in behaviour at school and the anti-authoritarian attitudes he developed were attributable to the consequences of his back injury, as was his drug use and lack of social skills. 
118His brother said that this injury and the ongoing pain it caused had adversely affected Mr Tiriaki's performance at school, which had also been adversely affected by his intellectual difficulties.  To his brother's knowledge, Mr Tiriaki self medicated that pain through the use of cannabis.  This injury had stopped Mr Tiriaki pursuing ten pin bowling, at which he had excelled, placing third in Australia, as well as other sports.  The result was that he left school to pursue an apprenticeship at TAFE, which he could not complete because of ongoing back pain, which had been exacerbated when Mr Tiriaki was injured in another car accident not long before this offence.  Despite this Mr Tiriaki had a great interest in cars, which he pursued successfully and which ensured that he always had gainful work, either for others, or on his own account.  This evidence corroborated evidence which Mr Tiriaki had himself given at trial.
119These circumstances help explain how Mr Tiriaki came to be associated with persons involved in drug supply and, ultimately, his involvement in the robbery during which he committed the murder for which he is now being sentenced.  Mr Tiriaki had been counselled against pursuing those associations, to no avail.  He comes from a stable and supportive family background and continues to have that support, even while he is in custody. 
120Chaplain Khalil wrote that he had come to know Mr Tiriaki while he was in custody; that he had regularly attended chapel and that they had spoken together in the yard.  The Chaplain said that he found Mr Tiriaki to be eager to learn about faith and to live his life according to such teachings.
121Dr Nielssen examined Mr Tiriaki in September 2014.  Mr Tiriaki did not give evidence and so his account to Dr Nielssen must be approached with some caution.  
122Mr Tiriaki did not admit to Dr Nielssen of having had any responsibility for Mathew Hedges' murder.  He gave Dr Nielssen a history of marijuana use from age 18, his intake increasing to three joints a day after suffering the further injury to his back in a car accident.  He reported a stable and supportive family background and employment as a repairer of non-insured cars.  He reported a criminal record for an assault when aged 18 and drive while disqualified offences.  He also reported a psychiatric history of depression after his back injury, but no history of mental illness.  There had been a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression after the back injury.  
123Dr Nielssen diagnosed substance use disorder, a depressive illness and a possible learning disorder.  His opinion was that Mr Tiriaki suffers a substance use disorder, having a history of daily use of cannabis; of complications of substance use, which brought him into contact with other drug users, including a former girlfriend who had a drug problem and possibly with Mr Tabbah, who it was clear had a severe conduct disorder and a pattern of antisocial conduct as an adult.  
124Dr Nielssen also found a history of a depressive illness after Mr Tiriaki's back injury in adolescence.  He had been diagnosed with depression by a doctor he saw soon after reception into custody.  There was also a diagnosis of a possible learning disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but Dr Nielssen noted that he had been able to become a capable mechanic, with good concentration on tasks that interested him.  
125Dr Nielssen concluded that:""Mr Tiriaki was thought to have good prospects of rehabilitation on the basis of the absence of a pattern of antisocial conduct from adolescence, or a severe form of substance use disorder associated with past offending, which are the main predictors of recidivism, and his account of continuous employment from the time he left school.""  
Deterrence
126Mr Tiriaki's mental health issues and the evidence as to the adverse consequences which they will have for him in custody, particularly given his ongoing back pain, must be taken into account in approaching the role that deterrence must play in his sentence.
127I have concluded that given the gravity of Mr Tiriaki's offence and the circumstances in which it occurred, there can be no question that both general and specific deterrence must feature in the sentence which is imposed on him, notwithstanding Dr Nielssen's opinions.  
128I have concluded that the role which general deterrence must play in Mr Tiriaki's sentence must be somewhat ameliorated, but that it cannot be overlooked entirely.  Specific deterrence and protection of the community are, however, important in Mr Tiriaki's case, given the nature and seriousness of his offence.
Totality and parity
129The principle of totality arises to be considered in Mr Tiriaki's case.  He was arrested on 6 March 2012, but was later sentenced in the Local Court to 3 months' imprisonment from that date, for driving offences, in circumstances where other sentences were not practically available to impose upon him.
130I can, however, see no reason why the sentence imposed for this offence should be made concurrent with the sentence imposed for the driving offences.  Those offences were committed after Mathew Hedges' murder at a time when he was on a bond for driving offences and are entirely unrelated to that offence.  
131Accordingly, I have concluded that the sentence for this offence will commence on 5 June 2012.
132The principal of parity also arises to be considered in Mr Tiriaki's case.  Mr Tiriaki has been convicted of an offence of murder, an offence considered by the Parliament to be much more serious than that of manslaughter, as the respective maximum sentences imposed for the two offences and the standard non-parole period which applies to the offence of murder, reveals.  That must be reflected in the sentences respectively imposed.
133I have however taken the parity principle into account in arriving at Mr Tiriaki's sentence, as one of the matters to which regard must be paid in his sentencing exercise, given the need to endeavour to ensure that justice is done between the two offenders, notwithstanding the different offences of which they have been convicted and their very different personal circumstances, which must be reflected in the sentences imposed on each of them.
Special circumstances
134Mr Tiriaki's case was that special circumstances would be found in his case, given the lengthy sentence which he faces, this being his first time in custody; his diagnosis of depression; the deterioration in his physical health, including his significant weight loss since going into custody, despite increased appetite being a side effect of the antidepressant medication he has been prescribed; the worsening of his back condition and lack of access to physiotherapy treatment.  
135I accept that given the serious offence which Mr Tiriaki has committed, his first time in custody will be lengthy and his sentence will be served in difficult circumstances, while suffering chronic, ongoing back pain, for which he will not have ready access to the treatment which he usually received.  
136I have concluded that given his age and health, what I have said about re-offending and rehabilitation, and the obvious need for him to have an extended period of supervision on release from custody, there should be a finding of special circumstances and a short departure from what the usual ratio would result in, by way of a non-parole period, which is the minimum period that Mr Tiriaki must serve in custody for his serious offence.
 Mr Tabbah's sentence
137In Mr Tabbah's case, having considered all of the matters I have mentioned, I have concluded that the sentence for his offence must commence on 6 March 2012.
138The total term of his imprisonment will be 14 years, with a non-parole period of 10 years. The result is that the earliest date that Mr Tabbah will be eligible for release for his offence is 25 March 2022.  His release will depend firstly on the sentence to be imposed on him for the s 60A offence, for which he is yet to be sentenced and secondly when eligible for release, on him convincing the Parole Authority that he should be then released on parole.  His sentence will expire on 5 March 2026.
Mr Tiriaki's sentence
139In Mr Tiriaki's case, having considered all of the matters I have mentioned, I have concluded that the sentence for his offence must commence on 5 June 2012.
140The total term of his imprisonment will be 28 years, with a non-parole period of 20 years. The result is that the earliest date that Mr Tiriaki will be eligible for release for his offence is 4 June 2032.  His release will depend on him convincing the Parole Authority that he should be then released on parole.  His sentence will expire on 4 June 2040.

		10 December 2014",2014-12-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765530,Dudgeon v R [2014] NSWCCA 301,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  The applicant in this matter has terminal cancer and, on the latest information available to the Court, has a very short time to live.  Fullerton J, whose draft reasons I have had the opportunity of reading and with which I agree, has found that the applicant's medical condition pre-dated his sentence.  The Court, therefore, was entitled to receive fresh evidence relating to his medical condition and is empowered to re-sentence the applicant on the medical evidence now before the Court. 
2As Fullerton J has explained in her judgment, on 13 May 2013, the applicant pleaded guilty of two counts of aggravated break, enter and steal contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 in the District Court.  The offences were committed whilst the applicant was on parole for a series of armed robberies.  The offences were, correctly, in my opinion, assessed by the sentencing judge as being above the mid-range of objective seriousness. 
3The sentencing judge imposed a total effective sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years to date from 8 November 2012, the day of his arrest.  Under the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge, the first date on which the applicant will be eligible for release is 7 November 2017.  Fullerton J has described that sentence as ""very lenient"".   
4Giving its leniency, in normal circumstances there would have been no basis for this Court to interfere with the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge.  The conduct involved in the offending was serious and the offences were committed whilst on parole for armed robbery offences.  The applicant has a longstanding criminal record and a history of re-offending.  However, the applicant's circumstances as they are now presented to the Court in the further evidence reveal that he is seriously and terminally ill and he may not survive into the new year.  His treatment in his present custodial arrangements is far from optimum.   
5This has presented the Court with a difficult sentencing task.  Had the sentencing task involved a free standing discretion, the Court may well have considered that it was appropriate that the applicant be immediately released to parole.  However, the Court is required to sentence the applicant in accordance with proper sentencing principles.  Whilst that task is appropriately evaluative, it does not entitle the Court to disregard, amongst other things, the seriousness of the offending conduct, including that it was committed whilst the applicant was on bail.  Fullerton J's remarks at [25]-[26] give expression to this.  For the reasons her Honour gives, I consider that the sentence she proposes is appropriate. 
6The views that the Court has expressed through Fullerton J's reasons does not preclude the applicant making an application to the Parole Board for his immediate release.  Although the Parole Board did not see fit to release the applicant on his last application, his medical condition has since deteriorated.  Fullerton J has helpfully set out by way of schedules to her judgment, a chronology and a summary of the material that was before the Court outlining the applicant's accommodation, treatment, care and support should he be released.   
7Should the applicant make a further application to the Parole Board, it might be presumed that the Parole Board would have before it material that was up to date at that time as to the applicant's condition and circumstances.  However, Fullerton J's schedules could well be of considerable assistance and consideration should be given to providing the judgment and the schedules to the Parole Board, should a further application be made. 
8HIDDEN J:  I agree with Fullerton J.
9FULLERTON J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court on 13 May 2013 after pleading guilty in the Local Court to two counts of aggravated break, enter and steal contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  That offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years.  A further offence of goods in custody was taken into account on a Form 1 on the first of those counts. 
10After allowing a discount of 25 per cent for his pleas of guilty, and after a finding of special circumstances and an order of partial accumulation of twelve months, the applicant was sentenced to an effective sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years to date from 8 November 2012, the date of his arrest.  He will be first eligible for release to parole on 7 November 2017. 
11The first of the two offences of aggravated break, enter and steal was committed on 18 October 2012.  The feature of aggravation in respect of that offending was constituted by the applicant tying the victim's wrists with a belt and ankles with a power cord and placing a bag over his head after entering his home through a window armed with a knife.  Thereafter the applicant demanded money and threatened to slit the throats of the victim's housemates if they returned home.  He then ransacked the house, looking for money and other valuables, and stole a large amount of property including $950 in cash together with jewellery and electronic goods to the value of $6,000. 
12The second offence was committed on 7 November 2012, again when the applicant entered the victim's home through a window.  The victim of that offence returned home to find the applicant endeavouring to remove a portable safe.  He was also armed with a knife on that occasion which he used to threaten the victim.  The feature of aggravation in respect of that count was the infliction of physical violence when, in response to the victim calling out to neighbours to help, the applicant punched him to the face causing swelling and lacerations. 
13The offence on the Form 1 concerned the applicant's possession of various goods suspected of being stolen, including a Pentax camera, camera lenses and a flash attachment.  
14The offences were assessed by the sentencing judge as being slightly above the mid range of objective seriousness.
15Both offences were committed whist the applicant was on parole for a series of armed robberies for which he received an effective sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years in 2006.  He was released to parole on 20 December 2011.  The State Parole Authority revoked his parole on 29 November 2012.  The balance of parole expired on 26 October 2014.  Given the date of commencement of the sentence imposed on the first count the balance of parole was served wholly concurrently with the effective sentence imposed for both counts.
16The applicant gave evidence on sentence and relied upon a report from Laura Durkin, a forensic psychologist.  It was on the basis of what his Honour described as Ms Durkin's detailed, objective and insightful clinical examination of the applicant that he made the finding of special circumstances, despite the applicant's lengthy criminal history and poor response to supervision in the past.  
17The following features of the applicant's subjective case were established by the evidence led on sentence.
18The applicant was aged 39 at time of sentence.  He had an extensive criminal record including lengthy periods of imprisonment, in addition to the armed robberies earlier referred to.  The sentencing judge noted that since the age of 25 the applicant has been in continuous custody other than for short periods of time invariably in circumstances where he came to adverse notice.  
19The applicant has a chronic drug addiction extending from his mid-teens to the time of his offending.  His past offending and the offending the subject of the sentence proceedings is drug-related.  On his release from custody in December 2011 it would appear the applicant was abstinent for a period of time but that he struggled to adjust in the immediate post-release phase to community life which was complicated by his chronic depression and anxiety.  The sentencing judge accepted he has a history of a depressive illness for which he has been medicated from time to time.  The applicant's various and, it would seem, valiant attempts at extricating himself from drug abuse in the past have been compromised by what the reporting psychologist described as ""numerous psychosocial stressors"". 
20It would appear from the sentencing remarks that the sentencing judge was impressed by the applicant, and acceded to the applicant's request that he be given ""one last chance"" in his determination to avoid reverting to drugs by affording him some leniency in the fixing of sentence.  His Honour was apparently satisfied that over the six months of the applicant's most recent remand he had taken concerted and sustained steps to remain abstinent from drugs, including electing to be housed on a limited association basis to avoid the risk of negative interaction with other prisoners. 
21The sole ground of appeal concerns what I am satisfied on the evidence led on the appeal, supplemented by evidence obtained at the Court's request after the hearing of the appeal, is the fact that the applicant is suffering from terminal cancer and is not expected to survive beyond a period measured in months as at the date of publication of these sentencing reasons.  I am also satisfied, contrary to the Crown's submissions on the appeal, that his terminal illness was extant as at the date of sentence but that it was undiagnosed at that time and remained undiagnosed until 24 October 2013, that is, five months after he was sentenced.
22For ease of reference I have attached a chronology of the accused's various dealings with Justice Health and other specialist physicians from 23 December 2012 to the most current report from a treating specialist in September 2014 which substantiates that finding (Schedule 1 to this judgment).
23I am also satisfied, that the jurisdiction of this Court is properly invoked and it was appropriate to receive the full complement of the applicant's medical records as fresh evidence on the appeal (including the materials furnished after the hearing of the appeal) and to reopen the question of an appropriate sentence in light of that evidence, including evidence bearing upon the circumstances which will make the applicant's continued incarceration more burdensome than would be the case were he in good health (see Iglesias v R [2006] NSWCCA 261 at [1]-[13]).  Were I not persuaded that the applicant's terminal illness predated the date of sentencing, this Court would have no jurisdiction to receive fresh evidence bearing on his medical condition or to move to re-sentence on the basis of that evidence.  Where a terminal illness is diagnosed after sentence and cannot be shown on the available medical evidence to have been extant at the date of sentence, the custodial conditions a prisoner in that situation may have to endure is a matter for the executive (see R v Achurch [2011] NSWCCA 186; 216 A Crim R 152 at [124]-[126]).  
24Affording full weight to the evidence relied upon by the applicant in support of his immediate release (a summary of the evidence is annexed as Schedule 2 to these reasons), the remaining and critical question in exercising the re-sentencing discretion is whether sentences could properly be imposed for each of the two counts of aggravated break, enter and steal which would have the practical effect of allowing for the applicant's immediate release from custody either unconditionally or on parole, that is, by the imposition of sentence with a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 8 November 2012 or under another sentencing option.  (I note that because a standard non-parole period attaches to an offence under s 112(2), it is not open to impose a fixed term of imprisonment.)
25The difficulty that I am confronted with in considering that question is that, given that the balance of the unexpired term of the previous sentence for the armed robberies expired on 16 October 2014, any sentence structured in that way will mean the applicant will have served, to date, a period of less than two months attributed directly to the break, enter and steal offences.  
26In light of the applicant's terminal illness and the conditions of his custody, and other considerations pertaining to his need for palliative care, I am satisfied that the already very lenient sentence imposed by the sentencing judge should be moderated by a degree.  However, given the gravity of his offending, replete as it was with the statutory features of aggravation under s 112(2), and the fact that the offences were committed whilst on parole for armed robberies, I am constrained to impose a sentence the effect of which will not result in the applicant's immediate release.
27The orders I propose are as follows:
(1)The sentences imposed in the District Court on 13 May 2013 are quashed.
(2)In lieu thereof and after taking into account the offences on the Form 1 on the first count the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 8 November 2012 and, on the second count, to imprisonment for a period of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 8 November 2013.
(3)The applicant is eligible to be considered for release to parole on 7 November 2015. 
28For my part, I would wish also to note (as reflected in Schedule 1) that on 24 April 2014 the applicant applied to the State Parole Authority for a parole order to be issued pursuant to s 160 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW).  That section expressly allows for a grant of parole where an offender is dying or if the Parole Authority is satisfied that it is necessary to release the offender on parole because of exceptional or extenuating circumstances.  The medical evidence current as at that date was provided to the Authority as it was to this Court.
29On 15 July 2014 the Parole Board refused to exercise the statutory power under s 160.  It gave no reasons for so doing.
30On enquiring of the applicant's solicitors, the Court has been informed that as at 24 November 2014 no further application has been made to the State Parole Authority based upon the updated medical reports the Court invited the applicant to submit for the Court's further consideration after judgment was reserved in August 2014, which included a revised estimate of the applicant's life expectancy.  Were a further application to be made, I consider it appropriate for the decision of this Court, and the annexed schedules, to be provided to the Parole Authority for their further consideration.

Received an effective sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months.10 July 2005Released on parole.6 October 2005The applicant committed four armed robberies, and assault of a police officer. 8 August 2006Sentenced to imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and 2 months. 7 October 2011Earliest date of his eligibility for parole for the four armed robberies and assault committed in 2006. 20 December 2011The applicant was released to parole.18 October 2012Committed aggravated break, enter and steal (Count 1). 2 November 2012Possession of goods reasonably suspected of being stolen (Form 1).7 November 2012 Committed aggravated break, enter and steal (Count 2).8 November 2012The applicant was arrested and made 'immediate admissions' to all 3 offences. Remanded in custody at Cessnock CC. Bail refused. 20 November 2012Transferred from Cessnock CC to Metro Remand Centre (""MRRC"").29 November 2012The State Parole Authority revoked the applicant's parole, effective from 18 October 2012. 6 December 2012Transferred from MRRC to Bathurst CC8 December 2012Transferred from Bathurst CC to Lithgow CC.23 December 2012The applicant completed a patient request form citing 'my skin cancer spots needed checking and my mental health needed to be reviewed'. January 2013The applicant noticed a lump on his left cheek which he thought was a boil in this month. 15 January 2013The applicant was examined by a GP, Dr John Dearin. There was no mention of any skin problems according to Dr Forstner's report but no direct evidence from Dr Dearin was tendered on the appeal.4 February 2013The applicant was examined by an unidentified medical practitioner without any specialist designation. There is no mention of a skin condition (again, according to Dr Forstner's report but no direct evidence of from the medical practitioner was tendered on the appeal).20 February 2013The applicant entered limited association, or 'Protective Custody'. 30 March 2013Transferred from Lithgow CC to MRRC.1 April 2013A registered nurse saw the applicant and noted, 'pt states he has no problems with his skin' (again, as noted by Dr Forstner but without direct evidence from the nurse).2 April 2013Transferred from MRRC to Cessnock CC.15 April 2013Transferred from Cessnock CC to MRRC.16 April 2013The applicant was seen at the MRRC clinic.23 April 2013Pre-sentence report prepared by Laura Durkin, psychologist (she does not mention the applicant's lesion).24 April 2013Transferred from MRRC to Parklea CC.9 May 2013Transferred from Parklea CC to Cessnock CC.10 May 2013The applicant gave evidence during the sentencing proceedings. 13 May 2013The sentencing judge sentenced the applicant to an effective head sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. Sentence to commence on 8 November 2012 and expire on 7 November 2019.19 May 2013The applicant made a request to see the nurse as 'the sore' on his cheek 'had returned and was oozing fluid'. (clinical records exist)1 June 2013The applicant went to the clinic and had his 'boil' treated and dressed (clinical records exist)3 June 2013The applicant again went to the clinic and had his 'boil' treated and dressed (clinical records exist).22 June 2013The applicant requests assistance, 'please do something to heal the boil on my left cheek'. (clinical records exist)26 June 2013Dr Badami examines the applicant's face and describes the lesion. The doctor queried whether it was cancer and made a clinical note to follow up.(Dr Forstner opines that this assessment was 'reasonable and the most likely differential diagnosis was documented' - clinical records exist)1 July 2013Transferred from Cessnock CC to Parklea CC. Did not receive the tests ordered by Dr Badami.  12 July 2013The applicant requested treatment medical treatment for the 'sore on side of cheek which has been there for 5-6 months'. (clinical records exist)22 July 2013Dr Yehia examines the applicant and notes the lesion to his face, and arranges an appointment with a surgeon. (clinical records exist)7 August 2013Transferred from Parklea CC to Long Bay Hospital.  8 August 2013Dr Hibberd examined the applicant at Prince of Wales Hospital, diagnoses the lesion as ""cancerous"" and advises that it be removed. Consultation with Dr Keogh (surgeon). A possible diagnosis was basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The treatment plan was to excise the lesion and subject it to cell analysis (cytology). The surgery was listed as priority to be done within '90 days'. Dr Forstner's opinion is that a 90 day priority is reasonable in the circumstances. (clinical records exist)13 August 2013Transferred from Long Bay Hospital to South Coast CC.21 August 2013Dr Mayer issued an urgent referral to plastic surgery to follow up on Dr Hibberd's recommendation that the lesion be excised (with or without flap repair) and to arrange for a cytology technician to perform a fine needle aspiration in theatre. (clinical records exist)22 August 2013Transferred back to Long Bay Hospital from South Coast CCThe applicant noticed a lump in his neck 'the size of a pea'. No medical records to substantiate this. 23 August 2013Chest x-ray conducted and revealed no metastases in the applicant's lungs. 5 September 2013Transferred to South Coast CC from Long Bay Hospital. 11 September 2013The applicant requested medical treatment in relation to the lesion on the left cheek and the lump under his jaw.12 September 2013Dr Mayer examined the applicant. He asked to be advised if no appointment for surgery was made in the next month. 1 October 2013Dr Mayer detected an obvious lymph node.5 October 2013 The applicant consulted a nurse who recorded a clinical note of the pain experienced by the applicant near the 'ear and jaw'.Multiple clinical notes record the applicant complaint of pain near the ear, jaw and neck (rather than the cheek) on 6 October and 8 October 2013.  According to the applicant, by this time the lump had grown to the size of a 'golf ball'.9 October 2013Dr Mayer examined the applicant and documented that the tumour had significantly increased in size and had developed a left submandibular node. Dr Mayer emailed Justice Health and advised that the applicant 'requires urgent surgical management'. 16 October 2013Dr Mayer referred the applicant for further CT scans. 17 October 2013A CT scan was scheduled but cancelled due to staff shortage. 24 October 2013CT scan showed pulmonary nodules consistent with metastases. In Dr Forstner's opinion, from this date, it was clear the applicant had a 'gross metastatic disease' and that he was 'likely [to have] had smaller volume metastatic disease for at least 4-8 weeks prior and maybe even longer'.  25 October 2013Dr Kenneth Landers referred the applicant for further assessment urgently. 29 October 2013Transferred back to Long Bay Hospital. 5 November 2013A biopsy was conducted on the excised part of the lesion on the applicant's cheek. 7 November 2013Dr Sandy Kershaw consulted with the Applicant and noted that the 'applicant was not aware of the possibility of metastatic cancer and is shocked'.Dr Hibberd also reviewed the applicant and noted that the lesion had increased in size and was now 3cm (according to Dr Forstner). 11 November 2013Applicant admitted for surgery at Prince of Wales Hospital.12 November 2013Surgery cancelled because the cancer had progressed too far. PET scan and biopsies were conducted instead. 15 November 2013CT guided biopsy of a right lung mass was performed. Dr Smee informed the applicant that his condition may be terminal. 18 November 2013Associate Professor Robert Smee diagnosed the applicant with stage IV (metastatic) pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma. Alternatively described as Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC). In Dr Forstner's view, the appropriate diagnosis is a 'sarcoma and not a carcinoma'. This is a rare high grade sarcoma and, in Dr Forstner's opinion, spreads quickly to the lungs. 19 November 2013Discharged from Prince of Wales Hospital.26 November 2013Assessed by Dr Simonelli, a psychiatrist, who noted the applicant was 'distressed' and 'devastated' by the spread of the cancer. 2 December 2013The applicant received further surgery and had the left facial skin lesion removed together with 32 lymph nodes in his neck. 9 December 2013The applicant was readmitted to Long Bay Hospital.22 January 2014The applicant consulted with Dr Siobhan O'Neill, Senior Staff Specialist, Department of Medical Oncology at the Prince of Wales Hospital. The applicant was also prescribed Avanza 60mg by a psychiatrist for his depression. 26 January 2014The applicant collapsed from an unknown cause. 2 February 2014The applicant had a Portacath inserted in his chest.3 February 2014Chemotherapy commenced and was to continue every three weeks. 9 February 2014The applicant developed a Golden Staph infection from the Portacath and was hospitalised for two weeks. 18 February 2014Dr O'Neill confirms the diagnosis and estimated the applicant's life expectancy could range from a few months up to around two years (Dr Forstner disagrees. In his view, survival is usually less than 9 months for a cancer of this kind). A PICC line is inserted into the applicant.26 February 2014Dr Lewis, in his capacity as the applicant's treating medical oncologist, wrote to Dr Kershaw (of the Medical Surgical Unit of Long Bay Jail) to confirm the diagnosis. He estimated the applicant had 6-12 months to live. 4 March 2014Dr Lewis wrote to Dr Kershaw again and described the applicant as 'well' and having regained lost weight.10 April 2014Dr Lewis wrote to Dr Kershaw again and noted: â  the applicant had made a full recovery from his Golden Staph infection; â  '[t]here is no evidence of recurrence over the previously resected left cheek lesion or in the left neck. His lungs are clear to auscultation';â  several lung metastases 'have definitely reduced in size' but a 'solitary metastasis in the right lung has increased slightly by about 2mm'; â  there was 'no evidence of any new lung metastases and no evidence of metastatic disease outside of the chest';â  the applicant's left lung lower lobe consolidation has been completely resolved. These results were 'better than [Dr Lewis] had expected'.15 April 2014Dr Lewis wrote to the applicant's legal representatives and confirmed his estimate that the applicant had 6-12 months to live. 24 April 2014The applicant made an application for early release to parole under s 160 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999.28 April 2014The applicant's psychological report was updated by Laura Durkin, Forensic Psychologist, for the purposes of the appeal (see Schedule 2 to this judgment).30 April 2014The psychiatric report of Dr Richard Furst, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, diagnosed the applicant with:1. substance use disorder (opiate and amphetamine dependence);2. depression secondary to a  general medical condition (cancer);3. chronic pain disorder; and4. personality deferred, likely antisocial traits. (see Schedule 2 to this judgment)15 May 2014In Dr Forstner's initial report, he states that 'the tumour is not very responsive to treatment and [the applicant's] survival is likely to be months'. He concluded that the applicant's 'care by justice health was reasonable but there was a significant delay [in arranging for] biopsy and definitive diagnosis....however, the greater reason for his poor prognosis was the aggressive nature of the tumour'.10 June 2014In Dr Forstner's supplementary report, he states that 'there is only one lump on the cheek that has been referred to and this is entirely consistent with it being the primary cancer'. This opinion is based on three reasons:1. There is no other primary site identified.2. That region of the left cheek contains very few lymph nodes and hence it is a highly unusual area to develop metastatic lymphadenopathy.3. Multiple different nursing and medical reviews document the lesion as being consistently on the left side of the face, suggesting that it was a single continuously present lesion. Dr Forstner states that, 'on the balance of probabilities the sarcoma was present prior to 13th May 2013'.15 July 2014The State Parole Authority refused the application for parole.28 August 2014Professor Lewis wrote to Ms Fisher, Nurse Manager at Long Bay Jail, with concerns that his previous correspondence to them was not received. Prof Lewis recommends the applicant receives palliative radiotherapy for the right lung dominant metastasis.  17 September 2014Prof Lewis emails the applicant's legal representatives and estimates the applicant has 4-6 months left to live. 6 October 2014Expiration of the sentence imposed in 2006. 7 November 2017Non-parole period imposed in May 2013 will expire. 7 November 2019Sentence will expire. 
SCHEDULE 2
The applicant's mother, her husband and daughter, will provide him support should he be released from custody (affidavit of Elaine Dudgeon, [8]); Durkin's updated report, [28]).
It appears that the support the applicant will receive from his two daughters, Maddison (aged 18 as of April 2014) and Mackenzie (aged 17 as of April 2014), will be limited. 
Maddison was homeless on day of sentencing (13 May 2013, ROS 3.9) and had recently given birth (Sarah Anne) who was born 13 weeks premature. They do not appear to communicate frequently because 'money is tight' (applicant's affidavit, [103]). She does not know the full extent of the severity of the applicant's illness (applicant's affidavit, [104]).
Mackenzie is also unaware of the applicant's diagnosis, although the applicant has informed her through a birthday card that he is 'unwell', and the applicant is not intending to tell her because she is currently preparing for the HSC (applicant's affidavit, [107]).
The applicant has successfully arranged for accommodation five minutes from his parents' residence in Newcastle (Durkin's updated report, [28]). No further evidence to substantiate this was tendered. 
A Parole Officer inspected the applicant's parents' home and deemed it a 'suitable place for [the applicant] to serve a parole order' (affidavit of Elaine Dudgeon, [6]).
The only evidence shedding light on the parents' financial capacity to support the applicant is the fact that they've had to sell their house to pay for the applicant's legal fees, and that they are currently occupying premises under a lease. 
 '[I]ncarceration is having a significantly adverse effect generally on [the applicant's] quality of life at this time...his health continues to be adversely affected by the lack of control he has over aspects of his care, such as his diet' (Durkin's updated report, [33]).
'[H]e will benefit from support and interventions that may ease his mental health concerns. Little other treatment is recommended. As such, the best intervention psychologically for Mr Dudgeon now, should focus on enhancing the connection with his family, enable him to gain some physical comfort and encourage him to stay in contact with a psychologist and a psychiatrist' (Durkin's updated report, [34]).
'His past history of relapsing into drug use and offending in the community is of concern; however, he has had extensive counselling in this respect through psychologists attached to the VOTP and Long Bay Hospital. The treatment plan outlined above [see below] should minimise his risk of relapse into drugs is given a compassionate release from custody on medical grounds, especially if he has ongoing specialist drug and alcohol input, a mental health care plan and is provided Methadone in addition to his antidepressant medication.' (Furst p. 9)
'Accessing of all treatments is likely to be complicated and potentially delayed by his incarceration which makes access to care more difficult. Provision of specialist palliative care services out of hospital setting is likely to be difficult whilst he is in custody. It will likely be impossible to address his psychosocial terminal care needs whilst he is incarcerated. I would strongly support consideration of his release from custody give his very poor prognosis from this aggressive malignancy'. (Dr Forstner's initial report, p. 9)
'I would strongly support this application for early/compassionate release from prison'. (Dr Lewis, 26 February 2014)
If the applicant is released to conditional liberty, Dr Furst recommends at p.8:
1. He is referred to his local GP with a view to providing ongoing medical and psychiatric care, pursuant to a mental health care plan.
2. He attends appointment with his treating doctor, as allocated, at a frequency as directed, probably fortnightly in the first instance.
3. He is placed under the care of Oncology treatment services in Newcastle, probably through the John Hunter Hospital, to continue his chemotherapy.
4. He attends appointments with a treating psychiatrist, as allocated, at a frequency is directed, probably monthly in the first instance, to review his mental health care plan, depression and need for antidepressant medication.
5. He accepts medication as directed by his treating doctor, probably of trial of Endep (Amitriptyline) 100-150mg orally at night in addition to his analgesic medications.
6. He is referred to local drug and alcohol treatment service, probably at his local community health centre, with the likely prescription of Methadone pursuant to the Opioid Substitution Program (OSP). Relapse prevention and drug and ongoing alcohol counselling are also indicated given his addiction issues.
7. He engages in specific psychological counselling to address his chronic pain issues, terminal illness, and adjustment to his cancer, probably through a clinical psychologist in the community as part of his mental health care plan and/or through counsellors working for the oncology service of the Hunter New England Health Service in Newcastle.

2765539,El-Zayet v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 298,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]
On 1 June 2012, a Crown Prosecutor informed the Supreme Court that the Director of Public Prosecutions (the Director) had made a direction pursuant to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986, s 7(2)(b), that no further proceedings were to be brought against the applicant and a co-accused following the quashing of their convictions for murder by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The Crown Prosecutor handed up the last page of a legal advising report (the document) upon which the Director had endorsed his direction under s 7(2)(b). Other than the signed direction, the document was privileged. 
The applicant made an application for costs under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967. At the hearing of that application, the Director was advised by the judge (Hidden J) that the document was on the court file.  The application was stood over to be heard by another judge.  The Director informed the court that he did not waive privilege in respect of that document, whereupon the document was returned to the custody of the Director. 
The applicant filed a notice of motion seeking orders to gain access to the document on the basis that the Crown had waived privilege. Price J dismissed the notice of motion.
The applicant filed both a summons seeking leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal and an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. On 26 March 2014, a Court of Appeal bench was constituted and heard the arguments on this appeal. 
A question arose as to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to hear the matter. The Court was thus additionally constituted as a Court of Criminal Appeal:  R v King [2003] NSWCCA 399; 59 NSWLR 472; Fairfax Digital Australia & New Zealand Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales [2012] NSWCA 172. 
Three principles issues arose for determination: 
(1) Whether an appeal lay to the Court of Appeal under the Supreme Court Act 1970, s 101;
(2) Whether an appeal lay to the Court of Criminal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 5F;  
(3) Whether privilege was waived when the legal advising report was handed to the Court.
The application for leave to appeal was dismissed.
In respect of (1)
Per Beazley P and Emmett JA, McColl JA agreeing:
(i) The Supreme Court Act, s 17, removes from the operation of the Supreme Court Act and the Supreme Court Rules proceedings in the Court which are specified in the Third Schedule. The Court of Appeal, whose powers are governed by the Supreme Court Act, therefore does not have power to hear an appeal from a Supreme Court judge on an application for a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act: [52]-[53]. 
Shepherd v Bowen (1986) 4 NSWLR 475; Adler v District Court (NSW) (1990) 19 NSWLR 317.
(ii) Where legislation provides that a statute has no application to a proceeding of a particular type, then unless there is a specific exception of an aspect of such proceedings, such as interlocutory orders, the reference to the proceeding includes all aspects of it. The Supreme Court Act and the Rules therefore do not apply to an interlocutory order made in an application under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, and no appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from Price J's dismissal of the applicant's notice of motion: [57]. 
In respect of (2)
Per McColl JA, Beazley P and Emmett JA not deciding:
(i) The Court, having been constituted as the Court of Criminal Appeal, has jurisdiction to entertain an application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory decision given in the course of hearing an application for a costs certificate pursuant to s 2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, it being an interlocutory judgment given in proceedings for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act.
In respect of (3)
Per Beazley P and Emmett JA, McColl JA agreeing:
(i) The primary judge erred in finding that the Evidence Act 1995, ss 118 and 119 applied. The procedure before Barr AJ did not involve the adducing of evidence, and as such the Evidence Act was not engaged: [88]. 
(ii) The only person who could waive privilege was the Director or a person authorised by him: [117]. 
(iii) The Crown Prosecutor did not have implied authority to waive privilege, as such waiver was neither necessary nor incidental to the task of informing the court that the Director had made a direction under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986, s 7(2)(b): [118].
 Cassar v NSW Crime Commissioner [2014] NSWCA 356. 
(iv) The Crown Prosecutor's apparent authority to compromise proceedings did not carry with it the authority to disclose privileged information: [119].
Waugh v HB Clifford & Sons Ltd [1982] Ch 374, Cassar v NSW Crime Commissioner [2014] NSWCA 356.
(v) The Crown Prosecutor's actions were not plainly inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality: [120].





			Judgment
1BEAZLEY P and EMMETT JA:  On 14 June 2013, Price J dismissed the applicant's claim that the Director of Public Prosecutions (the Director) had waived privilege in respect of a document upon which the Director had written a direction that no further proceedings be taken against the applicant:  Aouad v R; El-Zayet v R [2013] NSWSC 760.  That claim, by way of an amended notice of motion, arose in the context Mr El-Zayet's application for costs pursuant to the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW).  As the matter before this Court involved Mr El-Zayet only, we propose to refer to this judgment by its medium neutral citation.
2The applicant challenged that decision by summons for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeal, constituted by the members of this bench, filed on 12 September 2013.  The matter came before the Court of Appeal by way of a concurrent hearing of the summons for leave to appeal and, if granted, the appeal.  However, a question arose as to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to hear the appeal.  If that Court had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal, there was also a question whether the Court of Criminal Appeal has jurisdiction to hear and determine the question sought to be raised by the appeal.  In that regard, on 27 June 2013, the applicant had filed an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal from Price J's order dismissing the amended notice of motion.
3We have concluded, for the following reasons, that there is no appeal to the Court of Appeal from the dismissal of the amended notice of motion, with or without leave.  The summons for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal has been dismissed:  El-Zayet v Director of Public Prosecutions [2014] NSWCA 422.  It is uncertain, in our view, whether the Court of Criminal Appeal has jurisdiction pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5F(3).  However, as we have concluded that privilege was not waived, we have found it unnecessary to finally determine that question.  Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) should be dismissed.
Background to the appeal
4The document upon which the Director had written his direction was the last page of a ""legal advising report"" given to the Director by the Deputy Director of Prosecutions (the Deputy Director).  The report was an advice to the Director as to whether further criminal proceedings should be brought against the applicant and a co-offender following the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal quashing their convictions for the murder of Ahmed Fahda and ordering a retrial:  Aouad and El-Zayet v R [2011] NSWCCA 61.  Following that appeal the applicant and the alleged co-offender were arraigned on an indictment charging one count of murder.  As the matter before the Court involves only the applicant, it is not necessary to give any further consideration to the position of the other person. 
5The direction that no further proceedings be brought was made by the Director pursuant to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 (NSW), s 7(2)(b).  In a letter confirming that the direction had been made, the Director informed the applicant's solicitor that the matter was listed on 1 June 2012 for the purpose of ""formally entering a nolle prosequi in relation to all counts on the indictment"".  
6At the listing on 1 June 2012, the Crown Prosecutor informed Barr AJ that no further proceedings were to be taken and asked whether he could ""hand up a document to be filed with the court file"".  It appears that the last page of the legal advising report upon which the Director had endorsed his direction under s 7(2)(b) was then provided to the court.  Barr AJ discharged the applicant and his co-accused.  Counsel for the applicant and the co-accused informed his Honour that there would be an application for costs:  see Costs in Criminal Cases Act.  There was no formalisation of the matter by way of filing an application for costs and it was not suggested that that was necessary.  Barr AJ stood the matter over to 6 July 2012.
7Following a mention of the matter on 6 July 2012, the costs application was listed for hearing before Hidden J on 22 August 2012.  On that day, in response to a question from Hidden J as to whether there would be evidence of the Director's reasons in directing that no further proceedings be taken, the Crown indicated that he ""would not be waiving the privilege in any way"".  Hidden J adjourned for a short period to consider the written submissions of the parties.  When he returned to court, his Honour raised with the Crown the existence of the last page of the legal advising document on the court file.  His Honour said:
""Mr Crown, you quite properly take the view that the Director exercises its privilege in respect of the reasons for its decision. Unfortunately on one of the files there's a copy of your brief report and the Director's decision. I don't know what it's doing there but it's there. So that, like it or not, I know what the decision was and why. The only solution I can think of, unless anybody else has got any other idea, is that I recuse myself and the documents are returned to the Director.""
8The Crown advised his Honour that the last page of the legal advising report may have been handed to the Court on 1 June 2012, but that no one had authority to waive the Director's privilege and there was no intention that the privilege be waived.  Hidden J formally recused himself from hearing the matter.
9On 3 October 2012, the applicant filed a notice of motion seeking access to the document that had been handed to the court.  The orders sought in his notice of motion, which had been amended by leave, were as follows:
""1. That the document handed up in this court on 1st June 2012 by the Crown Prosecutor be produced to the court for inspection (pursuant to s 133 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), if that Act applies).
2. A declaration that any privilege over the document handed up in this court on 1st June 2012 by the Crown Prosecutor has been waived.
3. That the applicants have immediate access to the document handed up in this court on 1st June 2012 by the Crown Prosecutor; or alternatively have leave to file in court a Notice to Produce directed to the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions returnable immediately seeking only the production of the document handed up in this Court on 1st June 2012 by the Crown Prosecutor.
4. An order that the respondent pay the applicants' costs of these motions.""
10The applicant's amended notice of motion, along with that of his co-accused, was heard by Price J on 26 April 2013.  On 14 June 2013, his Honour found that client legal privilege had not been waived and dismissed the notices of motion:  [2013] NSWSC 760.  In his judgment on the notices of motion, no question was raised, and Price J did not address, whether the 'matter' in which the notice of motion was filed was properly characterised as a civil or criminal proceeding.  
11However, that question arose in the context of determining whether a costs order could be made on the applicant's amended notice of motion.  His Honour concluded that the application for costs was a civil proceeding and on 26 July 2013, ordered the applicant to pay the Crown's costs of the amended notice of motion on the ordinary basis as agreed or assessed:  Aouad v R; El-Zayet v R (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 991.
12In reaching his determination that the application for costs was a civil proceeding, his Honour observed, at [10], that the entry of the ""nolle prosequi"" terminated the proceedings against the applicant on the indictment.  His Honour then dealt with the nature of the application for the grant of a certificate pursuant to the Costs in Criminal Cases Act.  His Honour reasoned as follows:
""Although s 2(1) of [the Costs in Criminal Cases Act] confines the grant of a certificate to 'any proceedings relating to any offence', proof of those matters must be established under s 3 before a certificate will be granted on the balance of probabilities (the civil standard): Reddy v R; Tan v R [2013] NSWSC 907 at [4]. An application for a certificate under [the Costs in Criminal Cases Act] is not a proceeding against a person for an offence nor are such proceedings identified as being included in the definition of 'criminal proceedings' in the Civil Procedure Act. It seems to me that an application for a certificate under [the Costs in Criminal Cases Act] is a civil proceedings.""
13Price J then considered whether the notices of motion themselves constituted civil proceedings.  In this regard, his Honour held, at [11]:
""The unsuccessful notices of motion sought the waiver of privilege in respect of page 6 of the legal advice report that was handed up by the Crown Prosecutor to Barr AJ. On the hearing of the [motion], the sole relevance of this document was the possible impact it might have on the question of costs. The proceedings before me arose directly out of the [application] for a certificate. They are not proceedings against a person for an offence nor are they identified as being included in the definition of criminal proceedings in the Civil Procedure Act. In my opinion, the proceedings are civil proceedings and the Civil Procedure Act applies.""
14His Honour held, at [16], that in the circumstances, costs should follow the event in accordance with the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (UCPR), r 42.1.  His Honour, therefore, as indicated above, ordered that the applicant pay the Crown's costs of the motion on the ordinary basis as agreed or assessed.
Summons seeking leave to appeal
15On 26 March 2014 when the issue of jurisdiction arose, the application to the Court of Criminal Appeal had not been determined.  For the reasons we give below, we have treated that application to be before us, sitting as the Court of Criminal Appeal.
16As indicated above, a question arose as to whether the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to determine the matter because it was a criminal, not a civil, proceeding.  Argument in the Court of Appeal was permitted to proceed in the matter but the parties were directed to file further written submissions on the following questions:
""(a) whether an application for costs under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 is a civil or criminal proceeding within the meaning of the Civil Procedure Act 2005;
(b) whether, if an application for costs under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act is a criminal proceeding, any appeal lies from the order of Price J made on 14 June 2013 dismissing the notice of motion of Naseam El-Zayet by 9 April 2014.""
17In his written submissions filed pursuant to this direction, the applicant submitted that the proceedings were criminal.  He contended that, although the nolle prosequi on 1 June 2012 deprived the Supreme Court from further proceeding on the indictment, the Supreme Court retained the power formally to discharge the applicant and to determine any costs application made under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act in respect of that proceeding.  The applicant submitted, therefore, that the costs order made by Price J on 26 July 2013 ought to be set aside, as Price J was exercising criminal jurisdiction in determining the applicant's notice of motion and so lacked jurisdiction to make a costs order on the notice of motion.  
18The Crown contended that the proceedings were civil and did not fall within the definition of a criminal proceeding in the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), s 3 because an application for a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act did not involve ""proceedings against a person for an offence"".  It submitted that, as the Civil Procedure Act defines a civil proceeding as ""any proceeding other than criminal proceedings"", the application under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act and the notice of motion brought in that application were properly characterised as civil proceedings.
19The Crown also submitted that the applicant had no right to appeal to either the Court of Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeal.  With respect to the Court of Appeal, the Crown relied upon the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), s 17 and the Third Schedule, para (i) as precluding an appeal.  With respect to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Crown submitted that there was no appeal available under the Criminal Appeal Act, s 5F(3), as there were no extant criminal proceedings in respect of which an appeal, by leave from an interlocutory order, lay.  
20At the time the questions at [16] above were formulated, the concern was that, if the proceedings were criminal proceedings, the Court of Appeal would have no jurisdiction to hear the matter, as it was not constituted as a Court of Criminal Appeal.  However, as the submissions filed by the Crown make apparent, there are two preliminary questions to be determined which are not directly dependent upon the characterisation of the proceedings as civil or criminal.  The first question is whether the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear an appeal, including by leave, from the order made by Price J dismissing the amended notice of motion.  That question in turn depends upon the provisions of the Supreme Court Act and, in particular, s 17 and the Third Schedule to that Act.  If the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to determine the appeal, there is a second question as to whether an appeal lies to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  
21If the Court of Appeal does not have jurisdiction, or there is doubt as to whether the Court has jurisdiction, this Court may be constituted as a Court of Criminal Appeal and determine the matter in the jurisdiction in which the appeal properly lies:  R v King [2003] NSWCCA 399; 59 NSWLR 472 at [21];  Fairfax Digital Australia & New Zealand Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales [2012] NSWCA 172 at [7].  
22Given the doubt as to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, the Chief Justice has constituted the judges of this bench as a Court of Criminal Appeal to deal concurrently with the proceedings. 
Relevant legislation
23The following legislative provisions are relevant to the questions thus raised.
Costs in Criminal Cases Act 
24The applicant's notice of motion seeking access to the report was filed in the application he brought for a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act.  Section 2(1)(a) of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act provides that where, after the commencement of a trial, a direction is given by the Director that no further proceedings be taken, the Court may grant to the defendant a certificate specifying the matters stated in s 3.  Section 3 provides:  
""(1) A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Magistrate granting the certificate: 
(a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and
(b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.""
25If a certificate is granted, the defendant may apply to the Director-General of the Attorney General's Department for payment from the Consolidated Fund of costs incurred in the proceedings to which the certificate relates:  s 4(1).  The Director-General determines the amount of costs payable to the defendant to whom a certificate has been granted:  s 4(2)-(3).  The Director-General may also refuse to make any payment if the Director-General considers that, in all the circumstances, a payment is not justified, or if costs are otherwise recoverable:  s 4(4).
26There was no dispute in this Court that the direction that no further proceedings be taken against the applicant on the indictment was given ""after the commencement of the trial"":  see JC v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 228 so that the applicant was entitled to make an application under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act.  That application remains on foot and except to the extent that the application for production of the document arose in the course of that application, the application it is not otherwise of relevance in these proceedings. 
The Supreme Court Act 
27Appeals to the Court of Appeal from an order or judgment of the Court in a Division are provided for by the Supreme Court Act, s 101.  Pursuant to s 101(2), appeals from certain orders or judgments, including interlocutory orders or judgments in proceedings in the Court, require the leave of the Court of Appeal:  s 101(2)(e).  The order made by Price J dismissing the notice of motion was interlocutory:  see Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36; 117 CLR 423; Licul v Corney [1976] HCA 6; 180 CLR 213;  Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7; 195 ALR 225.  
28Pursuant to the Supreme Court Act, s 17, the Supreme Court Act and the Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW) do not apply to the proceedings specified in the Third Schedule to that Act or to certain interlocutory proceedings.  Section 17 in its present form (the bolded portions having been introduced by the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1988 (NSW), Sch 18) provides, relevantly:
""17 Criminal proceedings
(1) Except as provided in this section this Act and the rules do not apply to any of the proceedings in the Court which are specified in the Third Schedule, and no claim for relief lies to the Court against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings referred to in paragraph (a1) or (a2) of that Schedule ...""
29The paragraph of the Third Schedule to the Supreme Court Act that is relevant to the present case is para (i).  However, other paragraphs and, in particular, paras (a), (a1) and (a2), are relevant to the construction of the provision.  Those paragraphs are set out hereunder.  Other paragraphs of the Third Schedule will be referred to as necessary in the course of these reasons.  The Third Schedule relevantly provides:
""Third Schedule Criminal proceedings
(a) Proceedings in the Court for the prosecution of offenders on indictment ('indictment' including any information presented or filed as provided by law for the prosecution of offenders) including the sentencing or otherwise dealing with persons convicted,
(a1) proceedings (including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment (indictment including any information presented or filed as provided by law for the prosecution of offenders) in the Court or in the District Court,
(a2) proceedings (whether in the Court or the District Court) under Division 5 of Part 2 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986,
...
(i) proceedings in the Court for the grant of a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967.""
30The proceedings referred to in paras (a), (a1) and (i) are apparent from the terms of the provision.  Paragraph (a2) refers to pleas of guilty in committal proceedings. 
31Before leaving the provisions of the Third Schedule, it should be noted that it is headed ""Criminal proceedings"".  Pursuant to the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), s 35(1)(b), the heading to the Schedule is taken to be part of the Act.  
32The phrase ""claim for relief"" is defined in the Supreme Court Act, s 19(1) to include:
""(a) a claim for the recovery of damages or other money, or for possession of land, or for delivery of goods,(b) a claim for a declaration of right,(c) a claim for the determination of any question or matter which may be determined by the Court, and(d) any other claim (whether legal, equitable or otherwise) justiciable in the Court.""
The Civil Procedure Act 
33The Civil Procedure Act and the UCPR, upon which the Director relies, apply only to civil proceedings:  see Civil Procedure Act, s 4 and UCPR, r 1.5.  ""Civil proceedings"" are defined in s 3 as meaning ""any proceedings other than criminal proceedings"".  ""Criminal proceedings"" are defined in s 3 as meaning:
""... proceedings against a person for an offence (whether summary or indictable), and includes the following:
(a) committal proceedings,(b) proceedings relating to bail,(c) proceedings relating to sentence,(d) proceedings on an appeal against conviction or sentence.""
Construction of s 17 and the Third Schedule
Section 17 as originally enacted 
34It is useful at the outset to note the legislative history of s 17 and the Third Schedule and the proper construction of those provisions having regard to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.  Those matters were examined by the Court of Appeal in Shepherd v Bowen (1986) 4 NSWLR 475.  In that case, Mahoney JA (Glass and Priestley JJA agreeing) explained, at 478:
""Prior to the enactment of the Supreme Court Act 1970, the Supreme Court of New South Wales had a general jurisdiction, and that jurisdiction included the jurisdiction to deal both with civil and criminal proceedings. That jurisdiction was conferred upon the Supreme Court as the result of the Act 4 Geo IV ch 96 and the Charter of Justice 1823."" 
35His Honour continued:
""The Supreme Court Act, as originally enacted, was intended to have application generally to the civil jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. However, limitations were imposed upon the generality of its application in respect of its criminal jurisdiction."" 
36Mahoney JA identified s 17 and the Third Schedule as such a limitation.  It followed that s 101, which provides for appeals to the Court of Appeal from a judgment or order of a Division of the Court in a proceeding, did not apply:  see at 479.  
37The Court in Shepherd v Bowen was considering s 17(1) and the Third Schedule in the form in which those provisions were originally enacted.  Section 17(1) in that form provided:
""Except as provided in this section this Act and the rules do not apply to any of the proceedings in the Court which are specified in the Third Schedule.""
The Third Schedule as originally enacted bore the heading ""Excluded criminal proceedings"".  Paragraph (a) was in the same terms as its current form and is set out at [29] above.  Paragraphs (a1) and (a2) had not been enacted.
38The applicant in Shepherd v Bowen had applied for an order for a stay of proceedings on indictment in the Supreme Court that had been brought against him.  That application had been dismissed.  The applicant contended on the appeal that that application did not fall within the phrase ""prosecution of offenders on indictment"" within the terms of para (a) and accordingly was not excluded by para (a) of the Third Schedule.  This argument was rejected.  Mahoney JA observed, at 479:
""The exclusion effected by s 17(1) applies, in my opinion, not merely to the trial of offenders on indictment but also to such interlocutory applications and orders as may be taken in the course of and as part of those proceedings. These are proceedings 'for' the prosecution of the offenders referred to in the Third Schedule.""
39Mahoney JA considered that the application for a stay brought by the applicant was ""an incident of the proceedings ... brought ... for the prosecution of Mr Shepherd on indictment"" and therefore a proceeding for such a prosecution within the terms of para (a) of the Third Schedule.  His Honour, at 480, stated, however, that he did not:
""... wish to preclude the possibility that it may be possible to bring applications concerning a proceeding on indictment which do not fall within the relevant words in the Third Schedule.""
40The position was different in respect of proceedings in the District Court.  In Richards v Smyth (Court of Appeal, 24 December 1985, unreported), Kirby P, Hope and Priestley JJA dismissed an objection that the Court of Appeal lacked jurisdiction in a challenge, by way of summons seeking prerogative relief, filed by an accused in respect of a District Court judge's refusal of his application to change his plea.  The Court observed that ""the Court"" referred to in para (a) of the Third Schedule:
""... is the Supreme Court. The prosecution of offenders on indictment in other courts, including the District Court, is not thereby included in the exemption in s 17(1) ... Accordingly, there is no basis for suggesting that, by virtue of s 17(1), criminal proceedings of the kind here in question were excluded from the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.""
41Thus, as originally enacted, s 17(1) and the Third Schedule precluded from the operation of the Supreme Court Act and Rules any of the proceedings in the Court specified in the Third Schedule.  An interlocutory order in a proceeding within para (a) was also precluded from the operation of the Act and Rules.  An appeal from a conviction or sentence in such proceedings lay to the Court of Criminal Appeal:  Criminal Appeal Act, s 5. 
42However, s 17(1) and the Third Schedule did not preclude an application for prerogative relief to the Court of Appeal in respect of a determination on an interlocutory application made by the District Court in proceedings for the prosecution of an offender on indictment, as para (a) was confined to proceedings in the Supreme Court.  It should be noted that no appeal lay to the Court of Appeal from a conviction or sentence imposed in proceedings on indictment in the District Court.  Any such appeal lay to the Court of Criminal Appeal:  Criminal Appeal Act.  There was, however, no provision in the Criminal Appeal Act at that time for an appeal against an interlocutory order made in such criminal proceedings.  Prerogative relief was thus available in respect of such an order made in the District Court.  
The 1988 amendments
43This inconsistency between the availability of relief in respect of interlocutory orders made in proceedings against an offender on indictment in the Supreme Court and in the District Court led to amendments to s 17(1) and the Third Schedule:  see the long title of the Supreme Court (Appeals) Amendment Act 1987 (NSW);  Explanatory Note, Supreme Court (Appeals) Amendment Bill 1987;  Explanatory Note, Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 1988, Sch 18.  The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1988 (NSW) (the 1988 amendments) operated retrospectively so as to commence on 18 December 1987, being the date of commencement of the Criminal Appeal Act, s 5F relating to appeals against interlocutory judgments or orders in proceedings for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court and the District Court:  see Adler v District Court (NSW) (1990) 19 NSWLR 317 at 334;  WO v Director of Public Prosecutions [2009] NSWCA 370 at [4];  Jenkins v Director of Public Prosecutions [2013] NSWCA 406 at [19].  An earlier amendment to the Third Schedule introduced by the Supreme Court (Appeals) Amendment Act, which also commenced on 18 December 1987, was replaced from the date of its commencement by the retrospective operation of the 1988 amendments.  It is not necessary, therefore, to consider the 1987 amendments, which appear to have contained a drafting error, which led to the retrospective commencement of the 1988 amendments.
44The amendments made in 1988 introduced that part of s 17(1) which is bolded above at [28] and also introduced paras (a1) and (a2) into the Third Schedule.  Paragraph (a2) in its original form related to the Justices Act 1902 (NSW).  The paragraph was amended to its present form in 2001.  There have been no further amendments to s 17(1).  Nor have there been any presently relevant amendments to the Third Schedule.  
45The effect of the 1988 amendments was addressed in Adler v District Court (NSW).  The applicant had sought prerogative relief against the refusal of a stay of criminal proceedings on indictment brought against him in the District Court.  Relief was sought not only against the District Court but also against the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General.  There were various bases upon which the applicant sought the stay, including because the District Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the proceedings, which were alleged to be ""void"" by operation of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and certain Imperial statutes.  
46Kirby ACJ, at 334, observed in relation to the 1988 amendments to s 17 and the introduction of s 5F into the Criminal Appeal Act in 1987: 
""... the purpose of the legislation was to direct the flow of ordinary proceedings of that character from the Court of Appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The re-allocation of business might be justified by the general responsibility of the latter Court for criminal appeals, including from the District Court in criminal proceedings. The [s 5F] amendments also introduced a provision for leave. They evidenced a Parliamentary intention to uphold the authority of the court of trial in considering applications for a stay.""
47Having noted, at 333, that the relief sought by the applicant invoked the Court's original supervisory jurisdiction, his Honour observed, at 334, that clear statutory language would be required to oust that jurisdiction.  His Honour concluded that s 17(1) did not evince a clear parliamentary intention to do so.  On his Honour's construction, s 17(1) operated only where (relevantly in that case) the relief claimed was properly categorised as being against an interlocutory judgment or order in criminal proceedings on indictment within para (a1) (emphasis of Kirby ACJ at 335).  A claim for prohibition or a declaration of right in respect of the jurisdiction of the District Court was not a claim for relief against such an order.  
48Mahoney JA, at 337-338, also concluded that the Supreme Court's supervisory jurisdiction, which derived from its status as a superior court of record pursuant to the Charter of Justice, was not excluded by s 17(1).  Mahoney JA rejected the suggestion that the reference in s 17 to ""any of the proceedings in the Court"" included a claim for prerogative relief brought in the Court in respect of a matter referred to in the Third Schedule.  As his Honour pointed out, at 340-341, such a proceeding was not ""a proceeding for the prosecution of an offender on indictment"", as was required to fall within s 17 and the Third Schedule, para (a1).  This aspect of his Honour's reasoning was directed to the first part of s 17, namely, that the Supreme Court Act and Rules do not apply to ""any of the proceedings in the Court which are specified in the Third Schedule"".  
49Mahoney JA then considered the effect of the amendment to s 17 effected by the 1988 Act, namely, the addition into the section of the following words:
""... and no claim for relief lies to the Court against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings referred to in paragraph (a1) or (a2) of that Schedule""  
50His Honour accepted, at 341, that ""claim for relief"" within the amended s 17(1) included a claim made in the Court's supervisory jurisdiction for relief of a prerogative nature.  His Honour considered that the purpose of the amendment made to s 17 was to restrict the extent to which the Court of Appeal ""would be involved in the supervision of the orders and directions given by, inter alia, a District Court judge at the interlocutory stage"".  Mahoney JA stated that the prohibition against seeking relief in s 17(1) was not at large and ""is limited to relief against an interlocutory judgment or order"".  Importantly, his Honour considered that the 1988 amendments did not oust the Court's jurisdiction to quash proceedings of a criminal nature where there was ""a lack of jurisdiction in the trial court, a gross breach of natural justice or the like"".  As his Honour observed:
""... s 17(1) does not prevent a claim being made to the Supreme Court to prohibit or quash, not an interlocutory judgment or order, but the proceeding itself.""
Consideration
51Leaving aside those sections of the Supreme Court Act excepted from the operation of s 17(1) by s 17(3), none of which has application to the present matter, s 17(1) contains two preclusions.  The first is the preclusion from the Act and Rules of the proceedings in the Supreme Court which are specified in the Third Schedule.  The second preclusion is a prohibition on a ""claim for relief"" in the Supreme Court against interlocutory judgments or orders in proceedings of the type specified in the Third Schedule, paras (a1) and (a2), being proceedings for the prosecution of an offender on an indictment and proceedings relating to guilty pleas in committal proceedings, respectively.  It is the first preclusion which is relevant to the circumstances presently under consideration, the application before Price J being a proceeding in the Supreme Court.  However, the construction of s 17(1) as a whole is relevant to the operation of the first preclusion.  
52The effect of the first preclusion in s 17(1) is that the Supreme Court Act and Rules do not apply to proceedings in the Supreme Court which are specified in the Third Schedule.  As discussed above, the reference in s 17 to ""proceedings in the Court which are specified in the Third Schedule"" does not include a proceeding for prerogative relief:  see Adler at 334; 340-1.  Apart from paras (a1) and (a2), which include a reference to the District Court as well as the Supreme Court, all other paragraphs in the Third Schedule refer only to proceedings ""in the Court"".  ""Court"" is defined in the Supreme Court Act, s 19 to mean ""the Supreme Court"".  Thus, in addition to proceedings in the Supreme Court referred to in paras (a) and (a1), the Supreme Court Act and Rules do not apply to ""gaol delivery"":  para (b);  proceedings in the Court under the Criminal Appeal Act:  para (d);  proceedings in the Court under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (which deals with ""Criminal proceedings generally"" in respect of juveniles charged with offences, including in respect of the commencement of proceedings);  or proceedings in the Court under the Habitual Criminals Offenders Act 1957:  para (h).  
53It is apparent, therefore, that as originally enacted (where s 17(1) contained only the first preclusion and paras (a1) and (a2) were not in the Third Schedule), the purpose and operation of s 17(1) were clear.  In the organisation of the Supreme Court's work, there was removed from the operation of the Supreme Court Act and Rules those proceedings in the Court which were specified in the Third Schedule, all of which, by reference to the heading, were criminal matters.  As is relevant to this case, the Supreme Court Act and Rules did not apply to an application in the Supreme Court for a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act.  
54As para (i) has remained in the same terms since its enactment, there is no reason why it should have an operation different from the operation that it has had since its inception.  Thus, the Court of Appeal, whose exercise of its powers is governed by the Supreme Court Act, including s 48 and s 101, does not have power to hear an appeal from a decision of a Supreme Court judge on an application for a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act.  Accordingly, had the applicant been refused a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, there would have been no appeal, whether as of right or by leave, to the Court of Appeal.  
55The question in the present case, however, is more particular, namely, whether an interlocutory order made in an application for a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Proceedings Act falls within the first preclusion in s 17(1) so that the Supreme Court Act and Rules do not apply.  If the Supreme Court Act and Rules do not apply, no appeal will lie to the Court of Appeal, either as of right or by leave pursuant to s 101, from the order of Price J dismissing the notice of motion.  
56There is no express provision in s 17 or the Third Schedule relating to interlocutory orders made in an application for a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act.  Indeed, interlocutory orders in such applications might be thought to be unusual, but as this matter demonstrates, may nonetheless be made.  Whether the Supreme Court Act and Rules, by operation of the first preclusion, ""do not apply"" to interlocutory orders made in such an application depends upon whether an interlocutory order so made is, as a matter of its proper construction, encompassed within the meaning of ""proceedings in the Court for the grant of a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act"", in the Third Schedule, para (i).  
57There is no authority directly in point.  In our opinion, where legislation provides that a statute has no application to a proceeding of a particular type, then unless there is a specific exception of an aspect of such proceedings, such as interlocutory orders, the reference to the proceeding includes all aspects of it.  The whole must be taken as including all its component parts, including interlocutory proceedings.  Thus, the Act and the Rules do not apply to an interlocutory order made in an application under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act falling within the first preclusion of s 17.  Accordingly, the Supreme Court Act and the Supreme Court Rules do not apply and there is no appeal to the Court of Appeal from the order made by Price J's dismissal of the applicant's notice of motion.  As discussed above at [38], Mahoney JA, in Shepherd v Bowen, held that the exclusion from the operation of the Supreme Court Act and Rules effected by s 17(1) of proceedings that fell within para (a) included interlocutory orders made in the course of and as part of such proceedings.  A coherent construction of the Third Schedule would require the same reasoning to apply to the other paragraphs in the Schedule, including para (i).  
58This conclusion, however, needs to be tested against the construction of s 17(1) as a whole, taking into account the amendment of s 17(1) and the introduction of paras (a1) and (a2) by the 1988 amendments.  As explained above, those amendments introduced a second preclusion in respect of interlocutory orders made in specific proceedings, being interlocutory orders made in the proceedings specified in paras (a1) and (a2).  The question that arises is whether, as a matter of statutory construction, the inclusion of a specific provision for interlocutory orders in specified proceedings means that s 17(1) should be taken as intending that interlocutory orders made in other proceedings are not precluded from the operation of the Act and Rules.  
59If the correct construction of para (i) of the Third Schedule is as stated above, it is arguable that the second preclusion in s 17(1) has no work to do.  That is, it could be argued that, if the Supreme Court Act and Rules do not apply to any of the proceedings specified in the Third Schedule, including interlocutory proceedings, the Act and the Rules would not apply to any aspect of the proceedings specified in paras (a1) and (a2) of the Third Schedule. 
60The answer to such argument is twofold.  First, as identified above, in [47] and [52], the first preclusion does not extend to claims for prerogative relief in respect of paras (a1) and (a2) of the Third Schedule because such claims would not be proceedings in the Supreme Court ""for the prosecution of offenders on indictment"" or ""proceedings ... under Division 5 of Part 2 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986"".  Such a claim for prerogative relief would fall within the terms of the second preclusion because the claim for relief is against a judgment or order ""for the prosecution of offenders on indictment"" or ""proceedings ... under Division 5 of Part 2 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986"".  As identified at [43] above, the introduction of the second preclusion and the introduction of paras (a1) and (a2) was accompanied by an express legislative intention to exclude an application or appeal from the District Court where such an application or appeal would not lie from the same matter arising in the Supreme Court:  see the long title of the Supreme Court (Appeals) Amendment Act.
61This in turn raises the question whether the second preclusion has any relevance to proceedings in the Supreme Court.  The answer is likely to be found in the breadth of the second preclusion, in that it precludes any ""claim for relief"", rather than providing only that the Act and Rules do not apply.  ""Claim for relief"" is defined in the Supreme Court Act, s 19(1) to include, relevantly, ""any other claim (whether legal, equitable or otherwise) justiciable in the Court"":  para (d).  As was discussed in Adler, the first preclusion does not extend to any inherent power or jurisdiction of the Supreme Court whose existence is not dependent on the Act and Rules, whereas the second preclusion would have that wider ambit.  It may also be that the broader language employed by the second preclusion, in precluding a claim ""against"" an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings referred to in paras (a1) and (a2), would cover the potential difficulty identified by Mahoney JA, at [39] above, that an application concerning a proceeding on indictment may not fall within the relevant words of the Third Schedule. 
62However, it is not necessary in this matter to decide finally the scope of the second preclusion in s 17(1) and, as there was no argument specifically directed to it, it would be inappropriate to do so.  Upon its proper construction, we are of the view that the effect of the first preclusion in s 17(1), having regard to the terms of the provision as a whole, is that the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction in respect of an interlocutory order made in the course of an application in the Supreme Court for costs under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act.  Accordingly, no appeal lies to the Court of Appeal, by leave or otherwise, from such an order.  
63We would also add that, in our view, Price J was not correct in finding that the application for costs was a civil proceeding within the meaning of the Civil Procedure Act, s 3.  
Does s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act apply?
64As the applicant had originally filed an application for leave to appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal, he seeks the Court's determination of that application.  This gives rise to the question as to whether an application for costs under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act and the applicant's notice of motion made in that application fall within the Criminal Appeal Act, s 5F.   
65The applicant submitted that, although the Director's direction under s 7(2) deprived the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to proceed further on the indictment, the Court's jurisdiction remained, both to discharge him and to determine his costs application.  The applicant submitted that the express terms of s 2, which provide that the Court may grant a certificate ""in any proceedings relating to an offence"" (original emphasis), demonstrated that this was so. 
66The Crown contended that an application for costs did not fall with the terms of s 5F, which applies only to ""proceedings ... for the prosecution of offender on indictment"" (original emphasis).  The Crown submitted that there were no relevant proceedings on indictment following the discharge of the applicant by Barr AJ on 1 June 2012.  
67The Criminal Appeal Act, s 5F, provides:
""5F Appeal against interlocutory judgment or order
(1) This section applies to:
(a) proceedings (including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court, 
...
(2) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies.
(3) Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings:
(a) if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal ...""
68Section 5F will only apply if the order made by Price J was an interlocutory judgment ""given"" or ""made"" ""in proceedings for the prosecution of [an offender] on indictment"".  Whilst we have no doubt that a judge, in deciding whether to grant a certificate under s 2, is exercising judicial power, we consider that there is doubt as to whether in doing so the Court is making an interlocutory order or judgment in proceedings to which s 5F applies.  There are no authorities directly on point on this question and to the extent that there are judicial statements touching upon the question, they do not all point in the same direction.  
69McColl JA has discussed in detail those cases that indicate that s 5F is engaged and we have been greatly assisted by her Honour's analysis.  In particular, our abbreviated observations at [71] are drawn from her Honour's reasons.  
70In R v Manley [2000] NSWCCA 196; 49 NSWLR 203 Simpson J, at [67], observed that an application for the grant of a certificate under s 2 was ""an independent application authorised by statute"".  See also Solomons v District Court of New South Wales [2000] NSWCA 99; 49 NSWLR 321 at [22]-[23] per Mason P and [115] per Foster AJA.  There are also a series of decisions in the Court of Appeal in which the comment has been made that there is no appeal from a decision under s 2:  see Chahal v Director of Public Prosecutions [2008] NSWCA 152 at [55];  AB v DPP (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 122 at [12].  Furthermore, we note that in JC v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 228 Basten JA (Beazley P and Ward J agreeing) at [12], described the nature of the determination made under s 2 as involving: 
""...the expression of an opinion by a judge or magistrate, on the basis of which the Director-General may, on application, make a payment out of consolidated revenue with respect to costs incurred in the proceedings by the party to whom the certificate was granted: s 4(1).""
71Pointing in the other direction were comments made in Solomons v District Court (NSW) [2002] HCA 47; 211 CLR 119.   The question in Solomons was whether the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), ss 68 and 79 rendered the provisions of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act applicable so as to authorise the grant of a s 2 certificate in the course of the exercise of federal jurisdiction.  The majority (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ) assumed for the purposes of the question before the Court that in determining an application under s 2 the Court was exercising ""jurisdiction with respect to ... the trial and conviction on indictment"".  More directly, however, were the observations of McHugh J at [45] and Kirby J at [109] and [123] who described the determination as to whether a certificate should be granted under s 2 as an incidental matter or procedure associated with a criminal trial.  
72In circumstances where we have concluded, for the reasons which we now give, that privilege was not waived, we have not found it necessary to finally determine whether the Court has jurisdiction under s 5F.  We recognise that if there is no jurisdiction under s 5F, an anomalous position arises in that a decision of a magistrate or District Court judge in determining whether to grant a certificate is judicially reviewable, whereas a determination made by a Supreme Court judge as to whether to grant a certificate under s 2 is not reviewable by way of appeal or otherwise.  
73The anomaly may be explained by the fact that magistrates and judges of the District Court are judges of inferior courts whose decisions are judicially reviewable by the Supreme Court.  There is no statutory right of review in relation to decisions of such judges any more than there is a statutory right of review in relation to judges of the Supreme Court.  The latter, however, are judges of a superior court and when exercising judicial power are not amenable to judicial review by the Court of Appeal.  Whether they would be amenable to review by the High Court need not be considered.  
Was privilege waived when the legal advising document was handed to the Court?
74The evidence before Price J on the hearing of the waiver motions was set out by his Honour in his judgment [2013] NSWSC 760, as follows:
""10 Affidavits of Lloyd Babb, the Director, and John Pickering, a Deputy Director, were read by the Crown. Neither deponent was required for cross-examination. 
11 In an affidavit affirmed on 24 October 2012, Mr Babb states that he directed no further proceedings in relation to both applicants for the murder of Ahmed Fahda. Mr Lungo was not involved in any aspect of the prosecution and at no stage prior to 1 June 2012 did Mr Babb have any conversation with Mr Lungo about the matter. Mr Babb was unaware that the matter was listed on that day and that Mr Lungo was to appear. He only became aware that Mr Lungo handed up to the court his direction for no further proceedings when he was told by Mr Pickering what had occurred before Hidden J on 22 August 2012. Mr Babb states at pars 8-10:
'At no stage, prior to 1 June 2012 did I give any express or implied consent to Mr Lungo, to waive my privilege in relation to the document that he handed up in the Supreme Court on 1 June 2012.
Pursuant to my Prosecution Guidelines, particularly guideline 18, there are only very limited circumstances where a Crown Prosecutor has a right to waive my legal professional privilege without my express consent. None of those limited circumstances existed in this case. 
Had I been aware that Mr Lungo intended to hand up the document that he did on 1 June 2012, I would have immediately indicated to Mr Lungo that the document was privileged and I would not be waiving such privilege.'
12 In an affidavit sworn 24 October 2012, Mr Pickering states that he had provided 'a legal advising report' relating to the possibility of no further proceedings being directed in relation to both applicants for the murder of Ahmed Fahda. Subsequently Mr Babb directed that there be no further proceedings and wrote that direction on page 6 of the legal advice report. Mr Pickering states that Mr Lungo was not involved in any aspect of the applicants' prosecution and provided no legal advice to him in relation to his advice to Mr Babb. Mr Pickering was unaware that the matter was listed before the Supreme Court on 1 June 2012 and that Mr Lungo was to appear. Mr Pickering states at pars 7-9:
'At no time prior to Mr Lungo appearing in Court on 1 June 2012 did I have any conversation with Mr Lungo about the matter of Naseam El Zeyat (sic) and Ramzi Aouad. 
I am now aware that Mr Lungo, on 1 June 2012, in the Supreme Court in Sydney, handed up to the Court page 6 of my advice report that also contained the direction for no further proceedings by Mr Babb. I only became aware that Mr Lungo had handed up this document in Court after Justice Hidden advised myself in the Supreme Court on 22 August 2012, that this document was on the Court file, and he subsequently handed two copies of page 6 down to me. I have maintained custody of those two copies since. 
At no stage, prior to 1 June 2012 did I give any express or implied consent to Mr Lungo, to waive my privilege in relation to the document that he handed up in the Supreme Court on 1 June 2012.'
13 Mr Pickering states that if he had been aware that Mr Lungo intended handing up page 6, he would have immediately indicated to Mr Lungo that the document was privileged and he would not be waiving such privilege under any circumstances.""
75Price J held that the document handed to Barr AJ was privileged, in that it was a confidential communication made for the dominant purpose of the Deputy Director providing legal advice to the Director about pending proceedings, namely, the retrial of the applicant on indictment following the quashing of his conviction by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  His Honour held, therefore, that both ss 118 and 119 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) were engaged unless privilege had been waived.  
76In considering whether privilege had been waived, Price J observed, at [34] and [35], that the loss of client legal privilege was governed by the Evidence Act, s 122 and by common law principles:  see Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66, 201 CLR 1;  Cooper v Hobbs [2013] NSWCA 70.  His Honour noted that it was for the applicant to establish that privilege had been waived:  see R v Petroulias (No 24) [2007] NSWSC 783 at [9] per Johnson J.  
77His Honour next referred to the provisions of s 122, as well as to the common law principle that the benefit of legal professional privilege could be waived by a client and that waiver could be express or implied:  see Mann v Carnell at [28]-[29].  His Honour at [38], continued that consent under s 122(1) includes consent that would be imputed to the client on the same principles that apply at common law to the question of waiver, even though the client did not subjectively intend to waive privilege:  see Chen v City Convenience Leasing Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 297 at [29]-[33];  Petroulias (No 24) at [37].
78His Honour then had regard to the functions and powers of the Director pursuant to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, the functions of the Crown Prosecutor pursuant to the Crown Prosecutors Act 1986 (NSW), and the relationship between the Director and the Crown Prosecutor.  His Honour observed that under the Crown Prosecutors Act, s 5(3), a Crown Prosecutor expressly does not have the function of determining that no bill of indictment be found, or of directing that no further proceedings be taken against a person.  That function resided solely in the Director.  His Honour also observed, at [44], that when a Crown Prosecutor appears in court on behalf of the Director, the Crown Prosecutor provides legal services for the Director, who is the client.  
79Price J, having noted that the procedure for the entry of a nolle prosequi was normally effected by a simple memorandum on the indictment by the Attorney General or an authorised person, observed, at [43], that the evidence provided no explanation as to why the Crown Prosecutor had handed the last page of the legal advising report to the court.  His Honour stated that the Director had not authorised the Crown Prosecutor to hand the document to Barr AJ and that the Director was not aware that the Crown Prosecutor intended to do so. 
80His Honour also referred, at [45], to the Guidelines of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Guideline No 12 indicated that the disclosure of reasons for decisions made in the course of prosecutions or in giving advice remained the province of the Director.  His Honour observed that Guideline No 18 also stated that notwithstanding the duty of disclosure required of a prosecutor in the conduct of a trial, any document in the nature of an internal advice would normally be subject to a claim of privilege.  His Honour noted that there was nothing in that Guideline that permitted the Crown Prosecutor, who appeared before Barr AJ, to waive privilege in respect of any part of the Director's legal advice report.  Thus, in short, the Crown Prosecutor appearing on that day had neither the express nor the implied consent of the Director to disclose the document. 
81His Honour observed, at [46]:
""It does not matter that another lawyer in the Director's office may have given consideration to page 6 of the advice being handed up to the Judge. The privilege could only be waived by the Director. There is no inconsistency between the Director's conduct and the maintenance of the confidentiality. The handing up of the document was not authorised by the Director and in the circumstances he cannot be deemed to have consented, nor can consent to waiver be implied.""
82His Honour concluded, therefore, that client legal privilege had not been waived when the document was handed by the Crown Prosecutor to Barr AJ.
83The applicant challenges his Honour's determination that privilege had not been waived on two bases.  First, he contended that, contrary to his Honour's reasoning, the provisions of the Evidence Act did not apply.  Secondly, the applicant challenged his Honour's conclusion that privilege had not been waived at common law.  
Did his Honour err in relying on the Evidence Act provisions?
84The applicant's argument on the appeal, that his Honour erred in his reliance on the Evidence Act provisions governing privilege and its waiver, was advanced on the basis that the Evidence Act provisions are premised upon evidence being adduced.  The applicant contended that this was not the position here, as in his notice of motion he was seeking access to a document that was on the court file.  The applicant further contended that the provisions of s 131A did not apply as the document was not produced pursuant to a ""disclosure requirement"" within the meaning of that section, or pursuant to any obligatory court process.  It followed that the question whether privilege had been waived had to be determined on the basis of common law principles. 
85The Crown pointed out that the applicant had not contended before Price J that the Evidence Act did not apply and thus should not now be permitted to contend that it does not.  The Crown further submitted that, in an earlier submission, the applicant had stated that the document handed to Barr AJ was relevant to the application for costs and that in that application, ""it could be expected that [the applicant] would rely, at least in part, upon the DPP document now filed with the Court papers"".  The Crown submitted that the submission was predicated upon evidence being adduced.  The Crown submitted that, in any event, his Honour had determined the matter in accordance with common law principles. 
86For reasons which are explained below, the question whether the Evidence Act applies will not affect the outcome in this case.  However, as the issue was raised by the applicant, it is appropriate to deal with it briefly.  
87There is no dispute that the contents of the last page of the legal advising report were privileged.  Pursuant to s 118, if a client objects, evidence is not to be adduced if the court finds that adducing the evidence would result in the disclosure of a confidential communication between a lawyer and a client for the dominant purpose of the lawyer providing legal advice to the client:  s 118(a).  Section 119 provides, relevantly, that evidence is not to be adduced if, on objection by the client, the court finds that adducing the evidence would result in the disclosure of the contents of a confidential document prepared for the dominant purpose of the client being provided with professional legal services relating to an Australian proceeding:  s 119(b).
88There was no requirement for formal proof of the Director's decision in order for the court to act upon a direction made under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, s 7(2)(b).  Barr AJ could have discharged the applicant upon being informed orally of the Director's decision by a representative of the Director.  At the time that the document was handed to the court, Barr AJ was not engaged in a hearing, nor was any evidence required or adduced.  The document was not marked as an Exhibit, nor was it provided to the applicant.  At the point where it is alleged that privilege was waived, ss 118 and 119 of the Evidence Act were therefore not engaged.  Accordingly, subject to the application of s 131A, no question of waiver or privilege arose under the Evidence Act.  We should add that ss 118 and 119 were also not engaged in the application before Price J as the last page of the legal advising report was not sought to be adduced in evidence on that application.
89The Crown submitted, however, that s 131A applied.  In particular, the Crown contended that:
""... the terms of the amended order seeking production of the document pursuant to s 133 of the Evidence Act ... compelled the application of Part 3.10 (Client Legal Privilege) due to the provision of s 131A ...""
90Section 133 provides that if a question arises under the privilege provisions in Pt 3.10 relating to a document, the court may order that the document be produced to it and may inspect the document for the purpose of determining the question.  In the present case, Price J considered that it was not necessary that he see the document and he made no order for its production.  Section 131A was not, therefore, engaged.  
91Nor, in our opinion, did s 131A otherwise have application.  That section governs claims for client legal privilege pursuant to a disclosure requirement, as identified in the section, to give information or to produce a document.  Disclosure requirements include the requirement to produce documents pursuant to subpoena, pre-trial discovery, interrogatories, notices to produce and the like.  In his amended application, the applicant sought an order that he have immediate access to the document handed to the court on 1 June 2012 or have leave to file a notice to produce returnable immediately seeking the production of the document.  However, an application to the court for access to the document in the terms sought by the applicant, including his application for leave to serve a notice to produce, does not fall with the meaning of a disclosure requirement.  The position may be contrasted with a subpoena, which operates as an order of the court to produce documents or to attend to give evidence.  Likewise with a notice to produce, which requires, of its own force, the production of documents to the court.  In the present case, the applicant was seeking an order that the document be produced or, alternatively, that leave be granted to serve a notice to produce.  The Crown was not, at the point of the court's hearing the applicant's notice of motion, subject to any disclosure requirement.
92But even if the notice of motion and the orders sought therein could be characterised as falling within s 131A, such that it was incumbent upon his Honour to determine, in accordance with s 122, whether privilege had been waived, there was no error in his Honour's observation that consent for the purposes of s 122 includes consent imputed to a client at common law.  We observe, however, that whilst the authorities to which his Honour referred, namely, Chen and Petroulias (No 24), support his Honour's conclusion, those decisions predated the amendment to s 122(2) effected by the Evidence Amendment Act 2007 (NSW), s 3 and Sch 1, cl 57.  The Explanatory Memorandum to that Act relevantly stated: 
""Loss of client legal privilege
Section 122 of the Principal Act currently provides that client legal privilege is lost by consent or if a client or party knowingly and voluntarily discloses the substance of the evident.
Schedule 1 [57] replaces section 122 with a new section that is aligned more closely with the common law test for loss of privilege set out in Mann v Carnell ... It implements recommendation 14-5 of the [Uniform Evidence Law:  Report (2005)]
New section 122 provides that evidence may be adduced if the client or party concerned has acted in a way that is inconsistent with the maintenance of the privilege.""
93The new subsection appears to be a clear adoption of the common law principles discussed in Mann v Carnell, although the provision is not identical with the formulation of the common law principle in that case:  see Stephen Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law (11th ed 2014, Thomson Reuters) at [1.3.11040] ff, particularly at [1.3.11070].  However, a unanimous High Court in Expense Reduction Analysts Group Pty Ltd v Armstrong Strategic Management and Marketing Pty Ltd [2013] HCA 46; 250 CLR 303 stated, at [32], that the same considerations relating to waiver at common law equally apply to s 122(2).  We discuss those principles below. 
Was privilege waived at common law?
94The applicant contended that having regard to the following matters, his Honour erred in his determination that legal professional privilege had not been waived.  
95First, he submitted that the Crown Prosecutor, in acting as the legal representative of the Director, and within the scope of his functions as defined by the Director of Public Prosecutions Act and the Crown Prosecutors Act, had voluntarily and intentionally, and without any obligation to do so, handed the document to Barr AJ to be placed on the court file.  
96Secondly, the court file was a public record accessible by parties to the proceedings and even to non-parties with the leave of the court, so that had the file been accessed, the document would have been available for anyone to see.  
97Thirdly, it was relevant that the costs application was foreshadowed on the same day as the court was informed that no further proceedings were being taken on the indictment and was listed for hearing on a later date.  Neither at that point nor subsequently did the Crown Prosecutor seek the return of the document.  The document was returned to the Crown by Hidden J after he had located it on the court file.  The applicant submitted that the intentional filing of the document was accordingly inconsistent with the maintenance of any confidentiality and thus privilege was waived.
98The applicant submitted that this was not a case where a privileged document has been mistakenly produced to another party, but that even in that circumstance, privilege may be lost.  The applicant referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Armstrong Strategic Management and Marketing Pty Ltd v Expense Reduction Analysts Group Pty Ltd [2012] NSWCA 430.  The applicant submitted that the mere fact the Director, as the client of the Crown Prosecutor, now took issue with the Crown Prosecutor's conduct in providing the document to the court, was not to the point.  Privilege had already been waived because of the intentional conduct of the Crown Prosecutor who, in providing the document to the court, was acting within the scope of his statutory functions. 
99The Crown accepted that the question whether privilege had been waived at common law was whether the person entitled to rely on the privilege had acted in a manner that was inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which underpins the privilege, the focus being on the conduct of the person, not upon that person's subjective intentions:  see Mann v Carnell at [29].  The Crown submitted that the intention in the document being handed up to the court was to provide confirmation of the Director's direction.  
100The Crown further submitted that the fact that the document was not provided to the applicant was consistent with the maintenance of confidentiality and was inconsistent with waiver.  The Crown referred to the decision of Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) v Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd [2012] FCA 1101; 207 FCR 380, where inadvertent disclosure in the context of discovery was held not to constitute waiver.  Nor was this a case of selective disclosure, so as to be inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege, as there was no misleading or unfair impression given to the applicant in handing up the document to Barr AJ.
101The Crown also refuted the applicant's assertion that the Crown Prosecutor was acting within the scope of his statutory functions when he handed the document to the court.  
Consideration
102The question of waiver of privilege was considered recently by the High Court in Expense Reduction Analysts Group v Armstrong Strategic Management and Marketing, where the Court unanimously reversed the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, to which the applicant referred in his submissions:  see above at [98].  The case involved the inadvertent disclosure of privileged documents during the course of discovery.  The opposing party did not contest that the documents had been inadvertently disclosed, but contended that by the disclosure privilege had been waived.  
103In the High Court's view, at [63], there was in reality no question of waiver sufficient to be agitated before the court.  In circumstances where there had been no contest to the claim of inadvertence, the Court considered that any allegation of waiver turned on a legal, technical argument tangential to the main proceedings, and should not have been made.  The Court's criticism of the respondent in alleging waiver was based in part upon the obligations of parties to civil litigation imposed by the Civil Procedure Act, ss 56-60.  However, it was also significant to the Court's reasoning that the documents had been produced in the course of discovery.  As the Court explained, at [45], although discovery is an inherently intrusive process in litigation, it is not intended to affect a person's entitlement to maintain the confidentiality of documents where the law allows.  Their Honours stated that it followed that:
""... where a privileged document is inadvertently disclosed, the court should ordinarily permit the correction of that mistake and order the return of the document, if the party receiving the documents refuses to do so.""
104The present case involves criminal proceedings and an application for costs in respect of those proceedings.  Accordingly, the High Court's comments, insofar as they were based upon the processes involved in the conduct of civil litigation and the provisions of the Civil Procedure Act, have no application in this case.  Nonetheless, the Court's view that, in reality, there had been no waiver, requires further consideration, having regard to the circumstances under consideration here.  
105In coming to its determination that the documents should be returned, the High Court, at [30], stated:
""According to its strict legal connotation, waiver is an intentional act done with knowledge whereby a person abandons a right (or privilege) by acting in a manner inconsistent with that right (or privilege) [Craine v Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Co Ltd [1920] HCA 64; 28 CLR 305 at 326; [1920] HCA 64; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Gold Mines Ltd [1937] HCA 58; 59 CLR 641 at 658]. It may be express or implied. In most cases concerning waiver, the area of dispute is whether it is to be implied. In some cases waiver will be imputed by the law [Goldberg v Ng [1995] HCA 39; 185 CLR 83 at 95-96] with the consequence that a privilege is lost, even though that consequence was not intended by the party losing the privilege. The courts will impute an intention where the actions of a party are plainly inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect [Mann v Carnell ... at 13].""
106The Court continued, at [31]:
""In Craine v Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Co Ltd, it was explained that ''[w]aiver' is a doctrine of some arbitrariness introduced by the law to prevent a man in certain circumstances from taking up two inconsistent positions ... It is a conclusion of law when the necessary facts are established. It looks, however, chiefly to the conduct and position of the person who is said to have waived, in order to see whether he has 'approbated' so as to prevent him from 'reprobating''. In Mann v Carnell, it was said that it is considerations of fairness which inform the court's view about an inconsistency which may be seen between the conduct of a party and the maintenance of confidentiality, though 'not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large.'"" (Citations omitted)
107In Mann v Carnell, referred to by the High Court in the passage just quoted and to which Price J referred, the plurality, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ, observed, at [29]: 
""Waiver may be express or implied. Disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect. When an affirmative answer is given to such a question, it is sometimes said that waiver is 'imputed by operation of law'. This means that the law recognises the inconsistency and determines its consequences, even though such consequences may not reflect the subjective intention of the party who has lost the privilege. ...What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality; not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large.""  (Citation omitted)
108In Goldberg v Ng, to which the High Court also referred in the passage cited above, at [105], a solicitor, Mr Goldberg, had provided privileged documents to the Law Society in the course of responding to a complaint made by former clients, whose proceedings in which Mr Goldberg had acted for them, had been compromised.  Notwithstanding that the solicitor purported to maintain the confidentiality of the documents when providing them to the Law Society, the High Court by majority held that, for the purposes of legal proceedings commenced by the clients against the solicitor, privilege had been waived.  
109Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, at 95, observed that the circumstances in which waiver of privilege would be imputed by operation of law could not be precisely defined in advance.  In concluding that privilege had been waived, the majority considered that it was relevant that the solicitor had voluntary disclosed the material and had done so for the purpose of assisting the solicitor in his response to the Law Society. 
110In the course of their reasoning, their Honours referred to Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80; 161 CLR 475.  In that case, the High Court observed that in order to ensure that the opposing litigant is not misled by an inaccurate perception of the disclosed communication, fairness will usually require that waiver as to one part of a protected communication should result in waiver as to the rest of the communication on that subject matter.
111However, as the majority pointed out in Mann v Carnell, at [29], whether privilege has been waived is not determined by the application of some broad test of fairness.  Waiver will be imputed to a party whose inconsistent conduct in relying on a portion of a document gives a misleading or inaccurate perception of the communication.  It is an example of a person impermissibly approbating and reprobating:  see Expense Reduction at [31].  
Was there imputed waiver in this case? 
112In the present case, it was for the applicant to establish that privilege had been waived.  That required the applicant to establish that there was an intentional act, done with knowledge, whereby the Director abandoned the privilege by acting in a manner inconsistent with that right:  see Expense Reduction at [30].  In our view, waiver in this sense has not been proved.  
113Alternatively, the applicant was required to establish that waiver was imputed by law, even though the Director did not intend to waive privilege.  For the law to impute waiver, the applicant was required to establish that the actions of the Crown Prosecutor in handing the document to the judge to place on the file ""was plainly inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality"":  see Expense Reduction at [30].  In determining this question, the court will consider whether there is any unfairness in the privilege being maintained.  In this regard, the court will consider whether, by the conduct said to constitute waiver, the person claiming the privilege has 'approbated', such that the court will not countenance the person 'reprobating'.  
114In the present case, the document was not produced to the court pursuant to a compulsory process.  The document was given to the court as part of the process of informing it of the Director's direction pursuant to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, s 7.  It was not necessary for the court to have any form of written notice of the Director's decision.  In particular, there was no requirement that the reasons of the Director for making the direction pursuant to s 7 be disclosed to the court, to the defendant in the criminal proceedings, or to any other person.  
115At the time the document was provided to Barr AJ, it was not shown to the applicant's legal representatives and they did not request to see the document.  Although the document was placed on the court file without any request that it be marked as confidential, it is implicit in the submissions of the applicant that he had not sought to have access to the Court file prior to the matter being listed before Hidden J on 22 August 2012.  Accordingly, the applicant does not know the contents of the document.  
116As the authorities indicate, waiver involves an intentional abandonment of a right.  The exercise of a right involves a position taken as against or in relation to another party.  It can be inferred from the evidence that the document was provided to the court for the specific purpose of informing it in written form of the Director's direction pursuant to s 7(2).  The portion of the document containing the Director's reasons was not relevant to that purpose.  Significantly, there is nothing in the transcript to indicate that there was any use of, or reliance upon, the privileged portion of the document by the Crown Prosecutor.  
117As Price J accepted, the Director, or a person authorised by him, was the only person who could waive privilege.  On the Director's evidence, he had not given any authority to the Crown Prosecutor to waive privilege.  Clearly, the Crown Prosecutor was the Director's agent for the purpose of informing the court that the Director had made a direction pursuant to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, s 7(2).  To that extent, he had actual authority.  An agent's actual authority may include such authority as is implied by the nature and terms of that actual authority conferred on the agent by the principal.  
118The scope of an agent's implied authority in a particular case will depend upon what is necessary or incidental to the performance of the express terms of the agency:  see Cassar v NSW Crime Commission [2014] NSWCA 356 at [57].  As identified by Price J, in the present case, the right to waive privilege was neither necessary nor incidental to the Crown Prosecutor's task of informing the court that the Director had made a direction under s 7(2).  Accordingly, we consider that the Crown Prosecutor did not have implied authority to waive privilege.  
119The applicant contended, however, that the Crown Prosecutor had apparent authority to waive privilege.  In general terms, the scope of an agent's apparent authority is that which the principal represents or holds out to third parties:  G D Dal Pont, Law of Agency (3rd ed 2013, LexisNexis Butterworths), [8.1].  Apparent authority is to be contrasted with the actual authority of an agent, although an agent may have both implied and apparent authority.  It is well established that a legal practitioner has implied and apparent authority to compromise proceedings:  Waugh v HB Clifford & Sons Ltd [1982] Ch 374 at 387.  However, we are of the opinion that the implied and apparent authority to compromise proceedings does not carry with it the authority to disclose privileged information.  
120In our opinion, having regard to the circumstances in which the document was handed to the court, the Crown Prosecutor's actions were not ""plainly inconsistent"" with the maintenance of confidentiality.
121The Court makes the following order:
Application for leave to appeal dismissed.
122McCOLL JA:  This case concerns the question whether either the Court of Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeal has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal by Naseam El-Zayet from an interlocutory decision of Justice Price given in the course of his Honour hearing an application for a costs certificate pursuant to s 2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW) (the ""Costs Act""): Aouad v R; El-Zayet v R [2013] NSWSC 760 (""El-Zayet 1"").
123The background facts are set out in the joint judgment which I have had the advantage of reading in draft.  I will only repeat, or supplement, that background to the extent necessary to explain my reasons.
124I agree with the conclusion in the joint judgment (at [62]) that there is no appeal to the Court of Appeal from El-Zayet 1.  I do not, however, with respect, agree that there is no avenue of appeal or review available to Mr El-Zayet in respect of that decision.  In my view, the Court, having been constituted as the Court of Criminal Appeal, has jurisdiction to entertain Mr El-Zayet's application for leave to appeal from El-Zayet 1, it being an interlocutory judgment given in proceedings for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (the ""CAR Act"").
125In exercise of that power, I would grant Mr El-Zayet leave to appeal from El-Zayet 1.  However, I agree with the joint judgment that the Director of Public Prosecutions did not waive privilege in respect of the document upon which the Director had written a direction that no further proceedings be taken against Mr El-Zayet.  Accordingly the appeal should be dismissed.
Statement of the case
126Mr El-Zayet (and Mr Aouad) had been arraigned on an indictment charging them with the murder of Ahmed Fahda.  On 30 May 2012 the respondent directed that there be no further proceedings in relation to the charges.  The matter was listed on 1 June 2012 in the Supreme Court's Arraignment List for the purpose of formally entering a nolle prosequi in relation to all counts on the indictment.  On that day, the following occurred (El-Zayet 1 (at [5])):
""[5] Mr L Lungo, a Crown Prosecutor, appeared for the Crown and Ms Spence appeared for both the applicants when the matters were mentioned on 1 June 2012 before Barr AJ. The transcript reveals that Mr Lungo said:'Your Honour, there has been a direction by the Director that there be no further proceedings in relation to both accused and, your Honour, can I hand up a document to be filed with the court file.'[6] His Honour discharged the applicants. Ms Spence told the court that a cost application was foreshadowed. The application for costs was subsequently listed before Hidden J on 22 August 2012 and was opposed by the Crown.""
127Barr AJ then adjourned the proceeding.  No formal step was taken to initiate the costs application.  Rather, it appears it was taken to have been made by the oral advice to the Court on 1 June 2012 followed by, I assume, confirmation of that fact to the court which listed the application for hearing before Hidden J in the circumstances outlined in the joint judgment.  The transcript of the proceedings before Hidden J on 22 August 2012 records the hearing as taking place in the ""Criminal List"" of the Common Law Division.  The ""Criminal List"" annotation did not appear on the transcript of the hearing before the primary judge, but the file numbers are the same as those of the matters listed before Hidden J.  Indeed, they are the same file numbers as those allocated to Mr El-Zayet's (and Mr Aouad's) successful appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal against his conviction for the charge of murder in respect of which the nolle prosequi was ultimately entered: see Aouad and El-Zeyat v R [2011] NSWCCA 61.  The same file numbers appear on El-Zayet 1 and on the judgment dealing with the costs orders consequent upon the ruling in El-Zayet 1: Aouad v R; El-Zayet v R (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 991 (""El-Zayet 2"").
128The decision in El-Zayet 1 was delivered on 14 June 2013.  On 27 June 2013 the applicant filed an application for leave to appeal pursuant to the CAR Act against El-Zayet 1 (the ""CAR application"").  On 28 June 2013 he filed a notice of intention to seek leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal purportedly in accordance with Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) r 51.8.  The summons seeking leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was filed on 12 September 2013.  It was that summons which was before the Court on 26 March 2014 when the issue of jurisdiction arose.  Needless to say it was allocated a Court of Appeal file number.  The status of the CAR application is not apparent from the papers.  There is no suggestion, however, that it has been disposed of in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  
Statutory framework
129Section 2 of the Costs Act relevantly provides:
""2 Certificate may be granted
(1) The Court or Judge or Magistrate in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may:(a) where, after the commencement of a trial in the proceedings, a defendant is acquitted or discharged in relation to the offence concerned, or a direction is given by the Director of Public Prosecutions that no further proceedings be taken, or(b) where, on appeal, the conviction of the defendant is quashed and:(i) the defendant is discharged as to the indictment upon which he or she was convicted, or(ii) the information or complaint upon which the defendant was convicted is dismissed,grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in section 3 and relating to those proceedings.(2) For the avoidance of doubt, a certificate may be granted in accordance with subsection (1) (a) following an acquittal or discharge of a defendant at any time during a trial, whether a hearing on the merits of the proceedings has occurred or not.(3) In this section, 'trial', in relation to proceedings, includes a special hearing conducted under section 19 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 and also includes preliminary proceedings that form part of the trial, for example, a voir dire."" (Emphasis added)
130Section 2 was amended by the Courts Legislation Miscellaneous Amendments Act 2002 (NSW) (Sch 4.2), to add the emphasised clause in s 2(1)(a) to ""remove a doubt that had arisen as to whether a certificate could be granted in such cases due to differences in terminology between the Costs in Criminal Cases Act and the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986"": New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 23 October 2002 (at 5752).
131Reference should be made to other provisions of the Costs Act.  Section 3(1) requires a s 2 certificate to:""(1) ... specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Magistrate granting the certificate:(a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and(b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances."" (Emphasis added)
132Section 3A (Evidence of further relevant facts may be adduced) provides:
""(1) For the purpose of determining whether or not to grant a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the reference in section 3 (1)(a) to 'all the relevant facts' is a reference to:(a) the relevant facts established in the proceedings, and(b) any relevant facts that the defendant has, on the application for the certificate, established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate, and(c) any relevant facts that the prosecutor, or in the absence of the prosecutor, any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, has established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate that:(i) relate to evidence that was in the possession of the prosecutor at the time that the decision to institute  proceedings was made, and(ii) were not adduced in the proceedings.(2) Where, on an application for a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the defendant adduces evidence to establish further relevant facts that were not established in those  proceedings, the Court or Judge or Magistrate to which or to whom the application is made may:(a) order that leave be given to the prosecutor in those proceedings or, in the absence of the prosecutor, to any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, to comment on the evidence of those further relevant facts, and(b) if the Court, Judge or Magistrate think it desirable to do so after taking into consideration any such comments, order that leave be given to the prosecutor or to the person representing the Minister to examine any witness giving evidence for the applicant or to adduce evidence tending to show why the certificate applied for should not be granted and adjourn the application so that that evidence may be adduced.(3) If, in response to an application for a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the prosecutor or, in the absence of the prosecutor, any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application adduces evidence to establish further relevant facts that were not established in those proceedings, the Court or Judge or Magistrate to which or to whom the application is made may:(a) order that leave be given to the defendant to comment on the evidence of those relevant facts, and(b) if the Court or Judge or Magistrate think it desirable to do so after taking into consideration any of those comments, order that leave be given to the defendant to examine any witness giving evidence for the prosecutor or that authorised person."" (Emphasis added)""
133Section 4 relevantly provides:
""4 Payment of costs
(1) A person to whom a certificate has been granted under this Act may apply to the Director-General for payment from the Consolidated Fund of costs incurred in the proceedings to which the certificate relates. The application is to be accompanied by a copy of the certificate.(2) The Director-General may, if of the opinion that, in the circumstances of the case, the making of a payment to the applicant is justified, determine the amount of costs that should be paid to the applicant, not exceeding the maximum amount referred to in subsection (3).(3) The maximum amount is the amount that, in the opinion of the Director-General, would reasonably have been incurred for costs by the applicant in the proceedings, reduced by any amounts that, in the opinion of the Director-General, the applicant:(a) has received or is entitled to receive, or(b) would, if the applicant had exhausted all relevant rights of action and other legal remedies available to the applicant, be entitled to receive,independently of this Act, because of the applicant's having incurred those costs.(4) The Director-General may refuse an application under this section if of the opinion that, in the circumstances of the case, the making of a payment to the applicant is not justified or (without limitation) if costs are otherwise recoverable.(5) The Director-General may defer consideration of an application under this section for as long as the Director-General considers it necessary to do so to enable the Director-General to ascertain any amount referred to in subsection (3).(6) The amount specified in the determination is payable from the Consolidated Fund to the applicant or to another person on the applicant's behalf. Any payments from the Consolidated Fund under this section may be made without further appropriation than this Act."" (Emphasis added)
134The CAR Act relevantly provides:
""5F Appeal against interlocutory judgment or order
(1) This section applies to:(a) proceedings (including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court, and...(2) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies.(3) Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings:(a) if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal, or(b) if the judge or magistrate of the court of trial certifies that the judgment or order is a proper one for determination on appeal.""
135The following definitions in s 2 of the CAR Act appear relevant:
""Court of trial"" means any court from whose finding, sentence, order, or other determination, a person is by this Act entitled to appeal or to apply for leave to appeal.
""The appellant"" includes a person who has been convicted and desires to appeal under this Act"".  (Emphasis added)
The nature of a section 2 application 136In order to determine the jurisdiction question, it is necessary to examine the nature of an application under s 2 of the Costs Act.
137The Costs Act was enacted to displace the ""old rule ... that the Crown neither receives nor pays costs ... notably in criminal proceedings"" (Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59; (1990) 170 CLR 534 (at 538) per Mason CJ; (at 557) per Dawson J (Brennan J agreeing)) and ""to repair the perceived injustice of the common law"": Solomons v District Court of New South Wales [2002] HCA 47; (2002) 211 CLR 119 (""Solomons"") (at [73]) per Kirby J.  It is ""reforming legislation with a beneficial purpose designed to confer valuable privileges upon persons who succeed in criminal prosecutions; its provisions should not be narrowly construed so as to defeat the achievement of its general purposes"": Mordaunt v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2007] NSWCA 121; (2007) 171 A Crim R 510 (""Mordaunt"") (at [36]) per McColl JA (Beazley and Hodgson JJA agreeing). 138The power conferred by s 2 ""was clearly intended to be conferred on all New South Wales courts, at whatever level, exercising criminal jurisdiction"": R v Manley [2000] NSWCCA 196; (2000) 49 NSWLR 203 (""Manley"") (at [55]) per Simpson J (Wood CJ at CL agreeing); cited with apparent approval in Solomons (at [9]) per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.139The grant of a certificate under s 2 of the Costs Act satisfies ""a necessary precondition for the exercise by a State officer of the discretions conferred by s 4, the favourable exercise of which may result in the making of a payment from the Consolidated Fund of the State"": Solomons (at [15]) per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ, (at [51]) per McHugh J.  Sections 2 and 3 confer both jurisdiction and power on the Court to which an application for a s 2 certificate is made: Solomons (at [42] - [43] per McHugh J; Mordaunt (at [35]); AB v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 122 (""AB"") (at [56]) per Sackville AJA (Adamson J agreeing).  
140Section 3(1) sets out ""the preconditions to the exercise of the discretionary power to award a certificate ...[and] serves the dual function of stating what should be specified in the certificate and, impliedly, the necessary preconditions to the exercise of the power"": AB (at [4]) per Basten JA.  141Section 3A(2) makes ""[l]imited provision ... for the constitution of the application as a lis inter partes"": Solomons (at [11]) per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.  Thus, the applicant for a s 2 certificate bears the onus of showing it was not reasonable to institute the proceedings: Manley (at [15]) per Wood CJ at CL; R v Johnston [2000] NSWCCA 197 (heard concurrently with Manley) (at [17], [29]) per Simpson J (Wood CJ at CL agreeing).  However, the judicial officer dealing with an application for a certificate need not be the trial judge or, as in the instant case, the judge before whom the matter was listed to enter the nolle prosequi: Manley (at [61]) per Simpson J (Wood CJ at CL agreeing); Solomons (at [8] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ; at [47] footnote (80) per McHugh J; at [106] per Kirby J).  
142A number of the factors relevant to the exercise undertaken when an application is made for a s 2 certificate were set out in Mordaunt (at [36]).  In addition to those already mentioned, of these the most germane are [36](e), (f) and (m) which explain the task of the court considering the application as follows:
""(e) The task of the court dealing with an application under the [Costs] Act is to ask the hypothetical question, whether, if the prosecution had evidence of all the relevant facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings: Allerton (at 559 - 560); the judicial officer considering an application must find what, within the Act, were 'all the relevant facts' and assume the prosecution to have been 'in possession of evidence of' all of them and must then determine whether, if the prosecution had been in possession of those facts before the proceedings were instituted, 'it would not have been reasonable to institute [them]; an applicant for a certificate must succeed on both the 'facts issue' and the 'reasonableness issue': Treasurer in & for the State of New South Wales v Wade & Dukes (Court of Appeal, 16 June 1994, unreported, BC9402561) per Mahoney JA (with whom Handley and Powell JJA agreed); Ramskogler (at 134 - 135) per Kirby P;
(f) The hypothetical question is addressed to evidence of all of the relevant facts, whether discovered before arrest or before committal (if any); after committal and before trial; during the trial; or afterwards admitted under s 3A of the [Costs] Act; all of the relevant facts proved, whenever they became known to the prosecution and whether or not in evidence at the trial, must then be considered by the decision-maker: Allerton (at 559 - 560); Manley per Wood CJ at CL (at [9])...
...
(m) Section 3 calls for an objective analysis of the whole of the relevant evidence [sic, facts], and particularly the extent to which there is any contradiction of expert evidence concerning central facts necessary to establish guilt, or inherent weakness in the prosecution case; matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of the line of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially within the realm of the ultimate fact finder, whether it be Judge or Jury: Manley per Wood CJ at CL (at [14]); Johnston (at [26] [29]) per Simpson J (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Sully J agreed)...""
143An application for a s 2 certificate would ordinarily enliven the obligation to give adequate reasons: Ramskogler v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (1995) 82 A Crim R 128 (at 141) per Handley JA; see also (at 135, 138) per Kirby P (Sheller JA agreeing).  Such an obligation is an incident of the necessity to facilitate appellate review: Pollard v RRR Corporation Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 110 (at [56]) per McColl JA (Ipp JA and Bryson AJA agreeing).The s 2 jurisdiction
144As the joint judgment has explained (at [26]) it is common ground that the decision by the Director that no further proceedings be taken was made ""after the commencement of a trial in the proceedings"" so that the applicant was entitled to make an application under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act as held in JC v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 228 (""JC"").
145In Beckett v New South Wales [2013] HCA 17; (2013) 248 CLR 432 (at [33]) French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ held, quoting R v GKA (1998) 99 A Crim R 491 (at 496) (""GKA"") per Cole JA (Gleeson CJ and Barr J concurring), that ""once the Director's direction under s7(2)(b) was communicated to the court, the court was deprived of power to proceed further 'upon the current indictment'"".  In my view that statement does not answer the question as to the jurisdiction of this Court, constituted as the Court of Criminal Appeal, to entertain a challenge to an interlocutory decision of a Supreme Court judge made in the course of a s 2 application.  
146The text of the Costs Act supports the conclusion that a court with jurisdiction to deal with a defendant for an offence referred to in s 2(1) has power, as an incident of that jurisdiction, to entertain a s 2 application.  As is apparent from the passages of the Costs Act emphasised earlier in these reasons, the s 2 jurisdiction is enlivened ""in any proceedings"" relating to an offence once one of the triggering events in s 2(1)(a) or (b) occurs.  If a s 2 application is successful, the certificate granted specifies ""the matters referred to in section 3 and relating to those proceedings"".  The inquiry to which the application is directed is as to the reasonableness of instituting ""the proceedings"": s 3(1)(a).  It addresses the hypothetical question referred to in Mordaunt (at [36](e), see [142] above), by reference to the ""relevant facts"" which include those ""established in the proceedings"" (s 3A(1)(a)) and those which relate to evidence that was in the possession of the prosecutor at the time that the decision to institute proceedings was made, and were not adduced in the proceedings: s 3A(c).  If granted, the s 2 certificate founds an application pursuant to s 4 for payment from ""the Consolidated Fund of costs incurred in the proceedings to which the certificate relates"".  
147Thus, from beginning to end, the process of a s 2 application is founded on an event which occurred in the proceedings relating to any offence in which the applicant was the defendant, and focuses on the events concerning their institution and continuation (s 3) to determine whether a certificate should be granted.  This conclusion finds support in Solomons.
148In Solomons the High Court considered the question whether s 68 or s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) rendered the provisions of the Costs Act applicable so as to authorise the grant of a s 2 certificate in the course of the exercise of federal jurisdiction following Mr Solomons' trial and acquittal in a New South Wales State court, on an indictment charging offences under a law of the Commonwealth.  The High Court answered that question in the negative, affirming the decision of this court: Solomons v District Court of New South Wales & Ors [2000] NSWCA 99; (2000) 49 NSWLR 321 (""Solomons CA"") (Mason P and Foster AJA; Sheller JA dissenting).  In the course of their reasons the Court made observations concerning the exercise and nature of the s 2 power.  
149Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ were prepared to assume both that ""in entertaining [following an acquittal by direction] with respect to a State prosecution an application under s 2 of the Costs Act, a State court would be exercising jurisdiction, in the opening words of s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act, which was 'with respect to ... the trial and conviction on indictment' of a person charged with an offence against State law"" and that ""an application under s 2 of the Costs Act, after verdict and before judgment, is made when the jurisdiction with respect to the prosecution is not exhausted"": Solomons (at [18]).  
150McHugh and Kirby JJ each held that the trial court did not lose jurisdiction the moment, for example, a person was acquitted.  Although their Honours' remarks were made by reference to the language of s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act (""with respect to ... the trial""), they have force in relation to circumstances which may arise after the occurrence of any of the events referred to in s 2(1) of the Costs Act.
151McHugh J found (Solomons at [45]) that authority to grant a certificate under s2 of the Costs Act was jurisdiction with respect to the trial on indictment of the appellant because there was a ""discernible and rational link"" between the trial and such an application.  His Honour also held (at [47]) that the ""matter"" was ""not at an end because the court has settled the controversy that is central to the matter"" and that, ""[i]nevitably, incidental matters and procedures may remain alive"".
152Kirby J also rejected the submission that the jurisdiction of the District Court had expired by the time the s 2 application was made because, once Mr Solomons was acquitted, that Court was no longer exercising jurisdiction with respect to ""the trial and conviction on indictment"" (for the purposes of s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act) of a person charged with a federal offence: Solomons (at [94]).  In his Honour's view, notwithstanding the relevant s 2(1) qualifying event, such as acquittal, having occurred, s 2 contemplated that the costs application was made ""in [the] proceedings relating to any offence"": Solomons (at [105]).  
153Thus, it was inconsistent with the language of s 2 of the Costs Act to treat the application ""as being disconnected from, and subsequent to, the proceedings simply because the applicant has been acquitted"": Solomons (at [105]).  Accordingly, for the purposes of the Costs Act, ""such 'proceedings' remain extant so that consideration can be given to the exercise of the discretion enlivened by the application for the certificate"": Solomons (at [106]).  The scheme of the Costs Act is that because the application is determined in the trial proceedings, it is ""incidental or adjunct to them"": Solomons (at [109]; see also at [123]).
154Kirby J said (Solomons at [109]) that his conclusion that a s 2 application was incidental or adjunct to the trial proceedings meant he rejected the contrary view of the majority in this Court in Solomons CA: see Mason P (at [21]; Foster AJA (at [113] - [115])).  Mason P and Foster AJA's respective conclusions were expressed by reference to whether an application for the grant of a certificate under the Costs Act was ""with respect to"" any part of federal jurisdiction invested by s 68.  Neither, with respect, considered the text of the Costs Act and the significance of the multiple references to the application being made, and considered, in connection with ""the proceedings"".  Further, their Honours' reasons on this issue were rejected by McHugh and Kirby JJ in seriously considered dicta.  I do not, with respect, regard the majority's views in Solomons CA on this issue as militating against applying McHugh and Kirby JJ's observations on the relationship between a s 2 application and the trial.  Their Honours' conclusions support the textual construction of the Costs Act I consider is open, that a s 2 application is made as an incident of the proceedings relating to an offence punishable upon indictment referred to in the chapeau to s 2.
155Although, of course, procedure cannot govern the substantive resolution of the issue, it does appear that until the summons was filed in the Court of Appeal, the s 2 application was being treated as having been made in the criminal proceedings in which Mr El-Zayet had been arraigned.  Treating it in that manner is consistent with McHugh J's statement in Solomons (at [42]) that the jurisdiction of the court before which Mr El-Zayet was arraigned ""was not only the authority to decide the 'matter' involved in an indictment alleging an offence against State law [but] also included the authority to decide an application under s 2 of the Costs Act"".
156Thus, in my view, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court enlivened by Mr El-Zayet's arraignment (see s 130, Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and generally the discussion in JC v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (at [15]ff) per Basten JA (Beazley P and Ward JA agreeing) continued notwithstanding the entry of the nolle prosequi so that the court had power to entertain his s 2 application in those ""proceedings"".  As those proceedings were ""proceedings ... for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court"", they fell within the meaning of s 5F of the CAR Act.  It follows that I disagree, with respect, with Price J's conclusion (El-Zayet 2 (at [11])) that the s 2 application was a civil proceeding within the meaning of s 3 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) (the ""CP Act"").  Rather, because the application is made in the proceedings against the defendant for an offence (s 2, Costs Act) they fall within the chapeau to the definition of ""criminal proceedings"" in s 3 of the CP Act.
157The next question is whether the decision in El-Zayet 1 was an ""interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings"": s 5F(3).  In my view it was.
158An interlocutory judgment or order for the purposes of s 5F(3) is ""the decision of a court which determines the proceedings (or an identifiable or separate part of them) and which is entered in the records of the court"": R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 (at 636); approved and applied in Cheikho v R [2008] NSWCCA 191; (2008) 75 NSWLR 323 (at [32]) per Spigelman CJ (Barr and Fullerton JJ agreeing).  El-Zayet 1 determined Mr El-Zayet's notice of motion, which the primary judge ordered be dismissed with costs, an order which in the ordinary course, would have been entered in the court's records.  It did not finally determine his s 2 application which awaits resolution.  
159Accordingly, El-Zayet 1 determined an identifiable or separate part of the proceedings, namely whether the primary judge ought accede to the amended notice of motion seeking access to the document the DPP had handed up in court.  In my view El-Zayet 1 constituted an interlocutory judgment made in proceedings for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court within the meaning of s 5F(1)(a) of the CAR Act such as to attract the jurisdiction conferred by s 5F(3) to appeal by leave to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
160In considering the question of jurisdiction, it should be borne in mind that ""rights of appeal are not narrowly confined"": Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383; (2013) 85 NSWLR 783 (at [46]) per Basten JA (Bathurst CJ, Beazley P, Price and Beech-Jones JJ agreeing); Solomons (at [104]) per Kirby J.  The conclusion that an appeal, albeit by leave, lies from an interlocutory judgment or order made in a s 2 application pursuant to the CAR Act ensures that all defendants who make such applications have recourse to appellate review.
161Absent an avenue of appeal under the CAR Act, applicants for s 2 certificates who were arraigned in the Supreme Court would have no right to any review of an interlocutory decision made on that application.  However, ""the Costs Act cannot properly be construed without reference to the legislative scheme for the conduct of trials, both summary and on indictment"": JC (at [36]).  When viewed in that context, it is plain that such an outcome would not conform to the scheme of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) and legislation dealing with criminal proceedings.  That scheme ensures that criminal proceedings do not fall within the civil jurisdiction of the court established by the Supreme Court Act, the Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW) and the CP Act.  Rather, such proceedings fall within the ambit of the scheme constituted, without being exhaustive, by the Criminal Procedure Act, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and the CAR Act.
162As is apparent from the joint judgment (at [43]), the enactment of s 5F of the CAR Act was contemporaneous with the enactment of the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1988 (NSW) which inserted s 17 of the Supreme Court Act.  Section 17 has the effect of excluding from the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction, inter alia, any ""claim for relief ... against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in [proceedings in the Court for the grant of a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967].  
163The inter-relationship between the civil and criminal schemes was explained in WO v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCA 370 (Basten JA, Fullerton and McCallum AJJA) as follows:
""[4] Section 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act was intended to provide a facility for appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an 'interlocutory judgment or order' in proceedings which included, relevantly for present purposes, prosecutions on indictment in the District Court: s 5F(1)(a), the provision being introduced by the Criminal Appeal (Amendment) Act 1987 (NSW). The introduction of that facility in the Court of Criminal Appeal was accompanied by an exclusion of jurisdiction in this Court to deal with the same subject matter. Thus, s 17(1) of the Supreme Court Act provides that 'no claim for relief lies to the court against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings referred to in paragraph (a1) or (a2) of [the Third] Schedule' ...""
164It is apparent from the express excision of a ""[claim for relief ... against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings in the Court] for the grant of a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967"" from the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction in para (i) of the Third Schedule to the Supreme Court Act at the time s 5F(3) was enacted that the legislature intended that, henceforth, appellate proceedings arising from claims for relief in respect of such proceedings would be dealt with in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The only ""proceedings"" to which para (i) could refer are those commenced by a s 2 application.  It could hardly be inferred that by that excision, the legislature intended to extinguish any opportunity for appellate review of either the decision in a s 2 application, or an interlocutory judgment or order made in its course.
165Further, as the Court explained in R v Steffan (at 635), ""it was the stated intention of the legislature that s 5F would transfer proceedings in relation to [interlocutory orders] from the Court of Appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal"".  Accordingly the legislature also envisaged that there may be a need for appellate review of interlocutory aspects of such an application, the vehicle for which would clearly be s 5F(3).  (I note, that it is possible, of course, that a s 2 application per se could be characterised as interlocutory, but it is not necessary to decide that in order to dispose of this matter.)166The fact that the CAR Act facilitates appellate review of interlocutory decisions arising from criminal proceedings is also apparent from s 2 of the CAR Act set out above (at [135]) which makes it plain (if s 5F(3) was not sufficient) by the inclusive definition of ""appellant"", that an appellant for the purposes of the CAR Act need not be a person who had been convicted.  The definition of ""court of trial"" also makes it clear that an appeal or application for leave to appeal may be brought from a ""determination"" other than one consequent upon a conviction.  167It is telling, too, in my view, that the legislature identified an ""interlocutory judgment or order"" for the purposes of s 5F as one ""given or made in proceedings"", thus echoing the concept of an application made ""in any proceedings"" which appears in the chapeau to s 2 of the Costs Act.  
168I do not think, with respect, that the judgments referred to in [70] of the joint judgment militate against this conclusion.  None concerned the issue which arises in this case.  Both concerned the rejection of s 2 applications made in the District Court.  The statement made by Basten JA in Chahal v Director of Public Prosecutions [2008] NSWCA 152 (at [55]) (""Chahal"") was obiter as the claimant sought orders in the nature of prerogative relief with respect to a decision refusing his application for a certificate under the Costs Act.  The claimant in AB also sought prerogative relief with respect to a decision refusing his application for a certificate under the Costs Act.  He had first sought to appeal from that decision, but his notice of appeal was dismissed as incompetent by consent, there being as Basten JA said (at [12]) no appeal from such an order.  There was no consideration of, nor necessity for such discussion in the light of the claims for prerogative relief, whether such an appeal could be pursued in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Finally, Simpson J's statement in Manley (at [67]) says no more than is self-evident.  A s 2 application is a creature of statute.  It does not deny that the application, as s 2 dictates, is made ""in any proceedings relating to any offence..."" (emphasis added).
169In my view this court should accept Mr El-Zayet's submission that it has jurisdiction, sitting as the Court of Criminal Appeal, to entertain the CAR application, being an application pursuant to s 5F(3) of the CAR Act for leave to appeal from El-Zayet 1.
A possible alternative
170If my conclusion is incorrect, the apparent consequence is that defendants in proceedings for an offence tried in the Supreme Court have no avenue of review of an interlocutory or final decision made in a s 2 application.
171As is apparent from Chahal and AB, the Supreme Court's supervisory jurisdiction exercised by the Court of Appeal (s 48(2), Supreme Court Act) is available in respect of decisions of inferior courts in s 2 applications.  However, prima facie, such relief does not lie in respect of a decision of a Judge of this court on the premise that the determination of a s 2 application involves an exercise of judicial power: Patsalis v Attorney General for New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 343; (2013) 85 NSWLR 463 (at [29] - [32]) per Basten JA (Bathurst CJ and Beazley P agreeing).  Whether that is so is not settled.
172An exercise of judicial power ""results in a judgment or order that is binding of its own force"": Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2001] HCA 16; (2001) 203 CLR 645 (at [31]); see also Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [1999] HCA 9; (1999) 198 CLR 334 (""Bass"") (at [45]).  On its face, that is not the outcome of a s 2 application.  Rather, a successful application results in a certificate containing the opinion referred to in s 3, which, in turn, founds the application for payment pursuant to s 4.  
173Competing views were expressed about this issue in Solomons.  The Costs Act as it applied in Solomons was in different terms to the Costs Act as presently enacted, but not relevantly substantively so.  The relevant provisions appear in Sheller JA's reasons in Solomons CA (at [29]).  What was a two-step process under s 4, involving both the Under Secretary of the Department of the Attorney General and Justice and the Treasurer, now requires only consideration and action by the Director-General of the Attorney General's Department.
174In the High Court the plurality said, referring to Bass, that ""the grant of a [s 2] certificate by a court exercising federal jurisdiction would involve it in the exercise of power not provided by Ch III of the Constitution [as it] would be productive of a futility, not the resolution of any claim or controversy"": Solomons (at [28], emphasis added).  Their Honours added that ""the grant of a [s 2] certificate [would not] be the exercise by the court of an administrative function 'truly appurtenant' to the exercise by the court of its judicial power to conduct the trial of the applicant for the certificate"": Solomons (at [28]).  They distinguished Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees' and Builders Labourers' Federation [No 2] [1982] HCA 57; (1982) 152 CLR 179 (at 186 - 187) where, while Brennan J concluded that ""[t]he power conferred upon a court to grant a costs certificate [under s 6 of the Federal Proceedings (Costs) Act 1981 (Cth) (the ""Federal Costs Act"")] is not judicial"", his Honour held that that did not spell its invalidity as it was ""a function truly appurtenant to the exercise by that court of its judicial power to determine the appeal and to award costs of the appeal"".  
175McHugh J expressed a contrary view.  Applying the principle that ""[n]o narrow view should be taken of what constitutes judicial power"", his Honour held that ""[t]he jurisdiction of State courts under the Costs Act involves exercising judicial power"": Solomons (at [49]).  In his Honour's view, the issue determined in a s 2 application fell within the ""paradigm case of an exercise of judicial power involv[ing] the making of binding declarations of rights in the course of adjudicating disputes about rights and obligations as a result of the operation of the law upon events or conduct that have or has occurred"".  This was despite the fact that the Treasurer may refuse to act on a certificate granted under s 2 as a ""court may exercise judicial power although it is reviewing an exercise of non-judicial power and its declaration of right is but a step to the exercise of a discretionary administrative power"": Solomons (at [52]).
176Kirby J concluded that ""the functions performed by the judicial officer under the Costs Act are 'truly appurtenant' to the exercise of the judicial power"", observing that ""[f]ederal courts themselves grant like certificates all the time [referring to the Federal Costs Act s 6, s 7, s 7A, s 8 and s 9] [and] [n]o one suggested that, in doing so, they exceeded their judicial warrant"".  The Federal Costs Act confers a power analogous to the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 (NSW).
177Kirby J's view is supported by the reasons of Gibbs CJ (with whom Mason and Wilson JJ agreed) and Brennan J in Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees' and Builders Labourers' Federation, the latter being set out above (at [174]).  Gibbs CJ held (at 183 - 184) that, because s 16 of the Federal Costs Act obliged the Attorney-General to authorize payment in accordance with the Act, s 6 was a valid enactment because it was an ""incident[s] in the exercise of strictly judicial powers"".  
178If, therefore, the view of the plurality in Solomons was accepted, and the s 2 power involved an administrative, rather than judicial, determination, the Court's supervisory jurisdiction may be attracted in the manner explained in Patsalis.
179It is unnecessary (and undesirable) finally to decide this point as it was not raised by either party, and the jurisdiction issue is sufficiently determined by holding that it has its source in s 5F(3) of the CAR Act.
Orders
180I would make the following orders in relation to the CAR application:

2765546,R v IL (No 4) [2014] NSWSC 1801,"ex tempore REMARKS ON SENTENCE (REVISED)

Â 

1IL (""the offender"") is to be sentenced for five offences in relation to which a jury returned verdicts of guilty on Tuesday, 9 December 2014.

Â 

2The offences arose out of the offender's involvement with a man called Lan in the manufacture of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The criminal enterprise was uncovered in tragic circumstances. In the early hours of 4 January 2013, police and fire fighters attended premises in Quarry Road, Ryde, in response to an emergency call by a neighbour. When they arrived they found smoke pouring from the house and went they entered they discovered that the bathroom was well alight. Lan was naked and had suffered substantial burns to 60% of his body. The offender was also present suffering from smoke inhalation. Both Lan and the offender were taken to hospital. The offender recovered quickly but Lan died 10 days later.

Â 

3The offender was charged with a number of offences. On 18 November 2014 she was arraigned in relation to 6 counts including a count (2) by which she was charged with murder with an alternative charge of manslaughter. At the conclusion of the prosecution case I directed verdicts of not guilty in relation to both the murder and manslaughter charges: R v ILÂ (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1710.

Â 

4The trial continued and the offender gave evidence. Two witnesses were also called in the defence case. The jury retired to consider its verdicts at around 11:00am on 9 December 2014 and returned with verdicts of guilty in relation to all of the remaining charges shortly before 4:00pm on that date.

Â 

5All of the offences are serious. This is reflected in the maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods which apply. The counts in relation to which the jury returned verdicts of guilty are as follows:

(1)Manufacture a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine - maximum penalty of life imprisonment; standard non-parole period 15 years.

Â 

(3)Possess pistol without authorisation - maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment; standard non-parole period 3 years.

Â 

(4)Possess prohibited weapon - maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment; standard non-parole period 3 years.

Â 

(5)Possess pistol without authorisation - maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment; standard non-parole period 3 years.

Â 

(6)Possess pistol without authorisation - maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment; standard non-parole period 3 years.

Â 

The manufacture offence

6The offence charged in count one of the indictment is self-evidently an extremely serious offence. The precise role played in the commission of the offence by the offender is not clear. Plainly, the jury rejected the version of events provided by her in evidence. However certain aspects of the conduct are clear based on the undisputed evidence led by the Crown, from reasonable inferences arising from that evidence and from those parts of the offender's evidence which were not disputed or which I accept and are not inconsistent with the verdicts of the jury.

Â 

7The premises in Ryde were owned by the offender. The offender permitted the deceased man Lan to use those premises in the process of manufacture.

Â 

8That process is described more fully in my earlier judgment at [58]. It involved the final stage of manufacture whereby the purity level of the methylamphetamine was increased to a very marked degree by means of an evaporation process in which the raw product was placed in a solvent (acetone) and boiled to allow impurities to be extracted as the substance vaporised. The evidence showed that the process resulted in methylamphetamine with a purity level of less than 20% being refined or converted into methylamphetamine with a purity of well over 80%. Items found at the premises in the aftermath of the fire showed various quantities of methylamphetamine in varying degrees of purity. This indicated that in some instances the process had been completed whereas in other instances it had either just commenced or was in preparation.

Â 

9There was well in excess of 6 kg of methylamphetamine at the premises. The forensic chemist provided a calculation of the amount of solid methylamphetamine (salts, powder or crystal) found at the premises but in doing this calculation he took into account the purity level. Without any great precision, it is clear that if the admixture provision had been applied to the calculation, the amount of the drug was well in excess of 6 kg: see s 4 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). Whatever be the precise amount, it was far in excess of the large commercial quantity proscribed by the schedule to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (ie 1 kg).

Â 

10The raw product was not produced at the Ryde premises. The forensic chemist gave evidence that all that was occurring at the Ryde premises was the refining or evaporation process and that the raw methylamphetamine had produced being produced elsewhere (T 360).

Â 

11While the manufacturing process at Ryde was not particularly sophisticated, it was obviously a serious and commercial venture. There were pots and other items containing solids and liquids which tested positive for methylamphetamine throughout the house and in particular within the kitchen and bathroom of the premises. The bathroom had been set up with a gas burner, LPG gas bottle and large cooking pot for the purpose of using the bathroom as well as the kitchen to undertake the refining of methylamphetamine. The obvious purpose of this was to maximise the amount of methylamphetamine able to be produced in a short period of time.

Â 

12There were many items at the house plainly used or designed to be used in the process of manufacture and these included a number of large pots and other vessels used to heat or store the product at various stages of the purification process. There were items used to separate the solid from the liquid after the evaporation process including sieves, a Buchner funnel and associated vacuum flask and pump. There were plastic buckets, latex gloves, thermometers, the gas burner and gas bottle used to convert the suburban bathroom into an ad hoc meth lab. There were also chopsticks, which can be used to control the boiling process. There was nothing else in the house that suggested that it was being used for any purpose other than the manufacture of methylamphetamine.

Â 

13From that evidence it is clear that, at the very least, the offender was involved in the manufacture by permitting Lan to use her premises for the singular purpose of manufacturing methylamphetamines in very large quantities.

Â 

14But the offender's criminality and role was more extensive than that. Again, because her evidence was obviously rejected by the jury, the precise scope of her involvement is unclear. However the evidence at trial proved that she had purchased 8 litres of acetone on 1 January 2014 (see Ex W). The offender also gave evidence in the trial that she had taken two gas bottles to a service station and filled them. She said those gas bottles were similar to one found in the bathroom. The offender also gave evidence at the trial that at some time early in the morning on 4 January 2014 she stirred a pot in the kitchen which contained a substance which plainly was methylamphetamine in the process of extraction. While her account was that she did not know what she was stirring, the jury rejected that suggestion.

Â 

15Apart from the activities at Ryde, the police also located relevant evidence at the offender' home in South Hurstville. This included a sum of around $16,900 in cash along with around 15.1 grams of methylamphetamine. It is difficult to know precisely what is to be drawn from that but I think it is safe to assume that most of the $16,900 in cash was not innocently obtained as the offender told the jury in her evidence but was in some way connected with the criminal enterprise in which she was engaged in with Lan. A substantial portion is likely to have been payment for the use of the premises. Similarly, it is unclear precisely what to make of the relatively small quantity of methylamphetamine found at her premises, but it is safe to assume that the jury rejected her assertion that this was the property of Lan and that she did not know that the drugs were there. As the Crown Prosecutor put to the jury, the fact that her bedroom door at Hurstville was generally kept locked indicated that some form of illegal activity was taking place there.

Â 

16Precisely what was to happen to the 15.1 grams of methylamphetamine found at the offender's Hurstville home is unclear, but it provided further evidence of her criminal association with Lan and of her connection to the manufacturing process that was taking place at Ryde.

Â 

17In terms of the length of time during which the offender was involved in the manufacturing process, there is some evidence that she and Lan set up a safety deposit box on 2 December 2012. However, there is no evidence of its use and, while I accept that the safety deposit box was probably set up for the purpose of secretly storing money and perhaps drugs associated with the ultimate enterprise, I am unable to conclude that the manufacturing process itself commenced as early as the date that the safety deposit box was opened or that the offender was knowingly involved in the drug activity at that earlier date. There was other evidence in the trial that suggested that the offender and Lan had some legitimate plans to go into business together.

Â 

18An important piece of evidence on the subject of the length of time over which the process was occurring at the Ryde premises came from a defence witness called Allen Tang. The verdicts of the jury did not necessarily involve the rejection of Mr Tang's evidence and, while he was cross-examined, there was no suggestion that Mr Tang was lying. I found Mr Tang to be an impressive witness and I accept the submission made by counsel for the offender in his address to the jury that his evidence should be accepted in its entirety.

Â 

19Mr Tang gave evidence that on Boxing Day of 2012 the offender called him and asked him to assist her in moving a wardrobe and to look at the electrical wiring and lighting at the premises. Mr Tang attended the premises and observed that the premises were for the most part vacant. I accept that evidence. He was asked to move one or two pieces of furniture and to check the lighting and the wiring and he gave certain advice to the offender in that regard.

Â 

20Mr Tang's evidence gives rise to two inferences, one favourable to the offender and the other unfavourable to her. I am satisfied, based on Mr Tang's evidence that no manufacturing process had occurred or was occurring on or before 26 December 2012. Any activity that took place in the premises at Ryde for which the offender is to be a sentenced therefore occurred over a relatively short period, namely the seven or eight days between 26 December 2012 until 4 January 2013. However, I also draw the inference from Mr Tang's evidence that the offender was at that stage having the premises prepared for the manufacturing process that she knew was to occur in the following days or weeks.

Â 

21Apart from Mr Tang's evidence and the opening of the safety deposit box, the first clear evidence of the offender's involvement came with her purchasing the acetone at Bunnings on 1 January 2013. However based on Mr Tang's observations of the house being almost completely vacant on 26 December 2012, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that on that date, or by that date, the offender had agreed to provide her premises to Lan for the criminal purpose of manufacturing a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine and had taken steps to prepare the premises for that purpose.

Â 

22As the High Court pointed out in Olbrich v The Queen [1999] HCA 54 at [19] the relevant inquiry is to determine ""what the offender did"". To summarise, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that:

(i)The offender agreed to allow Lan to use her premises at Ryde for the sole purpose of manufacturing a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine.

Â 

(ii)A quantity in excess of 6 kg of methylamphetamine was in fact refined at those premises in accordance with that agreement.

Â 

(iii)The offender was to receive financial reward for her involvement and had received around $16,900 already. Precisely how much she would ultimately have received is not clear on the evidence but based on the finding of in excess of $300,000 at the Ryde premises I am satisfied that the profits to be made were substantial.

Â 

(iv)The offender's involvement was more than simply providing the premises. She actively arranged for and purchased some of the solvent (acetone) which was used in the manufacturing process and refilled gas bottles which were used for the purpose of heating the items necessary to conduct the evaporation process. She was present at the premises for at least part of the time that the evaporation process was taking place and actively assisted Lan by stirring the mixture as it evaporated.

Â 

23The things that I have just set out other things that I am able to find on the evidence that the offender actually did. While the majority in Olbrich said that it is not always useful or possible to determine precisely where in a hierarchy an offender stands, there is evidence in the present case that leads me to the conclusion that the offender was less involved in the enterprise than Lan and was subordinate to him. In particular, the $328,000 in cash found at Ryde was located in circumstances that clearly indicate that it was Lan's money. The cash was found in three locations. LI's property (clothing, handbag etc) was found in a particular bedroom at the back of the house. None of the cash was found there. The first amount was found in a leather bag that also containd Lan's passport. The balance of the cash was found in two shopping bags found in a room in the house not connected with LI. Both of those bags were analysed and found to have DNA consistent with than of Lan.

Â 

24The fact that the offender had a substantially smaller amount of money in her premises at Hurstville persuades me that she was subordinate to Lan in this enterprise. She was being paid in consideration of her allowing the premises to be used and she undertook at least two errands (filling the gas bottle and purchasing some of the acetone) at Lan's request or direction.

Â 

25I am prepared to accept that part of the offender's evidence where she said that she and Lan were involved in some kind of a relationship and that she considered him to be her boyfriend. From that, I am also prepared to sentence her on the basis that her involvement in the criminal enterprise arose as a result of her relationship with Lan and that he somehow persuaded her, probably by the offer of substantial financial rewards, to allow him to use her residential premises at Ryde for the purpose of manufacturing the drug.

Â 

26By reference to the maximum penalties and standard non-parole period, and considering the amount of drugs involved and the offender's financial motivation and essential role in the enterprise, the criminality in this case is substantial. On the other hand her involvement was over a relatively short period of time and seems to have been the result of her unfortunate connection with Lan. That latter matter does not mitigate her criminality very much, but it places it in a different context to that of a person who is simply involved in a criminal organisation or activity.

Â 

27One of the reasons that I have come to that somewhat benign view of her involvement is the strong and uncontested evidence of her previous good character and work ethic. Whilst the jury was obviously not persuaded that her prior good character was such that it had a reasonable doubt about her involvement, the evidence remains relevant in a proper assessment of her level of involvement and the reasons that she may have become involved. Whilst the jury obviously rejected large parts of the offender's evidence, an acceptance of those parts of her evidence where she described her relationship with Lan is not inconsistent with the verdicts.

Â 

28The seriousness of the drug offence is also highlighted and exacerbated by two other factors. The first is the fact that there were three pistols present at the premises. As the Crown submitted to the jury, the presence of these pistols along with the large sum of cash, underscored the commercial and criminal nature of what was taking place. The other matter concerns the dangerousness of the activity itself. It is notorious that methylamphetamine is a extremely addictive drug which has dire consequences on end users and on their lives and the lives of their loved ones. This case also demonstrates in a graphic way the risks and dangers involved in the manufacturing process itself. It is fortuitous that the fire was contained within the bathroom and that it did not spread to surrounding premises where innocent members of the community were no doubt asleep in the early hours of the morning. The dangerous activity took the life of one of the perpetrators of this offence. Of course, the death of Mr Lan is not to be taken into account as some form of aggravating feature in assessing the offender's criminality or moral culpability, but it highlights the dangers involved in producing drugs in the method here employed.

Â 

29I was told by the Crown prosecutor in an application for a discharge of the jury after the directed verdict that there is an increase in prevalence of these kinds of clandestine laboratories. That is a matter that highlights the need for general deterrence. The sentence that will be imposed on the offender will take that matter into account in a meaningful way.

Â 

Firearms and weapons offences

30In relation to the pistol charges, there was a reverse onus of proof cast upon the offender by reference to s 4A of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW). Because the guns were found in her premises and/or car she was required to establish on balance of probabilities that she was not in (joint) possession of the guns with Lan. Clearly, the jury were not so satisfied. While I may have come to a different conclusion in that regard, I am bound to give effect to the jury's verdict and the question that was asked in the course of the deliberations suggests that the jury saw the weapons as being an inherent part of the criminal enterprise in which Lan and the offender were involved.

Â 

31However, the location of the guns in each case satisfies me that they were Lan's guns, albeit that the offender was jointly in possession of them. The 9mm Luger (count 3) and associated 20 round magazine were found in Lan's leather bag along with a large sum of cash and Lan's passport. The .38 calibre Smith & Wesson was found in a homemade holster attached to a pair of men's trousers. The .45 calibre Norinco was in a car, registered in the offenders name, that I accept was used by Lan over the previous days or weeks and as part of the preparations for the manufacturing process. I am satisfied that the deceased owned the guns. However, the jury found that the offender was aware of the presence of the weapons on her premises and in her car and was in joint possession of them for the purpose of the criminal enterprise involving the drugs.

Â 

32The pistol involved in count 3 is a kind of automatic or semi automatic pistol and in my view should attract a slightly longer sentence than those appropriate for counts 5 and 6. The magazine in count 4 will attract a lesser sentence.

Â 

The relationship between the weapons and the drug manufacture: totality, concurrence and accumulation

33The connection between the weapons that were found in the premises and in the car and the drug manufacturing business highlights and exacerbates the criminality of the drug offences because it shows the degree to which the participants were prepared to act outside of the law to protect their plainly lucrative criminal business. On the other hand, the gun charges themselves are all individually very serious, reflected by the standard non-parole periods (three years) applicable to each. This gives rise to questions as to the operation of the principles of totality of the criminality and the appropriateness of cumulative and concurrent sentences.

Â 

34I accept the Crown Prosecutor's submission that there must be a degree of accumulation between the individual charges. I intend to invoke the provisions of s 53A and impose an aggregate sentence. In due course, and in accordance with s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), I will indicate the sentence that would have been imposed in relation to each offence. For the sake of transparency, I indicate that I would have made the sentences for the gun charges predominantly concurrent because their existence has been taken into account in assessing the criminality of the drug offence. However I would have accumulated those gun charges to a degree because the offences are, in themselves, very serious and there must be a clear denunciation of conduct involved in possessing such dangerous and formidable weapons such as these. The one exception to this approach of partial accumulation concerns count 3 (the Lugar) and count 4 (the magazine). Those items were found together and the magazine is essentially part of the pistol. I would have made the sentences for those two offences wholly concurrent with one another. The criminality of those 2 offences can properly be reflected and encompassed by the imposition of an entirely concurrent sentence.

Â 

35I indicate that I would have accumulated counts 3, 5 and 6 by a period of six months but would have made the offences otherwise concurrent. I would have found special circumstances in the accumulation itself and adjusted the sentence (see s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). There are also special circumstances justifying an adjustment of the non-parole period so that the balance of term of the aggregate sentence exceeds one third of the total sentence (see s 44(2B). This the offender's first gaol sentence and she will require a longer than usual period on parole to assist her in assimilating back into the community at the expiration of the inevitably lengthy non-parole period.

Â 

The offender's personal circumstances 

36The offender is a 45 year old woman with no prior convictions.

Â 

37Evidence of her good character was given at the trial by Allen Tang and the offender's 22 year old son AL. I found both of these witnesses to be very impressive.

Â 

38On the basis of their evidence and the evidence given by the offender herself as to her personal history, I am satisfied that that since coming to Australia in 1990 that the offender has worked in a variety of jobs and has been a useful and valuable member of the community.

Â 

39She has no prior convictions of any kind. She gave uncontested evidence that she has never been in trouble with police. That may have been a reason that Lan and those with whom he was associated targeted her because her premises would be, from an outsider's point of view, beyond reproach or suspicion. The relevance of that fact has been emphasised in a number of cases where it has been said that the good character of an person involved, for example, in drug importation does not receive the same weight because such people are often used as mules to avoid detection. In my view the present case is not completely analogous to that and I propose to give the offender the full benefit of her good character in assessing an appropriate sentence.

Â 

40In spite of those matters, the seriousness of the offences is so grave and the requirement for general deterrence so great, that the sentence to be imposed on her must be one of real significance.

Â 

41However, I have found that her prior good character and lack of criminal record are significant mitigating features: see s 21A(3)(e) and 21A(3)(f).

Â 

42I also accept Mr Pontello's submission that her prior good character and lack of criminal convictions is sufficient foundation, along with the concept of the personal deterrence inherent in the sentence that I must impose on her, for a finding that she has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. These are both mitigating features both at common law and under s 21A(3)(g) and (h).

Â 

43I accept that Mr Pontello has conducted the case with economy and efficiency and that the case has taken much less time than it might otherwise have. I accept that the offender has co-operated to some degree in the efficient conduct of the proceedings. However, I am unable to accept Mr Pontello's submission that she is entitled to receive a lesser sentence as a result of her co-operation and willingness to facilitate the course of justice: s 22A. The circumstances are far removed from those that prevailed in R v Hines (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 1273 in which I reduced the sentence to take into account the manner in which the case had been conducted (see paragraphs [2]-[9]).

Â 

The standard non-parole period and an assessment of the objective gravity of the offences

44As I have said, there is a standard non-parole period of 15 years for the manufacturing offence and 3 years for each of the weapons charges: s 54A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999 (NSW). The way in which this is to be taken into account received authoritative treatment in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39.

Â 

45I have taken into account the standard non-parole periods as one of the many diverse and relevant matters that must be synthesised to determine the appropriate sentence for this individual offender for these very serious offences.

Â 

46The standard non-parole period applies to cases ""in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". The Crown Prosecutor has submitted that the manufacturing offence is ""above the middle range of objective seriousness. The defence has submitted that it is ""well below"" the middle of the range. I accept neither of those categorisations. I have come to the view that that the offence falls below (but not ""well below"") the putative middle range in view of (i) the limited nature of the offender's involvement, (ii) the nature of her involvement suggests she was, as it was put by Mr Pontello, a ""menial assistant or gopher"" and (iii) the short period of time over which I can be satisfied that she was involved. In coming to that conclusion, I am conscious of the fact that the provision of the premises was essential to the process.

Â 

47I have taken into account the quantity and value of the drugs and accept that the offender knew generally how much drugs were involved: cf Wong and Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [31] (Gleeson CJ) and [64] (Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ).

Â 

48However, a proper assessment of her role is at least as important as an identification of the quantity involved: Wong and Leung at [68]-[70]. In Melikian v R [2008] NSWCCA 156 Price J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Hidden J agreed) at [33] cited with approval the following observations of Wood CJ at CL in R v MacDonnell (2002) 128 A Crim R 44 at [33]:

""It is also to be accepted that the mere quantity of the drugs is not the sole, or even the principal, determinant for sentencing in relation to drug offences. What is more important is the role of the offender, and the level of his or her participation in the offence; subject of course to the fact that, in relation to supply offences under State law, there is a gradation of seriousness reflected by an increase in penalty as the quantity of drug involved moves into those levels which answer the descriptions of a commercial quantity, or of a large commercial quantity.""

Â 

49When considering an offence involving a large commercial quantity, it is to be remembered that there is no upper limit. There are a number of past cases (of manufacture, supply and importation) where the quantities of drugs involved (methylamphetamine, cocaine and MDMA/ecstasy) were enormous.

Â 

50As to the weapons charges, I am of the opinion that these offences fall well below the middle range of objective seriousness. As I have found, the weapons belonged to Lan and the offender's possession of them arose as result of her involvement with Lan and with the drug manufacture.

Â 

Aggravating features

51The Crown Prosecutor submitted that there are three aggravating features under s 21A(2) namely:

(i) The offence was committed without regard for public safety.

(ib) The offence involved a grave risk of death to another person or persons.

(o) The offence was committed for financial gain.

Â 

52I accept that each of those matters is relevant to a proper assessment of the objective criminality of the offender's conduct. However, I am not persuaded that the evidence in this case allows for a finding that any constitutes an aggravating feature for the purpose of s 21A(2). The fact is that most offences of manufacturing a large commercial quantity of drugs involve processes that are risky and dangerous and pose some threat to life. Many such clandestine laboratories are set up in similar suburban environments. Most illegal drug manufacturers show a complete disregard for public safety and most commit the offence for financial gain.

Â 

53I have taken into account the fact that the offender acted without regard for the public safety and for financial reward in assessing the seriousness of her objective criminality. I have already commented on the fact that Lan's death highlights the risks involved in such clandestine laboratories and have taken those risks into account in assessing the objective criminality. I have considered the evidence of Mr Spouszta (T 230-231) as to the lack of proper safety standards in such labs generally and in this operation in particular. As I have said, the risk to life in this case was real and tragic with one of the perpetrators suffering what was no doubt a slow and painful death.

Â 

Statistics and past cases

54I accept the Crown's submissions that ""the range of sentences indicated by other cases does not establish the bounds of permissible sentences"" but rather ""provides a yardstick against which to examine the proposed sentence"". I also accept Mr Pontello's submission that the JIRS statistical database provides too small a selection of cases to derive any meaningful guidance as to an appropriate sentence.

Â 

55Neither counsel has taken me to any authority which is comparable in terms of the circumstances of offending or personal attributes of the offender. The Crown referred to R v Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2 and R v Little and Walsh [2006] NSWCCA 406. Those cases assist in their consideration of relevant principles but they are all cases of extreme gravity when compared to the present case. They may be cases properly categorised at the very top end of criminality encompassed by the section. The sentencing outcomes, as I think the Crown concedes, have no bearing on a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion in this case.

Â 

56I have considered the outcomes in the following cases as a yardstick in determining whether the sentence that I have in mind accords with the requirements of consistency of punishment on the one hand and the necessity for individualised justice on the other: Eckersley v R [2013] NSWCCA 219; Lau v R [2010] NSWCCA 43; DW v R [2012] NSWCCA 66; DAB v R: NJB v R [2010] NSWCCA 275; Greenaway v R [2013] NSWCCA 270; Reardon v R [2012] NSWCCA 46. None of those cases are on all fours with the present case but they satisfy me that the sentence I propose is fair, just and consistent with sentences imposed in circumstances having some features in common with the present offence. I am conscious of the fact that some of those cases attracted greater sentences than the one that I consider to be appropriate, particular when one takes into account relevant discounts for the pleas of guilty. However, IL is to be sentenced on the basis of her particular and individual circumstances. It is particularly to be borne in mind the role that this offender played and the limited period of her involvement. In many of the cases to which I have referred, the offender was involved for many months and at a much higher level.

Â 

General sentencing principles

57I have taken into account the objectives of punishment set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). In particular, I have taken into account the need to adequately punish the offender, to denounce her conduct and to make her accountable for her involvement in the offences. I have considered the need to protect the community from such offences and the need to deter others from committing similar crimes. I have balanced the need to deter Ms IL from committing offences in the future against the desirability of imposing a sentence that fosters her ultimate rehabilitation so that she can return to be a useful member of our society as she was for the first forty or so years of her life.

Â 

58As has often been said, these various factors pull in different directions and, consequently, there is no single correct sentence.

Â 

Sentence 

59No sentence other than a substantial full time gaol sentence can be imposed in the circumstances. The parties agree that the offender has spent a period of 1 year and 7 days in custody and that the sentence should commence on 2 December 2013.

Â 

60As I have said, I propose to impose an aggregate sentence under s 53A and I have set out in general terms the method by which I would arrive at that sentence in terms of partial concurrence and accumulation. I have also indicated that I have found special circumstances for the purpose of s 44(2B). The proper approach to the application of s 53A has been considered in a number of cases: see, for example, R v RD [2014] NSWCCA 103 at [62]-[66] (Hamill J), SHR v R [2014] NSWCCA 94 (Fullerton J); R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 291 at [56]-[60] and Brown v R [2012] NSWCCA 199 at [17] and [51] (Grove J).

Â 

61For the purpose of that section I indicate that I would have imposed the following individual sentences:


	Count 1 - 10 years
	Count 3 - 12 months
	Count 4 - 6 months
	Count 5 - 9 months
	Count 6 - 9 months


Â 

62The aggregate sentence that I will impose is 11Â½ years. With the finding of special circumstances there will be a non-parole period of 7Â½ years.

Â 

63IL, for the five offences of which you have been convicted, you are sentenced to an aggregate non-parole period of 7Â½ years commencing on 2 December 2013 and expiring on 1 June 2021. There will be a balance of term of 4 years commencing on 2 June 2021 and expiring on 1 June 2025. You will be eligible for release on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.

Â 

64I order that the drugs and weapons involved in the five counts on the indictment be forfeited to the Crown for the purpose of destruction.

Â 

65As to the offences listed on a certificate pursuant to s 166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW):


	Sequence 3 (offender found on drug premises) is dismissed by consent.
	Sequence 4 (owner knowingly allow premises to be used as drug premises) is dismissed by consent.
	On the joint application of the parties, all remaining sequences (that is, sequences 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13 and 14) are remitted to the Local Court

2765553,Barnett v R [2014] NSWCCA 296,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  I agree with Fullerton J.
2FULLERTON J:  On 3 March 2014, a jury found the applicant guilty of two counts of dangerous driving occasioning death contrary to s 52A(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  That offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. 
3On 24 April 2014, the applicant was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 24 April 2014 to expire on 23 April 2017 with a non-parole period of 18 months to expire on 23 October 2015.  Sentences of 2 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year were indicated for each offence.  The applicant was also disqualified from holding a motor driver's licence for three years from 15 February 2012. 
4The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the aggregate sentences imposed.  There is no appeal against conviction. 
5The sole ground of appeal is that the sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant's conduct was not a case of momentary inattention. 
The proceedings at trial 
6Unless specifically noted, what follows is a summary of the facts that were not in dispute at trial or on sentence.
7The collision occurred on 15 February 2012 on the Hume Highway near Berrima.  The highway at the collision site was a double highway which consisted of two lanes oriented generally north-south with an incline to the south.  There is a gradual left-hand bend prior to the incline.  An additional left-hand lane, designated for heavy vehicles, commences at the start of the incline.
8The collision occurred between 12.30pm and 12.40pm.  The weather was clear and the road surface was dry. 
9The deceased Ms Fraser, was travelling south on the Hume Highway when her Ford TX5 (""the Ford"") experienced mechanical problems, causing it to stop.  Because the breakdown lane and a metal Armco rail restricted the extent to which she could park off the highway, the Ford was partially on the road shoulder and partially in the left lane.  She turned her hazard lights on and raised the bonnet.
10Ms Fraser contacted the NRMA for roadside assistance.  A tow truck driver, the deceased Mr Clark, was assigned to tow her car. 
11The Ford had been broken down at the collision site for over an hour prior to the collision.  Evidence was led at the trial from two witnesses, each of whom were travelling south (that is, towards the collision site).  Both gave evidence that they had seen Ms Fraser and her vehicle stationary and awaiting roadside assistance.  They said they had been able to take evasive action to avoid colliding with her vehicle by verging to the right on the approach.
12The Crown also led evidence that 178 vehicles would likely have passed the collision site whilst Ms Fraser awaited the attendance of the tow truck.  The inference the jury were invited to draw was that those drivers who had seen Ms Fraser's car (and Ms Fraser) had been able to safely avoid any collision.
13Mr Clark positioned his tow truck in front of the Ford and activated the hazard lights.  The Ford and the tow truck (collectively referred to as ""the hazard"") both encroached into the left lane by approximately 1 metre and 1.3 metres respectively.  Traffic was diverted to the middle and right lanes by the large flashing amber arrow on the back of the tow truck.  Mr Clark was wearing a high visibility vest at all material times. 
14Whilst Mr Clark was in the process of attaching the Ford to the tow truck, the applicant was driving in the left southbound lane (on the incline) in a 4.8 tonne table-top truck at a speed of 100 kilometres per hour.  The designated speed limit was 110 kilometres per hour.  There were no vehicles in either of the southbound lanes ahead of the applicant as he approached where Mr Clark was attending to the Ford.  Another truck driver was travelling behind the applicant's truck.  That driver gave evidence that he had clearly seen the deceased and their vehicles on the approach and with sufficient time to allow him to move safely to the centre lane.  He confirmed there were no vehicles between the applicant's truck and the victims' vehicles.  He also gave evidence that he did not see the applicant's truck brake or slow down prior to the collision, but saw it swerve suddenly and sharply to the right just prior to impact.  He witnessed the collision.
15The applicant swerved 7.6 metres before clipping the rear offside (the driver's side) of the Ford and then colliding with Ms Fraser and Mr Clark who were standing beside the two stationary vehicles in the breakdown lane.  Both Mr Clark and Ms Fraser sustained fatal injuries and died at the scene.  The applicant was treated by ambulance officers and taken to Bowral hospital.  He sustained no injuries.
16The applicant was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of collision.  The Crown did not allege that he was driving recklessly.
The trial
17The trial proceeded on a very limited basis.  The only element of the offences in contention was whether the Crown had proved that, at the time of the collision which caused the death of Mr Clark and Ms Fraser, the applicant's manner of driving was dangerous by reason of his failure to maintain a proper lookout.  
18It was the Crown case that whilst driving a heavy vehicle on an open highway the applicant had failed to maintain a proper lookout as he approached the collision site such that he did not see the hazard in sufficient time to avoid the collision. 
19Defence counsel submitted that it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the reasonable possibility that on approach to the collision site the applicant was momentarily distracted and that when his attention was redirected to the road ahead he did not have sufficient time to avoid colliding with Ms Fraser's vehicle.  The defence submitted that, in those circumstances, the jury would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of the impact which caused the death of the deceased, the applicant was driving in a dangerous manner.
20The trial judge directed the jury that the Crown would prove its case if they were satisfied there had been a serious breach of the applicant's proper management and control of his vehicle, and that the breach was so serious that it created a real danger, in the sense of posing a real risk to others in the vicinity.  They were also directed that where a lapse of attention by a driver creates a danger of that kind, it may constitute dangerous driving despite the driver's inattention being either casual or momentary.  The jury were further directed that whether the Crown proved that the applicant's manner of driving shortly before, and at the time of impact, was dangerous depended upon all the circumstances in which the driving occurred, including such factors as the time of day, the nature of the road surface, weather conditions and the general environment.  They were reminded that the use of a motor vehicle is always dangerous, simply because of the risk it poses to others, but that potential risk can be minimised by the driver exercising proper control and management of the vehicle. 
21By their verdicts, the jury must be taken to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the point of impact the applicant was driving in a manner that was dangerous, despite what was relied upon in his defence as constituting what the sentencing judge described in his sentencing remarks as ""proffered sources of distraction"". 
22These included:
(1)At the scene immediately after the collision the applicant said to a witness, ""I think I grabbed my drink bottle and there they were"";
(2)The applicant told an attending ambulance officer that he was driving, placed the bottle into the cup holder, looked up and I saw two people in front of him or in front of the truck and that he hit them; and
(3)Approximately a fortnight after the collision, through his solicitor, the applicant provided a signed statement, the effect of which was that, as he climbed the incline to the south, he checked both of his rear view mirrors and moved into the left-hand lane as an extra lane was available.  He said that, as he approached what he described as the ""first crest"", he checked his rear view mirrors again as the third lane was about to merge at the top of the crest.  He then said, ""After checking both mirrors I looked back and saw a woman on the road immediately in front of my truck in the middle of my lane.  I immediately pulled the vehicle hard to the right and heard a bang"".
(4)In his statement, the applicant also said that he checked his mirrors because he wanted to know the location of a truck that he had earlier passed and because he believed the left lane was about to end and he intended to merge out of the left lane.  The left lane ended 350 metres after the collision site.  It was common ground that the applicant's vehicle had only two mirrors, being the left-hand side and right-hand side mirrors. There was no centrally placed rear vision mirror.  (He made no mention of the drink bottle in his statement to police.)
23The applicant did not give evidence at trial or on sentence. 
24Photographs taken by a police officer of the applicant's truck showed several drink bottles in the footwell of the cabin of the truck but no drink bottle in the cup holder.  The police officer also gave evidence that there was a ""fridge type system"" in the cabin.
25The Crown called a forensic accident investigator.  He gave evidence as to the time available to avoid the collision (measured in seconds) from a point on the roadway where the hazard was first visible to a driver in the position of the applicant. 
26The expert gave evidence from which the following factual propositions can be derived:
(1)The hazard was potentially visible 300 metres before the point of impact (tree foliage obscured the hazard prior to that point);
(2)The hazard was clearly visible 250 metres before the point of impact;
(3)A vehicle travelling at 100 kilometres per hour has 10.8 seconds before reaching a point that is 300 metres distant;
(4)A driver travelling at 100 kilometres per hour has 9 seconds before reaching a point that is 250 metres distant;
(5)The applicant swerved 7.6 metres (or 0.27 seconds) before the point of impact;
(6)An ordinary driver would take evasive action 2.9 seconds after seeing the hazard (including the time taken to perceive, process and act upon the stimulus created by the hazard).
27The Crown expert was invited in cross-examination to factor into his assessment the various explanations the applicant had given to account for his failure to see the hazard in sufficient time to avoid the collision.  He gave the following evidence:
(1)It would take 1.5 to 2.5 seconds for a driver to either remove a drink from or replace a drink into a cup holder mounted in the way the holder was positioned in the applicant's truck; and 
(2)It would take 1.5 seconds for a driver of a heavy vehicle of the general kind the applicant was driving to check one rear vision mirror.
28In his sentencing remarks, his Honour noted that, on that analysis of the evidence, a driver who was keeping a proper lookout had 7.9 seconds (10.8 seconds less 2.9 seconds) available to observe a hazard ahead and to take evasive action and that, on the expert's estimation, the applicant's inattention spanned at least approximately 4 to 5 seconds (being 7.9 seconds minus 3 to 4 seconds). 
29There is nothing in his Honour's sentencing remarks to suggest that he did not give consideration to that evidence or that he rejected any of the sources of distraction the applicant proffered in the accounts he gave to the witness, police and ambulance officers as not being capable of explaining his lack of attention.  What was in dispute on sentence was what conclusions could be drawn from all the evidence led at trial concerning the extent or duration of the applicant's inattention, or the time during which he failed to keep a proper lookout, consistently with the verdicts of the jury.  
30It was submitted by counsel then appearing for the applicant that it was not inconsistent with the jury's verdicts for his Honour to sentence the applicant on the basis of a lapse of attention, or inattention, for a period of time which could properly be described as ""momentary"". 
31After detailing what his Honour regarded as the factual findings embedded in the jury's verdicts, he rejected that submission and made the following findings:
... I do not accept [the applicant's] failure to maintain a proper lookout at the critical time can be fairly described as ""mismanagement"" or ""momentary inattention on his part"".
...
I am satisfied the jury's verdicts indicate a finding that the offender failed to keep a proper lookout at the road ahead of him for a significant period of time in the circumstances of being a professional driver on a busy highway and where there existed a need to be continuously alert and where the risk toothers is considerable. This indicates a finding that his moral culpability went beyond a classification of ""moral [sic] inattention or misjudgement"".
32Although the sentencing judge made no finding that the sources of distraction proffered by the applicant were not legitimate (in the sense that a driver may look away from the road to attend to a drink bottle and is required to use the rear or side mirrors as part of the safe management of the motor vehicle), it is clear from the findings he did make that he was not satisfied that, either individually or in combination, they allowed for the applicant's driving at the point of impact to be characterised as involving ""momentary inattention"".  He also observed that, even were the jury to have accepted the sources of distraction proffered by counsel in argument as a reasonably possible explanation for the applicant's failure to maintain proper focus on the road ahead, their verdicts must be taken to have left them in no doubt that he was driving in a dangerous manner at the point of impact. 
33It is clear from the sentencing remarks that his Honour reasoned to the conclusion that the applicant was inattentive, and for a significant period of time, after considering all the evidence in the case.  He also found that what he described as the ""proffered sources of distraction"" did not adequately account for the time over which the applicant was inattentive or during which he failed to keep a proper lookout.  His Honour reasoned to that conclusion by allowing 10.8 seconds (as opposed to 9 seconds) for the applicant to travel the distance of 300 metres - being the distance from the collision site when the hazard was first visible to a driver in the position of the applicant - despite making the further finding that the hazard was at least clearly visible from 250 metres before the point of impact, narrowing the time taken to travel the intervening distance from 10.8 seconds to 9 seconds.  That was a finding clearly favourable to the applicant.  So much is clear.  After accounting for the passage of 2.9 seconds for evasive action to be taken, his Honour then calculated that the applicant was (theoretically) inattentive for 7.9 seconds.  That was an error in that 9 seconds less 2.9 seconds equates to finding of theoretic inattention for 6.1 seconds.  His Honour later accepted that he had made an arithmetic error when his attention was drawn to it by the Crown prosecutor.  When the arithmetic error was pointed out to him, he said that it did not alter his ultimate conclusion that the applicant was inattentive for a significant period of time. 
34On the appeal, senior counsel for the applicant submitted that it was not open to the sentencing judge to find that the applicant failed to keep a proper lookout for ""a significant period of time"" on approach to the collision site, and that the proper finding (in the sense of it being the only available factual finding on the evidence and the inferences legitimately drawn from the evidence) was that the applicant was inattentive for a much shorter period of time which, according to the calculus senior counsel suggested his Honour seemed to employ, was as little as 0.33 of a second - a time measure which could only be described as momentary.  That calculation was expressed as follows: from a starting figure of 9 seconds (time available to observe the hazard) less 5.5 seconds (compound distraction time) less 2.9 seconds (time taken for evasive action) less 0.27 seconds (the seconds before collision where the applicant swerved), with the calculated result being 0.33 seconds.  It was then submitted that the criminality inherent in that conduct was of such a low order that the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge were excessive and that this Court should substitute non-custodial sentences by way of re-sentence.
35The Crown submitted that it would be completely inconsistent with the verdicts of the jury for his Honour to sentence the applicant on the basis that his inattention was momentary (whether for as little as one third of a second or some other order of magnitude in the range) as this would be contrary to a finding of criminal liability for the dangerous driving causing death inherent in the jury's verdicts (R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374).  The Crown submitted that to mount a challenge to the sentence tethered to the submission that his inattention was momentary, measured in a fraction of a second, was to implicitly challenge the verdicts as unreasonable.
36The Crown further submitted that, on a proper reading of his Honour's sentencing remarks, he did not employ the mathematical calculus attributed to him by the applicant before arriving at his ultimate finding that the applicant was inattentive for a ""significant period of time"", or at least he did not confine himself to the narrow theoretical calculus attributed to him by the applicant on the appeal according to which the figure of 0.33 was arrived at and advanced to this Court in argument.  
37For the applicant to seek to attribute to the sentencing judge such an approach, and then to dissect it for error, ignores the approach his Honour actually took to the fact finding after trial, an approach which the Crown submitted was in strict conformity with sentencing principles.
38In the Crown's further submission, his Honour did not make any express finding that the applicant's account to police and ambulance officers ought be given any weight at all and, even if it be accepted that his Honour afforded it some weight, it displaced the overwhelming weight of evidence in the Crown case which rendered the applicant's failure to see the hazard as explicable only on the basis of a failure to keep a proper lookout over a considerable distance in advance of the collision site or, as his Honour expressed it, for ""a significant period of time"".    
39The Crown submitted that having heard all the evidence at trial, in particular the evidence of the expert as to the distance of 300 metres from the rear of Ms Fraser's vehicle where the overhanging foliage no longer interfered with the view of the hazard ahead to the collision site, the drive-through reconstruction of the collision, and having participated with the jury in a view, his Honour was in an optimum position to determine for himself, consistently with the jury's verdicts, the degree or extent of the applicant's inattention to the road ahead and to sentence him according to that finding so as to reflect the extent of his moral culpability for the deaths. 
The sentencing judge's factual errors
Error 1 - The time taken to travel 250 metres
40The first error was the arithmetic error already discussed.
41Immediately prior to the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, his Honour had the following exchanges with the Crown prosecutor :
HIS HONOUR: I note that withdrawal [of back-up charges] and they are dismissed. Any other matters?
COUNSEL: Your Honour, there's just one factual matter. In your Honour's indication of the findings your Honour was satisfied the jury accepted, your Honour indicated Mr George's potentially visibilty for 300 metres. Your Honour then went on to indicate that the vehicles were clearly from 250 metres. Your Honour then went on and indicated a distance of 250 metres with the 2.9 seconds and reached a figure of 7.9 seconds. I'm not sure if your Honour was actually indicating a distance of 300 metres which would leave the 7.9 seconds or if indeed your Honour was meaning 250 metres, which would mean a slightly less figure of 6.1 seconds.
HIS HONOUR:  Well if that is the case, I will amend it to 6.1 seconds, but it does not make any difference in relation to the findings I made.
42It was submitted by the applicant that by merely acknowledging that he had made a mistake, but not reflecting on the impact of the error on the finding he had made adverse to the applicant (namely, that he had been inattentive for a significant period of time) before dismissing it as having no impact, his Honour's arithmetic error was compounded.  In combination with three further factual errors, it was submitted, invoking House v The King principles ([1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499), that the sentencing discretion has miscarried.
43In my view, neither the making of what has been described as the arithmetic error, nor the realisation that it was made, leads inevitably to the conclusion contended for by the applicant.  The critical question is whether the mathematical analysis imputed to his Honour was wholly or substantially determinative in rejecting the submission that the applicant's inattention was only momentary. 
44I am satisfied that on a proper reading of the sentencing remarks and the consideration his Honour gave to all evidence led at trial, that his ultimate finding that the applicant was inattentive for a significant period of time was not so narrowly confined. 
45That being the case, it is unnecessary to consider the three errors said by the applicant to have caused the sentencing discretion to miscarry since they each proceed on the basis of a mathematical formula that his Honour did not apply.  However, in order to make clear my reasons for dismissing the applicant's appeal, I will first refer to each of the errors contended for, albeit briefly. 
Error 2- the time during which the applicant was ""legitimately distracted"" 
46The second error relates to what is said to be an error in calculating the time taken to travel from where the hazard was visible to the collision site, referable to what the evidence suggested was the average time it would take to put a drink bottle in a holder and to glance at a side mirror in a heavy vehicle before, presumably, returning attention to the roadway ahead.  
47Counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge erred in not finding that the applicant could have been distracted by up to 3 seconds by checking both side mirrors, and that the duration of the proffered distractions from both handling his drink bottle and checking the mirrors should have been estimated to be to 4.5 to 5.5 seconds and not the 3 to 4 seconds his Honour must be taken to have deducted from the time it took the applicant to travel to the collision site from the time when the hazard first became visible. 
48Foundational to this submission is the proposition that his Honour found that the combined duration of these sources of distraction in fact ranged from 3 to 4 seconds premised upon the applicant looking into one mirror as he was merging from the left lane into the middle lane and that his Honour then applied a formula in which the combined duration of the sources of distraction were subtracted from the 9 seconds taken to travel to the collision site. 
49As the Crown submitted, and correctly in my view, no such finding was ever made.  While his Honour referred to the expert evidence which addressed the ""proffered sources of distraction"", he made no finding that the applicant was in fact distracted by either handling his water bottle or glancing in the side or rear view mirrors, even if implicitly he allows for that as a reasonable possibility.  Even so, there is nothing in his Honour's sentencing remarks to support the proposition that he allowed a compound distraction time of 3 to 4 seconds (1.5 to 2.5 seconds for the applicant to deal with the drink bottle, and 1.5 seconds to check a side mirror) from which he estimated the applicant was inattentive on approach to the collision site for ""at least 4 to 5 seconds"" (7.9 seconds less 3 to 4 seconds).  The appointment of ""at least 4 to 5 seconds"" was only ever referred to in the context of his Honour's review of the expert evidence.  Although he did not refer back to that evidence after the arithmetic error was pointed out to him (something which I am not satisfied he was obliged to do in any event), it would only require an adjustment of 1.8 seconds in the available time within which the hazard would have been obvious (that is, from a base of 9 seconds and not 10.8 seconds).  Were that adjustment to be made, rather than the 4 or 5 seconds during which the expert estimated the applicant failed to keep a proper lookout, the estimate would be in the region of 2 or 3 seconds. 
50What needs to be emphasised is that it was neither the applicant's case at trial nor on sentence that he took his eyes off the road for a continuous span of seconds as he looked at the side mirrors and dealt with his water bottle.  That being the case, the point the Crown makes, and persuasively, is that the mathematical exercise attributed to his Honour on the appeal is an abstraction which has no relevant bearing on the issues to be decided for sentencing purposes.  The Crown submitted that to subtract a compound estimate of discrete intervals or periods of inattention in the way proposed by the applicant's senior counsel is to create an air of artificiality foreign to the fact-finding exercise his Honour engaged in and from which he drew his ultimate findings.
51To the extent that those findings need to be restated, the sentencing judge found that prior to dealing with his drink bottle and/or checking his mirror(s), or during the interval between those tasks, the applicant should have ensured that the road ahead was clear and that it was safe to glance or look down at the drink holder or glance or look into the side mirror.  His Honour also found that the applicant's failure to maintain a proper lookout resulted in a degree of inattention found by the jury to amount to driving in a manner dangerous, and which he was satisfied was not momentary.
Error 3- the hazards may not have been visible when the applicant dealt with his water bottle or checked his mirrors
52It was submitted that the sentencing judge erred in assuming that when the applicant determined to do something with his water bottle and/or check his side mirrors, he would, if he had been keeping a proper lookout, have seen the hazard ahead, because his Honour has assumed that the applicant chose to deal with his water bottle and check his mirrors as he approached the collision site, that is, at some point within the 250 metres from which the hazard was visible.
53The applicant submitted that it was equally open for his Honour to have proceeded on the assumption that the applicant began to place a drink bottle into the dash mounted drink holder at 251 metres from the point of impact and, if that assumption was made, then the impact of that source of distraction was not only much reduced, but it undermined the finding adverse to the applicant that he was under an obligation to check that the road ahead was clear before engaging in activities which deflected or distracted him from that focus.  
54The only source of evidence as to when the applicant dealt with his water bottle was in the applicant's explanation to the ambulance officers at the scene, where he said that after placing the bottle into the cup holder he looked up and saw the hazard by which time it was too late to take evasive action.  To submit that his Honour was obliged to proceed on some other basis without evidence to support it is to misunderstand both the function of the sentencing judge and the role of this court as a Court of review.  
Error 4- the failure to take into account the swerve mark created 0.27 seconds before impact
55Fourthly, counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge did not properly take into account the evidence of the tyre marks on the road which indicated that the applicant had swerved 0.27 seconds before impact. 
56In estimating that the period of inattention was ""at least 4 to 5 seconds"", it was submitted that his Honour did not consider the swerve marks that had been laid, on the expert's estimate, 0.27 seconds before impact.  On the calculus which the applicant's counsel imputed to his Honour (including the arithmetic mistake referred to above), he accounted for 9 seconds (time taken to cover 250 metres) minus 2.9 seconds (time required for evasive manoeuvres) minus 3-4 seconds (distraction time) but omitted the additional 0.27 seconds which counsel submitted should also have been deducted when determining the period of inattention.
57Quite apart from what I am satisfied was a misconceived challenge to the period of inattention being found by his Honour as substantial for the reasons already discussed, the reasoning relied upon in support of what is said to be the fourth error is erroneous in any event.  It conflates what the applicant should have done with what the applicant did.  The applicant cannot have the benefit of subtracting 2.9 seconds from a notional period of inattention to account for what the expert described as the reaction time, and then subtracting a further 0.27 seconds to account for the evasive action he took by swerving to the right before the point of impact.  The two figures are mutually exclusive. 
58The orders I propose are:1.Leave to appeal granted.2.Appeal dismissed.
59BELLEW J:  I agree with Fullerton J.

	HAMILL J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed by her Honour Judge Wells in the District Court sitting at Lismore on 1 November 2013. The applicant, who was 15 years of age at the time of the offence, was sentenced along with two other juvenile offenders (AA and PW) following their pleas of guilty to two offences, the most serious of which was a charge of armed robbery with wounding which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment: s 98 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). There is a standard non-parole period associated with this offence but that period does not apply to juvenile offenders. Each of the offenders also pleaded guilty to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm whilst in company (AOABH). AOABH in company carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment: s 59(2). That offence occurred during the course of the commission of the armed robbery offence.
	
	
	In addition to the offences to which he pleaded guilty, the applicant also asked that an offence relating to the use of a stolen motor car be taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The car was used to drive to the scene of the robbery.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced as follows:
	



	
	AOABH - fixed term of 12 months commencing 25 February 2013 and expiring 24 February 2014.
	
	
	Armed robbery - non-parole period of two years commencing 25 May 2013 and expiring 24 May 2015 with a balance of term of two years expiring 25 May 2017.
	



	
	The sentences were largely concurrent but there was an accumulation to the extent of 3 months. Thus, the total effective sentence imposed on the applicant was 4 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of two years and three months. The applicant is eligible for release to parole on 24 May 2015.
	
	
	The co-offender AA was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years with a non-parole period of 12 months and a wholly concurrent period of 9 months for the assault offence.
	
	
	The co-offender EW was sentenced to 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months for the robbery offence and a wholly concurrent period of 9 months for the assault offence.
	
	
	There is no ground of appeal asserting that the disparity in the sentences gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. Apart from significant differences in the subjective cases, to which it will be necessary to make some reference in the course of this judgment, the facts showed that the applicant was the instigator of the offence.
	
	
	The applicant's notice of appeal raised two grounds and a third ground was added on the hearing of the appeal. The grounds as amended are as follows:
	



	
	""Her Honour failed to address the applicant's ""moral culpability"" in relation to the offending behaviour, particularly in the light of the applicant's intellectual impairment and ADHD.
	
	
	Her Honour failed to take into account the applicants intellectual impairment and ADHD in relation to the issues of;
	



	
	general and personal deterrence; and
	
	
	that the applicant's time in detention will be of greater hardship than those without such impairments.
	



	
	Her Honour erred in inferring that it was DA who ""bent down and punched"" Mrs Wilson ""to the face with a right closed fist on at least three occasions in quick succession"" (ROS at 3.9), it, in effect being agreed between the parties (pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) that Mr Wilson, who observed the incident, ""was unable to specify which of the offenders did this"" (see Agreed Statement of Facts - part of Exhibit 1 on sentence at page 3.3).""
	



	
	There was an agreed statement of facts. Her Honour recounted the facts in her judgment:
	


""The facts in the matter are before the Court by way of an agreed facts document pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act (1995). Shortly before 2.50pm on 24 February 2013 the young persons travelled in a vehicle that was stolen the morning before to the store. DA was the driver of the vehicle, EW was seated in the front passenger seat, AA and two other young people, KH and DM were seated in the rear of the car. When they arrived at Wyangeree General Store, DA turned to the others and said something to the effect of, ""Oh boys do you want to do a robbery."" Either he or one of the others repeated that and they all agreed to participate. Four of them entered the store whilst Mr and Mrs Wilson were present. They walked around looking for items. Mrs Wilson asked them if they were all right and they said that they were fine. They left the store and went a short distance away and to all appearances were having a discussion about committing the offence. That discussion was held between four of them with DM apparently still sitting in the vehicle. DA again instigated or promoted the commission of the offence and there was then agreement between them to carry it out. He then said, ""A,"" referring to AA, ""You and K run in first."" AA agreed to do this.

Mr Wilson in the meantime from inside the shop could see them outside. He saw their hand gestures. He saw one pull the hood of his jacket over his head and became unsurprisingly apprehensive. They entered the shop the second time at 3 o'clock, some ten minutes after their arrival. DM stayed in the car. AA went in first, approached Mr Wilson who was standing near the front door and punched him in the face with closed fist on a number of occasions. He sustained a one centimeter wound to his chin that later required stitches. AA later said that he kicked Mr Wilson. At about that time, KH, another co-offender who is not currently before this Court, picked up a broomstick with a metal hook on the end that was used to pull the shop front door down. He approached Mr Wilson at about the time that AA was engaged in punching Mr Wilson. He began to swing the stick in a forceful manner on a number of occasions. He struck Mr Wilson to the left side of the head and his back with that broomstick. Mr Wilson tried to protect himself by putting his left arm up but was struck on the left arm.

At about the same time, DA who had entered the store ran towards Mrs Wilson. She saw her husband being assaulted and went to assist. DA punched her, knocking her to the ground. She says that she was struck so hard she saw white. DA turned to Mr Wilson and joined in the assault on him before returning to Mrs Wilson. While she was unconscious lying on the ground, one of the offenders inferentially, DA, bent down and punched her to the face with a right, closed fist on at least three occasions in quick succession. At the same time, Mr. Wilson was distracted by one of the offenders threatening him with a knife. Mrs Wilson was still lying on the ground, DA approached her, bent down to her face and demanded the cash. She lapsed into unconsciousness again.

As this attack was being made upon Mr Wilson, EW had entered the store. He and AA made demands for the money and the cigarettes. One of them demanded the fifties and said if they were not told where they were, he would stab them. This person was holding a small knife in his hand. As a result, Mr Wilson told them there was money in the safe. One of them went to the safe and found a blue metal money box that did contain Australian notes but that was left behind. Again they demanded cigarettes or the ""smokes"" and they were told by Mr Wilson that they were in a cupboard. Property was then removed from the store. While that was happening AA was behind the counter searching that area for items to steal. He picked up a small broom handle and again made a threat while holding that handle to hit anyone who moved. They were all involved in searching for property. Whilst the property was being removed, DM the fifth person entered the store. He was partially disguised. He too left with a quantity of property. All of them were involved in taking stolen property to the car. In the end they took about 100 packets of cigarettes worth over $2,000, forty-two bottles of alcohol worth over $1,500 and something over $1,300 worth of cash and coins. They walked out according to closed-circuit television at about 3.06pm and left in the stolen car.

Witnesses alerted the police and went to assist the Wilsons. A patrolling police vehicle came upon them at Bonalbo. The police car activated lights and sirens. As the stolen vehicle attempted to negotiate past the police vehicle, it collided with a nearby tree. The five offenders left the vehicle and ran into the bush.

The Wilsons meanwhile were taken to hospital where they were treated. Mr Wilson had a wound to his chin as has been noted, soreness to the rear of his head and back, a cut to his forearm and left lower leg and a bruised and swollen middle finger on his left hand. Mrs Wilson who had been knocked unconscious had a sore back, left side of head and jaw and bruising and swelling to her right knee and ankle. Although there is no victim impact statement before this Court, it would be expected that the emotional damage done to Mr and Mrs Wilson would be lasting and perhaps of greater impact than their physical injuries.

Most of the robbery was, captured on the Closed-circuit television. It shows DA holding what appears to be a sharp implement in his outstretched right hand. AA told police he thought there was a butter knife in the car but didn't know if anyone had grabbed it. Scissors were found inside the shop near where the alcohol was kept that did not belong there. AA's prints were found in the stolen vehicle. EW's fingerprints were found in the store on the vegetable fridge glass lid and on a white plastic tub in the boot of the stolen car. DA's prints were found in the store on a cigarette packet protector and on the window of the stolen vehicle. The other two co-offenders prints or DNA were also found.

The following day 25 February both DA and EW were arrested by police, both declined to be interviewed. On 26 February AA was arrested, he took part in an electronically recorded interview where he made detailed and frank admissions in relation to the involvement of himself and the others in the offence. The interview that was held with police closely matches that of the agreed facts and the still pictures that are part of the agreed facts and the still pictures that are part of the exhibits before this court.""


	
	The sentencing Judge described the applicant's personal case as follows:
	


""DA was at the time of the offence fifteen. (DOB [content removed]). He has a criminal history that shows that he has committed some serious offences and has been subject to a previous control order. He, like all of the other young offenders, is an Aboriginal person. DA was diagnosed with ADHD when he was seven to eight years of age and with a mild intellectual disability at aged five. His behaviour according to the Juvenile Justice report of 16 September 2013 was described as erratic, impulsive and violent at school. He was suspended for hitting other children and described as defiant, aggressive and difficult at home and suffered variable, unpredictable moods. He was non-compliant with supervision, difficult to supervise because he chose to avoid appointments and was reclassified because of violent behaviour. It is said that he reacts poorly to any teasing. He is currently a client of the Serious Young Offenders Review Panel. The report reiterates that he has a diagnosis of a mild intellectual disability with hyperactivity. He suffers emotional distress, feelings of significant grief and loss, a history of an alleged sexual assault and poor interaction skills.""

Grounds 1 and 2


	
	In advancing these grounds the applicant placed great reliance on the contents of two Juvenile Justice reports dated 12 September 2013 and 29 October 2013. The applicant submits that whilst the sentencing Judge made some brief reference to the material in those reports, her Honour did not give effect to relevant sentencing principles concerned with young offenders and particularly young offenders who suffer from some intellectual disability. It is regrettable that the sentencing Judge was not provided with more direct and cogent evidence in relation to the matters which are subject to this appeal. There was no direct evidence from a suitably qualified expert.
	
	
	The report of 12 September 2013 indicated that his carer informed the Juvenile Justice officer that DA was going well in primary school until he began to have behavioural issues at 7 or 8 years of age. He was then diagnosed with ""ADHD"". He completed his first year of high school but his behaviour deteriorated and he was placed in special classes. The report indicated that he obtained ""little schooling"" when he was in the community. At 14 years of age he was in custody in juvenile centres and did some form of distance education. The report noted that since being in custody for the present offences he had been attending the year 10 programme. However, his attendance was described as sporadic and he had been involved in ""incidents"" that prevented him from attending. It was said that he had ""good periods"" but also ""some not so good times"". The report said:
	


""In previous reports it was documented that [DA] was diagnosed with ADHD when he was years 7-8 years of age. [DA] was previously linked into a number of services to assist his need. He was referred to the SWITCH program and the disability service in May 2012 via Juvenile Justice however due to a lack of engagement and detainments to custody he was not to benefit wholly from the resources of the service providers.""


	
	The report noted that DA had been a client of the Juvenile Justice Service since October 2012 and had been subject to bonds, probation orders and parole orders. He was described as ""non-compliant with supervision"" and ""extremely difficult to supervise often [avoiding] appointments"". The report concluded that supervision upon release was necessary although DA had requested that he not be subject to supervision.
	
	
	The report of 29 October 2013 said that DA had an ""intellectual disability significant enough to be eligible for direct case management"". The disability was described as a ""mild intellectual disability and ADHD"". It noted a ""history of defiance and physically aggressive behaviour towards his peers"".
	
	
	The second report also said:
	


""Dr Jackie Andrews in her report from 25 October 2013, confirms the diagnosis of mild intellectual impairment and ADHD. She also states that DA did not have regular review appointments and as a consequence he ran out of his medication. Dr Andrews states clearly in her report that DA was not medicated at the time of the offence. She adds, that ADHD makes DA more impulsive, i.e. he does not stop and think before acting. She is also canvassing a possibility of court mandating for DA to take his medication. Dr Andrews states that DA requires an increased level of supervision from his peers, as he functions at a level that is considerably lower than his biological age. Furthermore she states that he is unable to make decisions at an age appropriate level. It can be surmised that DA is vulnerable to being guided by negative peers.


	
	The report also noted that DA had some difficulties since being remanded in custody on 26 February 2013. He had been reclassified twice because of his violent behaviour and ""can react violently when being teased and baited by fellow detainees"" a reaction which ""could be precipitated by his limited understanding and ability to express himself because of his intellectual disability"".
	
	
	These were matters of real significance although, as I have said, the sentencing Judge was not assisted by the direct evidence of Dr Andrews or from any other qualified expert.
	
	
	The applicant relies on well-established and important principles concerning the sentencing of young offenders. He relies on the following passage from Slade v The Queen [2005] NZCA 19 at [43]:
	


""It is widely accepted that adolescents do not possess either the same developmental level of cognitive or psychological maturity as adults (Steinberg & Scott, 2003). Adolescents have difficulty regulating their moods, impulses and behaviours (Spear, 2001). Immediate and concrete rewards, along with the reward of peer approval, weigh more heavily in their decisions and hence they are less likely than adults to think through the consequences of their actions. Adolescents' decision-making capacities are immature and their autonomy constrained. Their ability to make good decisions is mitigated by stressful, unstructured settings and the influence of others. They are more vulnerable than adults to the influence of coercive circumstances such as provocation, duress and threat and are more likely to make riskier decisions when in groups. Adolescents' desire for peer approval, and fear of rejection, affects their choices even without clear coercion (Moffitt, 1993). Also, because adolescents are more impulsive than adults, it may take less of a threat to provoke an aggressive response from an adolescent.""


	
	This passage was cited with approval by Kirby J in R v Elliot and ton [2006] NSWCCA 305; 164 A Crim R 208 at [127].
	
	
	Apart from the applicant's youth, principles relating to the sentencing of offenders suffering from intellectual disabilities and neurological or mental health issues were also engaged. It is well established that an offender's intellectual capacity may impact upon a sentencing exercise in a variety of ways, not all of which are dependent upon a causal link being established between the condition and the offending. In R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 Spigelman CJ said at [21]-[26]:
	


""The significance of mental illness of an offender in the sentencing exercised has long been accepted. The relevant authorities have been reviewed in this Court, the Victorian Court of Appeal and the Western Australian Full Court. See R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40]-[48] per Simpson J; R v Harb [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35]-[45] per Smart AJ; see also R v Lauritsen (2000) 114 A Crim R 333, esp [43]-[51] per Malcolm CJ; R v Tsiaras [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; see also Potas, Sentencing Manual: Law Principles and Practice in New South Wales 2001 at 285-286; Fox and Freiberg, Sentencing State and Federal Law in Victoria (2nd ed), 1999 at 293-294.

In the present case, the Crown was prepared to concede that some mitigation was appropriate, on the basis of giving less weight to the issue of general deterrence. However, that is not the only way in which mental illness impinges on the exercise of the sentencing discretion.

To the extent that mental illness explains the offence - as her Honour found to be the position in the present case - then an offender's inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law. As Wood CJ at CL put it in Henry, supra, at [254]:

'... the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing.'

I agree with the observations of Malcolm CJ in Lauritsen at [48]:

'... mental illness is not only relevant to assessing culpability, in which case it must be shown to have contributed to the offence, but it is also relevant to assessing the level of danger the offender presents and the appropriate way in which the offender is to be rehabilitated. The mental illness should be taken into account in sentencing whether or not it played a part in the commission of the offence, but not with the consequence of the imposition of a sentence which exceeds the seriousness of the offence.'

Furthermore, mental illness may also lead to the conclusion in a particular case that the element of personal deterrence, not just general deterrence, is also entitled to less weight in the sentencing exercise than it may otherwise have because, as the Victorian Court of Appeal put it:

'... specific deterrence may be more difficult to achieve and is often not worth pursuing as such.' (Tsiaras, supra, at 400)

Finally, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person and that may be a material consideration in determining the length of the sentence to be served. (See Tsiaras, supra, at 400). However in Lauritsen at [51], Malcolm CJ noted that this factor, identified by the Victorian Court of Appeal in Tsiaras, may not represent the law in Western Australia. It is unnecessary to determine whether this is the law in New South Wales. It appears to have been regarded as material in this Court in R v Jiminez [1999] NSWCCA 7 at [25]. I see no reason why this would not be so, but the matter was not fully argued.""


	
	The complaint in ground one concerning the failure to take into account the applicant's intellectual impairment and ADHD in determining the offender's moral culpability is difficult to sustain when there was no evidence - at least no direct evidence - that the applicant's conduct was causally related to the conditions referred to in the Juvenile Justice report. Counsel for the applicant relies on inferences to be drawn from the substance of those reports and the applicant's behaviour.
	
	
	A further difficulty for this argument lies in the fact that the facts of the offence suggested that the applicant was not led astray by his peers. Rather the evidence suggested that he was the instigator of the offence. Further, the sentencing Judge found that the offence (at least from the point of view of the applicant) was premeditated to a certain degree. It was not an impulsive act. In this regard the sentencing Judge made the following findings:
	


""In relation to premeditation, it is only DA who could be regarded as a person who had considered what he wanted to do over a period of time before arriving at the shop as he was the driver of the car. He drove the other boys there. He was the one in the car outside the store who suggested the offence be committed. He continued to promote the idea of committing a robbery and gave the initial directions before anyone really entered the store on the second occasion.""


	
	The learned sentencing Judge made specific reference to relevant principles concerning the sentencing of juvenile offenders. She said:
	


""As they are young offenders the principles relating to the exercise and functions under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) s 6 apply and I have regard to that. I also have regard to the general sentencing principles found in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) s 3A and particularly note that greater weight should be placed on the individual's rehabilitation in formulating the appropriate sentence and less weight should be directed towards the principle of general deterrence.""


	
	The sentencing Judge in the present case took a more lenient approach to the sentencing of the co-offenders AA and EW. This was no doubt because there was more material placed before her to support a number of positive findings. In each case there were psychological reports providing direct evidence of their psychological functioning. AA was assessed as being in the ""borderline range of intellectual function"" with his IQ being above only 5% of his peers. The psychologist also noted features of attention deficit disorder. In summary, it was said that:
	


""the combination of AA's intellectual development disorder, limited verbal expressive skills, peer pressure and the effects of cannabis on decision making are considered to be causal factors in his involvement in the incident.""


	
	The psychological report for EW referred to his early involvement in drugs resulting in ""a degree of developmental lag where there is a delay in emotional and moral development"".
	
	
	The applicant is correct that the sentencing Judge made no reference to the fact that the Juvenile Justice report indicated that the applicant was operating at a ""level that is considerably lower than his biological age"". Nor did her Honour make any reference to the question of whether this may have impacted on his impulsivity on the day of the offence or meant that he was influenced by peer pressure to involve himself in the offence. Such matters may, as the applicant correctly submits, have influenced an assessment of the applicant's moral culpability. However, as I have said, the Judge made factual findings which proved such a contention difficult to sustain. These were that DA was the only one of the offenders who had acted with some form of premeditation and also that he was the instigator of the offence.
	
	
	Her Honour specifically referred to the diagnoses of ADHD and mild intellectual disability. Against that, for present purposes, were her findings as to his role and premeditation and the evidence of his aggressive and violent behaviour and non-compliance with supervision. While I accept that it may have been preferable for Judge Wells to engage clearly with the principles to which the applicant has referred, I do not accept that her Honour failed to address the applicant's moral culpability or that, in doing so, she did not take into account the evidence of his intellectual impairment and ADHD. Accordingly, ground 1 must be rejected.
	
	
	As to ground 2, the evidence that incarceration would be more onerous as a result of his intellectual disability and ADHD was not particularly strong. The second juvenile justice contained the following:
	


""DA can react violently when being teased and baited by fellow detainees. This could be precipitated by his limited understanding and ability to express himself because of his intellectual disability. Mr Holmes, psychologist, in his report referred to distorted negative interpretations of benign actions of others, which translates to high risk behaviours in group settings.""


	
	The report of Mr Holmes was not before the court and so the ""high risk behaviours"" to which reference was made was unexplained. Apart from the above passage, there was little, if any, evidence that the applicant was a person whose intellectual disability would make his time in custody more onerous. Her Honour made passing reference to the fact that the applicant did not respond well to being teased which suggests that she had read and considered this part of the report.
	
	
	Again, I am unable to accept that the sentencing Judge failed to take this evidence into account in relation to the issues of deterrence and whether the applicant's time in custody would be more onerous. Accordingly, ground 2 must also be rejected.
	


Ground 3


	
	The third ground of appeal concerns an inference that her Honour drew from the agreed facts. It was added at the hearing of the appeal and brief submissions were directed to it.
	
	
	The relevant part of the agreed facts were as follows:
	


""DA approached Mrs Wilson and punched her knocking her to the ground. DA struck her so hard that Mrs Wilson stated, 'I just saw white'. DA then turned towards Mr Wilson and joined into the assault on Mr Wilson before returning to where Mrs Wilson lay. At this stage, Mrs Wilson was unconscious. As she lay on the ground unconscious Mr Wilson observed one of the offenders bend down and punch Mrs Wilson to the face with a closed fist on a least three occasions in quick succession. He was unable to specify which of the offenders did this as he was distracted at this time by one of the other offenders threatening him with a knife.

While Mrs Wilson was still lying on the ground, DA the approached her, bent down with his face up against hers and said 'Where's the cash, where's the cash.' Mrs Wilson again lapsed into unconsciousness"".


	
	In recounting the facts, Judge Wells said:
	


""At about the same time, DA who had entered the store ran towards Mrs Wilson. She saw her husband being assaulted and went to assist. DA punched her, knocking her to the ground. She says that she was struck so hard she saw white. DA turned to Mr Wilson and joined in the assault on him before returning to Mrs Wilson. While she was unconscious lying on the ground, one of the offenders inferentially, DA, bent down and punched her to the face with a right, closed fist on at least three occasions in quick succession. At the same time, Mr. Wilson was distracted by one of the offenders threatening him with a knife. Mrs Wilson was still lying on the ground, DA approached her, bent down to her face and demanded the cash. She lapsed into unconsciousness again.""

[My emphasis]


	
	The applicant submits that the facts were agreed under s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) and that no submission was made by the prosecutor that DA was the person who hit Mrs Wilson three times. It is submitted that it was an error to draw this inference in those circumstances.
	
	
	The agreed fact that Mr Wilson was unable to identify the person who hit his wife three times was not a matter that prevented the Judge from drawing inferences from the fact that it was DA who had knocked her unconscious before that incident, that DA returned to where she lay after joining the assault of Mr Wilson and that it was DA who had asked her where the money was after that incident.
	
	
	Further, it is far from clear precisely what her Honour meant by saying ""inferentially DA"". It is true that later in the judgment she referred to the fact that ""DA showed considerable actual violence, particularly towards Mrs Wilson"". However, that was true on any view of the facts. On the evidence available, it was open to the sentencing Judge to infer that it was DA who was responsible for that action.
	
	
	While it has been submitted that the sentencing judge should have raised the matter with counsel and made plain the basis of her finding and whether it was being taken into account as an aggravating circumstance, this was a case where the young offenders were acting in concert and where the applicant was both the instigator and the only one of the young offenders to act with premeditation. The extent to which their precise roles within the premises would have impacted on the appropriate sentence is very doubtful. I would also reject ground three.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	The sentence imposed on the applicant was a severe one for a person of his age. The grounds that have been taken on his behalf are matters of substance. Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal. However, none of the grounds have been upheld and the appeal must be dismissed.
	
	
	Accordingly, the orders I propose are:
	



	
	Application for leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

		16 January 2015",2014-12-11 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2765555,R v JH [2014] NSWSC 1878,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	The offender, whose name has been suppressed from publication by order made under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, was charged on indictment that he did murder the victim, Eden Delir. He pleaded not guilty to that charge.
	
	
	The trial initially before 12Â jurors, subsequently reduced to 11, commenced on 25Â August 2014.
	
	
	On 13Â October 2014 the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.
	
	
	At the hearing on sentence on 28Â November 2014, Ms JÂ Hickleton of counsel, who had represented the offender at trial, again appeared on his behalf.
	
	
	The evidence on the sentencing hearing comprised documentary material as identified in the Schedule to these remarks.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the offender was a party to a joint criminal enterprise. The juryâs verdict of manslaughter was based upon unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter, namely assault of the deceased in circumstances of reasonable contemplation of an additional offence being committed, namely, unlawful and dangerous act.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon written submissions on sentence dated 27Â November 2014, supplemented by oral submissions on 28Â November 2014. In addition, the Crown relied upon its written submissions dated 3Â December 2014.
	
	
	Ms Hickleton of counsel relied upon her oral submissions on sentence made on 28Â November 2014, supplemented by written submissions dated 9Â December 2014.
	


Factual Circumstances


	
	On 30Â October 2010, Eden Delir was invited and attended a Halloween party at Bossley Park. He was then 17Â years of age. The party commenced at or soon after 5:00pm. At the time of the offence there were a large number of young people present, many of whom had been invited on Facebook and a number of persons attended who had not been invited.
	
	
	The offender attended uninvited in company with a number of associates who were also uninvited. They were described in evidence as being of Middle Eastern appearance. They entered through the front door of the premises and shortly thereafter proceeded to the rear yard of the premises where a number of young people were present. There was evidence that the group, or at least a number of the group, who were known as the âWakeley Boysâ. They had attended by reason of the fact that they had anticipated that a number of other youths known as the âCampbelltown Boysâ would be attending. After entering the rear yard of the premises some of the offenderâs group confronted particular partygoers asking whether they were âa Campbelltown boyâ and otherwise in loud and aggressive tones calling out âwhere are the Campbelltown Boys?â.
	
	
	The evidence at trial indicated that they had attended the party with the view to confronting the Campbelltown Boys. In the event, the Campbelltown Boys did not attend the party. The Crown at trial contended that the offender and his associates arrived at the party with a violent intent, though not then directed towards Eden Delir. The evidence varied as to whether one, or more than one, of the Wakeley boys was armed with a steel pole. There was evidence from the witness JD that she saw the offender arrive with the group, at which time he was yelling âLetâs go and have some fun boysâ: TÂ 587.
	
	
	A little later in the evening, the offender and his associates moved to the front of the premises and gathered out on the nature strip. There were a number of other partygoers in that general locality and in the front yard of the house. Eden Delir was one of those at the front of the house. At some point he was identified by one or more of the males who were standing in company with the offender as the person who it was thought had reported the offender to police over an incident that had occurred in February 2010.
	
	
	There was evidence that at one point there appeared to be an argument amongst the group. One witness, to whom I shall refer to as MH, said the offender was among the group at that time: TÂ 1274. A little later one of them called out to Eden Delir. Two witnesses gave evidence that the person called out âEdenâ and then they walked towards each other. The witness ED said he heard one of the group say to Eden Delir: âyouâre that guy that snitchedâ or something like that: TÂ 989. There was evidence that indicated that the co-offender MG made that statement.
	
	
	The witness JZ gave evidence that after he heard a male call out âEdenâ and Eden Delir approached the person facing him he grabbed Edenâs hat and held it in his hand and said âwhatâs this?â: TÂ 909. He described the situation at this point as âhostileâ: TÂ 940.
	
	
	A second male then came from behind a parked truck and struck the deceased to the right side of his face with such immense force that it knocked him to the ground.
	
	
	Other witnesses gave evidence that a number of the young males described as of Middle Eastern appearance surrounded Eden Delir. Though the estimates varied, there were probably at least six males surrounding him and they commenced to assault Eden Delir whilst he was on the ground. Some witnesses said that they saw Eden being âstompedâ kicked and punched with considerable force: TÂ 356. Whilst the group attack proceeded, one of the young males, the co-offender JP, who had been holding a bottle, wielded it and smashed it on Eden Delirâs head. There was evidence that the bottle struck him as he was getting to his feet after having been stomped, kicked and punched: TÂ 923. During this process he was trying to defend himself by raising his hands to try and block the attack: TÂ 449. There was evidence that the attackers formed a circle around Eden and that âmost of themâ were involved in delivering blows: TÂ 822.
	
	
	One witness said that one of the attackers chased after Eden when he broke free of the group: TÂ 929.
	
	
	Another witness saw one of the attackers in a âhoodieâ run after Eden with a pole in his hand. He said that that man pulled his hoodie up and struck Eden in the back of his head with the pole, twice.
	
	
	Though by then seriously injured, Eden somehow managed to run up Restwell Road and escape his attackers.
	
	
	There was evidence in the trial of an incident that occurred in February 2010 which involved both the offender and Eden Delir. They had known each other after having attended the same school. In February 2010, the offender rang Eden and asked him to meet up outside Edenâs home. The evidence establishes that the offender, in asking Eden to meet him, was setting him up for an attack. Within a short time of the meeting a number of persons wearing disguises set upon Eden assaulting him and taking his mobile phone. The offender ran from the scene just before the attack commenced. In that incident Eden Delir suffered injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment.
	
	
	Eden Delir subsequently was interviewed by police over the assault and robbery and he provided a statement to the police. This is the so-called âsnitchingâ to which reference was made by one of the attackers just before the bashing on 30Â October 2010 that resulted in brain damage being inflicted on Eden Delir.
	


The Medical Evidence


	
	Dr Stephen Wills, forensic pathologist, gave evidence and he performed a post-mortem examination of the deceased on 9Â November 2010. He stated that examination revealed that the deceased had sustained a considerable number of injuries including, in particular, injuries to his head. The nature of the injuries evident on post-mortem reflected a multiplicity of assaults upon Eden Delir. They included multiple wounds and bruising to areas of the face, a laceration to the upper right frontal scalp, an incised wound on the superior right parietal scalp caused by a sharp object to the top of his head, an area of abrasion and bruising on the interior occipital scalp (that is, at the back of the head) and multiple abrasions and wounds, bruising of areas in the left upper limb including a sharp injury associated with bruising to the left hand apparently caused by contact with a sharp object. That wound, Dr Wills stated, potentially was sustained when Eden Delir tried to fend off an attack with a sharp object.
	
	
	Multiple bruises were also located on the deceasedâs right arm, bruising was noted on areas of the lower limbs. Dr Wills accepted that these could have been caused by kicks or direct blows.
	
	
	Dr Wills said that the overall pattern position and nature of the injuries were indicative of an assault involving several points of blunt impact to the head, the face and additional sharp force injury: TÂ 1367.
	
	
	Dr Wills said that the deceased had been conveyed to Liverpool Hospital where a CT scan showed an acute left-sided subdural haematoma. The haematoma was surgically evacuated and he was returned to the Intensive Care Unit. Dr Wills explained that the haematoma caused pressure within the skull to rise with secondary effects upon the brain, in particular, starving it of blood and oxygen. The increase in pressure compromised blood flow into the skull and caused damage to the brain due to starvation of blood.
	


The Trial


	
	Whilst the offender did not give evidence at the trial the defence case relied upon the evidence of a covertly recorded conversation between MK and the offender on 5Â November 2011. A transcript of that conversation was admitted into evidence and became ExhibitÂ W in the proceedings.
	
	
	In the recorded conversation the offender told MK that he was not present during the attack. He said he had received a call from a Marven Georgis who, he claimed, had asked him to come and pick him up. He told MK that as he drove off ââ¦ all the boys started running to the carâ: ExhibitÂ W at pÂ 5. He said that âthe boysâ included a co-offender, MG, and another person, âLittle Alanâ, another member of the group of males involved in the attack.
	
	
	The Crown, in its submissions on sentence, stated that the juryâs verdict ââ¦ involved the wholesale rejection of the defence caseâ to the effect that the offender was not present during the attack: Crownâs Written Submissions, 27Â November 2014 at [8].
	
	
	MK was called in the Crown case. Her evidence was to the effect that she set up the interview with the offender with the intention of secretly recording it on her mobile phone determined to ascertain who had been involved in the attack upon Eden Delir, he having died earlier that day.
	
	
	The offenderâs statement to her âI was not there when it happened and I didnât tell anyone to go hit himâ (ExhibitÂ W, pÂ 29) was subsequently undermined, indeed contradicted, by his own statements which revealed that he in fact was present, that he spoke to MG on the question of Eden being âhitâ after which he proceeded to relate and then describe in detail the sequence of events that took place. At the time of the conversation with MK, it is clear that the offender had heard that Eden had died earlier that day. By the time he spoke to MK, he knew that the attack had assumed the seriousness of a homicide. His protestations in the conversation with MK, of not being present, not being involved, were plainly lies designed to distance himself from any involvement.
	
	
	The truth of his involvement as I have stated emerged later in the recorded conversation. The transcript of the recording reveals that MK continued to press him to reveal what he knew. His responses to her, as I have stated, included an account of what was said before the attack. The transcript of the conversation includes the following:
	


OFFENDER:Â Â Â âMilad saw him, âoh isnât that that guy that snitched on youse?â

Â Â Â Â Â Â â¦

OFFENDER:Â Â Â âAnd I was like âyeah, yeah, yeah, thatâs the guy, thatâs the guyâ and then Little Alan heâs like, ânah, nah we wonât hit him nowâ â¦â

OFFENDER:Â Â Â âAnyways, and then Little Alan was like ânah, nah, nah we wonât hit him now weâll wait till the party ends before we go home, so we can have funâ.â

OFFENDER:Â Â Â âLike alright no worries â¦â (ExhibitÂ W at pÂ 5).


	
	The offender then is heard in the recorded conversation giving a detailed description of the events involved in the attack. His description of what happened is plainly a firsthand account of what he heard others say, what he said, and his description of the events, including persons who joined into the attack and what they did: ExhibitÂ W, ppÂ 5-8.
	
	
	The statements made by the offender in the recorded conversation as to what was said by him and others just prior to the attack on Eden Delir, supports the following conclusions:
	


(1)Â Â Â That contrary to the defence case, the offender was present both before and during the attack on Eden Delir.

(2)Â Â Â That he engaged in discussions with his associates before any attack commenced on the subject of attacking Eden Delir.

(3)Â Â Â As a party to those discussions, the offender was a participant in the decision-making on the proposal to attack Eden Delir and the timing of the attack.

(4)Â Â Â The particular matter mentioned in what I will call the pre-attack discussions was that Eden Delir was the person who had âsnitchedâ on the offender about the February 2010 robbery and assault on Eden Delir.

(5)Â Â Â Immediately after Eden Delir was identified as the person the offender believed had given information to police about his involvement in the February 2010 attack, there were discussions between the offender and his associates. It is clear from the evidence that the discussions related to a plan of attack implemented within a very short time. The co-ordination of the roles played in the attack by the participants becomes apparent from the evidence as to the way that the events unfolded.

(6)Â Â Â The surprise nature of what was a planned ambush of Eden Delir caught him off guard. It placed him at a complete disadvantage in terms of defending himself, he being completely outnumbered, and quickly rendered vulnerable to what became a ferocious attack by a group of attackers against one then defenceless victim.


	
	The fact of co-ordination and planning involved is evident from the sequence of events â one group member, possibly JP, called Eden over, the distracted him by taking his hat/cap; another then came running around the truck and delivered the forceful blow to the right side of the deceasedâs head so severe as to knock him to the ground, then the attackers, having encircled him, proceeded to inflict injuries by kicking, punching and stomping on him.
	
	
	While these attacks were occurring, one of the attackers, accepted as being JP, smashed an empty bottle over Eden Delirâs head whilst Eden was getting to his feet, causing him to fall to the ground again.
	
	
	The Crown in its opening address to the jury outlined the basis of the offenderâs alleged liability. It was particularised as conduct amounting to encouragement and assistance. The Crown conceded that the jury may be unable to find that the offender struck a blow or blows himself in the violence. The Crown in its written submissions, 27Â November 2014, observed:
	


âThe Crown placed a common basis against all six, namely accessorial liability, and that was done in circumstances where a jury may have been left in doubt as to which individual was directly responsible for causing death. The pathology reduced the mechanism of death to the high probability of it being the bottle blow to the head, a single blow.â (At [14])


	
	The Crown did not allege in relation to the offence of murder charged in the indictment that the offender acted with an intention to kill, but rather had an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. Further, the Crown case did not depend upon a finding that the offender himself inflicted blows upon Eden Delir.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submission was that the evidence established that the offender was the person who set Eden up to be robbed and assaulted in February 2010. Further, the Crown submitted that the offender believed that after the incident Eden Delir had âsnitchedâ on him by reporting it to police and that this had motivated him to âorchestrateâ the planned attack on Eden Delir on 30Â October 2010. This joint attack, the Crown argued, was to his benefit in the sense that it would, at least in his mind, either deter Eden Delir from giving evidence in any proceedings against him, or alternatively, it would serve to punish Eden Delir for having done so.
	
	
	A lawfully intercepted telephone conversation involving the offender on 14Â November 2010, establishes that the offender believed that Eden had told police that he and others had been involved in the February incident and also believe that he made another statement to police about the matter subsequently: ExhibitÂ BB, transcript of the intercepted call 14Â November 2010 at pÂ 3.
	
	
	The Crown case at trial was that it was within the offenderâs contemplation that there was an appreciable risk that serious injury would be inflicted on Eden Delir from the âplanned attackâ involving the force of numbers against a defenceless 17-year old male. These facts, taken in conjunction with the offenderâs motivation, it was submitted, established a âhigh level of moral culpabilityâ in the offender. In the Crownâs submission these facts drove his liability upon sentencing for the crime of manslaughter âto a position precariously close to murderâ: Crown Submissions, 3Â December 2014 at [6].
	
	
	Taking all these matters into account, the Crown contended the consequence was that the sentence to be imposed would be one that exceeded the sentence imposed on the co-offender JP: Crown Written Submission, 3Â December 2014 at [6]. The offenderâs moral culpability, the Crown submitted:
	


ââ¦ exceeded by any responsible measure that of any other co-offender (including [JP]) in the joint venture.â (Written Submissions at [7])


	
	The Crown contended that the defence case comprised the following propositions:
	



	
	That the offender was not at the scene at the time the violent attack upon Eden Delir took place;
	
	
	That he did not know that an attack on Eden Delir was to take place;
	
	
	That his version of the attack as covertly recorded on 5Â November 2010, and the part played by those who participated in the attack, had been derived by him from accounts given to him by participants in the attack and not from his own direct knowledge through being present.
	



	
	The Crown submission was, however, that the defence case had been completely rejected by the jury. This was said to be particularly evident by reason of trial directions given to the jury that they were required to determine whether the offender was in fact present during the attack. Having regard to the juryâs verdict, the Crown submitted, it is evident that the jury found that he was present and that he was in a relevant and material sense participating in the attack by reason of his willingness to encourage or assist his co-offenders.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that his statement in the recorded conversation on 5Â November 2010 to the effect that he was not present, he having supposedly left the party to drive and pick up a friend, was plainly rejected by the jury. The Crown submitted that the evidence, including the evidence as to the offenderâs actions in relation to the attack on Eden Delir in February 2010, and the offenderâs belief that Eden Delir had âsnitchedâ to police, was evidence of his motive or intention to have his co-offenders inflict physical violence upon him. The Crown noted that the only person in the attacking group who knew Eden Delir, was the offender.
	
	
	The juryâs rejection of the offenderâs statement that he was not present during the attack, the Crown observed, did not then mean that he was to be convicted of murder. Whilst the jury were not satisfied to the requisite degree or standard that he had the necessary state of mind for the offence of murder, namely, an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm (or that it was in his contemplation that one of the group would do so), the Crown noted that this was a case in which it could not prove that he was physically active in the sense of him inflicting a blow or blows on Eden Delir. However, notwithstanding the Crown noted that the jury were satisfied that the Crownâs case on manslaughter had been proven beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The Crown emphasised that whilst in his opening address it was conceded that the jury may not be able to find that the offender struck a blow or blows himself (without conceding that this did not occur), the Crown case against him âparticularisedâ as conduct amounting to encouragement or assistance, was established to the requisite standard.
	
	
	The Crown identified the factors relevant in any comparative consideration of the relative culpability of the offender to his co-offenders as follows:
	



	
	That he had previously âset-upâ Eden Delir for the attack by unidentified persons in February 2010;
	
	
	That of all the participants involved in the joint attack upon Eden Delir at the Halloween party, only the offender had known Eden Delir before 30Â October 2010.
	
	
	That prior to 30Â October 2010 he alone had a belief or a state of mind following the attack in February 2010 that Eden Delir had gone to the police and âsnitchedâ on him;
	
	
	That he alone had a motive to attack Eden Delir on 30Â October 2010. This was his motive, it was submitted, for orchestrating the joint attack at the party.
	



	
	The Crown made submissions on the likely basis upon which the verdict of JP (manslaughter) and in the joint trial of MG, SB and AE (verdicts of murder) should be understood. In the trial of JP, the Crown stated that there was no necessary connection between JPâs use of the bottle as a weapon and proof of the requisite intention for murder. The bottle broke once and there was no evidence of other strikes by JP with the bottle.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that whilst the verdicts against JP and the offender may be attributable to a deficiency in evidence necessary to sustain a conviction for the offence of murder, the Crown case against MG, SB and AE âdelivered a less complicated and divergent series of factorsâ: Crown Submissions, 27Â November 2014 at [24].
	
	
	The Crown contended that inconsistency of verdicts did not arise. Reference was made to the test propounded in MacKenzie v R (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 367 in the joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and KirbyÂ JJ. I note that their Honours in that case at pÂ 366 in relation to apparent inconsistency as between verdicts affecting a co-accused or persons tried separately in relation to connected events noted that an apparent inconsistency, may, in some circumstances, be no more than what has been referred to as âdifferences in the evidence presented at two trialsâ or âthe different views which the juries separately take of the witnessesâ: see in that respect, R v Andrews Weatherfoil Limited (1971) 56 Crim App R 31 at 40.
	


Submissions for the Offender


	
	Ms Hickleton of counsel on behalf of the offender disputed the Crownâs contention that the evidence established a motive in the offender for an attack upon Eden Delir on the basis that he had reported the robbery and assault in February 2010 to police. In support, a number of matters were relied upon. These included that fact that there was evidence that the offender had disclosed to Eden Delir his involvement in setting him up by others to assault and rob him in February 2010, that he had apologised to Eden Delir for his role, that Eden Delir had accepted the same and as at May 2010, had communicated with the offender by Facebook. Additionally, a period of some eight months had elapsed between the February incident and 30Â October 2010.
	
	
	The submission was that the events that happened at the party on 30Â October 2010 were spontaneous and they were not pre-planned. They were not, it was contended, part of some âharboured dislike of Eden Delir at allâ: TÂ 17:30-35. Whether there was motive in others by reason of Eden Delir having âsnitchedâ this it was submitted did not apply to the offender as there was no evidence that he physically attacked Eden Delir. Further, the only evidence relied upon to support the fact that the offender had a motive by reason of Eden having snitched is the recorded conversation. It was submitted that there was no other evidence at all from any other witness on that matter.
	
	
	Reliance was placed upon evidence that the co-accused, MG, knew the witness Chin and that Chin had been charged with offences arising out of the February 2010 assault and robbery of Eden. The co-accused MG and the person referred to as âLittle Alanâ were said to be the only persons with a motive or a desire to hit Eden by reason of him having snitched: TÂ 19:15-25.
	
	
	Ms Hickleton submitted that the offenderâs statement in the recorded conversation to the effect âit wasnât supposed to be like thatâ indicated that the events simply got out of hand, that they spiralled out of control in a manner that the offender was not in control of: TÂ 19:15-25.
	
	
	Ms Hickleton referred to the account given by the offender in that conversation when he made a statement that his co-offender MG said to him âisnât that the guy that snitched on youse?â. The offender stated that he responded âYeah, yeah, yeah, thatâs the guy, thatâs the guy â¦â. In that sense Ms Hickleton stated he was ââ¦ the catalyst for it by identifying Eden but it was them, [MG] and Little Alan and perhaps others who then went on to formulate their own planâ: TÂ 20:35-36.
	
	
	It was submitted that in the recorded conversation of 5Â November 2010 he did not indicate that he was necessarily agreeing with a plan or proposal to wait for a while before Eden would be âhitâ and it is not necessarily to be taken as him having agreed with such a plan or accepting that it was going to happen: TÂ 21:14-20.
	
	
	It was further submitted that whilst the offender may have acquiesced in the statement of Little Alan to wait before hitting Eden, it did not mean that the offender intended to participate in the activity himself. Further, there was no evidence that he himself was involved in the attack at all: TÂ 22:25-35.
	
	
	The further submission was:
	


âThen if he was involved in the enterprise the question is what was his actual involvement in the assault upon Eden Delir and if he was in the immediate vicinity then he did not choose to enter the affray himself and there was certainly opportunity for him to do it if he was thereâ: TÂ 22:40-45.


	
	It was submitted that there was nothing in the evidence that established that, whilst the offender may have acquiesced in what the others intended to do that he was a person that came up with the plan: TÂ 23:20-30.
	
	
	Accordingly, the Crownâs submission that he was involved in the planning of what was described as a co-ordinated attack was disputed. It was submitted for the offender that he was not involved in the planning at all, or took any âphysical partâ in it: TÂ 24:5-12.
	
	
	Accordingly, so far as the offender was concerned, the submission may be summarised in the following terms:
	


(1)Â Â Â That the offender was not present at the time or during the attack.

(2)Â Â Â That if he was present he took no part in it either in the planning or in the physical assaults.

(3)Â Â Â If there was co-ordination with allocation of roles to members of the attacking group, he did not partake in any role.

(4)Â Â Â The evidence did not establish that any planned attack involved the offender as a participant in it. Alternatively, if he had been given a role then he did not go ahead with it: TÂ 25:1-6.


	
	In terms of comparative culpability the submission for the offender was that JP who hit the deceased over the head with a bottle when Eden Delir was on the ground, had a greater culpability than the offender who, it was contended, was ââ¦ simply standing at the side and not entering [the] affrayâ: TÂ 28:30-36.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the offender whilst, on the juryâs verdict, having been found to have been present and âpotentiallyâ required to enter the affray, nonetheless he did not do so. Furthermore it was argued that he did not have a weapon and finally there had been no suggestion, in the submission for the offender, that he was involved in the pre-planning including the use of weapons: TÂ 28:40-50.
	
	
	Accordingly, the submission was:
	


ââ¦ his role in the actual assault [was] he was merely present and perhaps ready and willing to give encouragement. I accept what the jury found. But the actual role in the assault is very different from those who physically carried out the attack. And one has to accept that if he was there he had the opportunity to enter the affray and he chose not to.â TÂ 29:15-25.


	
	It was further submitted that when, after the attack, the offender later returned to the party he, as he told Juvenile Justice, did not think that Eden had been seriously hurt. This I find to be a surprising statement given the number and nature of the assaults and the smashing of the bottle over the deceasedâs head. I do not accept that anyone witnessing what was clearly a ferocious attack with objects used as weapons, could have concluded otherwise than that Eden Delir had been seriously injured.
	


Consideration

Findings


	
	The evidence establishes to the requisite standard:
	


(1)Â Â Â That he was present with a group of young males out the front of the premises when one of that group, probably MG, noticed Eden Delir was present.

(2)Â Â Â That the offender participated in discussions and a plan whereby members of the group then present would assault Eden Delir.

(3)Â Â Â That the reason for the decision to assault Eden Delir was the fact that the offender believed he had âsnitchedâ on him (that is, reported the offenderâs involvement in the February 2010 offences (the assault and robbery offences) to police.


	
	I do not, however, accept the Crownâs submission that the evidence is sufficient to establish to the requisite standard that the offenderâs motive was to deter Eden Delir from giving evidence against him in relation to the events occurring in February 2010. I, however, accept the submission that the offender and the members of the attacking group held a strong belief that Eden Delir had âsnitchedâ something he and they considered to have been unacceptable conduct deserving of physical punishment. The evidence establishes to the requisite standard that this is what motivated the offender and the associates to attack Eden Delir.
	
	
	Whilst I do not consider that the evidence establishes that the offender âorchestrated the attackâ as the Crown submitted (in the sense that he was the sole instigator of it), I have, as I have indicated, concluded that he and others jointly decided upon launching the group attack upon Eden Delir and encouraged others to do so. That finding plainly establishes a high level of moral responsibility in the offender.
	


Sentencing Considerations


	
	The maximum penalty for the offence of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25Â years. There is no prescribed standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The offender is to be sentenced on the basis of an unlawful and dangerous act that caused the death of the deceased.
	
	
	In assessing the objective seriousness of the offence of manslaughter by way of unlawful and dangerous act, it has been said that there is no hierarchy of seriousness between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. Spigelman CJ said as much in Regina v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184 at [29]:
	


âEven a case where there is present an intention to kill or maim, which would constitute murder but which is reduced, by reason of provocation or diminished responsibility, to a charge of manslaughter, will not necessarily attract a higher sentence than other forms of manslaughter, including the relevant one here, ie, killing by an unlawful and dangerous act. As a five judge bench of this Court, including Gleeson CJ, Mason P, Hunt CJ at CL, Simpson and Hidden JJ, said in R v Issacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 381:

âThe argument for the appellant advanced on this appeal appeared to assume that a case of provocation manslaughter is necessarily, or at least ordinarily, worse than a case of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. We do not accept that. Each case depends upon its own circumstances. The range of sentencing available in the case of manslaughter is notoriously wide. There have been cases where provocation manslaughter has resulted in non-custodial sentences.ââ


	
	In determining the sentence in the present case, I am required to consider the objective and subjective factors relevant to the offence and the aggravating and mitigating factors in accordance with the provisions of sÂ 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and relevant sentencing principles. I am, in particular, required by law to take account of a number of matters in determining the objective gravity of the offence committed by the offender and relevant subjective factors. The sentence to be imposed is one that is appropriate to the particular crime, having regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively: Regina v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354.
	
	
	Without setting out the provisions of sÂ 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I bear in mind that those provisions seek to identify the relevant objective and subjective factors that establish the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the offence.
	


Objective Seriousness of the Offence


	
	The principles that apply to the findings of fact following a verdict at trial are well-established: R v Isaacs (1997) NSWLR 374, 377-8; The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 and Cheung v The Queen (2001) 209 CLR 1. The primary constraint upon the power and duty to make findings is that the view of the facts adopted by the judge for the purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury and arrived at beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	As the remarks and findings I have earlier made indicate, this was not a case merely involving a spontaneous act. The objective seriousness of the offence in this case is much greater than those all-too-frequent cases where someone is punched to the head and falls to the ground and dies as a result of injuries sustained. The objective seriousness of this manslaughter cannot, in my assessment, be characterised as anything other than extremely grave.
	
	
	The evidence establishes that the offence of manslaughter in this case involved an unlawful attack involving a number of serious matters. These included the following:
	


(i)Â Â Â That the act causing death occurred in circumstances in which a group of young males including the offender (approximately six in number), identified the deceased who was known to the offender and a decision was then made to physically attack him as a group.

(ii)Â Â Â The attack had not been preceded on the day in question by any dispute or confrontation involving the deceased. He as an invited guest at the party was simply a participant enjoying a social occasion.

(iii)Â Â Â The member of the group who called Eden over clearly did so for the purpose of setting him up for a group attack.

(iv)Â Â Â The evidence as to the attack reflects a degree of co-ordinated activity amongst at least some members of the group â in the respects that I have earlier stated.

(v)Â Â Â Eden Delir was subjected to a multiplicity of assaults including to his head causing brain damage that caused his death.

(vii)Â Â Â The assaults comprised punching, kicking and stomping before and after the deceased was struck with the bottle. The ferocity of the attacks was of a high order.


	
	The fact that Eden Delir was outnumbered approximately six to one, that the attack was without any warning, that it was unprovoked and that a number of attackers continued to kick, punch and stomp upon an increasingly injured young man followed by the smashing of the bottle over his head, underlines the brutality and complete callousness of the attack that subsequently brought about the death of a young person approaching the threshold of young adult life.
	
	
	This was not, in other words, a case merely involving a spontaneous act. The objective seriousness of the offence in this case is, as I have stated, much greater than those all-too-frequent cases where someone is punched to the head and falls to the ground and dies as a result of injuries sustained. The objective seriousness of this manslaughter cannot, in my assessment, be characterised as anything other than extremely grave. The actions of the offender, and his companion attackers evidence a serious element of calculated criminal conduct.
	
	
	The evidence in this trial as to the existence in certain sectors of the community of a culture or code of silence designed to protect lawbreakers is a matter of great concern. It is one that has no place in our society.
	
	
	Any culture in which an associate of an offender, or even a victim of a criminal offence is put in fear that revenge or retribution may be expected if information concerning an offence is given to police cannot be permitted. Tragically, this is such a case. Eden Delir having been interviewed by police about the assault and robbery committed against him in February 2010, he having been set-up by the offender, on the evidence and findings to which I have referred, was later targeted by the offender and his co-offenders at the Halloween party on 30Â October 2010 for having provided information to police.
	
	
	The ferocious attack upon Eden Delir was the product of the perverted culture to which I have referred. As events have turned out it rebounded badly upon the offender and his associates with convictions in three separate trials of five offenders and one pleading guilty to manslaughter. I have made reference to these matters by reason of their connection with the commission of the subject offence and possible relevance to deterrence, a matter I will separately address.
	


Subjective Factors

1. Remorse


	
	It was submitted for the offender that statements made by him in the recorded conversation display remorse. These were:  I swear to God Mary â¦ like why would I want someone to die for Mary â¦â (ExhibitÂ W at p5)â and later âMary, I swear to God, Iâm so sorry.â (ExhibitÂ W at pÂ 8) It was submitted that this reflected remorse and regret for the death of Eden Delir.
	
	
	An examination of the context in which those statements were made does not, in my opinion, evidence genuine remorse by the offender. In the recorded conversation the offender displayed an attempt to minimise his involvement and he was not focussed upon the death of Eden Delir.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the offender has shown no remorse.
	
	
	As I have earlier discussed the Juvenile Justice Background Report states that the offender has displayed an attitude of minimising or justifying his actions and has not accepted responsibility for his participation in the attack on Eden Delir.
	
	
	In her report of 8Â December 2014, Ms Elana Jones, Forensic Psychologist, wrote:
	


â4.3Â Â Â â¦ Despite a verbal concurrence that he felt remorse, there was little indication of such â¦â


	
	An examination of the evidence, in my opinion, leads to the conclusion that the offender has not shown any genuine remorse or contrition.
	


2. Bail Conditions


	
	On the issue of restrictive conditions of bail it was submitted that as the offender was required to live at home with his parents, and for the first one and a half years was not allowed to leave the home without being in the presence of one or other of his parents, or an adult approved by one or other of his parents, this meant that his liberty was significantly curtailed.
	
	
	In the period on bail he was not allowed to have a mobile phone and accordingly his ability to communicate with people was severely limited unless somebody utilised the phone for him.
	
	
	It was submitted that allowance should be made in sentencing for the restrictive bail conditions and that as he has matured and exhibited signs of somebody with a strong work ethic, he will become a productive member of society.
	
	
	The bail undertaking given by the offender on 16Â May 2011 was tendered in evidence and was marked as ExhibitÂ 5.
	
	
	On 22Â September 2011 the bail condit6ions were varied as follows:
	



	
	The bail undertaking remains the same, except that conditionÂ 3 of that bail undertaking is now to read ânot to leave home/be in a public place unless in the company of parent, or an adult approved of in writing by a parentâ.â
	



	
	In determining whether any credit should be given in sentencing the offender for reasons of the conditions of bail to which he was subjected to on and after 16Â June 2011, the following matters are to be brought into account:
	


(i)Â Â Â The length and term of an offenderâs period of bail awaiting trial is a matter relevant to the determination of the proper sentence to be imposed.

(ii)Â Â Â The bail conditions as considered either individually or collectively in determining if the offender has been the subject of onerous or stringent constraint.

(iii)Â Â Â In particular, whether or not the bail conditions imposed any really serious restriction on the offenderâs liberty.


	
	In accordance with accepted sentencing principles it is open to a sentencing judge to take into account onerous conditions of bail in assessing sentence, but he or she is not obliged to do so: R v Webb [2004] NSWCCA 330; 149 A Crim R 167 at [19] per GroveÂ J, Simpson and ShawÂ JJ agreeing.
	
	
	In R v Fowler [2003] NSWCCA 321, the Court (TobiasÂ JA, James and HowieÂ JJ) observed:
	


â242Â Â Â We accept that in an appropriate case the length and terms of an offenderâs period on bail awaiting trial or sentence is a matter relevant to the determination of the proper sentence to be imposed. What weight is to be given to such a matter will vary from case to case, depending upon what other factors need to be considered and what sentence is required in the particular case to address the purpose of punishment. Where that purpose is the protection of the community and the conditions of bail are particularly onerous, such as where the offender has been required to reside at a rehabilitation establishment, very significant weight might be placed upon such a factor where it is appropriate having regard to the nature of the offence. However, in other cases, less weight may be given to such consideration, particularly where the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment is required for the purposes of denouncing the crime and reflecting the general deterrence.â


	
	In that case, the Court determined that there had been an obvious and significant disruption to the appellantâs life and restrictions upon his liberty over a lengthy period of time as a result of the offence committed. However, it was held that the sentencing judge was not required to reduce the sentence because of such considerations: at [243].
	
	
	See also R v Dennis (NSWCCA, 14Â December 1992, unreported); R v Khamas (1999) 108 A Crim R 499 at [27].
	
	
	Although the conditions of bail in this case, in particular conditionÂ 3, curtailed the offenderâs liberty by the requirement for him to be in the company of a specified adult person, and the period he was on bail has been lengthy, I do not consider that those conditions, individually or collectively, have been so onerous as to require credit to be given on the sentence to be imposed.
	
	
	The offender during the period of bail has been able to maintain his pursuit of his working life and social life including maintaining his personal relationship with his girlfriend, who Ms Jones, Forensic Psychologist, noted he had met a year ago through mutual friends.
	
	
	Other factors that may be taken into account in determining whether credit should be allowed include the nature of the offence committed by the offender and the need for general deterrence. In a case such as this those factors are, in my assessment, particularly important. The gravity of the offence, the need for an appropriate and adequate sentence to be imposed and general deterrence are all factors to be given considerable weight.
	
	
	I accordingly, as indicated, determine that there should be no credit allowance in sentencing the offender for the period spent on bail.
	


Rehabilitation Prospects


	
	Ms Hickleton submitted that, on balance, the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and that he was unlikely to offend again. He has family support and prior to bail conditions imposed he had not mixed with his co-offenders nor since.
	
	
	It was submitted that this reflected a desire to distance himself from their behaviour.
	
	
	The Juvenile Justice Report does not express an opinion that would support a confident prediction as to the offenderâs rehabilitation prospects. Much, no doubt, will turn upon whether the offender benefits from the therapeutic interventions which the authors of the Report address.
	
	
	A similar position rises from Ms Jonesâ report of 8Â December 2014. Ms Jones, as earlier noted, indicated that his VRS estimate of his risk of violent re-offending is low range. The recommendation made for him to obtain his YearÂ 10 Certificate and participation in therapeutic programs would appear to be factors that would increase his prospects of employment and education in the community and minimise his chance of re-offending.
	
	
	On the evidence as it presently is, the offenderâs prospects of rehabilitation, I assess, with some caution, to be moderate.
	


Personal Factors


	
	At the time of the offence, the offender had left school and he was then 15Â years and 9Â months, and had obtained a job working at concreting.
	
	
	Reference was made to the testimonial provided by his employer, David Buhagiar, who was so impressed with the offender that he recruited him to come back and work in his new business. He spoke highly of his honesty and loyalty and hard work and sense of responsibility.
	
	
	In addition to working in the concreting field he worked in his fatherâs pizza parlour to help out. Accordingly, it was said his work ethic was high.
	
	
	In terms of his personal life it was submitted that he had a girlfriend who had and remains particularly supportive. This, his desire to work and his desire to be with family with whom he is close, the fact that he has a supportive family and that maturity has taken place in the years that have intervened since the offence, all indicate, it was submitted, that the offender is very unlikely to re-offend at all.
	
	
	By reason of the fact that he was 15Â years at the time of the offence and had not long left school he was a young offender and that is to be taken into account in determining sentence.
	
	
	It was submitted that in relation to the offence itself, there was no indication that he wished to see Eden Delir die, or indeed seriously hurt, although it was conceded that the jury must have found that should have been within his reasonable contemplation. However, it was submitted that did not mean that he wished for that to occur.
	
	
	It was submitted that emphasis should be placed on the offenderâs ongoing rehabilitation and the fact that he will re-enter society with every prospect of being a hardworking contributing member of society and unlikely to re-offend.
	
	
	In addition to being a young offender, it was noted that he had no prior offences.
	
	
	It was submitted that, on balance, the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely, as earlier noted, to offend again.
	
	
	I have also had the benefit of other testimonials taken on the sentence hearing which I have read and taken into account.
	
	
	The Bail Undertaking contains a date on the Certificate of the Authorised Officer of 16Â June 2011. There are six conditions specified. They include conditionÂ 3 in the following terms:
	


âNot to leave home/be in a public place unless in company of parent.â

Sentencing Juvenile Offenders


	
	In sentencing an offender I am required to take into account the objective seriousness of the offence, the subjective circumstances of the offender and the special sentencing considerations applicable to young offenders.
	
	
	Because of his age as at the date of the offence, 15Â years, the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 are, for sentencing purposes, applicable.
	
	
	SectionÂ 6 of that Act sets out âprinciplesâ to which I am required to have regard. In particular, the youth of an offender is a relevant factor in the sentencing consideration, to be given the appropriate weight, together with all other relevant factors. The above principles in their application will, of course, depend upon the nature of the offence charged as well as the age and the conduct of the offender: R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182; R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58.
	
	
	In R v Pham & Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 LeeÂ J (with whom GleesonÂ CJ and HuntÂ J (as his Honour then was) agreed) stated in the context of offenders respectively aged 17 and 19:
	


âIt is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal courtâs function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes.â


	
	The principles that apply in the sentencing of young offenders were set out by the Court of Criminal Appeal in KT v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 51 by McClellanÂ CJ at CL at [22]-[25].
	
	
	Although accepted to be of less significance than when sentencing adults, considerations of general deterrence and retribution cannot be completely ignored when sentencing young offenders. It has been noted that there remains a strong public interest in deterring antisocial conduct.
	
	
	In KT v Rgina, supra, it was stated that the emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders, may be moderated when a young person has conducted him or herself in a way an adult might conduct him or herself, and has committed a crime of violence of considerable gravity. In determining whether a young offender has engaged in âadult behaviourâ the court will look to various matters including the use of weapons, planning or premeditation, the existence of an extensive criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the offence. Where some or all of these factors are present the need for rehabilitation of the offender may be diminished by the need to protect society. In the present case, as I have noted on the findings I have earlier made, there was the use by the offenderâs co-offendersâ of objects as weapons, there was some premeditation, prior to the attack. The circumstances of the offence to which I have referred are to be taken into account. In addition to his age, the fact that the offender does not have a criminal history is another matter of importance in the consideration of the sentence to be imposed.
	
	
	In JT v R [2011] NSWCCA 128 HoebenÂ J (as his Honour then was) was not persuaded in that case involving an offender who was 16Â years and 7Â months at the time of the offence, that it was the sort of offence which indicated impulsivity and immaturity on the part of the applicant so that the need for rehabilitation should be given paramount consideration. Rather, his Honour said, it was the very sort of offence that was referred to in KT at [24] and [25].
	
	
	The weight of authority is that the seriousness of an offence is relevant to the emphasis that can be given to the youth of an offender. It has been observed, however, that that does not mean that youth is not an important consideration; but retribution and deterrence cannot, in a case as serious as the present case, give way entirely or even substantially to the interests of rehabilitation: JM v R [2012] NSWCCA 83 per SimpsonÂ J at [108] (dissenting but not on this point).
	
	
	In a case such as the present, as I have already indicated, where there was a use of extreme violence occasioning death and occurring in the circumstances to which I have referred, general deterrence and retribution cannot be ignored and must be taken into account.
	
	
	128 The factors to which I have referred in the sentencing of juvenile offenders, often pull in different directions. That is particularly marked in this case. The offender was in his mid&#8209;teens and he has no criminal history. Allowance must also be made for his immaturity. He has rehabilitation prospects although as I have indicated it is difficult on the evidence to be confident as to how strong those prospects are. Much will depend upon his capacity to free himself from peer groups with so-called normalised views on violence and the success of intervention strategies that provide insight about his use of violence and management of aggression and anti-social behaviours as noted in the Juvenile Justice Report and the report of the Forensic Psychologist, Ms Jones.
	
	
	The extreme level of violence associated with the subject offence in unprovoked circumstances, on a highly vulnerable victim, mark the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced, as an extremely grave one and one that cannot be categorised as the crime of a child.
	
	
	In determining sentence I have considered a number of sentencing decisions which I do not here reproduce. I attach to these remarks a list of the decisions to which I refer.
	
	
	Given the various circumstances of each case they do not, of course, establish any particular pattern of sentencing.
	
	
	By reason of the particular matters associated with the objective gravity of the offence, the sentence I propose to impose is a substantial one.
	


Special Circumstances


	
	I have considered the question as to whether there is a basis for a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of sÂ 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 so as to vary the statutory relationship between the non-parole period, and the head sentence. In that respect I have considered the personal and the subjective matters to which I have earlier referred.
	
	
	I have determined that the offenderâs age, and the absence of a history of previous juvenile offending, provide a basis for a finding of special circumstances for the purpose of the above provisions.
	
	
	However, although I have made such a finding it does not, in my assessment, permit a reduction of the non-parole period to a level that does not adequately reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and the culpability of the offender after regard is had to all relevant circumstances: Maglis v R [2010] NSWCCA 247; R v West [2011] NSWCCA 91.
	
	
	Accordingly, for those reasons on the special circumstances finding I have made I intend to provide a very limited adjustment only to the statutory ratio, that is, the ratio of the non-parole period to the total term.
	


Victim Impact Statement


	
	Victim Impact Statements prepared by the parents and the sister of Eden Delir were received by the Court. The statements express in clear and dignified terms the grievous effect and the immense loss of the life of Eden Delir has had upon each of them. The loss of a young person in the circumstances with which this case is concerned are exceptionally painful and tragic. On behalf of the Court I extend my condolences to the family of the deceased for the immense loss that they have endured and will continue to endure. Nothing of course can address that immense loss.
	
	
	I have noted the provisions of DivisionÂ 2 Victim Impact Statements of PartÂ 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, in particular, sÂ 28 thereof. I have, of course, closely considered the victim impact statements in this case as significant material before the Court. I have determined the sentence to be imposed on the basis of the evidence and findings to which I have referred above. As there were no submissions made in relation to sÂ 28, I have determined that any sentence should not be increased by virtue of the statements to which DivisionÂ 2 applies.
	


Sentencing as a Juvenile Offender


	
	In certain circumstances, if a court sentences a person under 21Â years of age to imprisonment for an indictable offence it may direct that the whole or any part of the term of the sentence be served as a juvenile offender: sÂ 19(1) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.
	
	
	SectionÂ 19(3) of the lastmentioned Act provides that a person who is sentenced to imprisonment in respect of a serious childrenâs indictable offence (as in the present case) is not eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender after the person has attained the age of 18Â years unless one or other of the matters set out in subparagraphsÂ (a), (b) or (c) of sÂ 19(4) are satisfied.
	
	
	The eligibility to serve a sentence of imprisonment imposed in respect of a serious childrenâs indictable offence as a juvenile offender after a person has attained the age of 18Â years, in this case, would depend upon whether or not a finding of special circumstances can and is made under sÂ 19(4) of the Act (in particular, under subparagraphsÂ (a) or (b) or (c) thereof).
	


Juvenile Justice: Background Report


	
	The offender was interviewed on 27Â October, 5 and 17Â November 2014 by Ms Dean, Juvenile Justice Counsellor and Ms Abusharif, Assistant Manager (Clinical).
	
	
	Their report, to which I have earlier referred, notes that the offender who is now 19Â years of age was born in Australia of Iraqi descent. He has siblings with whom he is close. He has been residing with his parents whilst on bail. He has had the support of his family whilst in custody and during the proceedings.
	
	
	He attended primary and secondary school but he was asked to leave the school in YearÂ 8 prior to being expelled following an altercation with a female student. According to the school, the act of violence against the female student was not the first incident where the offender had displayed aggressive behaviour towards other students.
	
	
	He changed schools and left midway through YearÂ 10. According to information provided, the offender had been disciplined on occasion due to misbehaviour, including verbal abuse towards teachers and some physical violence towards other students resulting in three periods of suspension.
	
	
	The Background Report records that the offender appears to struggle with acceptance of responsibility in relation to his role in the offence.
	
	
	As earlier discussed, he denied being present at the party at the time of the attack on Eden Delir and claimed that he did not know that his co-accused were planning on assaulting the victim when he allegedly left the party. I note that this is directly inconsistent with what he said in the recorded conversation on 5Â November 2010.
	
	
	The authors of the Report state that the offender appeared to provide responses that minimised or justified his actions. They also observed that he would benefit from âtherapeutic interventions to address underlying risk factors that contribute to his pattern of anti-social behaviourâ: (pÂ 6).
	


Forensic Psychology Report


	
	Ms Jones, Forensic Psychologist, in her detailed report dated 8Â December 2014, noted that the offender has since his custody on 13Â October 2014, participated in education programs and counselling offered at the Centre where he is held.
	
	
	Ms Jones noted that he minimised his antisocial attitudes and involvement in antisocial behaviour. His poor insight, she observed, may be reflecting poor self-awareness of his inner thoughts and feelings or an overt attempt to impression management. She suggested both were at play.
	
	
	In terms of risk assessment, Ms Jones stated that the risk of re-offending may be minimised by assistance in the development of effective risk management strategies that target relevant risk factors. These were identified in the offenderâs case at 7.4 of the report.
	
	
	Ms Jones recommended that if the offender is held in a juvenile facility he will receive intervention to improve his insight into his antisocial attitudes, his violence and the influence of peers. Psychological intervention could also address his use of minimisation and poor acceptance of responsibility for his offence and past aggressive behaviours.
	
	
	Ms Jonesâ report identified suitable therapeutic interventions: at 10.5. She stated that these may assist him in his ability to gain insight into his behaviour. Her report indicates that the interventions she recommended in paragraphsÂ 9.2 and 9.3 of her report are rarely offered to Low Risk offenders (he was assessed on the Violence Risk Scale (VRS) as within the Low Range) in adult custody. In other words, Ms Jonesâ analysis and opinion favour the offender remaining in a juvenile detention facility for the maximum permitted age (21Â years).
	
	
	I am satisfied on the evidence that the only available therapeutic programs suitable to the offenderâs needs are those identified by Ms Jones that are available in detention centres and that are unlikely to be available to him in an adult correctional facility. I am satisfied that special circumstances referred to in sÂ 19(3) and (4)(b) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 exist.
	
	
	A finding of special circumstances under sÂ 19, of course, does not permit an order to be made that goes beyond the offenderâs 21st birthday.
	
	
	On the basis of the evidence to which I have referred, I make an order pursuant to sÂ 19(1) and 19(3), directing that the offender serve his non-parole period as a juvenile offender until the day upon which he attains the age of 21Â years.
	
	
	In sentencing the offender it is my intention that he be able to remain in a childrenâs detention centre as a juvenile offender until the day he turns 21, whereupon he is to be transferred to an adult gaol.
	
	
	In relation to the provisions of sÂ 15C of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act I note that no application has been made by either party, or any other interested party, for the usual statutory prohibition on the publication or broadcast of the name of the offender to be lifted on the event of being convicted of a serious childrenâs indictable offence.
	
	
	Having considered the provisions of sÂ 15C, I do not consider that an order should be made pursuant to sÂ 15C(2) and accordingly it would be an offence for any person to publish or broadcast material that connects the name of the offender with these criminal proceedings.
	


Sentence


	
	JH, you are convicted of the offence of manslaughter. I sentence you to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 7Â years to date from 5Â October 2014 and to expire on 4Â October 2021. There will be a parole period of 3Â years to commence on 5Â October 2021 and to expire on 4Â October 2024.
	
	
	Accordingly, the head sentence is a term of imprisonment for 10Â years with a non-parole period of imprisonment of 7Â years.
	
	
	The first date upon which you will be eligible to be released to parole accordingly will be on 4Â October 2021.

		14 January 2015",2014-12-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2765562,R v MB (No. 2) [2014] NSWSC 1755,"Judgment
INTRODUCTION
1On 24 November 2014 MB (""the accused"") pleaded not guilty to an indictment alleging that on 18 November 2010, at North Strathfield in the State of NSW, she murdered her daughter (to whom I shall refer as OB) who was then aged 6 months.

2On 6 February 2014 Barr AJ found the accused unfit to be tried: R v MB (NSWSC 6 February 2012, unreported). On 10 July 2014 the Mental Health Review Tribunal determined, for the purposes of s. 16 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act""), that the accused did not meet the criteria for fitness to be tried and that on the balance of probabilities that situation would continue, and the accused would not become fit during the 12 month period following the finding of unfitness. 

3In these circumstances, the matter has come before me as a special hearing pursuant to s. 19 of the Act which is in the following terms:

19 Court to hold special hearing after advice received from Director of Public Prosecutions 
(1) If the Court receives a notification of a determination from the Tribunal under section 16 (3), 45 (3) or 47 (5) that a person will not, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried for an offence, the Court: 

(a) is to obtain the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether further proceedings will be taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of the offence, and 

(b) is to conduct a special hearing as soon as practicable unless the Director of Public Prosecutions advises that no further proceedings will be taken. 

(2) A special hearing is a hearing for the purpose of ensuring, despite the unfitness of the person to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, that the person is acquitted unless it can be proved to the requisite criminal standard of proof that, on the limited evidence available, the person committed the offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative to the offence charged. 

(3) If the Director of Public Prosecutions advises the Court under subsection (1) (a) that no further proceedings will be taken in respect of the offence, the Director of Public Prosecutions is also to give that advice to the Minister for Police. 

(4) Subsection (1) does not apply if the Court has already held a special hearing in relation to the offence concerned.

4Pursuant to s. 21A of the Act a special hearing is to be conducted by a judge alone unless an election is made by either the Crown or the accused that there be a jury. No such election was made by either party in the present case. 

5Pursuant to s. 22(1) of the Act the following verdicts are available to be returned:

(i)that the accused is not guilty of the offence charged;

(ii)that the accused is not guilty on the grounds of mental illness;

(iii)that on the limited evidence available the accused committed the offence charged; and 

(iv)that on the limited evidence available the accused committed an offence available as an alternative to the offence charged.

6As to (iv) above, manslaughter is an available verdict given that the accused has been indicted for the offence of murder.



AN OVERVIEW OF THE CROWN CASE
7OB was born on 21 April 2010 to the accused and her husband (to whom I shall refer as ""RB""). On 24 June 2010 OB was examined by Dr Con James, Consultant Paediatrician. The accused had previously expressed concern about the presence of small skin tags near OB's ears, and Dr James arranged for a renal and bladder ultrasound to be performed in order to exclude any abnormalities. During the consultation, Dr James also raised the question of OB having proximal limb shortening, a possible indicator of a condition known as achondroplasia, commonly referred to as ""dwarfism"". Dr James informed the accused that although he did not believe that OB was suffering from that condition, he considered it appropriate that an x-ray be conducted to exclude it.

8The accused and OB returned to see Dr James on 7 July 2010, at which time Dr James reassured the accused that both the ultrasound and x-ray were normal. He suggested a follow up appointment in several months. 

9Despite Dr James' reassurances, the accused displayed continuing anxiety about OB. She commenced researching achondroplasia (and related conditions) on the internet, from which she apparently learned that x-rays may not be conclusive in terms of excluding the condition. As a result of a follow up appointment with Dr James, a skeletal survey was arranged to further investigate the possibility of proximal limb shortening. At that time there was also some discussion about OB having a flat nasal bridge and frontal bossing (or in other words, a protruding forehead). 

10The skeletal survey demonstrated no abnormality. Despite this, the accused remained highly anxious, apparently unconvinced that OB had no deformity. Dr James became concerned about the accused's mental health and its effect upon her ability to bond with OB. As a consequence, he referred the accused to Dr Anne Turner, the Head of Medical Genetics at the Sydney Children's Hospital. Dr Turner also concluded that there was no evidence of any abnormality. The accused was not accepting of that opinion and continued to express concern about the possibility of OB having a genetic disorder. Dr Turner arranged for further testing and the accused was referred to Dr Betts, psychologist, and Dr Rickard-Bell, psychiatrist.

11At subsequent consultations, Dr James again expressed the view that OB was a normal, healthy baby. Again, the accused was not accepting of his opinion. She was admitted to hospital on the evening of 19 October 2010 because she felt the need to undertake psychiatric treatment. Having stayed one night in hospital she expressed the wish to go home and because she was a voluntary patient she was permitted to leave. On 26 October 2010 the final testing conducted on OB was reported as normal. 

12During the period leading up to OB's death the accused was in contact with a number of her friends. In the course of conversations with them, she expressed concerns about OB being less than ""perfect"", and about losing her husband because of the failure to give him ""a perfect child"". She also made references to the prospect of jumping off a cliff with OB, and throwing her in the bin, and expressed a feeling that dealing with a long term illness was preferable to having to ""deal with a dwarf"".

13At 12:10pm on 18 November 2010 the accused called 000. In a conversation extending over 10 minutes and 53 seconds, she told the operator that OB was in the bath and that she had ""left her in there just to get the shampoo and she fell out of the seat"". Upon enquiry, the accused told the operator that OB was under water. The operator repeatedly asked the accused to retrieve OB, or let the water out of the bath. The accused stated that she could not do either. When ambulance officers arrived at approximately 12:16pm they found OB floating in the bath, exhibiting no signs of life. She was not able to be revived. A crime scene was established at the accused's home. Amongst the items retrieved from the bath was a purple seat referred to as a ""Bumbo seat"", which carried with it a warning that it should not be used in water. 
14The accused was admitted to hospital on the evening of 18 November 2010. At the hospital, she told her husband that what had happened was an accident, and that she had left OB in the chair to retrieve a jump suit. When speaking to police, the accused said that her mobile telephone had rung, she had taken OB out of the bath, and had then put her back in the bath and left her there to retrieve a face towel. She said that when she came back OB was already in the water. Later that evening, when providing a history to a nurse, the accused said that she had fed OB and bathed her to clean her up. She said that she had placed her in the bath chair and had left her there whilst she went to get a face flannel, and that when she returned OB was face down in the water.

15Post mortem examination of OB determined that the cause of her death was consistent with drowning. Injuries, the appearance of which was consistent with having been inflicted by something sharp such as a fingernail, were observed to be present on OB's head. 

16As part of the investigation of OB's death, police installed listening devices in the accused's home, along with the home of her mother (to whom I will refer as SG). In the course of recorded conversations, the accused indicated (inter alia) that she had never bonded with OB due to the ongoing medical tests which were being undertaken, and that she wished she had never given birth to her. 

17The accused was arrested and charged with OB's murder on 6 May 2011. She has been on bail since that time. It is the Crown case that she killed OB, either by intentionally drowning her in the bathtub intending to kill her or inflict grievous bodily harm upon her, or by leaving her in the bathtub for a sufficient period of time to allow her to fall forward into the water, and thereafter failing to remove her from that vulnerable position. In the alternative, the Crown relies on manslaughter by way of gross criminal negligence. An issue of infanticide is raised on the evidence, as is the partial defence of substantial impairment.
THE EVIDENCE 
The birth of OB 
18Dr Morris was the accused's treating gynaecologist and obstetrician between 2009 and 2010. The accused first consulted him on 27 April 2009. She had learned on 26 February 2009 that she was pregnant but that pregnancy miscarried at 7 weeks gestation (Ex D p. 48).

19The accused then fell pregnant with OB and saw Dr Morris on 16 September 2009 (Ex D p. 48). Dr Morris confirmed the viability of the pregnancy by ultrasound (Ex D p. 49). He described the accused's reaction to being told of the viability of her pregnancy as ""appropriate"" (Ex D p. 52). He raised with her the availability of a test to determine the presence of Downs Syndrome and although he did not arrange that testing, the accused did so herself (Ex D pp.52-53). The testing was carried out on 14 October 2009 by Dr Kesby, who reported that the results indicated an increased risk of Downs Syndrome. As a consequence, further testing, known as ""CVS"" testing, was carried out (Ex D pp. 53-54). The result of that testing was normal and this was discussed between the accused and Dr Morris at a later consultation on 28 October 2009 (Ex D p. 55-56). 

20On 6 October 2009 the accused had an unscheduled appointment with Dr Morris as a result of an increase in bleeding and cramping. After examination and an ultrasound, Dr Morris reassured the accused of the viability of her pregnancy. OB was delivered by Dr Morris at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on 21 April 2010 (Ex A para. 8). 

21After OB was born, RB assumed the role of being ""the principal bather"" (T14 L49) and would generally bath OB in the evening after he came home from work (T31 L22-27). After OB had outgrown a baby bath RB decided to start bathing her in the bath located in the bathroom of his home (T15 L21-22). RB gave evidence of a ""Bumbo"" seat in which OB would be seated when bathed (commencing at T15 L38). He explained that the seat was not stable and that although it created a type of vacuum when pushed down in the water, it would ""pop up"" unpredictably (Ex A para. 20; T31 L33 and following). The seat carried a warning against use in the bath (Ex AW para. 7). RB explained (commencing at T16 L14) that he had told the accused not to leave OB in the bath alone and said that he himself had not done so (T16 L48-49). He described the accused (commencing at T32 L11) as absent minded, although he said that her presentation in this respect in 2010 was ""roughly the same"" as it was at any other time. 

22After OB was born Dr Morris saw her on 8 June 2010 (Ex D p. 67) and referred her to Dr James for what was described as a ""routine"" purpose (Ex D p. 67). Dr Morris had no contact with the accused after 8 June 2010. 

23Leaving aside the matters which are discussed in detail below, the only other documented difficulty reported by the accused following OB's birth was on 27 April 2010, when she reported problems associated with breast feeding. A home visit was made on 13 May 2010 (having been rescheduled from an earlier date) by Keryn Ferguson, a Child and Family Health Nurse. The problem was discussed and there were no issues which warranted a follow up visit. 

The accused's initial concerns about OB's appearance
24RB said (T14 L40 and following) that when OB was born the hospital staff noted the presence of skin tags near her ears. They were also noted by Ms Ferguson when she visited the accused at her home on 13 May 2010 (Ex E p. 3). When asked how the accused responded to the skin tags, RB said that she ""just wanted to know what they were"" (T14 L44). 

25Josephine Dattilo, who was then a close friend of the accused, saw her in hospital within a couple of days of OB's birth (T87 L24-26). After the accused returned home, Ms Dattilo had a conversation with the accused in the course of which the accused said that OB ""had a couple of little skin tags that she was looking into (which she) wanted ... removed because (she) didn't want her teased"" (T87 L48-49). When asked whether the accused had said anything about the appearance of the skin tags Ms Dattilo said (T88 L27-28):

""Well, she didn't like them. They didn't look good and she didn't want her daughter to be teased"".

26Another close friend of the accused at the time, Natasha Di Nunzio, was overseas when OB was born. When she returned approximately two weeks later, she went to the accused's home and saw her and OB. She said that on that occasion the accused (commencing at T74 L33):

""... was preoccupied with skin tags. And I said not to worry; I just wanted to have a look at her. So she walked me into the bedroom to have a quick look at her. ... She mentioned that she had them on her ears and how soon could she how soon can a child have plastic surgery to remove them. ... I just said not to be stupid"". 


27The evidence of Ms Dattilo and Ms Di Nunzio is generally consistent with evidence of RB (Ex A para 9) that the accused enquired as to the age at which the skin tags could be removed. 

28The evidence of SG (the accused's mother) was that the presence of skin tags on OB's ears was ""not a major concern"" (Ex. B para. 12). Even if that was the position from SG's perspective, I am satisfied that it was not so from the perspective of the accused who, as I have outlined, displayed significant concern to Ms Dattilo and Ms Di Nunzio. 

The initial consultation with Dr James - 24 June 2010
29Dr James is a Consultant Paediatrician who saw OB on seven occasions between 24 June 2010 and 28 October 2010. He said (Ex. F1 para. 5) that at all times, OB presented as being well cared for, well nourished, and interactive. 

30Dr James said (Ex F1 para. 8) that at the time of OB's initial examination, there was a clinical suggestion of proximal limb shortening. He arranged a renal and bladder ultrasound to exclude any abnormality associated with the skin tags, along with an x-ray of OB's right upper limb to investigate the suggestion of proximal shortening. Dr James explained (Ex F2 para. 5) that when he saw OB and the accused on 24 June 2010 he did not use the term ""dwarfism"", but explained that limb shortening can sometimes be associated with achondroplasia. He told the accused that he did not believe that OB was suffering from achondroplasia but that an x-ray would be valuable to exclude it. 

31The suggestion that OB may have had limb shortening caused the accused immediate and significant concern, compounding that which had previously arisen in relation to OB's skin tags. RB described the accused as being ""in shock"" after the possibility of limb shortening being raised and explained that the accused commenced to research the condition on the internet (Ex A para. 9). He described the accused (commencing at T19 L40; T 28 L29) as being ""concerned that (OB) was a dwarf"". The conclusion that the accused became distressed and anxious at the suggestion that OB was a dwarf is supported by the evidence of SG, who described the accused as being ""shocked and worried that this might be leading to a serious syndrome"" (Ex B para 12).

32Such a conclusion is similarly supported by Ms Dattilo. The accused told Ms Dattilo that she had visited a Paediatrician who had raised the question of OB having limb shortening and dwarfism (T88 L35-48). Ms Dattilo reassured the accused that ""everything would be okay"" (T89 L2). Similarly Joanne Dinov, another close friend of the accused, visited the accused following OB's birth. When asked whether there was any mention by the accused about OB having any abnormality Ms Dinov said (T111 L20):

""Something to do with her limbs and the possibility of her being a dwarf.""

33Ms Dinov said that the accused told her that she had been undertaking research on the internet as a result of her concerns (T111 L31-50). 

The test results of 6 July
34On 6 July 2010 an x-ray of OB's right upper limb, and a renal ultrasound, were conducted and reported as normal. 

The second consultation with Dr James - 7 July 2010 
35Dr James examined OB again on 7 July 2010 at which time he reviewed the results of the x-ray and renal ultrasound. He reassured the accused that no abnormality had been detected, and that there was no evidence of proximal limb shortening. He explained that this meant that OB did not have achondroplasia (Ex F2 para. 6). He suggested a clinical review in several months' time and advised the accused that OB's skin tags should be surgically removed before she reached 12 months of age. At that stage, at least from Dr James' perspective, nothing further was required.

The third consultation with Dr James - 14 July 2010
36On 14 July 2010, the accused telephoned Dr James' surgery and spoke with his receptionist, Ms Angela Tsamtseres. She told Ms Tsamtseres (Ex G paras. 7 and following) that her internet searches had revealed that x-ray results were not conclusive in terms of excluding the possibility of achondroplasia and that she wanted to have a genetic blood test conducted. She said, in particular: 

""Please I need (Dr James) to refer me to a Geneticist. I feel when I look at her, I'm seeing the signs of a dwarf"".


37Ms Tsamtseres then spoke with Dr James and an appointment was arranged for later that day (Ex G para 9). In respect of the examination of OB on that occasion Dr James stated (Ex F1 para. 10):

""OB appeared well. Her length was 58cm and head circumference 38.7cm both between the 25th and 50th percentile and weight 5.71kg between the 50th to 75th percentiles. A skeletal survey was ordered in view of a (sic) impression of slight proximal limb shortening and flat nasal bridge and frontal bossing.""

38He further stated (Ex F2 para. 8):
""The mother told me certain things about genetic testing and how she wanted more detailed testing to rule out Achondroplasia which she referred to as ""dwarfism"". I recall she told me that she had seen photos on the internet. I believe the accused raised the issue of the frontal bossing to me. I then made an observation of a flat nasal bridge and wrote the word ""prominent"" which would have meant prominent forehead. This is the same as frontal bossing. I ordered a skeletal survey. I ordered this not because I believed OB had Achondroplasia but to placate the accused. I told the accused on every occasion that OB was normal and did not have Achondroplasia"".

39Ms Tsamtseres stated that after that consultation she had spoken to the accused who said that she was feeling better (Ex G para. 10).

40According to RB, the reference to the possibility of frontal bossing rendered the accused's emotional condition worse (Ex A para. 10). That assessment is supported by what followed over the next several months.

The skeletal survey - 20 July 2010
41A skeletal survey performed on 20 July 2010 showed no evidence of achondroplasia, nor skeletal dysplasia (Ex F3). 

The fourth consultation with Dr James - 21 July 2010 
42Dr James examined OB on 21 July 2010 and noted that the skeletal survey was reported as normal. However he also noted (Ex F1 para. 11): 

""... mother was anxious ++, convinced OB has Achondroplasia and is crying today - this will affect maternal bonding.""

43Dr James explained (Ex F2 para 9) that whilst it was not uncommon for first time mothers to be anxious, and to require reassurance, the accused seemed convinced that OB had achondroplasia and was not normal, despite his attempts to reassure her to the contrary. In the circumstances, Dr James referred the accused to Dr Anne Turner, the Head of the Department of Medical Genetics at the Sydney Children's Hospital (Ex F1 para. 10). His letter of referral was in (inter alia) the following terms (Ex F2 para. 10):

""I suspect this baby is normal but mother is ""hysterical"" with concern and is convinced her baby has (Rhizomelic shortening) and needs genetic testing. Please see her asap or maternal bonding will suffer.""

The first consultation with Dr Turner - 21 July 2010
44Dr Turner first examined OB on the afternoon of 21 July 2010 in the presence of Dr Kathy Wu, a trainee Geneticist. Dr Turner described OB's appearance as being that of a ""normal healthy baby .... of three months of age"" (Ex H1 at paras. 4-5). She stated (commencing at para. 9 of Ex H1) that she reassured the accused that OB was a normal baby. In response to a specific query, she reassured the accused that OB's limb length was normal and that there was no indication of any bone disorder on x-ray. Dr Turner also explained to the accused that based on her clinical examination and the x-ray results, she was able to exclude any diagnosis of achondroplasia. 

45Despite this, the accused remained concerned and Dr Turner agreed to conduct genetic blood tests to further exclude achondroplasia. Dr Turner also offered to forward OB's x-rays to Professor David Sillence, a Genetic Bone Disease expert, for further reassurance. 

46Dr Wu described the accused as appearing ""very anxious about the possibility of an underlying genetic condition in OB"". She confirmed the opinion of Dr Turner that there were no significant indicators of a genetic problem (Ex J para. 5). She also confirmed that the accused's degree of anxiety was so great that further testing was arranged to provide additional reassurance. In doing so, Dr Wu recalled that the accused had said words to the effect:

"" ... every time I look at her, she looks like a dwarf.'""


47On 28 July 2010 Dr Turner wrote to the accused and said (inter alia) (Ex H2):

""On examination, OB was an alert and engaging baby who was constantly vocalising. Her growth parameters were all within normal range. She indeed had excellent tone and strength in her arms and legs. We noted the skin tags on her ears; otherwise her ears were normally formed and placed. We could appreciate your concerns about her flat nasal bridge and upturned nose, however, there (sic) are indeed subtle differences that may well be baby features or familial trait.

We reviewed the skeletal survey with Professor David Sillence, a world authority on skeletal dysplasias, who thought OB's skeletal survey was completely normal, with no evidence of Achondroplasia or Hypochondroplasia.

We discussed that skin tags on ears are very common and likely to be an isolated variation in OB given her normal growth and development, rather than having a genetic underlying cause. For your reassurance and given that you are planning your second pregnancy in the near future, we have arranged for OB to have a blood sample taken for chromosome analysis, MLPA and genetic testing for skeletal dysplasia.

We have tentatively arranged a follow-up appointment on 30th August, by which time we should have the above testing results. It will be helpful if OB's father can be present at our next appointment and if you can also bring some family photographs"".

The accused's presentations to Dr Soo 
48Dr Soo, a General Practitioner, saw the accused on 26 July 2010 when she presented with anxiety following the recent death of her grandfather. Dr Soo reported (Ex L para. 6):

""The accused was already on Xanax and was given a repeat script.""

49It is not clear from Dr Soo's statement who prescribed Xanax prior to this time.

50On 11 August 2010 the accused again presented to Dr Soo and complained of anxiety. Dr Soo reported (Ex L para. 7):

""From my notes I noted that her baby daughter had short limbs and was undergoing genetic testing. ... As a result of this consultation I prescribed her Zoloft tablet 50 mg, 1 at night"".

The accused's conversations with friends 
51I have already made reference to the accused having contact with a number of her friends in the period shortly after OB's birth. That contact continued over the ensuing months, right up to the time of OB's death. In the course of that contact, the accused not only expressed her concerns about OB but made various statements regarding the effect of OB upon her life. But for one discreet matter to which I have referred below, there was no challenge to the evidence of the statements made by the accused to her various friends. 

52Ms Di Nunzio described the accused as being ""preoccupied that there was something wrong with OB"" (T75 L23). When asked what she meant by ""preoccupied"" Ms Di Nunzio said (T75 L28-39):

""... she thought there was something wrong with her and she keeps saying that ""there's something wrong with her, I know""... She was very preoccupied that there was a mutation or she'd been taking her for several tests. She was preoccupied with what the results would be. So the conversations were normally about why this was happening to her and why did she deserve this to happen to her and to her husband."" 

53When asked whether the accused had expressed a particular concern about OB, Ms Di Nunzio responded (T76 L3-6):

""She thought that she was dwarf, that possibly that the results would indicate that she had dwarfism. ... Basically ... she felt her life with her husband was affected because of the state of the baby, and she felt guilty that she'd produced a baby that could possibly have something wrong with it, and she mentioned that her husband had said to her to to leave, gave her the opportunity to leave, and he'll look after the baby and she can get on with her life. And she said to me that, you know, she was happy with her marriage with her husband and why should she let this affect her marriage."" 

54Ms Di Nunzio said (T79 L27-47) that on another occasion the accused had told her that she ""couldn't bear to look at (OB) or pick her up"". When asked whether the accused had said why she felt that way, Ms Di Nunzio responded (T79 L47):

""It was all to do with what she believed was wrong, was wrong with OB"".

55The accused also told Ms Di Nunzio that she felt that her life had been affected by OB, and that she felt guilty that she had ""produced a baby that could possibly have something wrong with it"". She also questioned why she should allow any issue in relation to OB to affect her marriage (T76 L6-14).

56Ms Di Nunzio also said that the accused thought that OB's abnormalities were a ""punishment"" for something, although she did not know what (T80 L32-39). She described the accused, in effect, as a person who took pride in her appearance, particularly in relation to her hair and make up (T76 L32-38). 

57Ms Dattilo became aware that the accused had consulted a Paediatrician, and spoke with her on a weekly basis about the tests which were being carried out. She said that apart from the accused having expressed a fear that OB may be a dwarf, she had also expressed concerns about the shape of OB's forehead as well as the shape of the bridge of her nose (T91 L11-24; T94 L31-37). 

58In relation to the accused's concerns about OB's possible dwarfism Ms Dattilo gave the following evidence (T93 L12-20):

""Q. In relation to MB raising her concern about OB being a dwarf, did she say anything to you about how she would react if OB was a dwarf? 
A. She would have to get rid of her. 

Q. Can you remember how she said that or what words she said? 
A. She said that she didn't want she had the perfect husband and the perfect job, and she didn't want the quality of her life to diminish in any way. She also expressed that she had a fear of dwarfs, and that she would have to get rid of her, and apparently she had had a discussion with-""


59According to Ms Dattilo, this was said in a conversation in about September 2010 (T100 L48 - T101 L24). Ms Dattilo gave a lengthy statement to the police on 19 April 2011. She gave evidence in the committal proceedings in November 2012. She made no reference, on either occasion, to the accused saying that she would have to ""get rid"" of OB. When asked why this was so, she said (T99 L36 - 42):

""...It was quite daunting being at a police station for the first time and having to give such a long statement. We have a very close friendship, best friends one could say, and there were many things that have gone through my mind in the last four years of conversations that we had had. We sometimes there were days that we had more than one conversation in a day, conversations just about every day. It's very difficult to remember absolutely everything. ""


60In para. 21 of her statement to police Ms Dattilo had said (T102 L33-37):

""I recall a conversation with her when the genetic testing was going on where she said words to the effect 'if she is a dwarf, I told RB that OB would have to be taken away' "".

61The evidence of Ms Dattilo (T102 L23 - T104 L12) was that the conversation in which the accused had said that she would have to ""get rid"" of OB was the same conversation in which she had referred to OB being ""taken away"". When it was put to her that what the accused had said was that OB would have to be ""taken away"" as opposed to having to ""get rid"" of her, Ms Dattilo said:

""She did say that as well, throughout that long conversation, because yes. I know 100 per cent that's what she said"". 

62When asked when this conversation had come into her mind Ms Dattilo said (T105 L48 - T106 L3):

""It always pops into my mind here and there. You had so many conversations pop into my mind, I am sure there are other things which I don't remember today or, you know, that you kind of sit back at night and you think. There were things running through my mind last night, conversations, several conversations. Six and a half months is a long time of conversation between very close best friends.""


63Ms Dattilo denied (T106 L21-34) that her evidence that the accused had said she would have to ""get rid"" of OB was a lie. Having observed Ms Dattilo give evidence, I did not form the impression that she was a person who would deliberately lie. On the contrary, she presented as somebody who appeared to be doing her best to give truthful evidence. However, it was apparent from her demeanour in the witness box that the process of giving evidence was stressful for her, coming as it did against a background of a long friendship with the accused which, I infer, may have now ended. I can also well understand that the procedure of making a lengthy statement was, for the reasons Ms Dattilo explained, a daunting and difficult experience. 

64However even when full weight is given to those circumstances, her omission of any reference, both in her statement and in her evidence at the committal hearing, to the accused having said that she would have to ""get rid of"" OB, defies explanation. This is particularly so in circumstances where, in making her statement, she had alluded to the fact that the accused had made reference to OB having to be ""taken away"", this being something that she maintained was said in the same conversation as that in which the accused had referred to ""getting rid"" of OB. 

65In these circumstances I am not able to accept that the accused told Ms Dattilo that she would have to ""get rid of"" OB. However, there was no challenge to Ms Dattilo's evidence that the accused had said that if OB was a dwarf she would have to be ""taken away"". I am satisfied that this was said by the accused. 

66Ms Dattilo was also asked about conversations she had had with the accused about the accused's ability to bond with OB (T93 L45-49):

""Q. Did MB say anything to you about how she responded to OB? 
A. She said that OB wasn't responding, and that she was a frittata. 
Q. Frittata? 
A. Yes. Which is which is basically in Italian an omelette.""

67Ms Dattilo also gave evidence of the accused and OB attending her own son's birthday party in September 2010. She described (T94 L17-29) OB being dressed that day in a ""very thick hooded suit which concealed the presence of the ear tags"". The party occurred in September 2010 at a time when, according to Ms Dattilo, the weather was ""very warm"" (T94 L12). Ms Dattilo described the accused as a person who was always meticulous in her presentation (T96 L40-41). The obvious inference to be drawn from these parts of Ms Dattilo's evidence is that the appearance of OB's skin tags remained an issue for the accused at that time. 

68Ms Dinov said that the accused had expressed concern to her ""many, many, many times"" about OB having limb shortening (T112 L12-16) and about the possibility that it was indicative of achondroplasia. The accused went to the extent of asking Ms Dinov for a photograph of her son for the purposes of comparing his limbs with those of OB. Ms Dinov also said that the accused had expressed concerns about OB's forehead as well as the shape of the bridge of her nose (T112 L31-37). Ms Dinov was aware that OB was undergoing genetic testing (T112 L42).

69Ms Dinov said that on the occasions when she visited the accused after OB's birth she saw little in the way of affection or bonding between them (T113 L23-24; T113 L45-47; T115 L10-14) which the accused had attributed to ""the doctors"" (T115 L20). She also gave evidence (T115 L44-50) that when walking with the accused in a local park, the accused would make reference to ""ferrals"" having ""normal children"", and questioning why ""God punished her"".

The referral to Dr Betts 
70In the days following Dr Turner's initial examination, the accused made several enquiries about the test results (Ex H1 para. 14). On 10 August 2010 she called and spoke with Dr Wu and expressed her ongoing concern that OB had a genetic disorder. Dr Wu said (Ex J para. 8):

""On most occasions she sounded very distressed and anxious about the genetic testing results...Because I could hear in her voice that she was not coping, I spoke to the lab to try and speed up the results of the genetic testing. 

One of the phone calls I recall having with the accused was that she was feeling so anxious on this particular occasion that she could not bring herself to come to the appointment because of fear that she would hear something bad.""


71At about that time, Dr Turner and Dr Wu decided that the accused's levels of anxiety warranted a referral to Dr Betts, the Deputy Head of Psychology at the Sydney Children's Hospital (Ex H1 at para. 15). Dr Wu asked Dr Betts to assist in the accused's psychological management, with particular reference to anxiety associated with her concern that OB had a medical syndrome such as achondroplasia (Ex C para. 6). 

72On 11 August 2010 Dr Betts contacted the accused by telephone. The accused told him that she was coping adequately and declined Dr Betts' offer of an appointment. When asked to describe the accused's state of mind at that time Dr Betts said (T50 L8-11):

""I felt she was anxious and I note in my email that I say that MB spoke to me rather than and that I listened, and I mentioned about energy and a lot and she admits to a lot of anxiety. So I did form the opinion that she was very anxious, but that she was coping.""

73On 18 August 2010 the accused called Dr Betts and asked him to facilitate her admission to a psychiatric facility in the event that the results of OB's genetic testing evidenced an abnormality. She also told Dr Betts on that occasion that she was having ""a lot of difficulty"" coping with her anxiety (T50 L33-38). When pressed by Dr Betts about how she felt she would react if OB was found to have achondroplasia, the accused responded that ""she wouldn't be able to cope at home with the baby etc"", but did not elaborate further (T50 L43-44). Dr Betts described the accused's state of mind at the time in the following terms (at T51 L9-12):

""... she was extremely anxious and ... she needed further treatment for her anxiety. I did also ask relevant questions about depression, the symptoms of depression, and she denied the symptoms of depression but openly admitted to anxiety.""

74Although the accused denied any feelings of depression, she spoke with Dr Betts about her stress levels (T51 L39-43). Dr Betts explained (at T52 L3-5) that the accused cited, as the cause of her stress, the possibility that OB had dwarfism. He formed the view that the accused should be referred to a psychiatrist and contacted Dr Turner seeking a referral to Dr Rickard-Bell (Ex H1 para. 16) with whom an appointment was arranged (Ex C para. 8). Dr Betts took that step in light of the accused's anxiety (T52 L36-50). 

75Dr Turner's referral to Dr Rickard-Bell made reference to the fact that the accused was anxious regarding the results of OB's genetic testing and was either not responding to reassurances, or was irrational when doing so (T171 L46 - T172 L4).

The involvement of Carolyn Shalhoub
76Ms Carolyn Shalhoub, the Senior Genetic Counsellor at the Sydney Children's Hospital, became involved in the accused's management at the request of Dr Turner because of concerns about the accused's extreme levels of anxiety (Ex K para. 4). Ms Shalhoub telephoned the accused on 19 August to inform her that the genetic testing for achondroplasia had detected no abnormality. The accused responded (Ex K para. 5):

""I have been living in fear for several weeks, even prior to seeing genetics, my anxiety had begun when I first heard from the paediatrician that there was a suspicion of shortened limbs and bossed forehead. The anxiety that I have been experiencing is a reaction to the uncertainty of the situation and that I could ultimately cope with bad news but I just can't bear waiting for the results. I just want to know as soon as possible if there is condition in OB so that she can start any appropriate treatments etc.""

77When Ms Shalhoub asked the accused whether she had experienced stress or anxiety in the past, the accused responded (Ex K para. 6):

""No, this is definitely the scariest thing I have ever had to face...I have never experienced depression but maybe I am beginning to feel a little depressed lately as a direct result of all of the anxiety, but no more than that.""

78When asked whether she thought that she would benefit from consulting a psychiatrist the accused responded (Ex K para. 7):

""I don't think I need to, now that the result has come back normal, but I am open to this in the future if the anxiety does not settle.""

79Despite these statements, the accused subsequently telephoned Ms Shalhoub and expressed her concerns about OB, from which it was evident to Ms Shalhoub that the accused's anxiety remained. After further discussions, and in light of the accused's continuing anxiety, it was agreed that the appointment with Dr Turner scheduled for 30 August 2010 should be brought forward to 26 August 2010. This was because Dr Turner was concerned about the accused's levels of anxiety, and thought that an earlier consultation would allow an opportunity to reassure her about the absence of any abnormality in OB (Ex H1 para. 17).

The second consultation with Dr Turner - 26 August 2010
80When Dr Turner saw the accused, OB and RB on 26 August 2010, she found that all of OB's parameters were well within normal limits. Comparison with measurements taken on the previous occasion indicated normal growth during the intervening period (Ex H1 para. 21). Dr Turner reassured the accused and RB that OB was growing and developing normally and that no abnormalities were apparent on physical examination. The accused responded by telling Dr Turner that she felt reassured (Ex H1 para. 22). At that time Dr Turner mentioned that a final test, known as a ""CGH microarray"", had been ordered. She explained that this test was designed to detect chromosomal abnormality but said that she expected the results to be normal. Ms Shalhoub was in attendance at this appointment. She said that RB had expressed the view that he ""fully believed"" that OB had no abnormality but that the accused had not been able to see that this was the case. She said that the accused had said that OB's ""problem"" had commenced prior to her birth (Ex K para. 9). 

81Shortly after the appointment, the accused telephoned Ms Shalhoub and said (inter alia) (Ex K para. 10):

""I wanted to talk to express my on-going concerns about OB. I was not able to express my concerns in the appointment with my husband present. I feel that he does not believe that there is anything wrong with OB and that he is tired of hearing my concerns. RB is a good man and I do not want to cause any further friction to the relationship, by raising my concerns in the appointment. The car trip home would have been very difficult if I had done so. Despite all the evidence dismissing achondroplasia, I still feel that OB has dwarfism. I have measured and compared the lengths of the limbs of all the babies in my mother's group and am convinced that OB's is abnormal. I have also compared her hands and feet to the other babies and again am sure that they are smaller...OB's ears are different to mine and RB's which must be a sign that there is something wrong; OB's nasal bridge is depressed; her eyes are blue which again must be a sign of a problem as RB and I have brown eyes. I really feel that something isn't right. My mother's intuition is telling me so.""

82When asked by Ms Shalhoub whether or not she had ever had any contact with a dwarf, the accused replied:

""I remember a dwarf in my neighbourhood as a child, which used to considerably frighten me.""

The first consultation with Dr Betts - 26 August 2010
83Dr Betts met with the accused for the first time on 26 August 2010, over a period of 25 minutes. He recorded (inter alia) the following (Ex C para. 10):

""...(the accused) and her husband RB attended with their daughter OB. They had just come from their appt. with Dr Anne Turner and she said she was reassured by what they had said - normal results. (The accused's) presentation today was as she had been over the phone to me - anxious, a tendency not to listen to what is said but to repeat statements to justifying (sic) the 'normality' of her anxiety. I found I had to interrupt her politely but firmly many times to be able to say what I needed to, which was some Psychoeducations on anxiety and how it is best dealt with and reduced. I also warned both MB and RB that with the kind of anxiety, a temporary reassurance does not take away the worries but they tend to rebound unless the underlying reasons for the anxiety are addressed and treated. She told me she had had a scary experience when she was a child - a dwarf lived in their neighbourhood and whenever she saw this person she ran away screaming. Suggested Dr Chris Rickard-Bell would advise on treatment. Appt. for next Tuesday...""

84Dr Betts said (T59 L6-21) that when he spoke with the accused she ""justified the normality of her anxiety"". He said that he did not consider that the accused was exhibiting delusional thinking, but explained that when he later learned that the accused had told other people she was not reassured by the test results, he raised that possibility. He agreed that if the accused was delusional such a condition would overlap with a psychosis (T61 L8-26). 

85The accused told Dr Betts that she was ""reassured"" by what Dr Turner had told her (T54 L17-33). That, of course, was not consistent with the content of her conversations with Ms Shalhoub following the appointment with Dr Turner. As to the accused's presentation, Dr Betts said (T53 L49 - T 54 L15): 

""I think it was simply that she was worried that OB or had been worried that OB had a medical condition such as achondroplasia, and that was what she was trying to justify to me, the normality of mothers or parents being concerned as concerned as she had been about that possibility.""


86On the following day, 27 August, Dr Betts spoke with Ms. Shalhoub (T54 L39 and following) who informed him of her conversation with the accused on the previous day (Ex H1 para. 23). This raised a question in Dr Betts' mind about whether the accused was fit to care for OB. However, in circumstances where the accused had told him that she would never hurt OB, and where she denied any thoughts of harm towards herself (T58 L21), Dr Betts concluded that there was no indication that the accused wished, or intended, to harm OB or herself (T62 L11-45). That assessment is generally consistent with evidence given by RB, who said that the accused ""wanted to do everything she could"" for OB (T27 L4-9) and that she took particular care in attending to everything associated with having a new born baby. It is, however, somewhat inconsistent with the statements made by the accused to Ms Di Nunzio and Ms Datillo which, as I have noted, were not challenged.

87Dr Betts remained of the view that the accused required psychiatric intervention to treat her anxiety, and explained that he was ""very worried"" about her (T61 L35-41). He offered to expedite the forthcoming appointment with Dr Rickard-Bell but the accused declined that offer (Ex C para. 11; T56 L14). At about this time, Dr Betts had a number of telephone conversations with the accused and RB, independently of each other. When he spoke with RB, Dr Betts expressed concern about the accused's state of mind and advised RB that he should ""watch her carefully"" (T56 L35-39). Dr Betts said (commencing at T57 L2) that there were a number of things which caused him concern, including the accused's continuing belief that OB suffered from some type of syndrome, and a fear that the medical staff conducting the tests ""may have missed something"". 

88On 28 August 2010 the accused called Dr Turner's secretary asking that she be provided with copies of all test results by 2.00 pm that day. Those results were provided to her. The accused complained that she was not provided with that information at the time of her consultation on 26 August, although she had not requested it at the time (Ex H1 para. 24). Later the same day, there were discussions between Drs. Turner, Wu and Betts, and Ms Shalhoub, in which Dr Turner expressed concern that the accused's anxiety, and her inability to accept reassurance, were substantially in excess of what she was accustomed to seeing. She contacted Dr Rickard-Bell to make him aware of her ongoing concerns, but it was agreed that because the scheduled appointment was only four days away, it should remain in place and not be brought forward (Ex H1 para. 25). 

The consultation with Dr Rickard-Bell - 31 August 2010
89Dr Rickard-Bell conducted an initial consultation with the accused over a period of 45 to 50 minutes on 31 August 2010 (T172 L16-20). Although he had planned a follow up appointment no such arrangement was made, (T172 L30-32) due to the accused having difficulties in finding someone to look after OB, and the distance between her home and Dr Rickard-Bell's consulting rooms (Ex H1 para. 27).

90Dr Rickard-Bell described the accused as ""very professional in her presentation"" (T172 L43) and noted that her mood fluctuated from being very anxious and tearful to reacting in a more positive way. He regarded her as ""highly anxious"" (T173 L27-40). He formed the view that it was likely that the accused had an obsessional personality (T174 L1-6). He could find no evidence of thought disorder or illogicality in thinking, even though some aspects of what the accused said exhibited some abnormality. When asked what was abnormal or unusual in this regard Dr Rickard-Bell responded (at T174 L18-23):

""So her preoccupation about her child's her fears about her child's illness appeared to be exaggerated and indicated there was some psychiatric problem in that she had this strong preoccupation with the child's condition, perhaps dwarfism. It's a very unusual sort of preoccupation. I guess the issue is: Is this consistent with an anxiety disorder or was it reflective of something else?""

91When he asked the accused about her concerns regarding OB the accused responded that (T174 L49 - T175 L9):

"" ..... she was worried that the child may have dwarfism and even though she had been through testing, she still didn't feel that was conclusive and there was still a level of anxiety that the investigations were not comprehensive ... She believed that the child appeared to have shorter limbs than was normal and that there were some ear tags that can sometimes be associated with congenital defects and that she felt there was some flattening of the face.""

92The accused told Dr Rickard-Bell that in addition to speaking with medical staff, she was also conducting her own research on the internet. He regarded this as a common presentation in people who were obsessional and highly anxious (T175 L11-29).

93Dr Rickard-Bell said that despite the fact that all of the testing conducted up to that time was reported as normal, the accused remained anxious about whether or not this was truly the case (T174 L28-32). The accused had indicated that she wanted to obtain the outstanding test results, and she said that the Doctors who had been investigating OB did not exhibit the same level of concern as she did (T175 L36 - T176 L2). 

94Dr Rickard-Bell concluded that there was no evidence of cognitive disturbance (T174 L34-36) and he did not think that the accused's concerns about OB were interfering with her ability to care for her. On the contrary he observed that one of the accused's main wishes was to be able to care for OB as well as she could, to the point where she was over protective (T178 L7-12; T186 L32-39; T176 L4-8).

95In terms of his provisional diagnosis, Dr Rickard-Bell gave the following evidence (commencing at T176 L10):

""Q. Did you in fact form an impression that what the accused had was a hypochondriacal preoccupation and overvalued ideas about OB's genetic problem? 
A: That was my conclusion from an initial consultation of 45 to 50 minutes where I only had the direct information of preoccupation from her and the referring letter from the geneticist, so I didn't have at that time and normally one would like to have other corroborative information from others in the person's family or other medical practitioners or mental health practitioners that she may have been involved with. So from that snapshot of her condition, that was my provisional diagnosis"". 


96Dr Rickard-Bell could not exclude the possibility that the accused's presentation was part of a forming or developing psychosis. Although he agreed that there were factors which accounted for the accused's anxiety, he pointed out that this was based on a single interview, or ""snapshot"" (T177 L19-38). 

97Dr Rickard-Bell agreed that it was possible for a person to present as the accused did and descend into psychotic presentation over the ensuing days, weeks or months (T181 L47 - T182 L1). Equally, he agreed that it was possible that such a deterioration would not happen at all. He had expected that her condition would improve over a period of time with appropriate assistance and treatment (T183 L5-7). He agreed that the accused was suffering from something more than an adjustment disorder but saw no indication of the onset of schizophrenia (T184 L5-47). 

The fifth consultation with Dr James - 1 September 2010
98Dr James examined OB on 1 September 2010 and reviewed the earlier report of Dr Turner. He noted (Ex F1 para. 12) that the accused was ""still concerned"" and felt that OB's head was ""too prominent"". 

99On examination of OB, Dr James noted her measurements and recorded that apart from some slight frontal bossing, OB had a normal skull shape. He ordered a further ultrasound and suggested that the accused provide him with photographs of herself and RB as babies for clinical comparison (Ex F1 para. 12). Dr James explained (Ex F2 para. 11) that this consultation did not focus on any suggested achondroplasia, but rather the frontal bossing. He explained that he referred OB for an ultrasound because the accused felt that OB's forehead was too prominent. He also explained that this referral represented a ""further attempt to reassure the accused who seemed preoccupied that OB's head was not normal and that there was something else wrong, even if she did not have achondroplasia"" (Ex F2 para. 11).

The tests of 9 September 2010
100On 9 September 2010 a head ultrasound was reported as evidencing mild prominence of the extra axial CSF spaces which were just above upper limits of normal (Ex F3). It was observed that this would need clinical review and follow up. 
The conversation with Ms Shalhoub - 21 September 2010
101The accused telephoned Ms Shalhoub on 21 September 2010 and informed her that she had not been able to keep her follow up appointment with Dr Rickard-Bell. On that occasion the accused said to Ms Shalhoub (Ex K para. 12):

""I am not convinced that (OB's) arms are of normal length and in addition I am now extremely concerned about OB having frontal bossing...I am very worried because the measurement in question is a few millimetres above the normal range. I have seen a paediatric surgeon and he is not convinced that there is frontal bossing and added that OB's forehead's appearance is normal and familial in appearance. But I am not convinced by this, I am sure OB will require head surgery to rectify her forehead size.""

102Ms Shalhoub formed the view that the accused's anxiety was escalating (Ex K para. 12).

The sixth consultation with Dr James - 29 September 2010
103Dr James reviewed OB on 29 September 2010. He noted the results of the ultrasound conducted on 9 September and noted that both the accused and RB had said that they were ""reassured"" by (inter alia) the fact that they had consulted a Professor Gianoutsos, who had expressed no concern about OB's skull shape. Dr James said that at that time he was confident that OB was a normal, healthy baby. He recommended a review in 2 months (Ex F1 paras. 12-13).

The accused's admission to hospital - 19 October 2010
104In about mid October 2010, the accused and RB discussed obtaining treatment for the accused's anxiety (commencing at T29 L 41). On 19 October 2010, having initially presented to Concord Hospital, the accused was referred to the Hills Private Hospital where she was seen by Dr Manambrakkat (Ex M1 p. 17, Ex M2). Dr Manambrakkat obtained a history from the accused which included reference to OB's skin tags, as well as the accused's fear that OB was suffering from some genetic abnormality (Ex M1 p.23).

105Dr Manambrakkat concluded that the accused's mood was depressed, and that she had significant anxiety. However, he stated that she was neither psychotic nor suicidal. He diagnosed an adjustment disorder with depressed mood and prescribed Avanza (Ex M1 p. 21-22). He explained (Ex M1 p. 22) that the accused ""was facing a stress and was responding to, adjusting to that, in perhaps a maladaptive way"". 

106Dr Manambrakkat saw the accused the following day, 20 October 2010. The accused said that she was feeling better and was keen to leave hospital because she felt guilty about leaving OB at home (Ex M1 p. 25). The accused also expressed the feeling that her mental state would improve with the support of family and friends (Ex M1 p. 25). Dr Manambrakkat concluded that the accused's anxiety was improved and she was discharged from hospital (Ex M1 p. 26).

The notification of the test results - 26 October 2010 
107On 26 October 2010, Ms Shalhoub told the accused that the CGH array tests had been reported as normal. Ms Shalhoub stated that the accused seemed ""surprised"" when given this information (Ex K para. 13). The accused told Ms Shalhoub that she had not bothered to attend any further psychiatric appointments because she ""felt OK"" (Ex H1 para. 28). 

108SG gave evidence of the accused being informed of the final test results (commencing at T38 L23):

""... it was Friday I remember. I don't remember the date. It was about almost a week prior to accident. And she said to me she rang me, ""Mum"" she said, ""Mum, guess what. There is really good news."" Baby OB's results came like okay, good. It was good news. She was excited about it. And I said, ""MB, yes, there is nothing to worry. Baby OB has been normal. She's all right."" 


109RB said that he and the accused were walking in a park when they learned of the final test results (T30 L23-25). He described the accused's reaction as being one of ""relief"" (T21 L20-22) and said that they were ""quite happy"" (T30 L25). RB said that from that time until the time of OB's death the accused ""seemed okay""(T21 L24-26). He described her (T21 L30-31) as being ""a bit more relaxed; ...still coming to terms with it all, but ...she was getting better"".

The seventh consultation with Dr James - 28 October 2010
110Dr James saw OB on 28 October 2010, at which time she was 6 months of age. He noted that the accused was more relaxed and that she felt OB was ""normal"". Dr James arranged an ophthalmological consultation due to the presence of allergic conjunctivitis and tried to reassure the accused and RB that he felt that OB was normal. He recommended a review one month later (Ex F1 para. 14). 

The three week period leading up to OB's death 
111RB said that when he and the accused learned of the final test results, the accused had started ""weaning off"" her medication, to the point where she had completely stopped it by the week of 12 November 2010 (Ex A para. 12). He said that during the days leading up to OB's death things had been ""going perfectly"" and that the accused had ""been feeling better"" (Ex A para. 13). He referred, in particular, to the accused being busy with preparations for OB's Baptism which was to take place on 12 December 2010. Such observations were consistent with those of SG who said that the accused was ""very organised"" in respect of those preparations, that she was variously in a ""good mood"" and that everything was ""normal"" (Ex B paras.15 to 18). However, that part of SG's evidence was somewhat at odds with her oral evidence (commencing at T 39 L15) that despite being informed of the results, the accused's concerns did not dissipate and that her level of anxiety between June and October 2010 was constantly severe (T36 L46-T37 L4). 

112There is evidence which tends to establish that the accused continued to have concerns about OB, notwithstanding that all test results had been reported as normal. Ms Di Nunzio gave evidence of a telephone conversation she had with the accused in late October/early November 2010 (T77 L30-50) in which the accused continued to refer to the fact that there was ""something wrong"" with OB. Ms Di Nunzio said: 

""And I said to her, ""Look"" I was kind of getting not upset but I was getting not kind of fed up to calm her down and tell her that look, it's not it can't be anything serious like cancer or a terminal illness. And she turned around and said, ""Well, look, you know, sometimes it's better to deal with a terminal illness than to live with a dwarf for the rest of your life.""


113Shortly after this conversation, Ms Di Nunzio hosted a Melbourne Cup function at her home, which the accused attended without OB (T76 L16-30). Ms Di Nunzio said that the accused gave the appearance of being ""on another planet"", and ""very preoccupied with something"" on that day (T76 L42-43; T81 L25-29). She described her as being coherent (T82 L6) and able to maintain, and engage in, conversation (T82 L10-14) but explained that she ""just kind of gazed"" without making eye contact (T82 L23-39) and appeared ""like medicated or just her mind was elsewhere"" (T84 L10). Ms Di Nunzio also said (T77 L8-10) that the accused remarked, in reference to another baby who was present, that the baby was ""normal"". 

114Ms Di Nunzio also gave evidence that the accused had said she was receiving assistance from her mother because of an inability to cope. However, she explained that this was not so much an inability on the part of the accused to cope with OB because she was a new born baby, but rather an inability to cope with what the accused perceived were OB's imperfections (T83 L23-37):

"". ... she felt she didn't even want to look at (OB) or pick her up. There was nothing really else about, you know, her domestic life or anything else that she wasn't coping with. Nothing about her marriage or it was just more so that it felt like she really didn't say anything positive about it was like she was disattaching herself from her from her daughter ... not so much not coping with the baby. She wasn't she was just preoccupied with the test results. It wasn't nothing to do with coping with the baby itself.""

115On 16 November 2010, which was only two days prior to OB's death, Ms Dinov visited the accused at her home. She explained (T115 L26-48):

""I arrived and I wanted a drink and it was just suggested that we have some champagne and she started speaking and I noticed that she was very emotional and she was talking about OB, her concerns. I am just trying to think because there was so much that happened, and she was talking about OB not fitting into her perfect family and suggesting that she throw or jump with OB over a cliff or throw her in a bin. 

Q. When MB was talking about jumping over a cliff or throwing OB into a bin, how did she appear? 
A. I can't remember. 

Q. At the time of this meeting from your conversations with MB do you know if there were still outstanding tests for OB or whether they had all finished?
A. I think they were all finished and they came back normal, so I remember, sorry as well, getting a bit upset with MB as to why she was still concerned about her and why she wasn't moving on with her life. 

Q. Was there anything said by MB about observations she had made of any other children? 
A. Yes, she was talking about how she would see ferrals, in the park, and how can they have normal children and why, what did she do to deserve this child, why God punished her."" 


116Ms Dinov's recollection that these things were said by the accused after all test results had been returned accords with the evidence before me that the last test results (being the CGH array) were returned on 26 October 2010. 

117When asked about her observations of MB on 16 November 2010 Ms Dinov said (T118 L26 - T119 L8):

""A. Well I think she was getting worse because the two days prior to OB dying I had never seen her like that before as I had seen her that day. She was saying, like it struck me, so when I left there I was really concerned and I have never been like that concerned prior. I mean I knew she was like, she was speaking about it, and like obviously it was a major distraction, it preoccupied her mind, but not like the two days prior to the death. ... I didn't quite understand. Like the tests came back positive, yet she was still greatly concerned about something being wrong with OB, like to the point, like I remember saying things like ""you have to snap out of this"" because how could she possibly be a wife or a mother, a mother, if she is continuing to worry about stuff that's not worthy about being worried. I mean there was nothing wrong from the tests, so I couldn't quite understand. 

...

Q. Yes, on the 16 November did it seem to you that MB was becoming more and more obsessed with these problems? 
A. Yes, definitely. 

Q. And you were very alarmed? 
A. Well, yeah, I was concerned, yep."" 

118Ms Dinov gave evidence that when she saw the accused on 16 November the accused expressed concern about OB achieving her developmental milestones. Ms Dinov demonstrated a leg exercise which the accused could perform on OB. She recalled the accused dragging OB across the floor when performing that exercise and telling her to be more gentle (T 116 L11-20). 

119The evidence of the accused's presentation in the three week period leading up to OB's death is, in one sense, difficult to reconcile. On the one hand, observations of RB and SG indicate an improvement. On the other hand, the evidence of Ms Dinov, which was not challenged, reflects the continuing anxiety of the accused about OB's condition and, more importantly, an expressed desire to be rid of her. 

120As discussed further below, the medical evidence establishes that the accused's mental state fluctuated, and that she could function better on some occasions than on others. In my view, that is reflected in the evidence of RB, SG and Ms Dinov about the accused's presentation in the period leading up to OB's death, particularly as that evidence related to the accused organising OB's Baptism. What is clear however, is that only two days before OB's death, the accused was anxious, and had expressed a desire to be rid of OB, by jumping with her or throwing her from a cliff, or by throwing her in a bin.

The events of 18 November 2010
121On the morning of 18 November 2010 RB left for work at about 8.30 am. He did not see any injuries to OB when he left (T23 L28-35). 

122The accused made a call to 000 which was received at approximately 12:10pm by an operator, Jessie Fraser (Ex P p. 4). The recording of the call (Ex Q1) was played in the hearing and a transcript of the conversation was tendered (Ex Q2). The call extends for more than 10 minutes. Whilst I do not propose to set out the entirety of what was said, the following observations are relevant.

123Firstly, from the outset of the conversation, the accused sounded obviously distraught and upset. Her first words to Ms Fraser were:

""My daughter, she is in the bath, she's six months old. I left her in there just to get to the shampoos and she fell out of that seat. Please...""

124Secondly, it is apparent from what was said in the course of the conversation that in making the call the accused was not speaking from within the bathroom. So much is clear from (inter alia) the fact that the accused told Ms Fraser (Ex Q2 p. 1) that she was not with OB at the time. 

125Thirdly, Ms Fraser made numerous requests to the accused to retrieve OB from the bath. These requests were renewed by a colleague of Ms Fraser who I infer was her supervisor, and whose assistance was sought part way through the conversation. On each occasion the accused replied with words to the effect:

""I can't go in there.""

126Ricky Knox, an ambulance officer, received a call to attend the accused's premises at about 12:12pm. He arrived at about 12.16 pm (Ex R1 para. 7). Because the call that he received had made reference to submersion, Mr Knox initially looked for a swimming pool at the premises. When he ascertained that there was no swimming pool, he went into the house and walked into the bathroom where he saw OB prone in the water with her head submerged (Ex R1 para. 10). At that point Mr Knox shouted (Ex R1 para. 10):

""They haven't even got the baby out of the fucking bath.""

127Mr Knox said (Ex R1 para. 10) that he could not remember the temperature of the water but that its depth was twice that of OB, about 15 to 20 cms. He described the position of OB as follows (Ex R1 para. 10):

""The child's hands were down into the water, bent from the elbows. The child's feet were touching the bottom of the bath, but the child's head and body were definitely floating. The child's head was facing the front of the house. The child's body was in the right hand end of the bath, this is the end closest to the front door of the house. I also noticed something in the bath behind the child but I didn't take any notice what it was. The object was almost the same size of a child. I can't remember anything about the object, I just remember something being there. I would describe the bath-tub as being tiled in and not free standing. I remember it being a light colour, maybe white or cream.""

128Photographs 48 and 49 in Ex AA show the Bumbo seat floating in the bath. This is obviously the ""object"" to which Mr Knox was referring.

129With the assistance of another officer, Mr Knox commenced two finger compression CPR. OB showed no signs of life. An intensive care crew then arrived and treated OB. 

130The unchallenged opinion of Professor Cass (Ex AX) is that it takes approximately four to six minutes for an infant to die from drowning. In the present case, a period of approximately six minutes elapsed between the time at which the 000 call was received (12.12 pm) and the time at which Mr Knox arrived (12.16 pm) and found OB in the bath with no sign of life.

131After the arrival of the intensive care crew Mr Knox had a conversation with the accused in which she said (Ex R1 para. 16):

""... 'I went to get wash cloths and a tracksuit, when I came back I saw her face down in the bath tub. I could not go back in.' 

132Mr Knox said that the accused had made no reference to fainting or collapsing and had said words to the effect (Ex R2 para. 4):

""I went to go get a tracksuit and when I came back she was face down.""

133Mr Knox was accompanied by another officer, Lania Morgan. Ms Morgan noticed that when taking the accused's pulse at the scene, the sleeve of the right arm of the shirt that she was wearing was wet (Ex. S para. 27).

134Dorothy Apps, the accused's next door neighbour, was present when ambulance officers arrived. She said (Ex V1 para. 10) that when an ambulance officer asked the accused what had happened the accused replied:

""I was bathing the baby. I wanted to get a couple of things.""

135RB later received a message from Mrs Apps to make contact urgently (Ex A paras. 16; 18). 

136Later analysis of blood samples taken from the accused did not indicate the presence of anti-depressant medication, but did indicate the presence of the components of Xanax, a drug used to treat anxiety. The unchallenged expert evidence is that when making the 000 call the accused was not impaired by that (or any other) medication (Ex AZ1 para. 8).

OB's arrival at hospital
137OB was brought in by ambulance to the Emergency Department of Concord Hospital at 12:31pm (Ex U). She was immediately triaged to the resuscitation area. A history was taken that she had been found immersed in water in a bath, in full cardiorespiratory arrest with no palpable pulse (Ex U para. 4). CPR was continued. Dr Paoloni, an emergency physician, found no vital signs. He saw no physical or traumatic injuries evident and could detect no signs of any underlying illness (Ex T para. 4). Endotracheal intubation was performed and OB was given adrenalin. There was no response to resuscitative efforts, and OB's life was pronounced extinct at 12:56pm (Ex U para. 4).

The accused's admission to hospital
138At 1:15pm on 18 November 2010 the accused was assessed by Dr Snars, the medical superintendent of the Concord Centre for Mental Health, assisted by Drs Vandenberg and Eagle (T130 L10 - T131 L8). 

139Dr Snars transferred the accused to ""Manning East"", an acute psychiatric unit specifically for women in need of a high level of mental health care (T131 L15-42). The accused was observed to be ""extremely distressed and uncommunicative"" at the time (T131 L44-47) which gave rise to concerns for her safety and the possibility of suicide (T132 L3-4).

140Upon her admission to Manning East, the accused was classified as an involuntary patient on the basis of depression, and concerns about her safety (T132 L6-9). On 2 December 2010 her status was changed to that of a voluntary patient, she having been co-operative with treatment in the intervening period (T132 L11-21). Between 2 December 2010 and 30 December 2010 the accused was allowed to take periods of leave. At the time of her discharge on 30 December 2011, a follow up through the Croydon Community Mental Health Team was recommended (T132 L19-31). Dr Snars explained that after her admission, the accused's condition had improved at a rate consistent with what would be expected of a person who had been hospitalised and placed on treatment (T138 L40-50).

141Nurse Carol Fitzsimons spoke with the accused at the time of her admission into Manning East. At that time the accused was accompanied by RB and was observed to be responding to questions with monosyllabic answers (T150 L49 - T151 L8). RB remained with the accused for some time. After he left to go home, the accused became distressed and was crying, indicating that ""she wanted her baby back"". She was administered a relaxant at that time, which produced a settling effect (T151 L10-31). 

142By reference to her clinical notes, Ms Fitzsimons recounted her conversation with the accused at that time (T151 L46 - T152 L5):

""(She) stated that everything felt like a dream. We were all very happy. She talked about giving OB a bath because she had given her some banana and she had made a mess on her chest. She said she placed her baby in the baby bath chair and stated 'I thought she was safe'. She went to get a face flannel and when she came back she found OB face down in the bath. She stated 'I couldn't pick her up, why didn't I pick her up?', and repeated this a few times. She also talked about the genetic tests that had been done on OB. She stated they all turned out to be normal. She stated that she had been quite stressed when these tests were ongoing but had actually reduced her medication because everything was okay.""

143The accused told Ms Fitzsimons that she had previously been prescribed anti-depressant medication and Xanax. She told Ms Fitzsimons that ""it (didn't) feel real"" (T52 L7-14). Although in cross-examination Ms Fitzsimons said (T152 L29) that the accused had said that she ""had stopped taking"" her medication after the test results in respect of OB had been returned, she agreed in re-examination, by reference to her notes, that the accused had in fact said that she had ""reduced her medication"" without going into further detail.

144Dr Snars diagnosed the accused with major depression (T137 L47 - T138 L4). Although the history obtained suggested that the condition was pre-existing, Dr Snars had no information available concerning the accused's mental health immediately prior to her admission (T138 L8-21). He explained that any pre-existing major depression would have been exacerbated by the trauma of OB's death (T138 L32-38). 

145Although he considered other possible diagnoses, Dr Snars found no evidence of any psychiatric disorder other than major depression (T139 L24-35; T140 L1-3). He acknowledged that the symptoms of major depression could be referable to a deeper underlying condition such as schizophrenia (T143 L23 - T144 L41). However, he said (T140 L6-14) that the accused was capable of providing a coherent account of events and did not manifest signs of psychosis.

146Dr Snars agreed that in respect of schizophrenic and delusional conditions of a high order, it was frequently the case that a patient would give a number of different and inconsistent accounts in respect of particular matters (T145 L33-37). However, he stated that in his treatment of the accused, she was able to give a history of what had been occurring for the duration of OB's life. Dr Snars did not detect any inability on the part of the accused to give a consistent account and he detected nothing which suggested a shift in her internal sense of reality (T149 L19-29).

The post mortem examination of OB - 19 November 2010
147Dr Van Vuuren conducted a post mortem examination of OB on the morning of 19 November 2010. In her report she stated (inter alia) (Ex N p. 2-3):

""External post mortem examination did not show features of dwarfism. There was evidence of medical intervention. Small abrasions were present on the face and back of the head.""

148Under the heading of ""Evidence of injury"" (Ex N p. 5) Dr Van Vuuren noted (inter alia) the following:

""1. There was a 10 x 2mm abrasion on the right frontal area of the head.
2. There was an abrasion in the right ear which measured approximately 7 x 1mm.
3. There were 2 abrasions in the left ear which measured approximately 7mm.
4. ...
5. ...
6. ...
7. Several scratches were present on the back of the head. The largest measured 10 x 2mm and they measured approximately 30 x 20mm in total.
8. ...
9. ...""

149Photographs of OB (Ex O) demonstrate the injuries referred to in (7) above. 

150Dr Van Vuuren said (T121 L30 - T122 L5) that the physiology of a 6 month old baby was such that it was unlikely that the injuries in (1) and (7) had been inflicted by OB herself. She was unable to state what caused them, but said that their appearance was consistent with having been caused by a fingernail. In her opinion, they were ante mortem (T123 L13-15; T124 L25). Whilst Dr Van Vuuren agreed that it was possible for the injuries to have been caused in the course of administering CPR treatment (T124 L16) she reiterated that the appearance of the injuries was consistent with them being ante mortem. In these circumstances she did not think that the injuries had been caused as a result of treatment administered to OB by ambulance officers (T124 L25-28).

151Dr Van Vuuren agreed that she was not able to determine that OB was drowned by anyone, or that her death was the result of ""foul play"" (T124 L5-9). Whilst that is relevant, it must be emphasised that Dr Van Vuuren was giving evidence in relation to a single aspect of the circumstantial case relied upon by the Crown. For the reasons I have set out more fully below, I must have regard to the entirety of the circumstances, not just one. 

152Dr Collins, a consultant Forensic Pathologist, was called in the accused's case to express opinions regarding (inter alia) the post-mortem examination and the cause of the injuries found by Dr Van Vuuren. Dr Collins was not present at the post mortem examination. Accordingly, he did not view the actual injuries. For the purposes of expressing his opinions, he relied on the same photographs as those in Ex O, which are colour photocopies. 

153Dr Collins candidly acknowledged the limitations which are placed upon any expert who comes (as he put it) ""second-hand to a case"" (T292 L33-36; T294 L32-40). It was expressly accepted by counsel for the accused (T291 L26) that there was no difference between the photographs in Ex O and the photographs upon which Dr Collins based his opinion. Dr Collins described those photographs as being ""of less than optimal forensic quality"" (T295 L9-10). He later agreed that they were of ""inferior quality"" (T297 L1-3). Dr Collins also confirmed that unlike Dr Van Vuuren, he had not had access to digital photographs or microscopic slides (T295 L25-34). Despite all of these matters, Dr Collins thought that there was ""no real difficulty in the interpretation of (the) injuries"" (T295 L3-4).

154Dr Collins described the injuries as being ""blunt force ... scratch abrasions"" (T289 L43-49) which were consistent with having been caused by a fingernail (T297 L5-9). He found no evidence of any particular injury which was consistent with OB having been drowned by way of forceful immersion under the water (T289 L22-26), although he expressly acknowledged that a person may be forcefully drowned in a way which leaves no evidence of injury at all (T289 L31-35).

155Dr Collins expressed the view that OB's injuries were either ante mortem or perimortem and were ""fresh"", by which he meant that they could have been anything up to 1 to 2 days in age. He explained that the term ""perimortem"" meant ""at or around the time of death"" (T289 L5-12; T295 L47-T296 L16). He reiterated that the injuries had not, in his opinion, been caused ""hours after death"" and that they could have occurred ""at or about the time of the death or hurt"" (T296 L15-22). In circumstances where Dr Van Vuuren had expressed the opinion that the injuries were ante mortem, Dr Collins, thought that she was ""largely saying ... to some extent ... what I am saying"" (T296 L26-29).

156Both Dr Collins and Dr Van Vuuren agreed that the injuries were consistent with having been caused by a fingernail. The principal difference in their opinions (such as it is) concerns the time at which the injuries were sustained. The unequivocal evidence of Dr Van Vuuren (T123 L14-16) was that the injuries were ante mortem, or in other words occasioned prior to OB's death. Whilst she conceded the possibility in cross-examination (T124 L11-16) that the injuries were caused in the course of CPR treatment, she confirmed in re-examination that the appearance of the injuries indicated that they were not caused in that way. 

157I accept the opinion of Dr Van Vuuren in this regard and am satisfied that the injuries were occasioned prior to OB's death. Whilst Dr Van Vuuren could not say how long before OB's death the injuries were caused, I do not accept the opinion of Dr Collins that it could have been anything up to one to two days prior. For the reasons I have set out, Dr Collins was at a clear disadvantage in expressing his opinions. Further, his opinion that the injuries could have been inflicted days prior is completely inconsistent with the unchallenged evidence of RB, which I accept, that he saw no injuries to OB's head when he left for work on the morning of 18 November 2010.

The police investigation and interview with the accused
158Detective Bozikis and Detective Muir attended Concord Hospital on the afternoon of 18 November 2010 where they saw the accused. Detective Bozikis observed (Ex W para. 5) that the accused was unresponsive and tearful at that time. 

159RB arrived at the hospital at about 2:05pm. He said (Ex A para. 19):

""When I walked in (the accused) was asleep. I tried to wake her up at first but she would not open her eyes. She just started crying and stayed quiet. I could barely get anything out of her other than she told me 'it was an accident'.

I said 'What happened possum?'

(She) said 'I wanted to give her a bath. I left her in the chair; I went to go get a jumpsuit.'

As soon as I heard this I realised that she had left OB in the bath. She got distracted and left her in the bath. (She) mentioned that she was playing with her ducks.""


160Police were present when the accused said to RB (Ex W para. 12):

""It was an accident - I wanted to give her a bath. I left her in the chair and went to go get a towel...""

161When police spoke with the accused and asked her what had happened she replied (Ex W para. 14):

""I've never washed her before, my mobile rang, I took her out and wrapped her in a towel. Put her back in, wanted a second face towel. So I went to the cupboard but I wanted a harder one, I went to her room and at the bottom drawer grabbed one. When I came back she was already in the water.""

162When asked whether, at that point, she touched OB, the accused responded:

""No, I couldn't"".

163The conversation continued (Ex X2):

""Bozikis: Do you want to ask me anything before we go
Accused: (No response)

Bozikis: Can I ask you one more question about the mobile phone? MB did the mobile phone ring once or twice? Do you remember that?
Accused: I don't remember.

Bozikis: You don't remember. When it rang the first time, did you pick OB up? You know your mobile number (sic) phone when you told me that it rang, who actually was ringing you? Do you remember who it was?
Accused: The lady from work.

Bozikis: The lady from work. What's her name?
Accused: Um Julie Stockton.

Bozikis: Sorry Julie.
Accused: Julie.

Bozikis: Ok. And then the second time, did the phone ring a second time or was it just the once?
Accused: (INAUDIBLE)

Bozikis: You don't remember. Ok. When the phone rang with Julie where was OB?
Accused: (No response).

Bozikis: Ok, alright, that's ok.""

164A summary of telephone records (Ex Y) shows an incoming call from Julie Stockton of 13 seconds duration at 11:34:07. The phone records also show an incoming text message from Ms Stockton at 11:34:49. 

165Police conducted a search of the accused's premises. Numerous photographs of the premises form part of Exs Z and AA. A DVD of the accused's premises taken by police on 21 February 2011 is Exhibit AK and a plan of the premises is Ex. AB. Senior Constable Tancred is seen on Ex AK walking from the bathroom to various positions within the premises, firstly by doing so at what was described as a ""normal pace of walking"" and secondly at a slightly faster pace. In each case, two timings were recorded (the first being the time at normal pace and the second at a faster pace):

(b)from the bathroom to OB's bedroom and back again:

a. 12.3 seconds
b. 11.2 seconds

(c)from the bathroom to the main bedroom and back again:

a. 17.9 seconds
b. 13.8 seconds

(d)from the bathroom to the second bedroom and back again:

a. 16.8 seconds
b. 12.9 seconds

(e)from the bathroom to the kitchen and back again:

a. 18.2 seconds
b. 15.0 seconds

(f)from the bathroom to the basket in the lounge room and back again:

a. 13.1 seconds
b. 9.5 seconds

(g)from the bathroom to the laundry and back again:

a. 26.7 seconds
b. 20.4 seconds

(h)from the bathroom to the clothes dryer in the garage and back again:

a. 29.9 seconds
b. 25.5 seconds

(i)from the bathroom to the OB's room and then to the main bedroom and back again:

a. 27.6 seconds
b. 22.7 seconds

(j)from the bathroom to OB's room to the washing basked in the lounge room and back again:

a. 23.2 seconds
b. 18.2 seconds

(k)from the bathroom to the main bedroom to the washing basket and back again:

a. 25.0 seconds 
b. 21.7 seconds

(l)from the bathroom to OB's room to the washing basket to the laundry and back again:

a. 38. 9 seconds
b. 31.9 seconds

166On 17 February 2011 police received a document headed ""Statement"" signed by the accused and dated that same day (T188 L37 - T189 L9; Ex AJ). The statement is in the following terms:

'My full name is (MB). I am 35 years old. I married RB on 25 August 2007.
RB and I had our first child, our daughter OB, on 21 April 2010. 
On 18 November 2010 our daughter died when she drowned in the bath. I called the ambulance.
My husband and I have been greatly traumatised by OB's death. 
As a result of this trauma and my grief I just cannot talk to police about this awful (sic) accident. 
After I was approached by the police I sought legal advice. The lawyers have advised me not to make any further statement to the police or to agree to be interviewed.

(signed) MB 17/2/11""

The accused's arrest
167The accused was arrested and charged with OB's murder on 6 May 2011. When informed that she was under arrest for murder the accused responded (Ex W para. 45):

""Murder, I didn't murder her, it was an accident.""

168At that time Detective Bozikis was informed that when searching the property, Detective Tancred had located a number of documents inside the zipper pocket of the accused's black handbag (T192 L3-7; Exs AL1 and AL2). One of those documents (Ex AL1) is a statement in the handwriting of the accused headed ""My statement"". It is in the following terms:



â-Woke & took Xanax and Luvox as I was feeling depressed as RB & I had an argument the night before. 
Â 
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Fed OB in her chair & then was going to have a play with her in the bath & wash her down. It was the first bath I had given her as RB said to give her a bath the night before.
Â 
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  My Mum From memory i missed a call from my Mum so i sent her a text telling her to come over in the afternoon as i wanted to get OB bathed & immunised.
Â 
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Put OB in the bath & played with her rubber duckies & washed her down with water. 
Â 
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  mobile Phone rang & i picked up OB out of bath & wrapped her in her towel & walked into our bedroom. I missed a call from my Manager Julie Stockton. I started writing her a text back saying Iâd call back later but decided to clear the message & thought Iâd just call her back later.
Â 
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Walked back into the bath with OB.
Â 
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Heard a beep & a car â thought it maybe my Mum â took OB out of the bath, wrapped her in towelÂ  walked into the spare room to see if it was my mum. However it was not her so i went back to the bath & put OB in there.
Â 
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Heard the phone ring in the lounge room & left OB in bathroom with her duckies.Â  
Â 
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Walked to phone, picked it up & then fainted (sic) & fell to the ground.
Â 
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  When i woke up i jumped up & went towards the bathroom in a panic & then stopped. OB was not sitting upright in her chair & she was not making any noise. I fainted & fell to the ground 
Â 
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  When i got up i dialled 000 & walked outside as I couldnât think straight. I did not know CPR.
Â 
-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I begged the ambulance officer to please help me â please help me as i did not want to see her like that. The ambulance officer asked me to go and get OB out of the chair & to pull the plug out of the bath. I said i could not do it. i did not want to see her like that.
Â

169The remaining documents found (Ex AL2) are notes which are, in effect a draft form of the statement set out above. When spoken to by police the accused admitted that the statement was in her handwriting (Ex AM1 at p. 4).


The further statement of the accused
170On 2 December 2012 the accused presented at Burwood Police Station asking to see Detective Bozikis, who was on leave at the time. The accused spoke with Constable Halteh (Ex AN) and provided a further statement (Ex AO). The document, which is dated 2 October 2012 and signed by the accused, is in the following terms:

""Woke and felt unwell - very sleepy. 

Took Xanax and anti-depressant - did not have breakfast.

Fed OB

Gave her a bath

Put her in the bath seat

Heard car/noises/voices in my head - I thought it was my Mum coming over.

Took her out of bath seat and wrapped her in towel.

Went into spare room to see if Mum - not her in driveway

Put her back in bath seat = I felt very dizzy

Phone rang = picked her up - walked into our bedroom - mobile phone had rung out - missed call = went back into bathroom and put her in seat

Phone rang again = home phone - answered it = overseas call - call finished - heard voices in my head = felt dizzy = laid on the floor as it was cold = don't know how long = vision blurry.

Got up and went back to the bathroom and she had fallen out of seat = no movement.

Blanked out - got up and called 000 = could not go back in

Looked for keys everywhere as door at front was locked = ambulance came = not sure what happened afterwards = blank""

The accused's internet searches
171In the course of the search of the accused's premises, police seized two laptop computers along with a USB stick. The two laptop computers were examined and their internet histories recovered. A spreadsheet was prepared in respect of one of those computers showing a complete history of internet sites visited by its browser. A total of 65,536 events are listed on that spreadsheet comprising searches, website history and other recorded internal computer activity (Ex AP para. 7). Detective Bozikis reviewed the history in total and attempted to open all of the internet browser history links. Some of those links were a direct result of a search conducted via ""Google"" whilst others were the result of typing an actual website address or URL link (Ex AP para. 8). Amongst the topics searched were genetic abnormalities, ailments and treatments (Ex AP para. 9; Ex AQ). 

172Allan Watt, an electronic evidence specialist with the NSW Police Force State Electronic Evidence Branch examined a forensic copy of the hard discs taken from the laptop computers seized from the accused's premises. In the course of his examination of one of those discs, Mr Watt was able to recover a large amount of internet history. At para. 15 of Ex AQ Mr Watt stated the following:

""Some of the searches conducted were to locate pictures of children with dwarfism and other similar deformities. These searches and other websites visited returned a large number of photos of deformed children. These pictures have been extracted as have the relevant files metadata, to inform on when they were created on the computer.

...

(17) When a file is deleted on a computer, the data that was once within the file, now forms the mass of the computer's ""unallocated clusters"". The unallocated clusters is an unstructured part of the computer's drive, that houses the space where new files can be saved and written to, which is the same place where data is located that has been deleted and not yet overwritten. This deleted data can sometimes be extracted and re-formulated back into the original file, this is known as data carving. If the files are fragmented or deleted in such a way that the entire file cannot be recovered, then often fragments of the original file can be located and subsequently extracted. The way to locate the text of data that may be of interest is to conduct key words searches. In this case the following key words were used:

*drown
*death
*infanticide
*suffocate
*sids
*sudden infant death
*terminate
*poison
*asphyxiat (sic)
*smother

From these searches some text fragments were located, book marked and extracted.""

173The text fragments which were located and extracted are set out in annexure D to Mr Watt's statement of 30 August 2011 which forms part of Ex AQ. The text fragments include the following:

(i)""ISR-seeks-2-prevent-babies-and-children-from-drowning"";
(ii)""Date: 28 June 2010 Section: Leading Articles, Source: No"", Title: Drowning and sudden cardiac death"";
(iii)""Opinion: when does abortion become infanticide?""
(iv)""11-Month-baby-boy-suffocates-in-east-Pattaya"";

(viii)""Is+it+legal+to+terminate+a+dwarf+pregnancy+at+30+weeks+gestation"";
(ix)""Asphyxiating""+thoracic+dysplasia""

The conversations recorded by listening device
174In the course of the investigation police installed listening devices in the homes of the accused and her mother. A number of the conversations recorded by use of those devices have been tendered in evidence (Exs AC1 to AH 1) along with accompanying transcripts (Exs AC2 to AH2). Whilst I do not propose to set out the entirety of that evidence, the following aspects of it are significant. 

175In part of the conversation in Ex AG1, the accused is recorded as saying the following (commencing at p. 5 of Ex AG2):

""If he never mentioned frontal bossing she would have been alive today. I'll tell you that now. That for me was the final straw because I stopped having dreams about dwarfs and now I was dreaming her head was growing and growing and I was obsessing about her head, it was freaking me out. And her nose that little bridge and I thought my God there's so many, I just knew something wasn't right and I thought that's it"" (my emphasis). 

176Later, at p. 9 of Ex AG2 the accused is recorded as saying:

""Like I didn't have a chance to bond with my child and that's the reality"".

177In part of the conversation in Ex AH 1 the accused is recorded as saying the following (commencing at p. 10 of Ex AH2):

""But it's just a tragedy. Fuck, I wish I never even had that baby, I wish I never even fell pregnant""(my emphasis).

THE EXPERT PSYCHIATRIC EVIDENCE
Professor Greenberg
178Professor Greenberg was called in the Crown case. He saw the accused on three occasions, namely 4 April 2013, 5 April 2013 and 1 February 2014. He provided three reports dated 18 May 2013 (Ex AT1), 10 July 2013 (Ex AT2), and 1 February 2014 (Ex AT3).

179In Ex AT1 Professor Greenberg set out a lengthy history obtained from the accused. This included references to hearing loud noises in her head (Ex AT1 p. 5). No such history had been given to any other medical practitioner at any previous time. The history also included a reference to the fact that ""her thinking had stopped"". 

180Following his examination of the accused on 4 April 2013, Dr Greenberg (Ex AT1 p. 22) diagnosed the accused as suffering from the late onset of a schizophrenic disorder, which had been precipitated by the stresses of her pregnancy, the birth of OB and the postpartum period. He said (Ex AT1 p. 23):

""I am of the opinion that MB suffers from a major psychiatric illness (mental illness), namely a Schizophrenic Disorder. MB's presentation is somewhat atypical in that she presented with acute characteristic psychotic symptoms of her schizophrenic illness after the death of her baby OB. MB was aged 37 years old (late onset schizophrenic disorder) at that time. After the birth of her child and prior to the alleged offence, the diagnosis was not overtly apparent during her presentation in 2010. Subsequently after the alleged offence, and repeatedly being admitted to the Concord Hospital, her clinical condition has now become overtly apparent to her treating specialist psychiatrist.

Only over time has MB's schizophrenic disorder (a type of psychotic disorder) has (sic) deteriorated to a point in time when her presentation was a frank psychotic episode.""

181At page 24 of Ex AT1 Professor Greenberg concluded:

""I am of the opinion that MB presented with an initial prodromal state prior to the alleged offence and subsequently since the alleged offence, has continued to present with prodromal or residual continuous signs and symptoms of her schizophrenic symptoms (Reference: Compton 2007 and Bechdolf 2012). These include thought perseveration or obsessive thinking about her daughter's perceived genetic abnormalities. She also reported thought blockage where she felt that her thoughts were absent from her head. She described this symptoms (sic) as her ""thinking had stopped"", and her ""thoughts would go blank"".

182Professor Greenberg said that the accused's differing accounts of the events of 18 November 2010 could be explained on a number of bases (Ex AT1 p. 26). Although he accepted that those bases included the possibility that the accused had been untruthful, Professor Greenberg thought it more likely that she suffered from a major psychiatric illness, characterised by ""thought blocking"" which caused her thoughts to stop or go blank. Irrespective of the explanation, Professor Greenberg was of the view that the fact that the accused had given varying accounts was consistent with someone suffering from prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia, characterised by (inter alia) thought blocking, dysphoric mood, heightened anxiety and poor concentration. He thought that such prodromal symptoms also explained the accused's reluctance to follow the directions of the 000 operator to remove OB from the bath. 

183In Ex AT2, Professor Greenberg confirmed his opinion that at the time of the alleged offence MB was suffering from prodromal symptoms of a schizophrenic illness. However, he did not consider that she had a defence of mental illness available to her (Ex AT2 p. 5; T 213 L 18-29; T 227 L22-27). Professor Greenberg went on to say (Ex AT2 p. 8):

""I am of the view that MB had a predisposition to develop a schizophrenic (psychotic disorder). This disorder was precipitated by the adjustment stresses associated around the time of the birth of her child; the post-partum period. I am of the opinion that she did not have a pre-existing condition because she had not, at that time, presented with symptoms of an acute episode of her Schizophrenic Disorder. Any possible symptoms could only have been prodromal in nature.""

184In Ex AT3, Professor Greenberg confirmed his earlier diagnosis and made a number of observations regarding the accused's fitness to stand trial.

185When giving evidence, Professor Greenberg acknowledged (T205 L48 - T206 L6) that he did not meet with the accused until more than 2 years after OB's death and that in these circumstances, he relied upon both written material with which he had been provided, and the accused's account of events. He explained that his opinions were based on ""a longitudinal as well as a cross-sectional vertical assessment"" of the accused. He agreed that the death of OB was a significant trauma that precipitated a decline in the accused's mental health (T207 L23-26). 

186Professor Greenberg agreed (T207 L28-33) that to some extent he was limited by only having had the opportunity to meet the accused in 2013. However, he added (T207 L31-33) that in view of his particular skills in forensic psychiatry, he was able to look at the accused's entire longitudinal presentation to assist him in arriving at a concluded opinion. Professor Greenberg acknowledged (T207 L35-43) that there was some difficulty in this approach because it could not be determined that the illness manifested itself on a specific date. However, he expressed the firm view that the accused was suffering significant anxiety prior to OB's death (T208 L18-23). 

187Professor Greenberg was referred to that part of the accused's history that between June and October 2010 she was not caring for herself properly and was (inter alia) not washing her hair, and was crying each day. He was made aware of evidence given in this hearing (to which I have referred) that the accused was maintaining her appearance. He did not agree that this was suggestive of the accused having been less than frank with him (T209 L7-27), describing her as someone who had a disturbed mental state.

188Professor Greenberg was then taken to evidence relating to the accused's preparations for OB's Baptism which was to take place in December 2010. When asked whether this suggested that the accused was exaggerating her level of incapacity when providing her history, Professor Greenberg could not express a definitive view. He did acknowledge however (T212 L1-17) that people who suffer from schizophrenia maintain the capacity to function and perform activities. This was particularly so in the case of the accused, whose illness had not deteriorated to the point of a frank psychosis. He explained (T212 L21-31) that on some days, the accused could function better than on others and that this may explain what might otherwise appear to be an inconsistency in the evidence of her presentation. He acknowledged that there were periods when the accused was functioning and that at those times she was more capable of making a rational determination and performing a wilful act (T224 L17-31). 

189The essence of Professor Greenberg's opinion was that at the time of OB's death, the accused's schizophrenic condition was in its developmental stages (T216 L21-23). When asked whether or not he was able to say to what extent the condition had developed, he said that from a retrospective analysis it was ""fairly well developed"" (T216 L26-32). He specifically rejected the possibility that prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia had only manifested themselves after OB's death (T221 L38 - T222 L29). 

190Finally, Professor Greenberg was asked, in the context of the possibility of the accused having left OB unattended in the bath, about the accused being ""absent minded"". He explained that it was not a question of absent mindedness, but rather one of thought blocking, a symptom of schizophrenia where thoughts don't exist (T228 L7-17). Professor Greenberg said (T228 L29-31) that if the accused was thought blocking at the time of OB's death, she may not have had the necessary intention to kill, or inflict grievous bodily harm upon, OB. Importantly however, he agreed (T229 L9-15) that an acceptance of the proposition that the accused had inadvertently left OB in the bath as a consequence of thought blocking necessarily assumed that thought blocking did, in fact, occur. There is no evidence that this is the case. Perhaps even more importantly, he agreed that acceptance of the proposition that thought blocking resulted in the accused leaving OB unattended would also ignore any stated intention(s) on the part of the accused to harm OB. There is, as I have outlined, considerable evidence of such stated intention. 

Professor Buist
191Professor Buist was called in the accused's case and provided a report dated 18 August 2011 (Ex 1). That report followed a three hour interview of the accused on 1 August 2011. Professor Buist diagnosed two conditions, namely:

(i)major depression; and

(ii)postpartum psychosis.

192As to the diagnosis of postpartum psychosis, Professor Buist said (Ex 1 p. 8) that the accused now spoke of a voice that was driving her obsession to find out about OB's condition. She thought it likely that the accused became unwell soon after OB's birth. 

193In evidence (at T246 L35-46) Professor Buist confirmed her opinion that as at the date of OB's death, the accused had a serious disturbance of her mind and that she had gone on to develop schizophrenia. She agreed (T247 L6-13) that the prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia identified by Professor Greenberg were all consistent with the existence of a psychotic condition. 

194Professor Buist accepted, in effect, that the accused's mental state fluctuated but thought that she was nevertheless significantly impaired (commencing at T247 L15). In expressing these views Professor Buist cited, in particular, the clinical history taken at the time of the accused's admission to hospital on 19 October 2010, as well as the fact that the accused was searching information on the internet (T247 L23-30).

195Professor Buist also thought that the terms of the 000 call indicated that the accused had a disturbance of mind (T248 L9-16):

""I think it's consistent with a disturbance of mind. There is clear lack of ability to get from point A to point B. I know Professor Greenberg talks a lot about thought blocking, which is one of the aspects of thought disorder which is one of the key parts of schizophrenia, but thought blocking is only one of the parts of thought disorder and not being able to get from point A to point B is a very clear big part of that and that's really affected her behaviour, her thought process, sorry her thought processes affecting behaviour, and they are very clearly closely aligned.""

196Professor Buist expressed the view that the accused's mental illness had a bearing on her omission to act when asked by the 000 operator to retrieve OB from the bath. She said (T248 L39-46) that it was ""highly likely"" that the accused's inability in this regard reflected an inability to think in a logical and coherent way, all of which was a manifestation of her illness. She thought that the accused's inconsistent accounts of the events of 18 November represented a manifestation of her disturbed mind (T249 L26-46). Although she had diagnosed a psychosis and Professor Greenberg had not, Professor Buist thought that there was little difference between their respective opinions (T251 L44-47):

""... to me there is clear evidence prior to OB's death that showed her disturbance of mind, so whether you want to call it prodrome schizophrenia or post-partum psychosis that hadn't declared itself or schizophrenia that hadn't declared itself fully, it makes no difference.""

197Professor Buist accepted (T256 L10-16) that the inconsistent presentation of prodromal symptoms meant that such symptoms would have had more of a role to play on some occasions than on others. This was generally consistent with the opinion of Professor Greenberg. However she expressed the opinion (T257 L9-10) that it was unlikely that the accused's thinking was not affected in some way at the relevant time. She accepted that a stated intention to kill could have existed independently of any psychiatric or personality disorder from which the accused was suffering, although she regarded this as highly unlikely in the case of the accused (T266 L1-11). 

198Finally, Professor Buist pointed out (commencing at T271 L49) that on the available evidence, depression was a major part of the accused's presentation at that time and that this was completely consistent with an underlying schizophrenic condition. She agreed (at T272 L27-30) that an initial indicator of schizophrenia can be major depression which may form part of the prodromal symptoms giving rise to a subsequent diagnosis of schizophrenia (T272 L21 - T273 L1), and reiterated (commencing at T273 L42) that at the very least, prodromal symptoms existed as at 18 November 2010. In these circumstances she did not accept the position that there was no relevant mental condition existing prior to 18 November 2010 (T274 L17-19). 

Conclusions as to the expert psychiatric evidence
199As Professor Buist pointed out, there is little in the way of material difference between her opinion and that of Professor Greenberg. The principal difference concerns whether the accused had in fact developed a psychosis by 2010. Professor Buist expressed the view that she had. Professor Greenberg thought that the accused was displaying prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia, or in other words symptoms that were indicating an emerging schizophrenic condition. 

200Both experts acknowledged that a number of psychiatrists had assessed the accused in the period leading up to OB's death, none of whom had diagnosed schizophrenia. In particular, Dr Snars considered it but could find no evidence of it. 

201On the whole of the evidence, and bearing in mind that no diagnosis of schizophrenia was made at the time of OB's death, I prefer the opinion of Professor Greenberg that at that time the accused was exhibiting prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia. I am satisfied, based on the evidence of Professor Greenberg, that those symptoms were well developed but I am not satisfied that they had developed into a psychosis as at 18 November 2010. 

202Both Professor Greenberg and Professor Buist agreed, and I am satisfied, that the accused's mind was disturbed as a consequence of her mental illness. However, the precise extent of the disturbance on 18 November 2010 cannot be determined. The accused's symptoms fluctuated from time to time. They were not constantly disabling. There were times when she had the capacity to function. There is no evidence that any symptoms, particularly thought blocking, manifested themselves prior to the making of the 000 call on 18 November 2010. 

203Further, neither expert suggested that the various statements made by the accused to friends in the period leading up to OB's death should be interpreted other than according to the terms in which they were made.

Professor Cross
204In the course of the investigation, police obtained a report from Professor Rod Cross, Associate Professor of Physics at the University of Sydney. The report of Professor Cross formed part of the material which was served by the Crown, but upon which the Crown did not ultimately rely. However, counsel for the accused sought to rely on it, a course to which the Crown objected. 

205I heard argument in relation to this issue on 28 November 2014. Having done so, I reached the conclusion that the evidence of Professor Cross was not relevant and should not be admitted. I indicated at that time that I would provide reasons for coming to that view when delivering my final judgment. 

206Professor Cross conducted a number of tests to determine whether it was possible for OB to have fallen out of the ""Bumbo"" seat whilst in the bath. As part of his analysis, Professor Cross conducted experiments which involved 8 babies being individually placed in a bath in a Bumbo seat, and then being watched for the purposes of determining (inter alia) whether or not they fell out. Those experiments were recorded on DVD. Professor Cross' report provides, in effect, a narrative of what was observed. 

207In relation to the first four babies who were used for the purposes of the experiment, Professor Cross expressed the following opinion (at p. 19):

""I concluded from the experiment with the four babies that a relatively passive baby would be very unlikely to fall out of the seat and that even active babies would more likely than not remain anchored in a Bumbo seat, provided that they weigh less than about 10kg (and more than about 7kg so that the seat sinks to the bottom of the bath). Older and heavier active babies would probably be able to get out of the seat if left alone, but if they were able to crawl out and support their head above water then it is unlikely that they would drown in only 10cm of water, at least if left alone for a minute or two. I did not test the ability of a baby to hold its head above water, but two of the babies did so for about 10 seconds before being rescued by their mothers"".

208In respect of the second group of four babies used in the experiment, Professor Cross said (at para. 21):

""None of the four babies fell or climbed out of the seats. Babies 5 and 8 had previously been fed in a Bumbo seat and were therefore used to sitting in the seat. Baby 5 was relatively passive but did lean forward several times to touch the bath plug, without tipping out of the seat. Babies 6 and 7 were more active in leaning forward, reaching for the bath plug, the toys in the bath and the sides of the bath, but did not tip out of the seat. Baby 8 was the most active baby and appeared to attempt to get out of the seat after about 5 minutes by leaning backwards and pushing on the bath with his feet. However, his feet slipped on the bottom of the bath and he was unable to get out. Had he tried that out of water on a firm floor, then he may have been able to get out.""

209Leaving aside the fact that Professor Cross' conclusions arguably amount to little more than a recording of his observations, the evidence was not relevant for two primary reasons. 

210Firstly in seven of the eight cases, the baby used for the experiment was between one and three months older than OB and thus at a markedly different stage of his or her development. Secondly, all of the eight babies were between 0.5kg and almost 5kg heavier than OB. This would obviously have led to a significant difference in the dexterity of each of them when compared to OB. 

211Whether OB would have reacted in the same way as any of the babies used in the experiments is purely speculative. I am not able to accept the proposition that the behaviour of eight other babies, all of whom were of different ages and weight to OB, is in any way relevant to a determination of what may have transpired when OB was in the bath on 18 November 2010. 

THE NO CASE SUBMISSION
212At the close of the Crown's evidence, counsel for the accused made application for a ""directed verdict"" in respect of the count of murder.

213Counsel for the accused submitted that the evidence concerning the instability of the Bumbo seat, and the evidence of Professor Greenberg of the accused's symptoms of thought blocking, gave rise to a possibility that the accused had inadvertently left OB in the bath tub and later had become distracted, as a consequence of which OB had died by accident. Counsel for the accused submitted that the Crown had failed to exclude this hypothesis and that in those circumstances, I should conclude that the accused was not guilty of murder. Counsel for the accused further submitted that the only available inference on the evidence was that the accused was substantially impaired such as to warrant her liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.

214In response, it was submitted that the Crown was not required, at this stage of the proceedings, to exclude every reasonable hypothesis which might possibly be consistent with the accused's innocence. It was submitted that at this point, the Crown case should be taken at its highest and that there was evidence which sustained the inference that the accused had intentionally murdered OB. The evidence relied upon by the Crown in this regard included the statements made by the accused to friends in which she effectively stated that she wanted to ""rid"" herself of OB, her expressed resentment towards OB for constituting an interference with her ""perfect"" lifestyle and the evidence of the internet search in respect of drowning. The Crown also relied upon the injuries identified by Dr Van Vuuren as having been occasioned to OB.

215At the conclusion of submissions, I indicated to counsel for the accused that the application was rejected and that I would express my reasons for coming to that conclusion in the course of my final judgment. 

216The application made by counsel for the accused was based upon the proposition that it is incumbent upon the Crown, at this stage of the proceedings, to exclude any reasonable hypothesis consistent with the accused's innocence and that if the Crown had failed to do so, the accused was entitled to a directed verdict. That proposition is contrary to authority and simply cannot be accepted.

217A trial judge may direct a verdict at the close of the Crown case only if the view is reached that there is a defect in the evidence adduced by the Crown such that, when it is taken at its highest, the evidence will not support a verdict of guilty. In Doney v R [1990] HCA 51; (1990) 171 CLR 207 the High Court stated the principle in this way (at 214):

""It follows that, if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations, and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.""

218It will be evident that the Crown case against the accused is circumstantial. The fact that at this stage of the proceedings there may be competing inferences available does not mean that I should direct a verdict of not guilty. It is not open to a trial judge to direct a verdict of not guilty on the basis that inferences other than those advanced by the Crown might be open: R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39. 

219In Saffron v Director of Public Prosecutions; Allen v Director of Public Prosecutions (1989) 16 NSWLR 397 Gleeson CJ explained the matter in this way (at [401]):

""It is a corollary of the fundamental principle that the prosecution carries the onus of proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt that a jury cannot convict on the basis of circumstantial evidence unless no other explanation than guilt is reasonably compatible with the circumstances: Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234 and Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] (1984) 153 CLR 521. It does notfollow, however, that simply because it is possible, looking at the objective circumstances established by the evidence in a case, to construct an hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused, the case is not one fit to go to a jury. That entirely overlooks the role of the jury in a criminal trial.""

220Gleeson CJ observed that the various matters to which he had referred had been emphasised in Attorney-General's Reference (No 1 of 1983) [1983] 2 VR 410 where the Court (Young CJ, Anderson and Gobbo JJA) said (at 415-416):

""The question whether the Crown has ultimately excluded everyreasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence is a question of fact for the jury and therefore, if the Crown has led evidence upon which the accused could be convicted, a trial judge should not rule that there is no case to answer or direct the jury to acquit simply because he thinks that there could be formulated a reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused which the Crown has failed to exclude. Similarly a trial judge should not rule that there is no case for the accused to answer because he has formed the view that, if the decision on the facts were his and not the jury's, he would entertain a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. It is always a question for the jury whether a reasonable doubt exists as to the guilt of the accused and asMenzies J explained in Plomp's Case, in a case based on circumstantial evidence, the necessity to exclude reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence is no more than an application to that class of case of the requirement that the case be proved beyond reasonable doubt"" (emphasis in original).

221Similar observations were made in R v Bilick and Starke (1984) 36 SASR 321; (1984) 11 A Crim R 452.

222It follows that if the evidence adduced by the Crown is capable of proving each of the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt, then the matter should be left to the tribunal of fact for determination.

223There is obviously no issue that OB died. Further in my view, the material to which the Crown pointed is capable, when taken together, of sustaining an inference that the accused intentionally murdered OB by drowning her in the bath. The existence of a competing hypothesis simply highlights the fact that ultimately, the question is one for the tribunal of fact. I constitute the tribunal of fact for present purposes. 

224Finally, I have noted that counsel for the accused, in the course of his submissions, made reference to evidence supporting a partial defence of substantial impairment. Although it was not clear, the submissions tended to incorporate some suggestion that I should, in effect, conclude that the accused committed the offence of manslaughter, that being an available alternative to the allegation of murder, and direct a verdict accordingly.

225If this was the proposition that counsel for the accused intended to convey, I am unable to accept it. The partial defence of substantial impairment is a matter in respect of which the accused bears the onus of proof. Cases in which a verdict may be directed in favour of the accused, where the accused carries the relevant onus, are exceptional: Vickers v R (1975) 61 Cr App R 48 at 51; Morgan v Attorney-General of the State of Queensland (1986) 24 A Crim R 343 at 350.

THE CROWN CASE OF MURDER
226The principal basis on which the Crown puts its case is that the accused intentionally killed OB by immersing her in the bath and drowning her, intending to kill her or intending to inflict grievous bodily harm upon her. 

227The Crown acknowledged that it bears the onus of excluding any other reasonable hypothesis. In this regard, it is the accused's position (inter alia) that the Crown has failed to exclude the possibility that OB's death was the result of a tragic accident, and not the result of any act on the part of the accused.

SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES
Submissions of the Crown
228The Crown emphasised that because the case against the accused was a circumstantial one it was necessary to view the evidence as a whole in determining whether a case of intentional murder was established. In broad terms, the circumstances relied upon by the Crown included the following:

(i)the accused's lack of affection towards OB;

(ii)the accused's belief that OB was a dwarf, in circumstances where the accused had a phobia about dwarfs;

(iii)the accused's internet inquiries relating to (inter alia) drowning by cardiac arrest;

(iv)the accused's belief that OB compromised, or impacted upon, her ""perfect life"";

(v)the statements made by the accused about throwing OB from a cliff or throwing her in the bin; 

(vi)the accused's inconsistent accounts of the events of 18 November 2010 which were relied upon by the Crown as lies constituting evidence of consciousness of guilt;

(vii)the content of the listening device material; and

(viii)the injuries observed on OB. 

229In developing these submissions the Crown cited the accounts given by the accused about the events on 18 November 2010, namely:

(i)in the 000 call;

(ii)to Mr Knox the ambulance officer;

(iii)to Detective Bozikis; and

(iv)to Nurse Fitzsimons.

230It was submitted that I should come to the conclusion that each of these accounts amounted to a deliberate lie which constituted evidence of consciousness of guilt on the part of the accused.

231The Crown submitted that the evidence of Ms Di Nunzio, Ms Dattilo and Ms Dinov established that the accused was obsessed with appearance and perfection, both personally and in a more general sense. It was submitted that the various statements made by the accused to her friends made it clear that she thought OB was less than perfect, and that she had compromised her otherwise perfect life. The Crown relied on the same evidence to support the conclusion that the accused had not bonded with OB, had shown her no affection, and had made little or any positive comment about her. 

232The Crown acknowledged that the accused was mentally unwell in 2010. The Crown further acknowledged that both Professor Greenberg and Professor Buist had referred to the accused's mind as being ""disturbed"". However, it was submitted that on the whole of the evidence the disturbance was one which, in effect, ""waxed and waned"". It was submitted that the evidence supported the conclusion that the accused was functioning on 18 November, and that in the period leading up to that time she had continued to act in a way, and make statements about OB, which inferred an intention to kill OB.

233The Crown submitted that the evidence established that the injuries shown in Ex O were likely to have been sustained prior to OB's death, and that they were consistent with the application of blunt force by a fingernail. The Crown also emphasised the fact that there was more than one injury, eliminating the possibility that they had been caused by unintentional and passing contact with a fingernail. The Crown further submitted that there was no reasonable possibility that the injuries had been caused to OB by the ambulance officers, or by any other medical practitioner who had administered emergency treatment. 

234The Crown also relied on the evidence of RB that he saw no injury to OB when he left for work on the morning of 18 November 2010, and pointed to the evidence that OB was in the presence of the accused between that time and when she was found by Mr Knox. It was submitted that a combination of all these circumstances left no room for any conclusion other than the fact that the injuries found on OB and depicted on Ex. O had been inflicted by the accused at some stage during the course of the morning of 18 November 2010. The Crown also submitted that the absence of any other injury was insignificant, in view of the opinions of both Dr Van Vuuren and Dr Collins that there would not necessarily be evidence of any other injury in a case of intentional drowning.

235The Crown also relied upon the internet searches conducted by the accused and, in particular, to the text fragments which inferred that the accused had accessed articles entitled (inter alia) ""ISR seeks 2 prevent babies and children from drowning"" and ""Drowning and sudden cardiac death"". The Crown submitted that these articles were of particular significance in light of the cause of OB's death.

Submissions of the accused
236Counsel for the accused conceded that the expert evidence did not support a defence of mental illness. However, he submitted that the whole of the evidence tended against the proposition that the accused had murdered OB and that the Crown had failed to exclude, as a reasonable possibility, that OB's death was the result of accidental drowning, occurring in circumstances where: 

(i)the accused had been bathing OB in a big bath for the first time;
(ii)OB had been placed in the Bumbo seat which presented as being more stable than it actually was;
(iii)because of her mental illness, the accused was susceptible to profound distraction and thought blocking, and was not ""appraised of time accurately"";
(iv)as a result of distraction, be it because of an incoming telephone call, the necessity to obtain a bath towel, or some other cause, the accused left OB in the bath and took time to return to the bathroom, by which time OB had drowned.

237Counsel commenced by making reference to the 000 call which, it was submitted, was not inconsistent with an intention to kill on the part of the accused. The essence of the submission advanced by counsel was that the distraught demeanour of the accused was inconsistent with what would be expected from somebody who had just intentionally killed her child. 

238Counsel also relied upon the evidence of OB's forthcoming Baptism, and the preparations being undertaken by the accused in relation to it. This, it was submitted, was a circumstance which was plainly inconsistent with the proposition that the accused had intentionally killed OB. Counsel also relied, in this regard, upon the evidence of the accused's concerns about OB's health, and the possibility of genetic deformity. It was submitted that the expression of such concerns, and the repeated requests for testing, were consistent with a desire to ensure that OB was properly treated, rather than a desire to kill her.

239Counsel for the accused also relied upon the evidence of the accused's anxiety, her exhibited lack of concentration, and the thought blocking which was part of her symptomatology. It was submitted that all of these factors were inconsistent with the Crown case, but completely consistent with a conclusion that OB had drowned in a tragic accident. 

240Counsel also relied on the evidence of Dr Van Vuuren that she could find no evidence of ""foul play"". It was submitted that this tended completely against a conclusion that any deliberate mechanism had been employed to kill OB.

241It was submitted that the evidence of the accused's internet searches did not give rise to any sinister inference, but were consistent with wanting to do everything possible for OB in the event that a genetic abnormality was confirmed. As to the evidence of text fragments relating to death by drowning, counsel for the accused accepted that there was an available inference that the accused had accessed an article entitled ""Drowning and sudden cardiac death"" in the period leading up to OB's death. However, he submitted that I should ""exercise caution"" in using that inference to support a conclusion that the accused intended to kill OB. He pointed, in particular, to the fact that the text fragments had been retrieved by the use of certain ""search words"" by the police, in circumstances where there was no evidence that the accused had ever entered all or any of those words into any search engine.

242Counsel also relied on that part of Professor Greenberg's report (Ex AT1 p. 27) in which he indicated that in his opinion all of the factors pointed to a conclusion that the accused had inadvertently left OB unattended. Counsel accepted that it was not for Professor Greenberg, nor indeed for any other expert, to determine the facts but nevertheless submitted this was further evidence supporting the accused's poor concentration, and a further indication that the Crown had failed to eliminate accidental drowning as a possible cause of OB's death.

243Counsel for the accused also relied upon the evidence of RB concerning the instability of the Bumbo seat. He submitted that the evidence established that the accused had little or no previous experience with the seat and that the evidence of RB as to its instability was consistent with the accused, as a result of poor concentration or thought blocking, leaving OB in the bath, only to have OB fall forward out of the seat due to its instability, and drown in the accused's absence. 

244Counsel acknowledged that the accused had provided a number of inconsistent accounts of the events of 18 November. However, he submitted that these accounts should not be regarded as deliberate lies, in view of the evidence that inconsistent accounts were part of the manifestation of the accused's disturbed mind. 

245Counsel for the accused also submitted that there was evidence which established that the accused was a caring and concerned mother. It was submitted that such evidence tended against the proposition that the accused was the kind of person who would murder her daughter. In this respect, counsel for the accused invited me, in effect, to treat that evidence as akin to evidence of good character. 

246In terms of the evidence of the statements made by the accused to Ms Dattilo, Ms Di Nunzio and Ms Dinov, counsel for the accused submitted that they should be viewed as statements of ""profound frustration on the part of the accused, evidencing an inability to cope with maternal responsibilities"" rather than an intention to kill OB. 

247Counsel acknowledged the evidence of Dr Van Vuuren as to OB's injuries. However, he relied upon Dr Collins' evidence that the injuries were up to 1 to 2 days old and, in light of this evidence, pointed to the evidence of Ms Dinov that she had observed the accused drag OB across a floor on 16 November, 2 days before her death. Counsel submitted that this evidence provided an alternative hypothesis as to the cause of OB's injuries. I should say that I am not able to accept that submission in light of my rejection, for the reasons already given, of that part of Dr Collins' evidence.

Consideration
248Before considering the submissions of the parties it is appropriate that I deal with the discreet issue of whether the accused's conflicting accounts of the events of 18 November constitute evidence of deliberate lies.

249In Edwards v R [1993] HCA 63; (1993) 178 CLR 193, and subsequently in Zoneff v R [2000] HCA 28; (2000) 200 CLR 234, the High Court considered the question of how lies may be used against an accused. The principles established in those two cases may be summarised as follows:

(i)a lie may constitute an admission against interest only if it is concerned with some circumstance or event connected with the offence, and thus relates to a material issue;

(ii)the lie, and the circumstances relied upon to establish that it constitutes an admission against interest, must be precisely defined;

(iii)the jury must be satisfied that the lie was deliberate;

(iv)the lie may be taken into account only if the jury is satisfied, having regard to the circumstances and events, that it reveals a knowledge of the offence, or some aspect of it, and that it was told because the accused knew that the truth of the matter about which he or she lied would implicate him in the commission of the offence; and

(v)it is necessary for the jury to be reminded that there may be reasons for the telling of a lie apart from the realisation of guilt.

250In R v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 672 Whealy J (as his Honour then was), having summarised those principles, observed that the weight of authority and academic opinion favoured a cautious approach to the use of lies as evidence of consciousness of guilt: R v Sutton (1986) 5 NSWLR 697 at 701 per Street CJ; R v Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234 at 236 per Gleeson CJ; R v Ray (2003) 57 NSWLR 616 at 632 per Wood CJ at CL; Zoneff (supra) at 244. Whilst this may be so, it is necessary to bear in mind that even though caution is necessary, it cannot be allowed to inhibit the Crown from having the benefit of such evidence when that course is clearly appropriate: R v Lane [2011] NSWCCA 157; (2011) 221 A Crim R 309 at [11] per McClellan CJ at CL.

251Underlying the principles to which I have referred is the fundamental proposition that any statement made by the accused which is said to be a lie must be factually false, or wrong. That a statement is factually false or wrong does not necessarily connote that it is a lie - that is why it must be established that the asserted lie is deliberate: Lane (supra) at [58] per Simpson J. 

252I am not able to accept the Crown's submission that I should treat the accused's accounts of the events of 18 November 2010 as deliberate lies which evidence a consciousness of guilt. I have come to that view for two primary reasons.

253Firstly, there is an element of circularity in the Crown's argument. This is because the conclusion that the accused's accounts were deliberate lies is largely dependent upon assessing the entirety of the Crown's circumstantial case.

254Secondly, and more importantly, I must remind myself that there may be reasons for telling a lie, other than a consciousness of guilt. In the present case, there is evidence that the inconsistent accounts given by the accused were a manifestation of her disturbed mind. Significantly, those accounts were obviously given after OB had died, at therefore at a time when the accused's condition had been exacerbated by reason of OB's death.

255For these reasons I have not treated the accused's conflicting accounts as amounting to evidence of deliberate lies which reflect a consciousness of guilt. I turn then to consider the submissions of the parties.

256The Crown case that the accused intentionally murdered OB is a circumstantial one. In Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131; (2012) 224 A Crim R 22, the Court of Criminal Appeal (McClellan CJ at CL, Fullerton J and Garling J) said (at [466]):

""The case against the applicant is a circumstantial one. As McClellan CJ at CL discussed in Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21 at [50]-[53], where a case is circumstantial 'the jury cannot return a verdict of guilty unless the circumstances are such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused' quoting Barca v The Queen [1975] HCA 42; (1975) 133 CLR 82 at 104 (Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ), citing Peacock v The King [1911] HCA 66; (1911) 13 CLR 619 at 634; see also Plomp v The Queen [1963[ HCA 44; (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 252"".

257In the same paragraph the Court emphasised the need to consider the evidence as whole: 

""... a circumstantial case must be considered holistically. The court must weigh and consider the totality of the admissible evidence before reaching a conclusion, on the whole of the evidence, that it was open to the jury to be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt of guilt or, in the alternative, that a doubt persists such that it would be dangerous to allow the verdict of guilty to stand: R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 at [48]-[49] (Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ)"".

258Whilst these comments were made in the context of an appellate court considering whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty at trial, they obviously reflect the approach which I am required to take in determining whether the circumstances relied upon by the Crown, when taken together, establish that the accused committed the offence of murder. That approach does not involve a process of reasoning in which an attempt is made to explain away every individual circumstance as being consistent with innocence: Gilham (supra) at [466] citing R v Micaleff [2002] NSWCCA 480; (2002) 136 A Crim R 127 at [42]; Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 193 at [55].

259In my view the evidence in the present case establishes the following relevant circumstances. 

260On and from the first consultation with Dr James on 24 June 2010 the accused became distressed, highly anxious, and significantly pre-occupied with OB's appearance and, in particular, about the possibility that she suffered from some form of genetic abnormality. So much is clear from the unchallenged evidence of her conversations with medical practitioners, their staff, members of her family and her close friends. 

261The level of the accused's pre-occupation is particularly evident from the number of internet searches she conducted in relation to topics pertaining to genetic deformity. Moreover, she went so far as to tell her mother in February 2011 that had it not been for evidence of frontal bossing, OB would still be alive. It follows that the accused herself linked what she believed to have been OB's frontal bossing to the reason for her death. Obviously, it was not frontal bossing that was the cause of OB's death. However, frontal bossing was one of the issues which was of great concern to the accused in the context of what I am satisfied was an obsession with perfection.

262Although medical practitioners constantly reassured the accused that OB had no abnormality, those reassurances were, generally speaking, not accepted by the accused despite her occasional indications to the contrary. Even after the final test results were communicated to her on 26 October 2010, the accused remained concerned that OB was suffering from some kind of syndrome. She continued to express views to that effect well into November 2010.

263The accused's anxiety, and her pre-occupation with the suggestion that OB had a genetic deformity of some kind, arose in circumstances where she: 

(a)told Dr Betts of a negative experience with a dwarf;
(b)told Ms Dattilo that she was in fear of dwarfs; and 
(c)told Ms Shalhoub that she was frightened by a dwarf as a child. 

264The accused was also a person who had obsessional traits, particularly in relation to her appearance. Against that background she:

(a)expressed her regret that she had been unable to give birth to a ""perfect"" child;
(b)questioned why her otherwise ""perfect life"" had been upset by OB's birth;
(c)questioned why it was that others had ""normal"" babies when she did not;
(d)questioned why she ""deserved"" something other than a normal child; and 
(e)stated that she wished she ""never even had that baby"".

265These statements, in my view, indicate a considerable degree of resentment on the part of the accused towards OB. Perhaps with the exception of the matter in (e), the remaining statements were something of a recurring theme in the period leading up to OB's death. 

266The accused also made several disturbing statements to Ms Dinov about jumping off a cliff with OB, throwing her off a cliff, or throwing her in the bin, because OB had not fitted in to her ""perfect family"". In a not dissimilar vein, the accused also expressed the view to Ms Dinov that it was preferable to deal with a terminal illness than have a lifetime with a dwarf. Further, whilst I do not accept the evidence of Ms Dattilo that the accused said to her that she would have to ""get rid"" of OB, Ms Dattilo's unchallenged evidence was that the accused had said to her that if OB was a dwarf, she would have to be ""taken away"". In my view, these statements reflect the level of the accused's resentment towards OB and a desire on the part of the accused to be rid of her. When viewed in the context of the entirety of the circumstances, the multiplicity of such statements, and the terms in which they were made, reflect a great deal more than mere frustration on the part of the accused in dealing with the possibility that OB was in some way genetically abnormal. 

267The accused had told Ms Di Nunzio that she ""could not cope"" if OB was a dwarf. The entirety of the medical testing indicated that OB was completely normal. That was never fully accepted by the accused. There was a distinct lack of affection demonstrated by the accused to OB, and a lack of bonding between them. The accused herself acknowledged that lack of bonding and attributed it, at least in part, to the possibility that OB was a dwarf. The accused's difficulties extended to an inability, on occasions, to even look at OB or pick her up. They also extended to describing OB, at one point, as a ""frittata"". All of these matters are inconsistent with the proposition that the accused was a caring mother.

268Although the accused's internet research about genetic deformities reflects her anxiety about OB's suggested condition, her searches went well beyond that. A number of them were directed towards the topic of termination of pregnancy where there was evidence of dwarfism. More significantly, two articles appearing in the text fragments retrieved by Mr Watt related to the subject of drowning, one of them specifically to ""drowning and sudden cardiac death"". Given the manner of OB's death, the significance of that article is obvious. Its importance lies not in the particular search mechanism by which it was obtained, but in the fact that it was present amongst the text fragments located on the accused's computer. The inescapable inference is that the accused accessed that article. The fact that she had done so is consistent with the accused enquiring about methods by which she could rid herself of OB. That, in turn, is completely consistent with what she had said to her friends. 

269When RB left for work on the morning of 18 November 2010 he saw no injuries to OB's head. His evidence in that regard was not the subject of any challenge. The injuries found by Dr Van Vuuren are consistent with having been inflicted by a fingernail. Moreover, the fact that there is more than one isolated injury tends against the suggestion that the injuries came about as the result of the accidental passing of a fingernail upon OB's head. They are, however consistent with the application of blunt force, and thus consistent with forcibly immersing OB's head in the water. In this regard, it is not insignificant that the accused was observed to have a wet sleeve at the scene.

270In my view, these circumstances, when combined, establish that the accused murdered OB by intentionally drowning her. Indeed in my view, that conclusion is overwhelming. 
271I am satisfied that the Crown has excluded, as a reasonable possibility, that OB drowned by accident as a consequence of being left in the bath due to a lapse in concentration, or an episode of thought blocking, on the part of the accused. Acceptance of such a possibility necessarily assumes that thought blocking did occur at that time, a matter about which there is no direct evidence. More importantly, as Professor Greenberg conceded, the acceptance of the possibility that thought blocking caused the accused to become distracted requires the evidence of (inter alia) the accused's stated intentions to harm OB, be it by throwing her off a cliff or throwing her in the bin, being completely ignored. It was not suggested that those statements were not made by the accused, nor was there any evidence that the accused's mental disturbance should cause me to interpret those statements in a way inconsistent with their express terms. There is, therefore, no basis upon which I should ignore that evidence.

272Further, and even accepting for present purposes that the Bumbo seat was not stable, the suggestion that it was reasonably possible for the accused to be distracted by the necessity to (for example) retrieve a towel or a piece of clothing, to the extent that she left OB in the bath for an extended period, is not consistent with the objective evidence. Even if it were assumed that the accused had to retrieve such an item from the clothes dryer (that being the location furthest away from the bathroom of the accused's premises) the evidence establishes that it takes a maximum of only 29.9 seconds to walk from the bathroom, to the clothes dryer and back. If, for example, the item was in one of the bedrooms, the time taken would be a maximum of only 17.9 seconds. As I have noted, the evidence of Professor Cass is that it takes 4 to 6 minutes for a child to drown. The suggestion that the accused may have suffered an episode of thought blocking at that time, or that she became otherwise distracted, is purely speculative.

273The suggestion that the accused might have been distracted by a telephone call is equally unlikely. The last incoming call is recorded as coming to the accused's telephone from Julie Stockton at 11.34.07 for a duration of 13 seconds. An SMS message was received from Ms Stockton at 11.34.49. The 000 call was not received until 12.12 pm. 

274I acknowledge that Professor Buist thought it highly unlikely that the accused could have had an intention to kill, independent of any psychiatric disorder. However, whilst it may be highly unlikely, I am satisfied that the accused did have that intention in the present case. In my view, that is an overwhelming inference to be drawn from a combination of the circumstances to which I have referred.

Infanticide
275Infanticide is the first of two partial defences which I have been asked to consider. It was the Crown's submission that this issue was appropriately considered before considering the partial defence of substantial impairment, an approach with which I agree. 

The relevant statutory provision
276Section 22A of the Crimes Act 1900 NSW is in the following terms:

(11)Where a woman by any wilful act or omission causes the death of her child, being a child under the age of twelve months, but at the time of the act or omission the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child, then, notwithstanding that the circumstances were such that but for this section the offence would have amounted to murder, she shall be guilty of infanticide and may for such offence be dealt with and punished as if she had been guilty of the offence of manslaughter of such child.

(12)Where upon the trial of a woman for the murder of her child, being a child under the age of twelve months, the jury are of the opinion that she by any wilful act or omission caused its death, but that at the time of the act or omission the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to such child or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child, then the jury may, notwithstanding that the circumstances were such that but for the provisions of this section they might have returned a verdict of murder, return in lieu thereof a verdict of infanticide, and the woman may be dealt with and punished as if she had been guilty of the offence of manslaughter of the said child.

(13)Nothing in this section shall affect the power of the jury upon an indictment for the murder of a child to return a verdict of manslaughter or a verdict of not guilty on the ground of insanity, or a verdict of concealment of birth.

277The Crown accepted, correctly in my view, that it bears the onus of establishing that at the time of deliberately drowning OB, the balance of the accused's mind was not disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to OB, nor by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of OB.

The expert evidence
278In his report (Ex AT1 at p. 28) Professor Greenberg stated as follows:

""I am of the opinion that during the antenatal (pregnancy) period she was under extreme stress. MB had a stressful pregnancy because of her parents' separation and subsequent divorce, the onset of her gestational diabetes, her anxiety about the possibility of her having a Downs baby and her having to wait for the various test results including the chorionic villus sampling. Also, there was the additional stress with the development of a weeping granuloma of her breast during pregnancy. 

Subsequently during her postnatal period she developed acute severe pan-anxiety associated with her heightened concern about a genetic abnormality of her daughter. I am of the opinion that her pan-anxiety was part and parcel of her prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia. At this time her beliefs of such abnormalities could have reached delusional or near delusional proportions. MB's other non-specific symptoms such as dysphoric (depressed) mood, irritability, poor concentration and poor attention, sleep disturbance, low energy, social withdrawal, overvalued ideas, perceptual disturbance, brief intermittent hallucinations, unusual thought content and failure to carry out her maternal duties. During her pregnancy birth and subsequent post-natal period the stresses precipitated the progression of her schizophrenic disorder which became overtly apparent in late August 2012. These prodromal symptoms were, in my opinion, significant and the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her prodromal schizophrenia and the effect of her giving birth. I am of the view that the balance of her mind was ultimately disturbed by her prodromal schizophrenia. Her daughter drowned at approximately 6 months old and therefore MB likely had not fully recovered from the effect of giving birth. The birth in itself was not the primary reason for her imbalance of her mind but was a significant contributor in aggravating and/or precipitating her prodrome symptoms of schizophrenia illness. Over the long term, MB will continue to suffer from symptoms of her mental illness as there is no cure for schizophrenia and the illness is a (sic) chronic in nature and independent of her postnatal period.

I am therefore of the opinion that in my view the accused would, on balance likely have a defence of infanticide under s. 22a (sic) of the NSW Crimes Act 1951 (sic). However, the final determination is best left to the Trier of fact"" (emphasis in original).

279Professor Greenberg also said (Ex AT2 at p. 8):

""To my mind there is some ambiguity with interpretation of legal infanticide and medical science. I am of the opinion that MB would on balance qualify for this defence. However, there is some doubt because her mind was not solely disturbed by reason of her not fully recovered (sic) from the effect of childbirth. Her mental health had less to do with her puerperium and the effects of child birth associated with the puerperium (post natal blues, post-partum depression and postpartum psychosis). Her mental state has more to do with her predisposition to significant schizophrenic mental illness separate of the puerperium. However her prodromal mental state was likely precipitated to exacerbate it by the significant stresses associated with the puerperium period (emphasis in original).

...

In the alternative should MB not meet the definitional requirements for infanticide I remain of the view that MB would likely have a defence of substantial impairment because at the time of the drowning, she was unable to control her actions because she was substantially impaired by abnormality of mind arising from her underlying schizophrenia mental illness"" (emphasis in original)

280Professor Greenberg confirmed these opinions when giving evidence (T225 L11-13). Importantly, he confirmed his opinion that the accused's disturbance of mind had not arisen solely as a result of her not having fully recovered from the effects of childbirth. When taken to that part of Ex AT2 in which he had expressed that view, Dr Greenberg gave the following evidence (T225 L11 - T226 L20):

""What I am referring to there is the infanticide defence. As I understand it, is that it's a defence that is available during a year after childbirth due to the effects of childbirth. What I am referring to is the fact that it's more of a technical fact, that it's not the hormonal aspect that causes the disturbance. 

All women who give birth to children have hormonal imbalance postdelivery. It is not the hormones. It is the fact that she had a predisposition to schizophrenia, and the stress of the childbirth and the postchildbirth period precipitated the schizophrenia. The childbirth itself is just a stressor, rather than the cause of the psychosis, the later psychosis. 

In other words, from a psychiatric point of view, we don't distinguish between psychosis during the postdelivery period, postpeurperium period and psychosis at other times, so for instance, in the accused's situation, occurring two years later. It's part and parcel of schizophrenia, not part and parcel of what they used to call postpartum psychosis, which is a woman who has a psychotic episode because of childbirth. The childbirth is just the stress. It's the schizophrenia that is the illness. So it's more of a technical issue. This defence has a long historical origin, where they believe women during periods of menstruation, or women during periods of childbirth, could develop a disturbance of the mind. We know that's not true, because women give birth to children all the time, or have menstruation periods all the time, and don't become mentally ill. It's not the hormones that cause the illness. 

Q. So is what you are saying, that although the fact of having given birth to OB has a role to play, it is not the sole role to play, because there was another existence of psychiatric illness? 
A. Not existence, was emerging. She was predisposed to it, and she was then developing symptoms, yes.

Q. So it's not the situation that you would accept that the sole operating consideration at the time of OB's death was that the accused had not fully recovered from the effects of giving birth? 
A. Well she hadn't recovered from the effects of giving birth. I am talking about stresses involved, but it's not solely because of hormones. ""

281Professor Buist also concluded that it was open to the accused to rely upon the provisions of s. 22A (Ex 1 p. 10):

""... it is my belief that the death of OB would fit under the NSW Crimes Act 1900 s. 22A as Infanticide. MB at the time was in charge of her child and as such through omission resulted in OB's death. Her judgment, concentration and thinking were also significantly impaired at the time as evidenced by her mental illness prior and subsequently in the extensive notes as well as on this assessment. This illness commences shortly after birth and was directly related to the birth, from which she has still not fully recovered. The child was also under twelve months of age, fit in these criteria.""

282Professor Buist expressed the view that the birth of OB was a ""clear and important precipitant"" in respect of the accused's mental state (T257 L23-26). When asked about the effect of this upon her diagnosis of infanticide Professor Buist said (T258 L27-33):

""Now even if she was prodromal prior to the birth of this child, it's still the birth of this child that pushed her over the edge and it was the birth of this child started her being fixated and, you know, in the end on the borderline of delusion, if not delusional, about the child's illness or fictitious illness. So that I still feel it's the birth of this child. The two previous pregnancies, you know, are extra stresses. If you look at it, anyone with post-partum psychosis, it's the coming together of all of the factors and then the child that is the tipping point.""


Submissions of the Crown
283The Crown submitted that the facts of the present case did not fall within the provisions of s. 22A. It was submitted that whilst the evidence established that the accused suffered from a disturbance of the mind, that condition had not come about by reason of the effect of giving birth to OB, nor by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of OB. In short, the Crown submitted that the accused's disturbed mind was due to a multiplicity of factors. 

284The Crown submitted that the effect of s. 22A was to permit an accused to rely upon one of two separate considerations, namely that at the time of the relevant act or omission, her mind was disturbed by reason of:

(i)not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child; or
(ii)the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child.

285The Crown submitted that the reference to the ""effect of lactation"" informed the proper meaning of the phrase ""the effect of giving birth"". It was submitted that such a phrase required that there be evidence that the disturbance of mind had come about by reason of some direct effect of the process of giving birth, as opposed to some condition which had arisen independently as a consequence of other factors. The Crown submitted that the opinions of both Professor Greenberg and Professor Buist supported the conclusion that there were a number of other factors, over and above those stemming from the effect of giving birth, which were causative of the accused's mental condition and that accordingly, s. 22A had no role to play. 

Submissions of the accused
286Counsel for the accused submitted that it was open to me to find that the circumstances of the present case fell within s. 22A. That submission was not further developed. In particular, counsel for the accused, having been given the opportunity to do so, made no submission in response to that of the Crown in respect of the meaning of the phrase ""the effect of giving birth"" as it appears in s. 22A.

Consideration
287In the course of submissions, the Crown referred me to R v Yihwai and Aku [1963] PNGLR 40, a decision of Mann CJ in the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court. That was the only decision which the Crown had been able to find where a provision such as s. 22A had been considered. I have not been able to find any other decision from my own research of the matter.

288In that case, the co-accused Aku was the father of Yihwai, who was pregnant. Yihwai was prevented by her father from marrying because he intended her to be his ""domestic"". He instructed Yihwai to kill the child when the child was born, and this she did. The provisions of the Criminal Code Act 1974 (PNG) and s. 3(1) of the Infanticide Ordinance 1953-1956 (PNG) combined to create a provision in the same terms as s. 22A. 

289Mann CJ concluded that there was no onus on the defendant to establish that the circumstances fell within infanticide, and that the onus was on the Crown to establish that they did not. The Crown has, in my view correctly, adopted that same position in the present case. 

290His Honour then went on to say:

""Taking the facts of the present case, the question of causation arises, for it is clear from Yihwai's own evidence that her actions were not caused by anything relating to the processes of birth or lactation. She made up her mind to obey her father before the child was born, and her actions were clearly premeditated. Nevertheless, section 3(1) is not expressed in terms of causation, and in my opinion, Yigwai would be entitled to rely on the section if in fact her mental balance was disturbed as specified, even if it did not appear that her decision was due to that mental disturbance. It seems to me that the section contemplates that any decision or action made or taken in that mental state is not to be examined further as to cause and effect, and that once the condition is fulfilled, the criminal responsibility is limited.

The final question therefore comes down to this: does the evidence fairly raise as a defence the proposition that the Accused was in fact in the state of mental disturbance specified? If so, and if the Crown has disproved the existence of that mental state, the Section operates.

The substantial evidence on the point is that of Yigwai herself, who said that she was not sick, that she knew what she was doing, that she intended to kill the child, and was obeying her father's instructions. All of this evidence, in my opinion, tends to prove that the Accused was in full possession of her normal mental faculties and was in the same mental condition as before the birth of the child. I think, therefore, that the facts raise no basis for this defence, but tend to negative the state of mind specified"". 

291The facts in Yihwai were obviously different to those in the present case. The fundamental question in the present case is whether, at the time of the act which I have found caused OB's death:

(i)the balance of the accused's mind was disturbed;
(ii)that disturbance was by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to OB.

292The evidence of Professor Greenberg and Professor Buist supports the conclusion that the accused's mind was disturbed at the time she killed OB. The real issue is whether that disturbance was by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to OB. This gives rise to the question of what is meant by the phrase ""the effect of giving birth"". 

293Although the facts in Yihwai were obviously different, one aspect of Mann CJ's approach is instructive. His Honour construed the term ""giving birth"" as referring to the actual process of giving birth. That narrow construction is supported by the fact that the only other basis upon which an accused can avail herself of the provisions of s. 22A is where the disturbance of mind is by reason of the effect of lactation. 

294Mann CJ's construction is also supported by the fact that the application of s. 22A is limited to circumstances in which the child is under the age of 12 months when killed. It is not open to an accused person to rely upon s. 22A where the disturbance arises after that time, and in a way which is tangential to the process of giving birth.

295Consistent with that approach, it is my view that in order for the accused in the present case to be able to rely upon s. 22A the disturbance of mind must be by reason solely of her not having fully recovered from the effect of the process of giving birth. The evidence in the present case does not support that conclusion. The opinion of Professor Greenberg, in particular, makes it clear that a series of factors placed the accused under considerable stress, and explained her disturbed mind. These included the separation and divorce of her parents, bleeding in the placenta during pregnancy, consequent fears of losing her pregnancy, contracting gestational diabetes, and suffering from a granuloma of the breast. Professor Greenberg's evidence was clear that all of these matters had a part to play in precipitating the accused's schizophrenic illness (T215 L9-30).

296For these reasons I am satisfied that the Crown has discharged its onus and that s. 22A has no application in the present case.

SUBSTANTIAL IMPAIRMENT
The relevant statutory provision
297Section 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 NSW is in the following terms:

23A Substantial impairment by abnormality of mind 
(1) A person who would otherwise be guilty of murder is not to be convicted of murder if: 
(a) at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, the person's capacity to understand events, or to judge whether the person's actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, and
(b) the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) (b), evidence of an opinion that an impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter is not admissible.

(3) If a person was intoxicated at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, and the intoxication was self-induced intoxication (within the meaning of section 428A), the effects of that self-induced intoxication are to be disregarded for the purpose of determining whether the person is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section.

(4) The onus is on the person accused to prove that he or she is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section.
(5) A person who but for this section would be liable, whether as principal or accessory, to be convicted of murder is to be convicted of manslaughter instead.

(6) The fact that a person is not liable to be convicted of murder in respect of a death by virtue of this section does not affect the question of whether any other person is liable to be convicted of murder in respect of that death.

(7) If, on the trial of a person for murder, the person contends: 
(a) that the person is entitled to be acquitted on the ground that the person was mentally ill at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, or
(b) that the person is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section,
evidence may be offered by the prosecution tending to prove the other of those contentions, and the Court may give directions as to the stage of the proceedings at which that evidence may be offered.

(8) In this section:""underlying condition"" means a pre-existing mental or physiological condition, other than a condition of a transitory kind.

The expert evidence
298Professor Greenberg said (Ex AT1 p. 28):

"" ... I am of the view that MB would likely have a defence of substantial impairment because at the time of the drowning, she was unable to control her actions because she was substantially impaired by abnormality of mind arising from her underlying schizophrenia mental illness"".

Submissions of the Crown
299The Crown submitted that any impairment of the accused's mental state was not such as to reduce the offence from murder to manslaughter. Whilst the Crown accepted that the accused was mentally unwell at the time of OB's death, it was submitted that her condition did not amount to a substantial impairment for the purposes of s. 23A(1)(a). 

300In the event that I was to conclude that the provisions of s. 23A(1)(a) were established, the Crown submitted, in particular, that in circumstances where OB was a vulnerable child of only 6 months of age, and in circumstances where the accused retained an ability to function, I should conclude that any impairment from which the accused might have been suffering was not such as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.

Submissions of the accused
301Counsel for the accused submitted that ""all of the evidence goes to substantial impairment on 18 November"". Counsel cited, in particular, the opinion of Professor Greenberg in support of that submission. 

Consideration
302The accused bears the onus of establishing that she is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section: s. 23A(4). 

303In the present case, Professor Greenberg's opinion (which I have accepted) was that at the time of OB's death, the accused was suffering from prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia which were well developed. He expressed the view that such condition impaired her capacity to control her actions (Ex T1 p. 28). That opinion is unchallenged. Professor Buist did not disagree with that opinion, although she was of the view that the accused had in fact developed a psychosis at the time of OB's death. In that sense, her opinion went one step further than that of Professor Greenberg, although the two opinions are not inconsistent with each other.

304There is no reason why I should not act upon such opinions. There is no other evidence which outweighs them. It follows that I am satisfied of the matters set out in s. 23A(1)(a). 

305However, the question posed by s. 23A(1)(b) is quite separate. Whether the impairment is sufficiently substantial to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter is not a matter for a medical expert. It involves me making a value judgment, rather than reaching a finding of medical fact. It is a task which is to be approached in a broad, common sense way: R v Trotter (1993) 35 NSWLR 428 at 431-432. 

306In making that judgment I must apply the standards which I regard as prevailing in the community. In R v Bretherton [2013] NSWSC 1036 Harrison J observed (at [25]):

""The terms of s. 23A(2) make it plain that the decision called for by s. 23A(1)(b) is not in fact a medical or technical decision, even if the decision itself is likely, if not certainly, to be one that will have been informed by evidence of that type or character. Section 23A(2) makes is plain, as the Second Reading Speech was at pains to emphasise, that the factual matter requiring determination is at large, and is not in any way to be constrained or limited by expressions of opinion about it. It is abundantly clear that the opinion is one that calls up consideration of an objective community standard, being whether the extent of the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter"". 

307The conduct of the accused in the period leading up to OB's death establishes that she regarded OB as imperfect, that she saw her as an interference in her life, and that she wanted to rid herself of her because she perceived, contrary to all medical opinion, that she had a genetic abnormality. She effectively regarded OB as an imposition. 

308Whilst accused's desire to learn more about OB's suggested genetic abnormality by researching the internet is understandable, her accessing of an article regarding death by drowning is not. The latter is consistent only with an intention to kill OB.

309Consistent with all of those considerations, there is evidence of a lack of affection being displayed by the accused to OB in the period leading up to OB's death, and an associated lack of bonding between them. Indeed, Ms Dinov's observations on one occasion were that the accused had physically treated OB inappropriately. There is also evidence of the accused having experienced a need to rid herself of OB. Amidst all of this, OB was a defenceless 6 month old child who completely relied upon the accused.

310I have had regard to the medical evidence of the nature of the accused's illness. Clearly, the accused was suffering a disturbance of the mind in the period leading up to the time of OB's death. However, this is not a case in which the accused's mental disorder was constantly at a level which completely prohibited her from functioning. Professor Greenberg acknowledged that there were periods when the accused was functioning, and when she conducted her life accordingly. Professor Buist regarded aspects of the accused's behaviour in the period between June to November 2010, such as attending medical appointments, socialising with friends, attending to her personal appearance and enquiring about test results as being indicative of focus, albeit that there were times when she became overwhelmed and where the focus could not be sustained (T262 L5-8). Moreover, there is no evidence that the accused was suffering from any particular symptom(s) of her illness on the morning of 18 November 2010, much less experiencing some psychotic episode.

311In all of these circumstances, I am not satisfied, bearing in mind the community standards to which I must have regard, that the accused's mental impairment was so significant as to warrant a reduction in her blameworthiness. It follows that the partial defence provided by s. 23A is not made out. 

Conclusion as to the offence committed by the accused
312It follows from the above that I am satisfied that on the limited evidence available, the accused committed the offence charged, namely the murder of OB. Neither of the partial defences to an allegation of murder are made out.

The limiting term
313Had this hearing been a trial before a jury, and had the accused been found guilty of murder, I would have imposed a term of imprisonment. In these circumstances, pursuant to s. 23(1) of the Act, I must nominate a limiting term. In doing so, I do not set a non-parole period. Before nominating such a term I propose to give counsel for the accused the opportunity to put such submissions to me as he considers appropriate. 

ORDERS
314I make the following order:

(1)On the limited evidence available, I find that the accused committed the offence charged, namely that on 18 November 2010, at North Strathfield in the State of NSW, she did murder OB.

2765566,R v Khoda Doost [2014] NSWDC 327,"Judgment


	
	Ruhollah Khoda Doost has made a release application. That is an expression used by the Bail Act 2013. He has made this application because he has been charged with various offences and has been refused bail.
	
	
	Mr Khoda Doost is a 31 year old man from a Kurdish community in Iran. He travelled to Australia by boat and arrived at Christmas Island on 18 August 2010. He is classified as an âunlawful non-citizenâ and has been held in detention since then. He has been held in detention at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre. His parents and four siblings are overseas.
	
	
	Whilst he has been in detention, between 7 May and 20 August this year, he has committed a number of offences. Some of them are more serious than others. He has assaulted officers of the agency which is charged with responsibility for managing the detention centre. The assaults have been physical and include biting and hitting. In addition, he has been charged with threatening behaviour towards some officers. He has charged at them. Finally, he has been charged with exposing himself in a public place.
	
	
	He was arrested and charged for a number of these alleged offences on 19 August this year. He was given bail and permitted back into the detention centre. But the following day he committed the last offence, namely the one on 20 August 2014, where he hit one of the officers on the face. He therefore committed that offence whilst on bail.
	
	
	Ms E Lloyd appears for Mr Khoda Doost today on this application. Ms AÂ Karavias appears for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions who is prosecuting Mr Khoda Doost for these alleged offences. Both have drawn my attention to the legislation. It is important for me to apply it.
	
	
	Section 17(1) of the Bail Act 2013 says that I âmust, before making a bail decision, consider whether there are any unacceptable risksâ. Ms Karavias claims that there are two unacceptable risks of the kind specified in that section, namely, an unacceptable risk that Mr Khoda Doost will commit another serious offence or that he will endanger the safety of individuals in the detention centre. She has carefully in her submissions (which are part of exhibit A) gone through the matters which are the only matters which I may consider in deciding whether there is an unacceptable risk. The considerations in respect of almost all of the matters point positively towards an unacceptable risk. In particular, there is evidence that while in detention Mr Khoda Doost âhas been involved in numerous incidents of aggressive and abusive behaviour towards staffâ, as Ms Karavias argues in paragraph 20 of her submissions.
	
	
	Ms Lloyd points to two particular matters which I have to take into account in considering the unacceptable risk. One is the length time which her client is likely to spend in custody if bail is refused. Evidently Mr Khoda Doost is defending the charges and a trial date has been fixed for June next year. He was taken into custody in September this year. Ms Lloyd points out that he will be in custody for almost ten months before his trial.
	
	
	Ms Karavias fairly acknowledges that that period of custody is likely to be greater than any prison sentence, or at least any equivalent of a non-parole period that would be imposed in respect of the offences.
	
	
	The second factor relied upon by Ms Lloyd in particular is the special vulnerability of her client. There are psychiatric reports in respect of Mr Khoda Doost which point to him being very vulnerable psychiatrically. Ms Lloyd points to the fact that for the last four months in custody there has been only one incident of misbehaviour - it had to do with him fouling his cell. On the other hand, there have been significant instances of self-harming behaviour, which she acknowledges also occurred in the Villawood Detention Centre. She points to evidence that he has been moved around a lot since he has been bail refused which will affect his stability. She also points to psychiatric evidence that says that the âuse of isolation and strict behaviour management is contraâindicated in a man with organic brain deficits and a significant disorderâ. That is an opinion expressed by a psychiatrist, Dr Newman. She also goes on to express the view that Mr Khoda Doost âwill deteriorate in this situation and develop increasingly difficult behavioursâ.
	
	
	Ms Lloyd in particular relies on s 20 of the Bail Act. It provides that I âmay refuse bail for an offence only ifâ I am âsatisfied that there is an unacceptable risk that cannot be sufficiently mitigated by the imposition of bail conditionsâ. After canvassing a number of conditions which, it turned out, were not available under the statute, Ms Lloyd emphasised the conduct condition which is the subject of s 25. She acknowledged that the stringent conduct conditions - which Ms Karavias acknowledged would be appropriate if bail was granted - would be in order. They include conditions that Mr Khoda Doost must not âassault, molest, harass, threaten or otherwise interfereâ with persons in charge of him in the detention centre, nor engage in any other intimidating conduct. There is a condition that he accept reasonable directions from officers in charge of any facility that he occupies.
	
	
	As McCallum J, as her Honour then was sitting at first instance, said in R v SKR v DK [2014] NSWSC 816 -
	


âNeither the prospect of refusing bail nor the prospect of releasing them from custody is entirely satisfactory or entirely risk free.â

Her Honour goes on to observe at [15] that âthe Bail Act does not contemplate the absence of any risk if a person is released but the informed balancing of risk.â


	
	The risk in respect of Mr Khoda Doost is significant. He is psychiatrically vulnerable and his behaviour has been deteriorating in a self-harming sense. If he was found guilty of the offences, the time he would spend in custody is likely to be less than the time he would spend in custody awaiting his trial. The imposition of very strict conditions would mean that he would need only to misbehave once or twice for his bail to be revoked and to go back into custody. Indeed, he could not even harass or disobey orders from those in charge of him. To my mind a condition such as the one proposed by Ms Lloyd and acknowledged by Ms Karavias (without conceding that bail is appropriate) would sufficiently mitigate the unacceptable risk posed by Mr Khoda Doost being granted bail.
	
	
	For those reasons, under s 49(3) of the Bail Act 2013 I grant bail to MrÂ Khoda Doost. The conditions of his bail are these--
	



	
	That he reside at such place as may be determined by the Minister of Immigration
	
	
	That he must not assault, molest, harass, threaten or otherwise interfere with any detention centre staff.
	
	
	That he must not engage in any other conduct that intimidates any detention centre staff.
	
	
	That he be of good behaviour.
	
	
	That he accept reasonable directions from SERCO and immigration officials.
	
	
	That he attend court as and when directed.
	
	
	That he engage in STARTTS counselling.
	


HIS HONOUR: Any other conditions?

LLOYD: No.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Khoda Doost, I have granted you bail. You have won your case. There are strict conditions. You must behave yourself. If you do not behave yourself you will be back in gaol.

Anything else?

KARAVIAS: Your Honour, just the small matter of extending the time to file if that was okay

HIS HONOUR: You said that, whatâs that?

KARAVIAS: We were due to file by tomorrow, we will be seeking to 30 January to finalise the charges on the indictment. There will be nothing extra, itâs just a matter of drafting--

HIS HONOUR: Is that opposed?

LLOYD: No, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Whatâs the direction that I give?

KARAVIAS: To extend the time for filing of the indictment to 30 January.


	
	In this case I extend the time for the filing of the indictment to 30 January 2015.
	


KARAVIAS: Thank you, your Honour.

LLOYD: Your Honour, I just might enquire what happens with Mr Khoda Doost, normally heâs released to SERCO?

HIS HONOUR: Well we donât know. Condition one is that he has got to be released to some accommodation approved by the - and in any case I think he would need to be processed downstairs. Is that right?

CORRECTIVE SERVICES OFFICER: We have a detention order from--

HIS HONOUR: Say that again?

CORRECTIVE SERVICES OFFICER: We have an Immigration detention order for him.

HIS HONOUR: What does that mean? Sorry, what does that mean?

CORRECTIVE SERVICES OFFICER: We are instructed to return him to our custody and he will be returned to Immigration custody.

HIS HONOUR: There you go.

KARAVIAS: Thank you, your Honour.

LLOYD: Thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you, Corrective Services. Anything else?

LLOYD: No, thank you.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you Ms Lloyd, Ms Karavias.

		11 May 2015",2014-12-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2765568,R v Bradbury [2014] NSWSC 1753,"Judgment

1Mathews AJ: The applicant, Brian Bradbury, is seeking the grant of a certificate under s 2 Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (""the Act"") in relation to criminal proceedings against him which were discontinued by the Director of Public Prosecutions (""DPP"") shortly before his trial was due to commence.

2The background of the matter, briefly, is as follows. On 11 October 2011 the applicant's wife, Lynette Bradbury, was killed in her home in Kerrie Road, Oatlands. Considerably later, on 31 July 2013, Mr Bradbury was charged with her murder. He was initially taken into custody, but was released on conditional bail on 22 August 2013. On 14 November 2013 he was committed for trial by the Parramatta Local Court after waiving his right to a committal hearing. He was first arraigned in this Court in February 2014, and a plea of not guilty was entered. His trial was listed for hearing on Monday 3 November 2014, with an estimated duration of five to six weeks. On 31 October 2014, only three days before the trial was due to commence, the matter was listed for mention and the Crown Prosecutor informed the Court that the DPP had directed that there were to be no further proceedings taken against Mr Bradbury. He was accordingly discharged and the trial date vacated. At that point his counsel applied for a certificate under s 2 of the Act. Such a certificate, if granted, would enable Mr Bradbury to apply to the Director-General of the Attorney General's Department for payment, from consolidated revenue, of the costs he incurred in the criminal proceedings against him.

3Section 2 of the Act, as relevant here, provides as follows:
2(1) The Court or Judge or Magistrate in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may:

(a) where, after the commencement of a trial in the proceedings, a defendant is acquitted or discharged in relation to the offence concerned, or a direction is given by the Director of Public Prosecutions that no further proceedings be taken, or

(b) ...

grant to the defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in section 3 and relating to those proceedings.

(2) For the avoidance of doubt, a certificate may be granted in accordance with subsection (1)(a) following an acquittal or discharge of a defendant at any time during a trial, whether a hearing on the merits of the proceedings has occurred or not. 

(3) In this section, trial in relation to proceedings includes.....preliminary proceedings that form part of the trial, for example, a voir dire. 

4Section 3 of the Act provides as follows:
3(1) A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Magistrate granting the certificate: 

(a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and

(b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.

5The phrase ""all the relevant facts"" is defined in s 3A(1)(b) of the Act to include ""any relevant facts that the defendant has, on the application for the certificate, established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate"".

6At first sight, it might have appeared that the current application faced a potential hurdle in that s 2 is restricted to situations where, as relevant here, the DPP's direction to withdraw proceedings against Mr Bradbury occurred ""after the commencement of a trial in the proceedings"". The DPP's direction in this case was, as already mentioned, made the week before the jury trial was due to commence. This issue came before the Court of Appeal earlier this year. In JC v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 228, Basten JA (with whom Beazley P and Ward J agreed) decided that for the purposes of this section, a person's trial commences when he or she is first arraigned and pleads not guilty in the court where the trial is to take place. In the present case this occurred in February 2014, more than eight months before Mr Bradbury was discharged. It follows that this provision potentially applies in the present case.

7Two issues require determination in this case. The first, pursuant to s 3(1)(a) of the Act, is whether I am satisfied that, had the prosecution been in possession of all the relevant facts before the proceedings were instituted, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings. The second, pursuant to s 3(1)(b), is whether any act or omission of Mr Bradbury that might have contributed to the continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances. The significant dispute in this case relates the second issue, and I will be returning to discuss it shortly. Indeed, the Crown does not dispute the first matter. Nevertheless, I am required to make a positive finding relating to it. I therefore propose to briefly describe the factual background of this matter, which is central to the first issue and potentially relevant to the second.

8Both Mr and Mrs Bradbury worked in different capacities and in different shifts at Westmead Hospital. Late on the night of 31 October 2011 Mr Bradbury returned home from work to find his wife's body lying in the rear bedroom of their house, with her hands and feet bound and a black towel covering her head. Nearby was a 2 kilogram hand weight which belonged to Mr Bradbury. A subsequent post mortem examination showed that the victim had died as a result of blunt force injuries, most but not all of which were probably inflicted by blows from the hand weight. 

9Mr Bradbury has always denied having any involvement in his wife's killing. There were no eye witnesses, and the case against him was based entirely on circumstantial evidence. He had a history of a gambling addiction, which had sometimes led to tensions in the marriage, and this aspect of the matter assumed considerable prominence in the case against him as set out in the Crown Case statement. Without going into details at this stage, I can say that even on the face of the Crown Case statement, it always seemed to me that this was a particularly weak circumstantial case. It largely depended on inferences to be drawn from difficulties in their relationship because of Mr Bradbury's gambling, from the fact that there had been no forcible entry to the house and there had been only minimal disturbance inside it, and a few other relatively minor factors.

10The written submissions of the defence, in support of the current application, describe the circumstances surrounding the killing in considerably greater detail than the Crown Case statement did. This additional material shows the matter in a completely different light. Indeed, the overall impression after reading these submissions is that Mr Bradbury was a very unlikely candidate as his wife's murderer. Yet virtually all this ""new"" information was apparently obtained from the prosecution brief, which was said to amount to nearly 7,000 pages. 

11It is unnecessary for present purposes to go into the details of the additional material, but I propose to mention a few of the more prominent matters. First, the fact that there was no forced entry into the house was rendered insignificant by the fact that the laundry door was closed but unlocked. Moreover, a diamond patterned rubber glove-finger impression was found on both the external and internal laundry doors, as well as on the roll of tape that was attached to the bindings placed on the deceased. These prints were inconsistent with police-issue gloves, and no gloves were found inside the house which could have left them. Then there is the matter of the three young men. A neighbour later told the police that two days before the killing she saw three young men walking on the road not far from the Bradbury home. They were talking about doing a robbery, and one of them said ""Let's do it on Halloween"", which was the day the deceased was killed. On the evening of the killing another neighbour saw three young men, of similar description, walking towards the entrance of an easement which in turn gave easy access to the back yard of the Bradbury house, and then to the laundry door. One of them was cradling a piece of timber in his arms. In this regard, although the hand weight was the only weapon found at the scene, a number of the deceased's injuries were not consistent with having been inflicted by it, and could have been inflicted by a length of timber. Finally there was the matter of timing. The Crown case was that Mr Bradbury killed his wife that afternoon, within the short time (10 to 12 minutes) between her arriving home from work and his leaving for work. Given the sustained nature of the attack on the deceased, including the binding of her body, it would have been extremely difficult, to say the least, for him to have done everything in that time which the murderer or murderers apparently did. And there was certainly no time for him to have done these things after he returned home from work later that night and before he ran next door to tell a neighbour about finding his wife's body. Moreover another neighbour heard a thumping noise from inside the Bradbury home at about 6.30 that evening, at much the time that the three young men could have gained entry. On the prosecution case the deceased was already dead by then, and Mr Bradbury had left for work some hours earlier.

12On the basis of all this material I have no difficulty at all in finding, within the terms of s 3(1)(a) of the Act, that if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings against Mr Bradbury.

13This takes me to s 3(1)(b), and to the substantial matter in issue on this application. The Crown opposes the granting of a certificate upon the following bases: first, that although he was legally represented, Mr Bradbury waived committal proceedings under s 68 Criminal Procedure Act, 1986. As a result, the Crown submits, the prosecution authorities were entitled to think that there was implicit acceptance of a cogent and prima facie case. Secondly, his lawyers at no stage, either before or after his arraignment, applied to the DPP for a nolle prosequi. It was not ""reasonable in the circumstances"", it is submitted, for the defence to allow the matter to proceed to trial if the contended shortcomings in the Crown case have always been patent and incurable. Accordingly, the Crown contends that there should be no award of costs. Alternatively, the liability for costs should be reduced in proportion to the omissions of the applicant. 

14There are two matters raised by this submission. The first is whether, as a matter of law, s 3(1)(b) applies to procedural acts or omissions such as occurred in the present case. The second is whether the particular acts or omissions of the defence, as relied on by the Crown, were ""reasonable in the circumstances."" I shall discuss the matter of law first.

15There can be no suggestion that any act or omission of the defence contributed to the institution of the proceedings against Mr Bradbury, given that the two matters relied upon by the Crown occurred well after those proceedings had been commenced. Accordingly, we are concerned here only with ""acts or omissions that contributed, or might have contributed, to the continuation of the proceedings"". 

16The defence submits that s 3(1)(b) is not aimed at the routine procedural matters which are relied upon by the Crown in this case. Rather, the section is concerned with defence failures to disclose factual material, or to otherwise mislead the prosecution.

17The defence referred me to a number of cases involving applications under s 2 of the Act, in which the courts have discussed the scope and meaning of s 3. These have generally focussed upon the interpretation and application of s 3(1)(a). Indeed none of them has directly raised any issue under s 3(1)(b). However some judgments have commented on the scope of this provision. In R v Manley [2000] NSWCCA 196 Simpson J. said: 
""The subparagraph permits an inquiry as to whether the applicant unreasonably withheld any information or evidence that might, if provided to the Crown, have influenced its decision to continue with the prosecution.""

18This observation was made in relation to the circumstances of that particular case, in which no specific act or omission on the part of the defence had been identified by the Crown as giving rise to an issue under s 3(1)(b). 

19In R v Hatfield (2001) 96 A Crim R 169 the same judge, Simpson J, said in relation to s 3(1)(b):
""That provision is directed to circumstances in which an accused person may, by making admissions or other statements indicating guilt, or otherwise, have led the prosecution authorities to bring the charge, or set them on a false trail (see, for example Palvey at 400), or has withheld, unreasonably (having regard to the adversarial nature of criminal proceedings), evidence that contradicts or casts a different light on the prosecution case (Manley at 220 [78]; 587 [78]).

20In Mordaunt v DPP (NSW) (2007) 171 A Crim R 510 McColl JA listed the principles to be extracted from the authorities dealing with applications for a s 2 certificate. In relation to s 3(1)(b), her Honour said as follows:
""Section 3(1)(b) recognises that tactical considerations and decisions are legitimate in the defence of criminal charges, and the potential value to an accused person of retaining the element of surprise in the confrontation of prosecution witnesses, or the presentation of the defence case; it will primarily be directed to omissions, for example cases in which defence material has been, for tactical or strategic or other reasons, withheld from the prosecution; it is also wide enough to encompass positive acts such as the (probably more unusual) case where the defence has deliberately in some way misled the prosecution; it is not in every case where defence evidence has been deliberately withheld from the prosecution that a court will consider that the omission to supply the material to the prosecution was not reasonable in the circumstances.""

21With this background I return to discuss the circumstances of the present case. The two matters relied upon by the Crown, as already indicated, were the defence's waiver of the committal proceedings and its failure to apply for a nolle prosequi. The second matter can be dealt with quickly and briefly. There is and never should be any obligation upon an accused person, no matter how weak the case may be against him or her, to apply for a nolle prosequi, or to otherwise point out the weaknesses in the prosecution case. The obligation is and remains upon the prosecution throughout the proceedings to ensure that there is sufficient evidence to support its case. If, as here, the Crown only realises late in the day that there is little or no substance in its case against the accused, it can hardly blame the accused for its own failure to recognise this matter earlier.

22The situation is slightly different in relation to the waiver of the committal proceedings, in that this involved a deliberate decision on the part of the defence. But it was entirely a procedural decision, which in no way influenced the apparent cogency or otherwise of the Crown case. It has to be remembered that the DPP has power to override a magistrate's decision in committal proceedings, whether the decision be to commit a person for trial or to discharge the person. The Crown submits that the defence's waiver of the committal proceedings in this case entitled the Crown ""to think that there was implicit acceptance of a cogent and prima facie case."" But even if this was a rational conclusion to be drawn by the Crown from a defendant's decision to waive committal proceedings (as to which I have substantial reservations) it is still incumbent upon the Crown to assess the strength or otherwise of its own case. There is no obligation on the defence to point out its weaknesses. 

23The decisions I referred to earlier in this judgment, in which the scope of s 3(1)(b) was discussed, have all suggested that this provision applies in relation to an accused person who has either withheld relevant factual information from the prosecution or has provided misleading information. In both those situations it is entirely appropriate, in my view, that an assessment should be made as to the reasonableness of the person's actions or omissions before he or she is to be granted a certificate under the Act. But the same cannot be said in relation to purely procedural decisions made by the defence, such as those which were made in this case.

24It follows that, on my finding there was no act or omission of the defence in this case that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of these proceedings under s 3(1)(b).

25This finding makes it unnecessary to consider the reasonableness or otherwise of the acts which were relied upon by the Crown. However for the sake of completeness I should say that I would, in any event, have found this matter in favour of the defence, on the basis of the affidavit of Janet Manuell SC, sworn on 20 November 2014 and filed on behalf of the defence. Until the issue under s 3 (1)(b) arose, Ms Manuell was counsel for the defence. She was first briefed in the matter in October 2013, and it was on her advice that Mr Bradbury elected to waive the committal hearing in this matter. In the affidavit she gives her reasons for advising this course, which I consider to be entirely reasonable in the circumstances. Similarly, I am satisfied that the defence's failure to apply for a nolle prosequi in this case was reasonable in the circumstances outlined in Ms Manuell's affidavit.

26For the reasons given above I am satisfied of the matters referred to in both s 3(1)(a) and s 3(1)(b) of the Act. I therefore grant Mr Bradbury a certificate pursuant to s 2 of the Act relating to the criminal proceedings against him. The certificate, signed by me and dated today's date, is hereby handed to his representatives.
