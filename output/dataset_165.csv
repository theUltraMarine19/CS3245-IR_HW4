ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Murder—Trial judge—Charge to
jury—Indirect comment on failure of accused to testify—Canada Evidence Act,
R.S.C. (1906), c. 145, s. 4, subs. 5.

The appellant was charged with the murder of
his mother. The trial judge, in instructing the jury, made the following
remarks: “The doctor who made the autopsy has declared that the death must have
occurred at

[Page 113]

seven o’clock in the
morning or even before. The accused was at that time in the house according to
his own declaration to police officers. The accused was then alone with his
mother when she was killed; and if so, the defence should have been able to
explain by whom the murder has been committed, because such a brutal murder
could not have been committed without the knowledge of the accused.”

Held that,
although (the language of the charge might be understood1 as
relating to a failure of the accused to give an explanation to police officers
or others, it is also easily and naturally capable of being under stood as
relating to the failure of the accused to testify upon that subject at the
trial; and therefore such language is obnoxious to the imperative direction of
subs. 5 of s. 4 of the Canada Evidence Act which requires the trial judge
to abstain from any comment upon the failure of an accused to take advantage of
the privilege which the law gives him to be a witness at the trial in his own
behalf. The accused is entitled to a new trial.

APPEAL from the decision of the Court of
King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, upholding the conviction of the appellant for murder.

The material facts of the case and the
question at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now
reported.

Alleyn Taschereau K.C. and J. E. Bédard K.C. for the appellant.

Arthur Fitzpatrick K.C. and V. Bienvenu K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

Duff J.—As a new trial is necessary, and since the crime with which the
accused is charged is one of the greatest gravity, it is important to adhere
rigorously to the practice of refraining from any comment on the circumstances of the case, beyond that which is strictly
necessary in order to elucidate the point upon which the decision of the appeal
turns.

It should be said at the outset that the
jurisdiction of this court rests upon the dissent of Mr. Justice Allard, and in
particular upon his view, in which he was not in agreement with his colleagues,
that the learned trial judge, in instructing the jury, had failed to observe
the imperative direction of subs. 5 of s. 4 of the Canada Evidence Act, which,
in effect, requires the trial judge to abstain from any comment upon the failure
of the accused to take advantage

[Page 114]

of the privilege which the law gives him to be a
witness at the trial in his own behalf.

The learned trial judge said:

Le docteur Marois a fait l’autopsie à trois heures et quart, et si vous croyez son
témoignage (c’est un homme dont le témoignage a du poids), il a déclaré que la
mort avait dû arriver à sept heures, ou à six heures et même avant, du matin.

Voilà les circonstances qui enveloppent la
mort de la défunte.

Si la mort, mes amis, remonte à six heures ou
à sept heures du matin, où était l’accusé à ce moment-là, vers sept heures ou
six heures du matin, même plus à bonne heure? A la maison. A la maison. Car,
d’après sa propre déclaration, il n’est sorti qu’à huit heures du matin.

Il était donc seul avec sa mère à la maison
quand la mort est arrivée et si l’accusé était seul avec sa mère quand elle a
été tuée et égorgée, la défense aurait dû être capable d’expliquer par qui ce
meurtre a été commis. Car une pareille boucherie n’a pas dû se faire, sans que
l’accusé en eut connaissance.

It seems to be reasonably clear that, according
to the interpretation which would appear to the jury as the more natural and
probable one, the comment implied in this passage upon the failure of la défense to explain who committed the
murder would, having regard to the circumstances emphasized by the learned
trial judge, be this, namely, that it related to the failure of the accused to
testify upon that subject at the trial. It is conceivable, of course, that such
language might be understood as relating to a failure to give an explanation to
police officers or others; but the language of the charge is so easily and
naturally capable of being understood in the other way, that it seems plainly
obnoxious to the enactment referred to, subs. 5 of s. 4, R.S.C., c. 145. The
law, in our opinion, is correctly stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart
in Rex v. Gallagher[1], in
these words:

* * * it is not what the judge intended but
what his words as uttered would convey to the minds of the jury which is the
decisive matter. Even if the matter were evenly balanced, which I think it is
not, and the language used were merely just as capable of the one meaning as
the other, the position would be that the jury would be as likely to take the
words in the sense in which it was forbidden to use them as in the innocuous
sense and in such circumstances I think the error would be fatal.

There must be a new trial.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Reserved case—Insufficiency of
the stated case—Authority to order copy of evidence—Arts. 1017, 1024 Cr.C.

By virtue of the combined effect of sections
1017 and 1024 of the Criminal Code, the Supreme Court of Canada, when it deems
it necessary, may require the trial judge to supplement the material submitted
by him as a reserved case stated pursuant to an order of the court of appeal,
by furnishing a copy of such parts of the evidence at the trial as are material
to the disposition of the questions directed to be submitted.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, upholding the conviction of the
appellant and dismissing the application made by him for a new trial on a
stated case.

Laflamme K.C. and Bazin K.C. for the
appellant.

Bertrand and Fontaine for the respondent.

The Chief
Justice (for the court).—The accused was convicted on
the 2nd December, 1922, of an offence under s. 477 of the Criminal Code by the
Court of the Sessions of the Peace of the District of St. Hyacinthe; and the
judge of that court having dismissed the application of the accused to have
questions of law reserved for the consideration of the Court of King's Bench,
an order was made by that court giving leave to appeal and directing the judge

to state a case for the consideration of this
court; and to reserve for the decisions of this court the following questions
of law:

1. Did the indictment upon which the accused
was arraigned, tried and convicted in this case disclose the commission of a
criminal offence?

2. Was the said promissory note a false
document as described by the code, article 335?

3. Was the said promissory note a forged
document, as required by article 466 of the code?

4. Was the said promissory note a document
such as described by article 477 of the Criminal Code?

5. Is there entire absence of proof of any
intention to defraud on the part of the accused when signing and uttering the
said document?

6. Was the evidence made by the Crown
relating to the said note of $3,500 dated 2nd June, 1921, payable to Dame Euphémie
Gauthier Reeves, to the promissory note of $1,500 dated 2nd November, 1921,
payable

[Page 729]

to H. Ernest Benoit, to the promissory note
of $4,000 dated 12th November, 1921, payable to Alexander Choinière and to the
note of $2,500 payable to one Pothier admissible in evidence? and that the said
stated case be in due course transmitted to the clerk of the court with the
record.

A document was accordingly forwarded by the
judge of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace to the Court of King's Bench,
which was treated by the latter court as being a stated case within the meaning
of this order. Apparently the notes taken by the judge at the trial, if any,
were not sent to the Court of King's Bench, nor was that court furnished with a
shorthand note of the evidence.

In the opinion of the majority of the court the
facts stated in the case as framed by the learned trial judge are not of such a
character as to make it possible to answer question 5 in the negative, and in
the absence of a complete statement of the material evidence it is obviously
impossible to answer it in the affirmative. In respect of this question there
was a dissenting judgment in the Court of King's Bench.

The order of the Court of King's Bench seems to
have contemplated a stated case which should in itself contain a full account
of the evidence given material to that question or that the Court of King's
Bench should be put in possession of a note of the evidence taken at the trial.
In these circumstances, in order that this court may be in possession of the
information necessary to enable it to give an affirmative or a negative answer
to the question, the proper course seems to be to direct that the judge of the
Court of the Sessions of the Peace furnish to this court a copy of such parts
of the evidence given at the trial as may be material.

By the combined effect of subsections 1017 and
1024 of the Criminal Code this court seems to have authority to make such an
order.",1923-10-22 00:00:00,CA Supreme Court

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Appeal—Bail—Jurisdiction—Section
1019 Cr. C.

A judge of the Supreme Court
of Canada has no jurisdiction to admit to bail an accused person pending his
appeal to this court, such jurisdiction being conferred by section 1019 (1) of
the Criminal Code upon the Chief Justice of the appellate court or a judge of
that court designated by him.

APPLICATION on behalf of the
appellant for an order that he be admitted to bail pending his appeal to this
court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.

The appellant was convicted on
October 16, 1923, on a charge of having had carnal knowledge of a girl under
sixteen, and sentenced to imprisonment for one year. Appeal was taken from the
sentence to the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia, and the same was dismissed on
November 22, 1923, but one judge of the Court of Appeal dissented.
Under section 1024 of the Criminal Code, the appellant then appealed to the
Supreme Court of Canada.

The appellant was admitted to
bail pending the hearing before the court of first instance, and also pending
his appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia; but, upon application
to the Court of Appeal to admit him to bail pending the determination of his
appeal to this court, the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal held that that
court had no jurisdiction, presumably considering that, in-

[Page 2]

asmuch as an appeal had been
taken to the Supreme Court of Canada, the Court of Appeal was functus
officio. Hence the application to this court.

Section 1019 (1) of the Criminal
Code, as enacted by section 9 of 13-14 George V, c. 41, reads as follows:—

1019 (1). The Chief Justice
or the Acting Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, or a judge of that court to
be designated by him, may, if it seems fit, on the application of an appellant,
admit the appellant to bail pending the determination of his appeal.

Smellie K.C. for the
appellant.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—On this
application coming before me in chambers I could not find in the Criminal Code
jurisdiction given me to make the order asked for. After consultation with such
of my brother judges as were available, forming with myself a majority of the
court, we have come to the conclusion that this court has no jurisdiction to
make the order but that section 1019 (1) of the Criminal Code confers
jurisdiction upon the Chief Justice or the acting Chief Justice of the
Provincial Court of Appeal, or upon a judge of that court to be designated by
him, to admit the appellant to bail pending the determination of his appeal. The
latter words of the section ""the determination of his appeal"" must be
construed as extending to the continuance of his appeal from the provincial
Court of Appeal to this court and that therefore the jurisdiction to admit the
appellant to bail pending the appeal here rests with the judge specially named
in that section.

Application is refused.",1923-12-15 00:00:00,CA Supreme Court

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Charge of murder—Warrant
against accused in United States as undesirable—Admissions before, emigration
officers— Admissibility of evidence—Voluntary statement.

A warrant of arrest having been issued
against the appellant on a charge of murder committed in a lumber camp near
Quebec, his presence in the City of Detroit was discovered a year later by a
Canadian detective. Instead of instituting extradition proceedings, the detective
obtained the arrest of the appellant under a warrant of deportation, as an
undesirable, issued by the U. S. Imigration authorities. On being brought
before two emigration officers and informed that he would be deported, the
appellant declared that he was ""as good as dead"". The officers asked:
""Why?""; and the appellant then answered by making certain admissions
as to his presence at the lumber camp at the time of the murder. At the trial,
the two officers gave evidence as to these statements by the accused.

Held that the
evidence was admissible, as the statements made by the accused were
""voluntary"" within the rule laid down in the case of Ibrahim v
The King ([1914] A.C. 599), Mignault J dubitante.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, upholding the conviction of the
appellant and dismissing the application made by him for a new trial on a
stated case.

[Page 227]

The material facts of the case and the
questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments
now reported.

Alleyn Taschereau K.C. for the appellant.

Lucien Cannon K.C. for the respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—This is an appeal from the Court of King's
Bench of the Province of Quebec, which by a majority upheld the conviction of
the appellant Prosko, or ""Big Mike"" as he was generally called, on
the charge of the murder of a man in one of the lumber camps of Quebec. Prosko had been tried jointly with another man named Janousky before Chief Justice
Sir François Lemieux and a jury. Both were found guilty by the jury; but on
appeal to the Court of King's Bench, the conviction against Janousky was
unanimously quashed and a new trial granted to him, while the conviction
against the appellant Prosko was by a majority of that court upheld, the Chief
Justice Lamothe and Greenshields J. dissenting.

The reasons of the court for quashing the
conviction against Janousky substantially were that certain statements,
admissions or confessions made to the police officers of the city of Detroit by
Prosko when he was in custody there, as to his own and Janousky's connection
with the. murder for which they were being jointly tried were inadmissible as
against Janousky, and calculated to prejudice his receiving a fair and
impartial trial, and this notwithstanding that the trial judge in charging the
jury had fully and explicitly

[Page 228]

told them they were not to consider or give any
weight to these alleged admissions or statements or confessions, as they were
called, of Prosko as against his co-prisoner Janousky.

The court was unanimous on this point of
granting a new trial to Janousky but a majority, as I have stated, held, and in
my opinion, properly that these statements, admissions or confessions of Prosko
were admissible against himself in the circumstances and under the conditions
in which they were made, and that they would not interfere, in Prosko's case,
with the judicial discretion exercised by the trial judge in refusing to grant
the application of counsel for a separate trial of each of the prisoners.

The questions reserved for the consideration of
the Court of King's Bench were as follows:—

(1) Was there error in refusing a separate trial to the accused?

(2) Was there error in admitting the testimony of the two witnesses
Heig and Mitte, as to certain statements or so-called admissions made by one of
the accused, Prosko?

(a) as to
the accused Prosko?

(b) as to
the other accused Janousky?

(c) seeing the admissions made by Prosko
were so made in the absence of Janousky, were the instructions of the trial
judge to the jury that statements made by one of the prisoners did not make
evidence against the other, sufficient?

(3) Was there error in admitting the testimony of the witness Roussin
with respect to certain statements made by Prosko either before or after his
arrest?

(4) Was there error in permitting the Crown to produce before and
exhibit to the jury as exhibits certain objects which were found in the
possession of one or other of the accused on or in the premises occupied by one
or other of them?

So far as Janousky is concerned, the questions
are finally disposed of and we need not concern ourselves with them. As to the
other accused, Prosko, question (3) was abandoned at the hearing before us,
leaving the three questions to be considered by us on this appeal:—

[Page 229]

(1) the refusal of a separate trial to him;

(2) the admission in evidence of the statements or confessions sworn to
by Heig and Mitte as having been made to them by Prosko; and

(3) the production as exhibits of clothing and other articles such as a
mask, a false moustache and an electric torch, said to have been found in a
valise or parcel in Prosko's room in his boarding house in Montreal. With
regard to the first of these questions, I have no difficulty in declining to interfere
with the judicial discretion exercised by the trial judge in refusing to grant
the application for such separate trial for Prosko. It is true the appücation
was made twice; once, when the trial began and, afterwards, when it was
proposed to put in Heig and Mitte's evidence respecting Prosko's statements or
confessions (so-called) to them. But I am quite unable to find any possible
prejudice which could arise to Prosko from this refusal. There might be and in
fact the Court of King's Bench held it to be quite possible that a joint trial
coupled with the admission of such evidence, notwithstanding the judge's charge
to the jury that they were not to consider or give any weight to these alleged
admissions or statements of Prosko as against his co-prisoner, might prejudice
Janousky, and that it was impossible to say what effect they might have had on
the minds of the jurymen. But as regards Prosko, admitting for the moment the
admissibility of such evidence, I cannot find any possible prejudice which its
admission would cause to him.

Then as to the admissibility of this evidence as
against Prosko, I think the statement of Lord Sumner, when delivering the
reasons for the conclusions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in
the case of Ibrahim v. The King[1]
correctly states the rule in that regard:

[Page 230]

It has long been established as a positive
rule of English criminal law that no statement by an accused is admissible in
evidence against him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a
voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either
by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority. The principle is as old as Lord Hale.

See also The King v Colpus[2]; The King v. Voisin[3];Rex v. Cook[4].

I have read the evidence of each of these
witnesses Heig and Mitte most carefully. I concede that they were persons in
authority having at the time Prosko in their custody with the intention of
bringing him before the United States Immigration Board to be examined whether
or not he was an undesirable immigrant to the United States, and with a view to
his deportation being ordered if he was found undesirable.

I fail to find the slightest evidence that
Prosko's statements or confessions were induced or obtained from him either

by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage
exercized or held out

by either Mitte or Heig to him. On the contrary
I conclude that Prosko's statements were absolutely voluntary ones. After
having been told by these witnesses in Detroit that they were going to take up
his case with the United States Immigration officials and have him deported to
Canada, Prosko replied:— ""I am as good as dead if you send me over
there."" The officers in reply to this naturally asked ""Why""? Whereupon
Prosko proceeded to give his statement as given in evidence by these two
witnesses. (It must be remembered that the time when he made these statements
or confessions was before he was brought before the Immigration Board, and that
later, when he

[Page 231]

was brought before that Board he repeated under
oath, as Heig and Mitte say in evidence, the statement he had already made to
them. The Immigration Board on hearing his statement or confession made the
necessary order for his deportation). Under these circumstances I feel bound to
answer the second question in the negative.

As regards the third question to be considered
by us on this appeal, I feel bound to say that I cannot see any reason why the
crown, having by its officer, Roussin, visited the boarding house in Montreal
of Prosko, and having there been shown the rooms said to have been occupied by
Prosko and one Yvasko, should not have produced the articles found there and
put them in as exhibits. If the crown produced any of these articles found in
this room of Prosko's it was bound, in my opinion, to produce all articles
found there.

I do not attach any great importance to the
production of these articles. They consisted in part of an electric flashlight,
a false moustache, several photos of Prosko, a cap and other articles.

The question of their being improperly admitted
as exhibits was not strongly pressed at bar, and even if they were improperly
given in evidence as exhibits, which I do not at all concede, I cannot think it
possible that ""any substantial wrong or miscarriage"" was thereby
occasioned on the trial as regards Prosko.

Unless there was in our opinion such substantial
wrong or miscarriage occasioned, we are forbidden by sec. 1019 of the Criminal
Code to set aside the conviction or direct a new trial.

Under all these circumstances and on my findings
with respect to the questions submitted to us, I am of the opinion that the
appeal must be dismissed.

[Page 232]

Idington J.—Four men entered, during the night of the 27th July, 1918, a lumber camp in the Province of Quebec, for the purpose of robbing the men therein,
and, in the course of such pursuit, shot and killed one of the men there.

Two of the said four were convicted of the
murder and were executed in July, 1920.

Thereafter the appellant and another named
Janousky were placed on trial in Quebec. In their defence they were represented
by the same counsel who asked the court to direct that they be tried
separately, but this privilege was denied them.

The trial resulted in the conviction of both.
Thereupon a stated case was directed by the Court of King's Bench and, upon the
hearing thereof, a new trial was granted Janousky but, by a majority of the
court, denied the appellant.

The learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice
Green-shields dissented from the said denial of a new trial to the appellant.
Hence this appeal here based on some of the grounds taken in such dissent.

The first question so raised is as follows:

(1) Was there error in refusing a separate trial
to the accused.?

The Court of King's Bench having unanimoulsy
arrived at the conclusion that as to Janousky there was error, we have nothing
to say as to that aspect of the case except to make clear the reason for so
distinguishing.

There were many statements made by appellant
which the trial court admitted in evidence against him, and in some of these he
had referred to Janousky, under his nickname of ""little George,"" in
such a way as to implicate him.

[Page 233]

There was a possibility of the jury having been
impressed thereby to the detriment of Janousky and, in that result, to have
confused that and somewhat similar incidents in other features of the case as
presented by the entire evidence, nothwithstanding the clear and express
direction of the learned trial judge to the jury to apply the evidence in such
a way as to avoid such possible error.

There was no such counterpart in the evidence
against Janousky alone as would tend to the confusion thereof with the case
made against the appellant alone.

In the broad salient features of the case
demonstrating the actual perpetration of the crime there was nothing to
confuse. It is merely when the evidence of the identification of the accused,
or either of them, came to be considered by the jury that there was a
possibility of undesirable confusion of thought.

Whatever may have been possible in that regard
relevant to Janousky, and to his detriment, I cannot see how appellant was
likely to have suffered the like from anything in the evidence directed to
Janousky's part, if any, in the matter in question.

Counsel for appellant, indeed did not point to
anything specific in that regard but seemed to rest upon and press the
possibility of appellant having been able to call Janousky as a witness on his
behalf if a separate trial had been granted.

There is nothing specific in way of fact
presented to support this contention.

Nor, so far as I can see, was such a pretension
presented to the learned trial judge.

I cannot see any good ground for the allowance
of this appeal by way of answering this question in the affirmative.

[Page 234]

The next question raised herein is as to the
admissibility of the evidence of Heig and Mitte who swear that appellant, after
having been presented with the decision of the authorities in Detroit that he
was to be deported back to Canada as an undesirable citizen, said ""I am as
good as dead"" which naturally evoked the question ""how is that""?
and he proceeded to to tell a story which, as I read its introduction, was not
improperly induced within the meaning of the rule in that regard as set forth
by Lord Sumner in the case cited to us, as follows:—

It has long been established as a positive
rule of English Criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in
evidence against him unless it is shown by the prosecution to have been a
voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either
by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority. The principle is as old as Lord Hale.

I refer to the case of Ibrahim v. The
King,[5]
at foot of page 609 and top of 610. The dictum from which I quote was
approved in the later case of The King v. Voisin[6].

As pointed out in argument the said case was
decided on other grounds and the ruling only an incident, but nevertheless, this
is a fair presentation of the rule invoked by the dissenting judges in the
Court of King's Bench.

It is the inducement exercised by the officers
in charge that is to be guarded against and not the accidental circumstances of
an arrest and the bearing thereof on the mind of one accused that has to be
guarded against.

And the evidence of each of these witnesses is
introduced by a distant categorical denial of having exercised any of these
practices which would bring the evidence given within the rule against its
admission.

[Page 235]

I think, therefore, the learned trial judge's
ruling was right and that the question raised anent same must be answered in
the negative.

Then as to Roussin's evidence the appellant was
distinctly warned by him upon his arrest that anything he said would be used
against him and hence no ground for the contention set up.

In truth it seems to have been assumed in
argument here as hopeless to argue, if held that the evidence of the American
detectives of statements made by accused, without express warning, was
admissible, then Roussin's story in what he tells, so far as it was
substantially the same as had been told by the said detectives, could not be
rejected.

I am decidedly of the opinion that both were
admissible.

The only other question upon which counsel for
appellant rested his appeal was the fourth question of the stated case, which
reads as follows:

Was there error in permitting the Crown to
produce before and exhibit to the jury as exhibirs certain objects which were
found in the possession of one or other of
the accused on or in the premises occupied by one or other of them?

I, with great respect, find it difficult to
treat such a question seriously. Some of the articles found were not worthy of
serious consideration by the jury, but the false moustache and flashlight, for
example, were important items well worthy of consideration in a case such as
this dependent to so great an extent as it was upon circumstantial evidence.

That which was incapable of being fitted into
the chain of circumstances to be relied upon, of course, would be discarded by
the jury to whom we must attribute common sense.

[Page 236]

It became the duty of the crown officer to
present the suit-case contents as found and let the jury determine what was relevant
and what was not. And then not leave the impression that accused was so intent
in pursuit of easy money that he could think of nothing else, and hence carried
only false moustaches, flashlights or glass cutters.

The question should be answered, as it was by
the majority of the court below, in the negative.

The appeal herein should be dismissed.

Anglin J.—The material facts are sufficiently stated in the judgments
delivered in the Court of King's Bench. Of the three questions argued before us
only one in my opinion called for consideration, viz., whether certain
statements alleged to have been made by the appellant to two American
detectives (Heig and Mitte) were admissible in evidence against him. To both
the other grounds of appeal s. 1019 Cr. G. appeared to me to afford a
sufficient answer. But, having regard to the importance attached to the
statements made to Heig and Mitte by the learned Chief Justice in charging the
jury, the question of their admissibility cannot be thus disposed of.

My only reason for withholding concurrence in
the judgment dismissing the appeal was that, owing to pressure of other work of
the court, I had not had an opportunity of satisfying myself by a study of the
record that the Crown had discharged the burden, which undoubtedly rested upon
it, of establishing that the statements made by the appellant to Heig and Mitte
were voluntary statements, in the sense that they had not been obtained from
him by fear of prejudice or

[Page 237]

hope of advantage exercised or held out by a
person in authority. Ibrahim v. The King[7];
The Queen v. Thompson[8];
The King v. Colpus[9];
The King v. Voisin[10].

The two detectives were persons in authority;
the accused was in my opinion in the same plight as if in custody in
extradition proceedings under a warrant charging him with murder. No warning
whatever was given to him. While these facts do not in themselves suffice to
exclude the admissions, as Duff J. appears to have held in The King v. Kay[11], they
are undoubtedly circumstances which require that the evidence tendered to
establish their voluntary character should be closely scrutinized. Rex v.
Rodney[12].

If I should have reached the conclusion that the
burden on the prosection of establishing the voluntary character of the alleged
admissions had not been discharged, the proper result would have been to order
not the discharge of the appellant (s. 1018 (d) Cr. C.), but his remand for a
new trial (s. 1018 (b) Cr. C.) Since the majority of the court was clearly of
the opinion that the impugned evidence was properly received and the appeal
therefore failed, I did not feel justified in delaying the judgment and
shortening the time available for consideration of the case by the Executive,
merely to complete my own study of the evidence, especially in view of the fact
that the case must in any event go before the Minister of Justice, who may, if
he should entertain any doubt of the propriety of the conviction, grant the
appellant the only relief to which he would in my opinion in any event have
been entitled. (S. 1022 Cr. C.)

[Page 238]

For these reasons, while not dissenting, I
refrained from concurring in the judgment affirming the conviction.

Since the delivery of judgment, however, I have
had an opportunity of considering the material evidence and I think I should
state that I now see no reason to differ from the conclusion reached by the
majority of the Court that the evidence in question was admissible. At all
events the discretion exercised by the learned trial judge in receiving it
could not properly have been interfered with. The King v. Voisin[13].

Brodeur J.—Trois questions nous sont soumises.

La premiére est de savoir si l'accusé Prosko
avait eu raison de demander un procès séparé de son co-accusé Janousky.

Le président du tribunal a refusé cette demande
et les deux accusés ont subi leur procès en même temps et ont été trouvés
coupables de meurtre.

La Cour du Banc du Roi a decidé que Janousky
avait eu raison de demander un procès séparé parce que des aveux faits par son
complice Prosko ont pu lui causer un tort réel et ont pu amener sa
condamna-tion. La Cour du Banc du Roi a été d'opinion que Prosko n'avait
souffert aucun préjudice d'avoir subi son procès en même temps que son
complice. Un nouveau procès séparé a donc été accordé à Janousky, mais a été
refusé à Prosko.

Ce dernier appelle de cette décision.

La preuve au procès a été en général commune aux
deux accusés. Ils ont été vus tous les deux près de la scéne du meurtre, avant
et après. On a trouvé à leurs résidences respectives des effete dont se servent

[Page 239]

d'ordinaire ceux qui font du vol leur principale
occupation. Dans le cas de Prosko, cette preuve de circonstances a été
fortifiée par des aveux qu'il a faits avant et après son arrestation pour
meurtre.

Il est bien évident que ces admissions de Prosko pouvaient lui nuire considérablement;
mais ces aveux pouvaient être prouvés, que Prosko eût été mis seul en
accusation ou qu'il l'eût été avee son complice. Alors un procès séparé ne lui
aurait pas été plus favorable sur ce point. Il y a bien les effets trouvés chez
Janousky dont la mention au procès de Prosko aurait pu lui porter préjudice.
Mais on en a trouvé des semblables chez lui. Alors il me semble que cette
preuve quant aux effets trouvés chez Janousky ne peut pas être considérée comme
ayant cause un tort réel à Prosko. L'article 1019 du code criminel couvre le
cas. Je dirais donc que le président du tribunal n'a pas fait d'erreur en
refusant d'accorder à Prosko un procès séparé.

La deuxième question qui nous est soumise porte
sur des aveux qui auraient été faits par Prosko aux témoins Heig et Mitte.

Le détective Roussin, qui avait été chargé de retrouver
les auteurs du meurtre, avait appris que Prosko pouvait être l'un des
meurtriers et, un an environ après que le crime eût été commis, il l'a retracé
à Détroit, dans les Etats-Unis. Il s'est alors abouché avec deux détectives de
cette dernière ville, Heig et Mitte, et ils ont décidé, pour éviter les frais
d'un procès en extradition, que Prosko serait amené devant les autorités de l’immigration,
qui, si elles trouvaient que Prosko n'était pas un citoyen désirable, pourraient
le déporter des Etats-Unis au Canada.

[Page 240]

On l'arrête pour violation des lois
d'immigration. On lui dit qu'il va être déporté au Canada, et alors il déclare
en présence de Heigh et Mitte qu'il ne veut pas retourner au Canada; et il ajoute:"" I am as good as dead"". Les détectives lui demandent pourquoi, et
alors il raconte qu'il avait été dans un camp avec certains hommes qui avaient
alors commis un meurtre. Ces délarations ont été faites volontairement, sans
aucune menace et sans aucune sollicitation.

Les decisions récentes en Angleterre sont à
l'effet que des déclarations faites comme dans le cas actuel doivent être
reçues par les tribunaux. Ibrahim v. The King[14]; The
King v. Colpus,[15];
The King v. Voisin,[16].
Il est à remarquer que ces déclarations de Prosko ont été faites avant qu'il ne
fût arrêtè pour meurtre. Je suis d'opinion que la cour n'a pas fait d'erreur en
recevant les témoignages de Heig et Mitte.

La troisième question est de savoir si les
effets trouvés dans les chambres des deux accusés pouvaient être produits comme
exhibits dans la cause.

Ces effets ont été produits comme éléments
d'accusa-tion. Il est de régie, surtout dans le cas de meurtre, de produire
devant la cour les effets dont l'accusé aurait pu se servir pour commettre le
crime dont il est accusé. On peut aussi produire des articles qui peuvent
servir à l'identifier.

Il paraît certain dans cette cause que le vol a
été le mobile du crime. Alors je ne vois pas pour ma part d'objection à ce que
l'on produise devant la cour des articles qui sont généralement utilisés par
les voleurs et que l'on trouve en la possession des accusés. Il est

[Page 241]

possible que certains de ces articles n'ont pas
dû servir à la commission du crime. Mais cette circonstance
ne serait pas suffisante pour constituer dans le cas de Prosko un déni de
justice ou un tort grave. Je répondrai donc
négativement à cette troisième question.

En conséquence l'appel doit être renvoyé.

Mignault J.—The only question raised by this appeal which appeared to me at
the hearing to have any substance was whether the evidence of some statements
made by Prosko at Detroit to the American detectives Heig and Mitte should have
been allowed.

When these statements were made Prosko was under
arrest by virtue of a warrant issued by the United States Immigration
authorities, as an undesirable, which warrant was served on him by one Roussin,
a Canadian detective, who was seeking to bring him to trial in Canada on a
murder charge, and instead of instituting extradition proceedings, it was
considered better to have Prosko deported as an un-dersirable when he would of
course be arrested on the murder charge. Roussin brought Prosko before the
Immigration authorities in Detroit, and when informed by them that he would be
deported, Prosko told them that he was as good as dead. Heig and Mitte then
questioned him and it was under these circumstances that he made the statements
which were given in evidence.

I have serious doubts whether this evidence
should have been allowed. The American detectives were persons in authority and
Prosko's exclamation when told that he would be deported shows that he understood

[Page 242]

that his deportation was sought in order to have
him brought to trial in Canada on the charge of murder. He evidently made the
statements he did with the hope to escape deportation and his consequent arrest
for murder, and the American detectives were persons in authority. It is true
that he subsequently made similar admissions in Canada to Roussin, but the
learned trial judge insisted in his charge on the evidence of Heig and Mitte as
corroborating that of Roussin which otherwise the jury might have hesitated to
accept as sufficient, so the introduction of this evidence may have caused a
substantial wrong to the appellant. A majority of the court is, however, of the
opinion, that the evidence of Heig and Mitte was admissible, so that Prosko's
appeal cannot succeed. Under these circumstances I have not entered a formal
dissent, but I cannot do otherwise than express my serious doubts as to the
admissibility of this evidence.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Speedy trial—Election—Requirement
by the Attorney-General—Jury trial—Panel box—66 jurors instead of 60—Sections 446,
777, 778, 825, s.s. 5, 826, 827, 873, 927, 1019 Cr. C.—Arts. 3438, 3455, 3459 R.S.Q.

The appellant was arrested on a charge of
highway robbery, and, when brought before a judge of the Sessions of the Peace,
he did not elect for a speedy trial, pleaded ""not guilty"" and was
duly committed for trial. The Grand Jury found a true bill upon an indictment
preferred by the Attorney-General. The appellant was then arraigned and again
pleaded ""not guilty."" On the day of the trial his counsel made an
application to have the case postponed to the next term of the assizes to
permit the accused to elect for a speedy trial, if he so decided, but the
application was refused. Under article 3438 R.S.Q., sixty petit jurors had been
summoned; but the sheriff, on receiving notices of claims for exemption,
summoned additional jurors and returned before the court the first panel with
the additions made to it. As the claims for exemption were disallowed, the
names of sixty-six petit jurors remained in the panel box. On the day of the
trial, six jurors were absent; none of the jurors called were challenged by the
accused and the twelve called were sworn without any objection, except that
counsel for appellant objected to the fact that the panel box contained more
than the names of sixty jurors. This objection was also overruled, and the
appellant was tried and found guilty. A reserve case was granted the appellant;
and the questions submitted were as to the constitution of the panel and as to
whether the accused had wrongly been refused the right to elect for a speedy
trial.

Held, that the
alleged irregularities are not sufficient to entitle the accused to a new
trial.

Per Idington
J.—The appellant, having previously renounced any desire for a speedy trial and
having later pleaded to the indictment without raising any objection, had
waived any right he had to elect for a speedy trial.

[Page 155]

Per Duff and
Brodeur JJ.—The right of the appellant to elect to be tried summarily had been
taken away by the requirement by the Attorney-General for a jury trial, the
preferment of the indictment by the Attorney-General under sect. 873 Cr. C.,
constituting such requirement within the meaning of sect. 825, s.s. 5, as
enacted by 8-9 Ed. VII, c. 9, s. 2.

Per Anglin and
Mignault JJ.—The application made on behalf of the accused for a postponement
of the trial to permit him to re-elect was not an election for a speedy trial;
and, therefore, there was no refusal to grant acte of an option made by
the accused.

Held, also,
that, in not discharging the six additional jurors, the trial judge exercised a
discretion conferred on him by art. 3459 R.S.Q., and moreover, the appellant,
under the circumstances, did not suffer any substantial wrong on that account.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, dismissing an appeal by the appellant
relating to questions of law arising on his trial and upon a stated case.

The material facts of the case and the
questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments
now reported.

Alleyn Taschereau K.C. for the appellant.

Aimé Marchand K.C. and Lucien Cannon K.C.
for the respondent.

Idington J.—The accused having when charged before the magistrate expressly
renounced any desire for speedy trial without jury and later notwithstanding
pleaded to the indictment without raising any sort of objection thereto, in my
opinion, had waived any legal right he had up to that time to elect for a
speedy trial.

Such was the settled state of the law until the
decision of this court in the case of Giroux v. The King[1].

[Page 156]

I am not quite sure in light of that decision,
what the law so laid down really is, but when applied to this case which is, as
it were, the counterpart of that, I think it has no application.

If that decision should, necessarily, govern in
regard to the point I raise, I would bow to it, though I dissented therein, but
it does not, I think, and therefore I hold the pleading to the indictment,
under the attendant circumstances, fatal to the appellant's contention herein.

There the accused was allowed, even after plea
to an indictment, to withdraw his plea and elect to go to trial before a judge
without a jury.

I thought then there was no jurisdiction in the
courts to so proceed.

This case is quite distinguishable from the case
of Minguy v. The King[2],
where the accused had indicated his desire to elect, as he was entitled to have
done, for a trial without a jury before he was forced to plead to an indictment
and thereby, as I held, improperly deprived of his right to elect.

I am, notwithstanding the doctrine laid down in
the case of Giroux v. The King[3],
unable to see that it necessarily governs this case.

I therefore would answer the first question of
the stated case in the negative.

And as to the second question I am of the
opinion that, under all the attendant circumstances, the error if any, which is
disputed, would not necessarily be fatal to the validity of the trial, and
therefore answer it also in the negative.

The appeal therefore, in my opinion, should be
dismissed.

[Page 157]

Duff J.—The appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed.

1st. As to the constitution of the panel. In
this respect no substantial prejudice was suffered by the accused. It is
unnecessary to repeat the observations contained in the case as stated and
signed by the Chief Justice of the Superior Court and in the judgment of Mr.
Justice Martin with which I concur.

2nd. As to the right of the accused to elect to
be tried by a judge. Admittedly the accused had that right under sections 826
and 827 of the Criminal Code unless by virtue of a requirement by the Attorney-General
under s.s. 5 of sec. 825 Cr. C., that right was taken away. In Minguy v.
The King[4]
I concurred in the opinion of the Chief Justice of this court that where the
Attorney-General prefers a bill of indictment under sec. 873 or where the bill
of indictment is, by the special direction of the Attorney-General, so
preferred that in itself constitutes a requirement that the case should be
tried by a jury within the meaning of section 825, s.s. 5.

I am not at all impressed by the argument that
the power given by section 873 is a different power from that given by s.s. 5
of sec. 825. They are not the same power, no doubt; but it does not follow that
each must be exercised by an independent proceeding. A proceeding under sec.
873 may and prima facie does import a determination that the accused
shall be tried by jury, a determination negativing his right to be tried
without a jury and at all events, in the absence of some qualifying declaration
it is an exercise of the authority given by sec. 825, s.s. 5. I may add that
the decision in Giroux v. The King[5]
(a case in which the judges who took part in it proceeded upon diverse grounds)
is not an authority having any relevancy to this question.

[Page 158]

I think that in this case there is sufficient
evidence and there was sufficient evidence before the trial judge that the
Attorney-General had required that the case should be tried by a jury within
sec. 825, s.s. 5.

It is important, I think, to add that had it not
been for s.s. 5 of sec. 825 of the Criminal Code, I should have been
constrained to hold that in the language of sec. 1019 Cr. C., ""something
not according to law was done at the trial"" and consequently that the
conviction must be set aside. The accused, as I have already said, was entitled,
in the absence of action by the Attorney-General under sec. 825, to have the
benefit of the procedure provided by sections 826 and 827. Through no fault of
his own but through the default of the officers of the Crown he was put upon
his trial without being given the opportunity to take advantage of those
provisions; and had it not been for the intervention of the Attorney-General he
could not, I think, have been tried legally in these circumstances.

It is not so much a question of jurisdiction.
The Court of King's Bench had jurisdiction to decide whether or not the accused
could legally be tried as it had jurisdiction to decide all other questions of
procedure and substantive law touching the liability of the accused to be tried
and convicted of the offence with which he was charged. The point is that the
trial of the prisoner in such circumstances would not have been a trial
according to law; an objection which could properly be raised by way of stated
case and dealt with on appeal under the provisions of the code.

For the reasons given I am of opinion, however,
that these last-mentioned considerations are without application in the present
case.

[Page 159]

Anglin J.—Two questions are
submitted by the reserved case granted the appellant:

1. Was there error in refusing to grant acte of
the option made by the accused for a speedy trial before a judge of the
Sessions without the intervention of a jury?

2. If it was the fact, that cards to the number
of 66, bearing the names, numbers and addresses of 66 petit jurymen were placed
in the panel box for the purpose provided, did it constitute an irregularity or
illegality sufficient to entitle the accused to the relief sought?

One of the learned judges of the Court of King's
Bench dissented from the majority of the court on both points.

(1) Although the argument travelled over the
whole field of the rights of a person committed for trial to elect for a speedy
trial—the duties of the sheriff and the judge, under secs. 826-7, to accord him
an opportunity to make such an election being specially dwelt upon as
imperative and as such affording a basis for the contention that because those
sections had not been complied with, the Court of King's Bench lacked
jurisdiction to try the appellant—the first of the two questions actually presented
for decision lies in a very much narrower compass. The only thing approaching
""an option made by the accused for a speedy trial"" of which the
record contains any evidence is to be found in the following extract from the
procedure book of the Court of King's Bench:

Avant de procéder à tirer au sort les
cartes contenant les noms et les numéros des Petits Jurés, Mtre Alleyn
Taschereau, procureur de l'accusé, demande la remise de la cause aux prochaines
assises, pour permettre à l'accusé de réélire, s'il le juge à propos, suivant
le Code Criminel et ses amendments.

Mtrs Lucien Cannon s'oppose de la part de
la Couronne à cette demande;

La Cour décide qu'il faut procéder.

[Page 160]

The only application made to the court was for a
postponement of the trial to the next assizes to permit the accused to
re-elect, if he should think fit. That motion was simply refused. Apart from
the fact that there had been no previous election and the case was therefore
not one for re-election, what took place at the assize court certainly did not
amount to an election for a speedy trial. There was not even an intimation that
such an election would be made if the postponement asked for were granted.
There was therefore no refusal ""to grant acte of an option made by
the accused for a speedy trial."" He had made no such option and an acte
of such an option therefore was not and could not have been sought or
refused. The first question must be answered accordingly. It is not within our
province, as was held by a majority of this court in the recent case of Scott
v. The King (24th of Feb., 1921), materially to modify, qualify or
enlarge the scope of a question in a reserved case merely because it does not
cover the ground of appeal which counsel presents to the court, although that
should appear to be what the appellant conceives to be his substantial
grievance.

(2) In not discharging the six additional jurors
over the required panel of 60 (R.S.Q., Art. 3438) the court exercised a
discretion conferred on it by R.S.Q., Art. 3459. The six additional jurors
having been lawfully retained I am not satisfied that their names were not
properly placed in the panel box (Crim. Code, s. 927), from which the names of
the petit jury were drawn. As is pointed out by Mr. Justice Martin, only sixty
jurors answered the roll call on the day of the trial. Six were absent. No
juror called for the trial was in fact challenged by the appellant. The only
objection taken on his behalf on this branch of

[Page 161]

the case which appeared to be of moment, viz.,
that the proportion of peremptory challenges which he was entitled to exercise
was disturbed by the presence of the six additional jurors, thus appears to be
lacking in substance. His right of challenge was not in fact affected. Even if
there was something done at the trial not according to law, the right of
challenge not having been interfered with, s. 1019 of the Criminal Code
precludes the granting of a new trial since no substantial wrong or miscarriage
was occasioned.

Brodeur J.—Il s'agit d'un appel dans une cause criminelle. Deux questions
nous sont soumises. La première a trait à la juridiction de la cour qui a
condamné l'accusé. La seconde est de savoir si le petit jury a été validement
constitué.

L'accusé avait été arrêté pour vol à main armée
sous la disposition de l’article 446 du Code criminel. Il a été amené devant le
juge des Sessions de la Paix le 18 septembre 1920, pour y subir sommairement
son procès: mais, comme il en avait le droit, il a opté pour un procès devant
la cour du Banc du Roi (arts. 777-778), c'est-à-dire, un procês par jury.

Le juge des Sessions de la Paix a alors procédé
à l'enquête préliminaire et l'accusé a été, le 12 octobre, condamné à subir son
procês. Le dossier constate qu'avant la déclaration du juge qu'il y avait
matière à procès (commitment) l'accusé s'est évadé de la prison où il était
incarcéré.

Le 13 octobre, un acte d'accusation (indictment)
fut présenté au grand jury par les avocats de la Couronne, qui l’avaient signé
comme suit:

L. A. Taschereau, Attorney-General, by Aimé
Marchand, Lucien Cannon, duly authorized.

[Page 162]

Cet acte d'accusation portait en outre sur le dos
l'inscription suivante signée de la main du Procureur-Général lui-même:

This indictment is preferred by the
undersigned, the Attorney-General for the Province of Quebec.

L. A.
Taschereau,

Attorney-General
for the Province of Quebec.

L'acte d'accusation fut rapporté comme fondé le
même jour par le grand jury et de suite l'accusé fut mis en jugement (arraigned) et il plaida non-coupable.

Le 15, au moment où son procés devait commencer et avant que l'on procédât à
choisir le petit jury, l'accusé par son avocat a demandé verbalement à la cour

la remise de la cause aux prochaines assises
pour permettre à l'accusé de réélire s'il le juge à propos.

La Couronne s'y est objectée et le procès a eu lieu
et l'accusé a été condamné. Il prétend maintenant qu'il a été illégalement
privé du droit d'opter pour un procès expéditif et que lorsque les petits jurés
ont été tirés au sort il y avait dans la boîte où les cartes étaient déposées
soixante-six noms, c'est-à-dire six de plus que le nombre déterminé par la loi.

Ce dernier point ne paraît pas avoir été soulevé en
temps utile. D'ailleurs rien ne démontre qu'aucun texte de loi ait été violé.

Le shérif, sous les dispositions des articles 3438 et 3455 des statuts revisés de Québec, avait le pouvoir d'assigner plus que
soixante jurés. Et si après avoir examiné les demandes d'exemption des jurés il
reste plus de soixante jurés présents, le juge peut renvoyer le surplus. La loi
ne lui en fait pas une obligation: au contraire, elle paraît laisser cela à sa
discrétion. Il peut arriver, en effet, que le terme soit bien chargé, qu'un
grand nombre de causes aient à être décidées et jugées: et alors, suivant sa
discrétion, le juge peut garder

[Page 163]

plus de soixante jurés. C'est ce qui a été fait
dans le cas actuel. Le juge n'a donc violé aucun texte de loi: mais il a simplement exercé une discrétion
qu'il pouvait exercer.

L'autre question qui nous est soumise touche à la
juridiction de la cour et a trait au droit de l'accusé d'opter pour un procès
expéditif.

La Cour du Banc du Roi avait certainement
juridiction pour juger l'accusé. L'offense qui lui était imputée désignait ce
tribunal comme ayant le droit de juger l'accusé.

Un acte d'accusation a été porté contre l'accusé et
le grand jury a rapporté cet acte d'accusation comme bien fondé. Sur le dos de
cet acte d'accusation on trouve la signature du procureur-général déclarant que
cet acte d'accusation avait été présenté au grand jury sur ses instructions
formelles.

Avant l'amendement du code criminel de 1909, un accusé d'une offense comme celle qui
est imputée à Collins avait le
droit absolu de demander à subir son procès devant le juge des Sessions de la
Paix: mais par l'amendement de 1909 ce droit lui est refusé lorsque (825-5) le procureur-général requiert que le procès se fasse devant un jury. La
loi ajoute que le Procureur Général peut faire cette demande bien que l'accusé
ait consenti à être jugé par le juge des Sessions.

Il me semble que la signature du procureur-général
sur l'acte d'accusation constitue
cette demande dont parle l'article 825-5 du code criminel. Je serais enclin à croire d'un autre côtê également
que du moment que le procureur-général, sous l'article 873,
porte devant la grand jury une accusation, qu'il y ait eu
enquête préliminaire ou non, dès ce moment-là la cour du Banc du Roi est dûment
saisie de la cause et qu'elle peut la juger et en disposer. Nous n'avons pas

[Page 164]

à examiner ce qui s'est passé antérieurement; et si
l'accusé, comme il Ta fait dans le cas actuel, demande un procès expéditif, la
cour a parfaitement le droit de lui refuser ce privilége et de procéder à faire
juger la cause par un jury.

Dans le cas actuel, je considère que l'action du
procureur-général en signant lui-même l'acte d'accusation démontre d'une
manière explicite qu'il requérait que la cause fût jugée par un jury (825-5 C.C.). C'est là un droit absolu de la
part du procureur-général, et il a suffisamment exprimé le désir d'exercer ce
droit pour qu'on ne puisse pas prétendre que la cour soit sans juridiction. Il
serait désirable cependant que cette réquisition fût insérée dans le dossier
originaire afin d'enlever au juge des Sessions toute apparence de juridiction.

Nous ne pouvons pas mettre de côté une
condamnation, même s'il été fait quelque chose de non conforme à la loi et si
des instructions erronées ont été données, à moins qu'il n'en soit résulté un
tort réel ou un déni de justice. Je suis incapable de trouver dans la cause
actuelle aucune illégalité qui ait pu constituer un déni de justice (art. 1019 C.Cr.).

La Couronne avait le droit de requérir que l'accusé
subisse son procès devant la Cour Criminelle; la cour, dans sa discrétion, était justifiable de refuser à l'accusé un
ajournement; le choix des petits jurés ne s'est pas fait illégalement. La
condamnation qui a été infligée à l'accusé doit être maintenue.

L'appel doit être renvoyé avec dépens.

Mignault J.—This appeal comes to this court on two questions as to both of
which Mr. Justice Greenshields dissented from the majority judgment of the
Court of King's Bench:

[Page 165]

1. Was there error in refusing to grant acte
of the option made by the accused for a speedy trial before the judge of
the Sessions without the intervention of a jury?

2. If it was the fact that cards to the
number of 66 bearing the names, numbers and addresses of 66 petit jurymen were
placed in the panel box for the purpose provided, did it constitute an
irregularity or illegality sufficient to entitle the accused to the relief
sought?

First question. The appellant's counsel argued
this question as if it were quite a different question, namely, whether under
section 826 et seq., Criminal Code, he should have been brought before a judge
and the statement required by sect. 827 made to him, at which time and on which
statement being made to him he would have been afforded the opportunity of
exercising, if he saw fit, an option for a speedy trial or to be tried in the
ordinary way. I think I sufficiently stated in Minguy v. The King[6], what
procedure should be followed in cases like this one.

But this is not the question we have to answer.
And I propose to reply to the question submitted in the negative because the
appellant never made an option for a speedy trial, and therefore there was no
option of which acte (to use the language of the question) should have
been granted.

This does not necessarily mean that I disagree
with what Mr. Justice Greenshields said on this first point, but under the
question put to the court there is no necessity of expressing any opinion on
this point.

Second point. I would also answer this question
in the negative for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Martin in the Court of
King's Bench, which are entirely satisfactory to me.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN.

Criminal law—Manslaughter—Person killed by
automobile—Criminal liability of driver—Degree of care—Sections 247 and 258 Cr.
C.

The driver of an automobile, who fails to
take reasonable precautions against, and to use reasonable care to avoid,
danger to human life is, under section 247 of the Criminal Code, criminally
responsible for the consequences.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1921] 1
W.W.R. 443) affirmed.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Saskatchewan[1],
on a reserved case for the opinion of that court. The appellant was convicted
of manslaughter for unlawfully killing a workman who was working in a manhole
in the street by striking him with his motor car, and the conviction was
sustained by the Court of Appeal.

The material facts of the case are stated in
the judgments now reported.

Geo. F. Henderson for the appellant.

Harold Fisher for the respondent.

[Page 41]

Idington J.—The appellant whilst in charge of and driving an automobile in
one of the streets of Regina, ran it over an obstacle described as follows by
the learned trial judge:—

The tarpaulin was thrown over a form
extending about five or six feet from north to south, and looking at it from
the north or from the south it was in the shape of an inverted V. The top of
this V would be somewhere between four and five feet high. Possibly nearer four
than five feet. The width of the bottom of the V would be between three and
four feet. The measurements were not given at the trial, but a witness erected
a tarpaulin at the trial, in the presence of the court and jury to represent
its position at the time of the accident.

The structure so described covered a manhole in
the street where three men were working for the provincial telephone
department, and one of them was killed as the result of this adventure on the
part of the appellant.

For so killing that man appellant was indicted
for manslaughter and found guilty thereof.

The street in question was a wide one on which
there was ample room for appellant to have driven the car in question over the
unobstructed part of the street and passed the said structure in safety.

The learned trial judge submitted, after said
conviction, a reserved case containing the following question:!—

1. Did I properly instruct the jury as to
the negligence which under the circumstances of the case, would render the
accused guilty of manslaughter?

2.—In view of the fact that there was no
evidence that the accused saw the deceased nor knew that the deceased was under
the tarpaulin referred to in the evidence, could the accused be found guilty of
manslaughter?

The learned judges of the Court of Appeal with
the exception of Mr. Justice Newlands, answered these questions in the
affirmative and sustained the conviction.

[Page 42]

The opinion of the majority was written by Mr.
Justice Lamont who reviewed at length many decisions which support the judgment
now appealed from, if any needed beyond the relevant section of the Criminal
Code which I am about to quote.

Mr. Justice Newlands held that in light of some
expressions in decisions of long ago that

there must be gross negligence before there
is criminal liability (and that) the want of ordinary reasonable care which an
ordinary prudent man would have observed, although sufficient to render the
accused liable in a civil action, is not sufficient in a criminal case.

Several of the cases he cites were mere nisi
prius expressions which are not at the present day of much value, even if,
as I submit, possibly relevant to the then state of the law.

The law applicable to this case is to be found
in section 247 of the Criminal Code, cited by Mr. Justice Lamont, which reads
as follows:—

247.—Everyone who has in his charge or
under his control anything whatever animate or inanimate, or who erects, makes
or maintains anything whatever which, in the absence of precaution or care may
endanger human life, is under a legal duty to take reasonable precautions
against and use reasonable care to avoid, such danger and is criminally
responsible for the consequences of omitting, without lawful excuse, to perform
such duty.

This was first enacted in the Criminal Code of
1892, section 13.

It leaves no room for the refined distinctions
between ' negligence and gross negligence.

It imposes an absolute duty on the part of him
having charge of that which in its use may endanger human life, to take
precaution and care.

It should not, I respectfully submit, be
frittered away by any refinement on the part of judges.

[Page 43]

The learned trial judge's charge throughout was
absolutely correct until he momentarily, on objection, interjected the remark
that there was a possible distinction between that which would render a man
liable for civil damages for negligence, and that which would render him liable
criminally.

Even if the distinction had been maintainable as
I hold it is not in the application of this section, he seems to have covered
the ground.

I should have preferred the charge before so
amended.

Section 1019 of the Criminal Code, which reads
as follows:—

1019.—No conviction shall be set aside nor
any new trial directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly
admitted or rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the
trial or some misdirection given, unless, in the opinion of the court of
appeal, some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the
trial: Provided that if the court of appeal is of opinion that any challenge
for the defence was improperly disallowed, a new trial shall be granted,

might, if need be for which in my view there is
none, be relied upon. If Mr. Justice Newland's view is correct it should be
applied.

The negligence here in question which led to
appellant's motor car running over such an obstacle on the street as the above
description presents when ample space to pass it without doing so, was so
palpably gross that there was not much to be found in the way of palliation
even if the old saws about gross negligence could be invoked and relied upon.

There was, in my opinion, no miscarriage of justice.

The appeal should, I think, be dismissed.

Duff J.—Section 258 of the Criminal Code does not I think, substantially
change the common law. In this I agree with the opinion of Mr. Justice Sedge-

[Page 44]

wick delivered on behalf of the court, in the Union
Colliery Company's Case[2].
There may, I think, be cases in which the judges ought to tell the jury that
the conduct of the accused in order to incriminate him under this section must
be such as to imply a certain indifference to consequences, but such cases, I
think, must be rare and this assuredly is not one of them. Where the accused,
having brought into operation a dangerous agency which he has under his
control, (that is to say dangerous in the sense that it is calculated to
endanger human life), fails to take those precautions which a man of ordinary
humanity and reasonably competent understanding would take in the given
circumstances for the purpose of avoiding or neutralizing the risk, his conduct
in itself implies a degree of recklessness justifying the description
""gross negligence."" The facts of course may disclose an explanation
or excuse bringing the accused's conduct within the category of
""reasonable"" conduct. But as Vaughan J. said long ago in Bushell's
case[3], the
judge does not charge the jury with matters of law in the abstract but only
upon that law as growing out of some supposition of fact; and it is much better
in such a case as the present, (where, in the absence of explanation, the
conduct of the accused—driving a motor through a frequented street at the rate
of 12 miles an hour without seeing the road clearly before him—plainly
inculpates him) that the trial judge should seek, as Mr. Justice Lamont did, to
bring the jury to concentrate their attention upon the various matters alleged
in explanation and excuse.

[Page 45]

Anglin J.—I would dismiss this appeal. There was dissent in the court of
appeal only upon the first question of the reserved case. To that question s.
247 of the Criminal Code precludes any but an affirmative answer. Failure to
take reasonable precautions against, and to use reasonable care to avoid,
danger to human life is thereby declared to entail criminal responsibility for
the consequences. There is nothing in s. 16, referred to by Mr. Henderson, to
qualify this explicit declaration; and s. 258 has no bearing, in my opinion, on
a case of manslaughter. It would be most unfortunate if anything should be said
or done in this court to countenance the idea that a motor car may be driven
with immunity from criminal responsibility if reasonable precautions be not
taken against, and reasonable care be not used to avoid, danger to human life.
As Mr. Justice Bigham said on the trial of a chauffeur for manslaughter by
running over a woman in a London street:—

There is a greater responsibility on a
person engineering a dangerous machine like a large motor car about the streets
than on a man driving a one horse brougham. Rex v. Davis.[4]

What are reasonable precautions and what is
reasonable care depends in every case upon the circumstances. Carelessness
which ought to have been recognized as not unlikely to imperil human life
cannot, in my opinion, be regarded as aught else than culpable negligence.

Brodeur J.—This appeal arises out of a conviction for manslaughter in the
case of a man driving negligently an automobile.

[Page 46]

It is contended by the accused that there must
be gross negligence to incur criminal liability and that the degree of
negligence must be higher in criminal cases than in civil cases.

A large number of cases have been quoted to us
on this point and they might appear somewhat conflicting though I think that
they could be reconciled by a careful examination of the facts in each case.
But the language itself of the Criminal Code disposes of this issue. It says in
article 247:—

Everyone who has in his charge or under his
control anything whatever, whether animate or inanimate * * * which, in the
absence of precaution or care, may endanger human life, is under a legal duty
to take reasonable precautions against, and use reasonable care to
avoid such danger and is criminally responsible for the consequences of
omitting without lawful excuse to perform such duty.

Nobody will dispute the fact that an automobile
negligently driven is a dangerous thing. Then the driver of his automobile on
the street is bound to take reasonable precaution and use reasonable care to
avoid any danger.

If our legislators intended to state that there
would be criminal liability only in the case of reckless or gross negligence,
they would certainly have so declared their intent. But they simply
incorporated in our criminal statutes these expressions so well known and so
fully construed in the cases of civil negligence.

The absence of reasonable care in driving an
automobile may then create a criminal liability. The following cases may be
quoted in support of this contention: Reg. v. Murray[5]; Rex v.
Grout[6];
The Queen v. Dalloway[7].

Even if we construe the judge's charge as the
appellant contends, I consider it legal and sufficient.

The appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 47]

Mignault J.—The appellant was tried on an indictment for manslaughter for
having, when driving a motor car in a public street of Regina, caused the death
of one Percy Young. The learned trial judge, in charging the jury, directed them
as to the law governing the case as follows:—

It has been decided and I am going to tell
you that the law is, that every person who drives a motor car has a duty to
drive it with such care and caution as to prevent, so far as is in his power,
any accident or injury to any other person; that is, he has got to use all
reasonable precaution to see that no person is injured through his want of
caution or precaution.

After the charge, counsel for the accused
complained that the learned judge should have told the jury that a greater
degree of negligence was required in a criminal case than in a civil one, and
the learned judge recalled the jury and gave them this further direction:—

I am also asked to direct your attention to
the fact that in a criminal case the degree of negligence which renders a man
culpably negligent is greater than in a civil case. I think that is quite so,
and I am going to charge you to that effect—that while in a civil case a man
may be liable to an action for damages, in a criminal case it would take a
greater degree of negligence to render him liable. That is so. But in this case
it is for you to say whether or not the accused, driving a vehicle of that sort
along the streets of the city took that care which it was the duty of an ordinary
prudent man to take in order to avoid doing damage to some person else on the
street. If you come to the conclusion that he did not take that care, and that
it was in consequence of that want of care that the death of Young took place,
then he is guilty; if he did take that care he is not guilty.

Notwithstanding Mr. Henderson's able argument, I
cannot come to the conclusion that the jury was misdirected. Section 247 of the
Criminal Code states the law as follows:—

Everyone who has in his charge or under his
control anything whatever, whether animate or inanimate, or who erects, makes
or maintains anything whatever which, in the absence of precaution or

[Page 48]

care, may endanger human life, is under a
legal duty to take reasonable precautions against, and use reasonable care to
avoid, such danger, and is criminally responsible for the consequences of
omitting, without lawful excuse, to perform such duty.

I think the charge is fully supported by this
section. It was the duty of the accused to take reasonable precautions to avoid
endangering human life, and the jury was told so. It was then for the jury to
determine whether the accused had taken these precautions.

Naturally, in the offence of manslaughter, there
may be a greater or less degree of guilt according to the circumstances of each
case. I see no reason to doubt that the degree of guilt in this case will be
duly considered when sentence is pronounced on the jury's verdict.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law —Principal guilty of
manslaughter—Abettor afterwards convicted of murder—Charge—Explanations as to
manslaughter—Sections 69, 262 Cr. C.

The appellant was tried for murder and found
guilty. The victim had been killed by the appellant's son, at the instigation
of his father. The son, having had his trial 'previously, had been found guilty
of manslaughter.

Held, that the
appellant could be convicted of murder.

The trial judge in his charge, after reading
section 259 Cr. C., explained to the jurors the nature of murder and instructed
them that they could find one of three verdicts against the accused, murder,
manslaughter or acquittal. While he did not read section 262 Cr. C. which refers
to manslaughter, in discussing provocation and the defences set up by the
appellant of self-defence and protection of the home, he explained under what
circumstances the verdict might be one of manslaughter.

Held, Brodeur
J. dissenting, that the trial judge sufficiently instructed the jury as to what
in law constitutes the offence of manslaughter.

Per Brodeur J.
(dissenting).—There was sufficient evidence to justify the jury in finding a
verdict of manslaughter, if they had been properly instructed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, dismissing an appeal by the appellant
relating to questions of law arising on his trial for murder and upon a stated
case.

[Page 22]

The appellant was charged with having murdered
one Morissette and found guilty. Morissette was killed as the result of a rifle
shot which was fired by the son of the appellant at the victim, who had called
late at night under peculiar circumstances. The trial of the son was held first
upon an indictment of murder; and he was found guilty of manslaughter. At the
trial of the appellant the judge, in his charge to the jury, explained the
nature of murder, quoting section 259 Cr. C. He also cited section 261 Cr. C.,
on the defence of provocation, section 53 Cr. C. dealing with self defence
against assaults and section 60 Cr. C. on the defence of dwelling-house at
night. The judge did not read section 262 Cr. C. as to manslaughter. The two
questions submitted to the courts were: 1, as the son was convicted of
manslaughter, the appellant, as aider and abettor, could not be found guilty of
murder; and 2, the charge was illegal as the jury were not sufficiently
instructed as to the distinction between murder and manslaughter.

N. K. Laflamme K.C. and M. A. Lemieux
K.C. for the appellant.

Aimé Marchand K.C. and Lucien Cannon K.C.
for the respondent.

Idington J.—The appellant was indicted for murder and convicted therefor.

The Court of King's Bench has, with the
exception of Mr. Justice Guerin, so answered the questions submitted in a
reserved case relative thereto as to maintain the conviction.

[Page 23]

The pith of the dissenting opinion of Mr.
Justice Guerin in said court which gives appellant the right to come here, and
is the measure of our jurisdiction to interfere, is that because appellant's
son on another indictment for murder, resting on same killing, had on his trial
been only found guilty of manslaughter, therefore the appellant cannot be found
guilty of any greater offence than that of manslaughter.

The contention is a most remarkable one and
seems to me to have been so well and effectually answered by the several
opinions of the other judges in the court below writing opinions with which I
substantially agree, that I do not feel at liberty to repeat same here. Some of
them illustrate the unfounded nature of such pretensions as made, by various
alternatives.

I only add another and that is if this case, as
it might have been in law, had been tried before the other, despite what
appellant's counsel suggests is customary in such cases, how could he have
invoked the pretension of law now set up?

The appeal should be dismissed.

Duff J.—I have carefully considered the charge of the trial judge and I
am by no means satisfied that he instructed the jury insufficiently touching
the elements of the offence of manslaughter and the distinctions between that
offence and murder.

I am unable to perceive any force in the
argument founded upon the verdict and judgment against the younger Remillard.

Anglin J.—In my opinion this appeal fails. The fact that in another trial
another jury passing upon evidence which may have been somewhat different
decided that the offence committed by Roméo Rémillard

[Page 24]

in killing Lucien Morissette amounted only to
manslaughter is wholly irrelevant to the question whether Joseph Rémillard
could rightly be put on trial for, and could upon proof that he had aided,
abetted or instigated, the homicide, be convicted of murder. As between Romeo
Rémillard and the Crown the verdict of the jury who tried him is no doubt
conclusive as to the nature of his crime. As between Joseph Rémillard and the
Crown it determines nothing. The character of the offence actually committed by
each must be decided by the jury charged with the disposition of the indictment
gainst him. To the first question in the reserved case the only possible answer
was in the negative.

The learned judge, in my opinion, sufficiently
instructed the jury as to the three verdicts which may be rendered on an
indictment for murder and as to the distinction between murder and
manslaughter. He discussed adequately and correctly all the relevant grounds on
which in this case the culpable homicide charged to have been aided, abetted or
instigated by Joseph Rémillard might possibly have been reduced from murder to
manslaughter. Having read to the jury the definitive provisions of s. 259 of
the Criminal Code dealing with murder, he instructed them that, if the homicide
were not excusable, their verdict should be guilty of manslaughter, unless the facts
proved warranted a verdict of murder. That was equivalent to a reading to them
of s. 262 of the Code—the omission of which from the charge was made the
subject of serious complaint. The learned judge also read and explained s. 261,
which deals with the effect of provocation, and discussed the several matters
suggested in the course of the defence by way of excuse and in palliation.
Without characterizing the

[Page 25]

charge as a model presentation of the case to
the jury, with Mr. Justice Carroll I regard it as fulfilling the requirements
of the law and not warranting interference by an appellate court on any ground
covered by the reserved case.

The second and third questions should, in my
opinion, be answered as they were by the Court of King's Bench.

Brodeur J. (dissenting).—Trois questions
principales nous ont été soumises. La première porte sur
la validité d'un verdict de meurtre contre un complice quand l'auteur de
l'homicide n'aurait été trouvé coupable que de manslaughter.
Par les deux autres questions
on nous demande si le juge qui présidait au procès a suffisamment expliqué la
différence entre le meurtre et le manslaughter.

L'appelant est accusé d'avoir tué un nommé
Morissette, et il a été trouvé coupable de meurtre. Ce n'est pas lui cependant qui
a tiré le coup de fusil qui a été malheureusement fatal, mais c'est son fils
Roméo. L'accusé dans la présente cause n'a été que le complice de l'infraction.

Certains témoins, qui, je le suppose, ont été crus
par le jury mais dont le témoignage est contredit par d'autres témoins, ont
déclaré que le père, l'accusé en la présente cause, avait incité son fils à
tirer sur la victime. C'est à raison de cette circonstance, je suppose, que la
Couronne a persisté tout de même à procéder sur une accusation de meurtre
contre le complice quand l'auteur lui-même du crime n'avait été trouvé coupable
que de manslaughter.

L'article 69 du code criminel justifie cette procédure, vu qu'il met sur le même
pied l'auteur et le complice d'une infraction et il les déclare tous

[Page 26]

les deux coupables de l'offence elle-même. Celui
qui aide, provoque ou conseille un assassinat peut donc être trouvé coupable de
meurtre lui-même, malgré qu'il n'ait pas perpétré lui-même le fait qui a
produit la mort.

Nos lois criminelles depuis leur codification ont
fait disparaître cette classification un peu subtile des accusés en principaux
au premier degré, en principaux au deuxième degré et en complices avant le
fait. Elles ont mis tous ces criminels sur le même pied. Chacun d'eux peut être
poursuivi pour l'offense principale elle-même, quand bien même il n'aurait
qu'aidé, assisté ou conseillé l'auteur du forfait (Russell
on Crime, 6ème édition, pp. 176-177).

Ainsi dans le cas d'assassinat, celui qui a
simplement provoqué une personne à tuer peut être mis en accusation de meurtre
comme s'il avait porté lui-même le coup qui a terrassé la victime. Hawkins, ""Pleas of the Crown,"" 8ème édition,
vol. 2 p. 439, déclare que, même dans un cas d'homicide, le complice
pourrait être trouvé coupable de meurtre lorsque l'auteur lui-même du crime ne
serait coupable que de manslaughter.

All those who are present when a felony is
committed and abet the doing of it, as by holding the party while another
strikes him or by delivering a weapon to him that strikes him, or by moving him
to strike, are principal in the highest degree in respect of such abetment, as
much as the person who does the act, which in judgment of law is as much the
act of them all as if they had actually done it: and if there were malice in the
abettor and none in the person who struck the party *** it will be murder as to
the abettor and manslaughter as to the other.

Dans le cas actuellement devant nous le jury
pouvait rendre un verdict de meurtre même si l'accusé n'eut été que le complice
et n'eut pas porté lui-même le coup fatal. Chaque cause pouvait être jugée
suivant son propre mérite et suivant la

[Page 27]

preuve qui serait faite dans chacune d'elle sur la
nature de l'offense. Le verdict dans l'une ne devait pas nécessairement être
adopté dans l'autre cause.

La première question qui nous est soumise devrait
donc recevoir une réponse négative.

Quant aux deux autres questions qui ont trait aux
instructions du juge au jury, je ne puis pas en venir à la même conclusion que
la Cour du Banc du Roi.

La question dans la cause était de savoir d'abord
s'il y avait eu homicide coupable. L'accusé a tenté d'établir que l'assassinat
avait été commis sous l'effet d'une provocation et qu'il était accidentel. Ces
deux moyens de défense auraient pu le libérer de toute offence
criminelle s'ils avaient été prouvés.

Le juge, dans son allocution aux jurés, s'est
attaché à démontrer que la provocation n'était pas suffisante pour justifier
Roméo Rémillard de faire l'acte qu'il a commis et que le coup de feu qui a été
tiré ne pouvait pas être rangé dans la catégorie des accidents.

Après avoir lu soigneusement toute la preuve, je me
suis convaincu moi-même que la provocation qui a été invoquée n'était pas
suffisante pour pouvoir justifier l'homicide; et je ne crois pas non plus que
les circonstances où le coup de feu a été tiré peuvent ranger l'acte accompli
dans la catégorie d'actions qui, purement accidentelles, peuvent libérer
complètement l'auteur de l'acte ou ses complices. Il y a donc, suivant moi,
homicide coupable. L'homicide n'était pas justifiable ni excusable.

Mais cet homicide était-il volontaire ou
involontaire? En d'autres termes y a-t-il eu meurtre ou simplement manslaughter?

Le juge malheureusement ne paraît pas avoir fait
ressortir suffisamment la distinction entre ces deux offenses de meurtre et de manslaughter.

[Page 28]

L'honorable juge Carroll
qui présidait la Cour du Banc du Roi et qui a décidé
contre l'appelant, après avoir déclaré dans ses notes que l'allocution du juge
est légale dans son ensemble, ajoute cependant qu'elle a pu

produire chez les jurés l'impression qu'aucun
autre verdict que celui de meurtre ne pouvait être rendu.

Dans ce cas, peut-on dire que le juge a
suffisamment renseigné le juré sur les faits de la cause dans leurs rapports avec
le crime de manslaughter? Il
n'y a pas de doute, suivant moi, comme je l'ai dit plus haut, que la
provocation et le caractère accidentel du coup de feu ne pouvaient pas empêcher
l'accusé d'être coupable d'homicide; car quand bien même des personnes auraient
jugé à propos de venir faire visite à sa femme à une heure indue de la nuit,
l'accusé n'aurait pas été justifiable de prendre un fusil et de les tuer. La
provocation n'était pas suffisante pour cela.

Mais si dans le but de protéger son foyer contre la
mauvaise réputation que la visite nocturne de ces jeunes gens peut lui imputer
et si prenant un fusil il tente de leur tirer dans les jambes et si comme
résultat de l'excitation ou par maladresse le coup va porter sur une partie
vitale de l'un de ces visiteurs, sans aucune intention de sa part de causer la
mort, n'y a-t-il pas lieu alors pour le juge de bien faire la distinction entre
l'offense qui constitue un meurtre et celle qui constitue un manslaughter?

C'est ce qui n'a pas été fait dans cette cause-ci.
L'allocution, au contraire, a porté sur ces incidents comme éléments du crime
de meurtre, lorsque la preuve démontrait plutôt que les jurés étaient en
présence d'un crime de manslaughter.

[Page 29]

Il me paraît évident, pour ma part, qu'il n'y avait
pas intention de tuer mais simplement de faire une démonstration qui
empêcheraient ces visiteurs de répéter leurs visites nocturnes et de les
forcer, eux et leurs semblables, de respecter le foyer de l'accusé. Sa pauvre
femme était malheureusement victime de la boisson et ses moeurs, comme il
arrive d'ordinaire dans tous ces cas, étaient un objet de scandale pour sa
propre famille. Alors l'accusé a voulu la protéger contre ceux qui seraient
tentés de profiter de ces faiblesses pour déshonorer son foyer.

Cela ne saurait justifier un droit cependant de
prendre une arme à feu et de tuer ces visiteurs. Mais si, comme dans le cas
actuel, le juge doit insister pour dire aux jurés qu'il y a crime, il doit le
faire de façon à leur faire bien comprendre ce qu'est le meurtre, ce qu'est le manslaughter. Prenant la phrase que j'ai
détachée de l'opinion du juge Carroll, je dis que si l'allocution du juge a pu produire chez les jurés
l'impression qu'aucun autre verdict que celui de meurtre pouvait étre rendu, il
doit y avoir an nouveau procès.

Le juge ne doit pas se contenter de citer
généralement le texte du code qui nous dit que sur une accusation de meurtre un
accusé peut être trouvé coupable de meurtre, de manslaughter,
ou acquitté; il ne doit pas non plus donner une définition
plus ou moins vague de ces deux offenses, mais il doit considérer ces deux
offenses à la lumière des faits prouvés et dire aux jurés d'une manière claire
et précise les relations des faits prouvés avec le crime de meurtre et de manslaughter. Le but de l'allocution du
juge aux jurés est de leur expliquer la loi qui gouverne la cause, de montrer
les points essentiels qui doivent être prouvés de côté et d'autre, les
relations de la preuve aux points en litige. Aussi dans un cas où les faits
prouvés sont

[Page 30]

tout à la fois susceptibles de produire un verdict
pour deux offenses différentes, il devient nécessaire pour le juge de
déterminer qu'il y a criminalité et aussi de montrer clairement le degré de
cette criminalité en rapport avec les offenses dont l'accusé peut être trouvé
coupable.

Le juge doit définir le crime imputé à l'accusé et
il doit également expliquer la différence entre ce crime et tout autre dont il
pourrait être trouvé coupable. Le défaut pour le juge de renseigner le jury sur
le meurtre et le manslaughter a
été jugé suffisant dans la cause de The King v. Wong On[1], pour ordonner nouveau procès.

Sir James Stephen, dans son ouvrage ""General
View of Criminal Law,"" 2ème édition, p. 170, dit ceci:

I think that a judge who merely states to the
jury certain propositions of law and then reads over his notes does not
discharge his duty.

Une cause à peu près semblable à la présente a été décidée en Angleterre il n'y a
que quelques années; c'est celle de King v. Hopper[2].

Il s'agissait, dans cette cause de Hopper, d'une accusation de meurtre; et
l'accusé, comme dans la présente cause, plaidait provocation et accident. Au
procès, le juge a fermement exprimé l'opinion que c'était un cas de meurtre ou
d'acquittement. Il n'a pas voulu déclarer que la provocation et l'accident
pouvaient être tels que l'offense pût être considérée comme manslaughter. Lord Reading, qui a rendu le jugement de la Cour d'Appel, a décidé que les circonstances
prouvées pouvaient justifier un verdict de manslaughter
et que le juge aurait dû instruire le jury en
conséquence.

[Page 31]

Dans le cause actuelle, le juge, il est vrai, n'a
pas été aussi positif que dans la cause de Hopper; mais il a tout de même laissé le jury sous l'impression que le seul
verdict qui pouvait être rendu était celui de meurtre.

Je suis d'opinion, pour ces raisons, que les
instructions du juge au jury étaient incomplètes et par conséquent illégales.

Il devrait y avoir un nouveau procès et l'appel
devrait être maintenu.

Mignault J.—The appellant having been tried at Quebec on an indictment for
the murder of one Lucien Morissette before Mr. Justice Désy and a jury, was
found guilty and death sentence was passed on him. The learned trial judge
refused to state certain questions for the opinion of the Court of King's Bench
sitting in appeal, but on appeal to the latter court, he was ordered to state
for the opinion of that court the following questions:

1°. Should I have told the jury, as a
matter of law, that the author of the crime, Roméo Rémillard, having been by
another jury previously convicted of the crime of manslaughter, the accused (if
in the opinion of the jury he was an aider and abettor) could not be convicted
of the crime of murder; but the only verdict that could be rendered was one for
manslaughter or acquittal?

2°. (a) Should I have pointed out to the
jury the three verdicts that could be rendered upon a charge of murder, viz.:
guilty of murder, guilty of manslaughter, or not guilty?

(b) If yes, did I sufficiently so instruct
the jury?

3°. (a) Should I have pointed out to the
jury what in law constituted the offence of manslaughter?

(b) If yes, did I sufficiently so instruct
the jury?

After hearing counsel, the Court of King's Bench
answered the first question in the negative, the two branches of question two
in the affirmative and the two branches of question three also in the
affirmative.

[Page 32]

Mr. Justice Guerin dissented and would have
answered question one in the affirmative, the first branches of question two
and three in the affirmative and the second branches of these questions in the
negative.

This dissent permitted the further appeal which
has been taken to this court, and, in view of its terms, the whole case is open
for review. It should be remarked, as to questions two and three, that the five
judges were of opinion that it was the duty of the trial judge to direct the
jury in the manner stated in the first branches of these questions, the
majority of the learned judges being of opinion that the trial judge had
sufficiently instructed the jury on the points referred to.

First question. Briefly
stated the contention of counsel for the appellant is that the learned trial
judge should have told the jury that inasmuch as Roméo Rémillard, the
appellant's son, who fired the fatal shot, was previously tried on an
indictment for the murder of Lucien Morissette, and found guilty of
manslaughter only, the appellant, if in the opinion of the jury he was an aider
and abettor, could not be convicted of the crime of murder, but that the only
verdict that could be rendered was one for manslaughter or acquittal.

The circumstances under which the jury found a
verdict of murder against the appellant are not mentioned in the reserved case,
and cannot be perfectly ascertained by reading the charge to the jury, in which
the learned trial judge commented on facts well known to the jury. I think
however that we have only to deal with the facts assumed in question one, that
is to say that Roméo Rémillard was the author of the crime, and was previously
convicted by another

[Page 33]

jury of manslaughter. We must also assume that
there was evidence upon which the jury could find that the appellant was an
aider and abettor in the crime committed by Roméo Rémillard.

Assuming these facts, in order to determine
whether it was the duty of the learned trial judge to direct the jury that the
only verdict they could find against the appellant was one for manslaughter or
acquittal, it is necessary to consider certain sections of the Criminal Code.
The old distinction between accessories before the fact and principals has been
abolished, and section 69, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code enumerates those
who are parties to, and guilty of, an offence.

Every one is a party to and guilty of an
offence who,—

(a) actually commits it; or

(b) does or omits an act for the purpose of
aiding any person to commit the offence; or,

(c) abets any person in commission of the
offence; or,

(d) counsels or procures any person to
commit the offence.

Paragraph (a) of subsection 1 applies to Roméo
Rémillard, who actually committed the offence, and the other paragraphs
comprise those who formerly were termed accessories before the fact, and who
are now, equally with the perpetrator, parties to and guilty of the offence. If
the jury were of the opinion that the appellant was an aider and abettor in the
offence committed by Roméo Rémillard, they could undoubtedly find him a party
to and guilty of this offence.

To aid or abet is defined as follows in Stroud's
Judicial Dictionary, vol. 1, p. 64:

To constitute an aider or abettor, some
active steps must be taken, by word or action, with intent to instigate the
principal or principals. Encouragement does not, of necessity, amount to
aiding and abetting. It may be intentional or unintentional. A man may

[Page 34]

unwittingly encourage another in fact by
his presence, by misinterpreted words or gestures, or by his silence or
non-interference:—or he may encourage intentionally by expressions, gestures,
or actions intended to signify approval. In the latter case he aids and abets;
in the former he does not. It is no criminal offence to stand by a mere passive
spectator of a crime, even of a murder. Non-interference to prevent a crime is
not itself a crime. But the fact that a person was voluntarily and purposely present
witnessing the commission of a crime, and offered no opposition to it, though
he might reasonably be expected to prevent it and had the power so to do or at
least to express his dissent, might, under some circumstances, afford cogent
evidence upon which a jury would be justified in finding that he wilfully
encouraged, and so aided and abetted. But it would be purely a question for the
jury whether he did so or not (per Hawkins, J., The Queen v. Coney[3]).

It is obvious here that it was for the jury to
determine whether a case of aiding and abetting was made out.

But it is contended that the offence committed
by Roméo Rémillard was manslaughter, as shewn by the verdict rendered against
him and which must be taken to have been justified by the evidence, and that
therefore they could not find the appellant guilty of the greater offence, that
of murder.

This reasoning necessarily implies that the
verdict found in another trial against Roméo Rémillard is conclusive evidence
in the trial of Joseph Rémillard of the nature of the offence committed by the
former, of which offence question one assumes that the latter could be found to
have been an aider and abettor. I think that this shews the fallacy of the
appellant's contention, for what was decided in Roméo Rémillard's case was
entirely irrelevant in the trial of his father, and the learned trial judge
would have erred had he told the jury that because the son in another case had
been found guilty of manslaughter, the father, when separately tried, could not
be convicted

[Page 35]

of the greater offence of murder, for that would
have been giving to the verdict in the Roméo Rémillard case a conclusive effect
in the Joseph Rémillard trial; in other words, treating it as res judicata, which
it certainly is not. Unless the provisions of sect. 69 Crim. Code are borne in
mind, confusion may be caused by treating the one as the actual perpetrator,
the other as the aider and abettor, and measuring the guilt of the latter by
the guilt of the former. Both are principals or rather parties to and guilty of
the offence committed (sect. 69), that is to say culpable homicide, and
culpable homicide is murder when committed with intent actual, or presumed in
the cases mentioned in section 259, subsection (b), (c) and (d), to cause death,
and manslaughter when that intent does not exist. So between two parties,
within the meaning of sect. 69, to a culpable homicide, it is conceivable that
one may be shewn to be guilty of murder and the other of manslaughter. And on
the trial of the appellant, the jury could certainly determine what was the
crime committed and, if the evidence justified the verdict, find the appellant
guilty of murder, notwithstanding the fact that Roméo Rémillard in another
trial was, for the same culpable homicide, convicted of manslaughter.

My opinion therefore is that question one must
be answered in the negative.

Question two. I
would answer both branches of this question in the affirmative. It is common
ground that it was the duty of the learned trial judge to tell the jury that
three verdicts could be rendered upon a charge of murder, to wit, murder,
manslaughter, or acquittal, and the learned judge did so.

[Page 36]

Question three. The
appellant's counsel greatly insisted on this question, contending that the
evidence was such as would have rendered a verdict of manslaughter possible,
and that the jury were not sufficiently instructed as to what constitutes the
offence of manslaughter.

I have twice read the learned judge's charge. He
very particularly explained to the jury the nature of murder, quoting the
different provisions of the code which deal with this crime. There is no
definition in the code of manslaughter, and section 262, stating that culpable
homicide, not amounting to murder, is manslaughter, even if it could be
regarded as a definition, was not read to the jury. However, at different parts
of his charge, while discussing the defences urged by the appellant, the
learned judge referred to manslaughter. Thus, on the defence of provocation,
the learned judge cited section 261 of the code, the effect of which is that
culpable homicide may be reduced to manslaughter where death is caused in the
heat of passion occasioned by a sudden provocation. After reading the first and
second paragraphs of section 261, he said:

Vous vous demanderez si nous sommes dans ce
cas là, et si on a eu le temps de reprendre son sang-froid avant que le coup de
feu ne soit tire.

And after reading the third paragraph of this
section, he adds:

Par conséquent, c'est une question qui doit
être déterminée par vous-mêmes si une action quelconque qui aurait été prouvée
ici, ou une insulte particulière, constitue une provocation, et si la personne
provoquée a réellement perdu son sang-froid par la provocation. Ce sont là des
questions de fait dont vous êtes les seuls maîtres et que vous devez déterminer
après avoir examiné la preuve à la lumière des principes de droit qui vous ont
été exposés.

[Page 37]

Further on, the learned trial judge quoted from
Russell on Crimes, vol. 1, p. 693, translating as follows:—

Pour réduire le crime de meurtre à l'homicide involontaire, la provocation, il faut que les
circonstances justifient la conclusion que l'acte fait avec l'intention de causer la mort ou des blessures corporelles graves,
n'a pas été le résultat d'une décision froidement prise après délibération et
d'une malice réflective, et n'est
imputable qu'à la faiblesse de la nature humaine.

And the learned judge thus commented on this
passage:

Vous vous demanderez si la preuve démontre en
dehors de tout doute que le projet qui a été exécuté entre minuit et une heure
du matin le vingt-huit janvier n'était pas un projet qui avait commencé à se
former et à s'exécuter graduellement depuis la veille au matin.

Vous examinerez les faits et gestes, pas et
démarches de l'accusé à la barre, les déclarations qu'il a faites, vous
examinerez toute sa conduite et vous donnerez la réponse à cette question.

Immediately following the passage I have quoted,
the learned trial judge instructed the jury as to the claim made that the
accused was justified in using force to prevent the breaking into of his house
at night. He said:

L'article 60 du Code Criminel dit:

Quiconque est en paisible possession d'une
maison d'habitation, et quiconque lui prête légalement main-forte ou agit sous
son autorité, sont justifiables d'employer la force nécessaire pour empêcher
l'effraction de cette maison d'habitation, de nuit, par qui que ce soit, s'il
croit, pour des motifs raisonnables et plausibles, que cette effraction est
tentée dans le but d'y commettre quelque acte criminel.

Est-ce que dans ce cas ici aucune personne a
essayé à commettre une effraction chez l'accusé à la barre?

Est-ce qu'il n'est pas prouvé hors de tout
doute que Morissette aprés avoir dépassé de quelques pieds la maison de Rémillard
en se dirigeant vers chez les Baker, et étant dans le doute que la maison de
Baker fût réellement ce qu'elle était et basant ce doute sur le fait que Baker ne les avait laissés qu'une
demi-heure avant et qu'il n'y avait pas de lumière dans la maison de Baker
puisqu'il y en avait dans la maison de Rémillard, est-ce que, dis-je, il y a eu
effraction de la part de Morissette?

[Page 38]

N'est-il pas vrai que Morissette a fait comme
tout homme bien élevé qui arrive dans une maison respectable; qu'il a sonné à
la porte avant d'entrer? Est-ce qu'il n'est pas prouvé qu'il a enlevé son
chapeau et qu'il a posé poliment une question à la personne qui lui ouvrait la
porte?

Again the learned judge, referring to the
suggestion of the defence that the prisoner's wife was a prostitute and that
the deceased and his companions had come to the prisoner's house at night in
order to commit adultery with her, quoted from some unnamed authority as
follows :

Si un homme en trouve un autre commettant
l'adultère et le tue ou le tire dans le premier transport de sa passion, il
n'est coupable que d'homicide involontaire, car la provocation est grave et la
loi présume que le mari n'a pu se contrôler. Mais celui qui tue l'adultère
délibérément et par vengeance est coupable de meurtre. Ainsi, si un père voit
quelqu'un commettre avec son fils un acte contre nature et le tue
instantanément ce ne sera qu'un homicide involontaire. Mais s'il en entend
parler seulement, recherche ensuite cette personne et la tue, ayant eu le temps
de reprendre ses sens, ce sera un meurtre.

And as to the claim made that the accused had
acted in self defence, the learned judge said:

Si une personne recevant un coup se revenge
immédiatement avec une arme ou autre instrument qui lui tombe sous la main,
l'offense ne sera qu'homicide involontaire, pourvu que le coup ait été porté
sous le coup de la colère résultant de la provocation, car la colère est une
passion à laquelle sont sujets les bons comme les méchants. Mais la loi exige
deux choses:

1°. Qu'il y ait eu
provocation; 2°, que le coup
puisse clairement être attribué à l'influence de la passion résultant de la
provocation.

Y a-t-il eu assaut dans le cas actuel?

Le coup a-t-il été tiré sous le coup de la
colère, colère provoquée par cet assaut, le tout à la connaissance de l'accusé
en cette cause?

Si vous en arrivez à la conclusion que ce
drame s'est déroulé sous l'influence soudaine de la passion, vous devrez
appliquer la loi que je viens de vous exposer, mais si vous en arrivez à la
conclusion que l'accusé d'abord a fait quelques actes d'omission ou de
commission conformément aux principes de la loi que je viens de vous citer, et
qu'il a agi ou refusé d'agir sans être sous l'influence soudaine de la passion,
mais bien sous l'influence de cette disposition dépravée et de ce mauvais
esprit que la loi nomme ""malice"" dans la définition du meurtre, alors
l'offense ne sera pas l'homicide involontaire mais ce sera le meurtre.

[Page 39]

In view of all this I cannot come to the
conclusion that the learned trial judge did not sufficiently instruct the jury
as to what in law constitutes the offence of manslaughter, at least in so far
as was necessary to decide upon the different defences relied on by the
accused, and as to these defences the learned judge told the jury under what
circumstances, if they thought them established, a verdict of manslaughter
could be returned. Such a method of instruction was probably more useful to the
jury than citing to them sect. 262 of the Criminal Code, or theoretically
explaining the differences between murder and manslaughter. The charge as a
whole was a strong one against the prisoner and may have given the jury the
impression that the proper verdict to return was a verdict of murder, while
leaving them entirely free to appreciate the evidence and come to their own
conclusions thereon. Even if I thought that this amounts to misdirection, and I
cannot say that, I would not be justified in setting aside the verdict unless I
felt convinced that some substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned by the
judge's charge (sect. 1019 Criminal Code). I cannot come to this conclusion
after carefully reading the learned judge's charge and the circumstances there
referred to as far as disclosed, and if the learned trial judge's comments on
the facts are fair, and no objection thereto was taken at the trial, my opinion
is that no substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned, even if the
impression was left on the minds of the members of the jury that the proper
verdict to return was one of guilty of murder.

I would therefore answer both branches of
question three in the affirmative.

As a result the appeal must be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPEAL DIVISION OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.

Criminal law—Trial—Plea of insanity—Charge
to jury—Proof—Beyond a reasonable doubt.

On a criminal trial where the prisoner pleads
insanity it is misdirection for the judge to charge the jury that insanity must
be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Rex v. Anderson (7
Alta. L.R. 102) approved. The King v. Kierstead (45 N.B. Rep.
553) overruled. Idington J. dissents.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Appeal
Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the conviction of the
appellant on an indictment for murder.

The appellant being put on trial pleaded that
he was insane when the crime was committed. Subject to this defence the crime
was proved.

The trial judge in charging the jury
instructed them that the onus of proving insanity was on the prisoner and that
such defence must be established ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" The
appeal Division having already decided in 1818 in The King v. Kierstead[1] that
this was a proper charge the trial judge refused an application for a reserved
case based on it as a misdirection and the Appeal Division refused to direct
that he should grant it.

[Page 609]

In a case of Rex v. Anderson[2], the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta had, in 1814, held that such
a charge was misdirection arid the prisoner applied for leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada under the provisions of the amendment of the Criminal
Code passed in 1920 being 10-11 Geo. V, ch. 43, sec. 16. This amendment
authorizes a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada to grant leave to appeal to
that Court where provincial courts have given conflicting decisions on a
question of criminal law. The leave was granted in this case the effect of
which was that the judge granting it held that it can be granted where the
court below is unanimous (if not the amendment would be unnecessary, as if
there is dissent in the court below an appeal would lie as of right) and also
that the refusal of the provincial court to direct the trial judge to reserve a
case is an affirmance of the conviction under sec. 1024
C.C.

W. P. Jones K.C. for the appellant.

W. B. Wallace K.C. for the respondent
referred to Rex v. Beard[3].

Idington J. (dissenting).—The appellant was indicted for murder and convicted
thereof. The defence set up was insanity. The facts bearing upon his actual
commission of the crime charged seem to have been of such a conclusive
character as to leave no room for doubt of his guilt unless he could be excused
on the ground of insanity, or rather a doubt of his sanity which is sought to
serve the same purpose.

[Page 610]

Stripped of undue verbiage confusing or tending
to confuse the mind, the issue raised is whether or not if there might have
been or ought to have been created by the evidence adduced a doubt as to his
sanity in the minds of the jurors who tried him, then he should have been
acquitted.

The law in Canada ever since the enactment of
the Criminal Code of 1892, is that declared by section 11 thereof continued in
section 19 of the Criminal Code, chapter 146 of the Revised Statutes of Canada
1906, as follows:—

19. No person shall be convicted of an
offence by reason of an act done or omitted by him when labouring under natural
imbecility, or disease of the mind, to such an extent as to render him incapable
of appreciating the nature and quality of the act or omission, and of knowing
that such an act or omission was wrong.

2. A person labouring under specific
delusions, but in other respects sane, shall not be acquitted on the ground of
insanity, under the provisions hereinafter contained, unless the delusions
caused him to believe in the existence of some state of things which, if it
existed, would justify or excuse his act or omission.

3. Everyone shall be presumed to be sane at
the time of doing or omitting to do any act until the contrary is proved.

In submitting the question of appellant's sanity
to the jury, the learned trial judge told them that the burden was placed upon
the accused to make out his insanity at the' time of the commission of the offence,
beyond a reasonable doubt.

Inasmuch as that precise form of direction had
been then recently, unanimously approved by the Court of Appeal for New Brunswick in the case of The King v. Kierstead[4],
the learned trial judge refused to reserve a case for said court, founded upon
the objection that there was error in so charging the jury. That court upon
appeal thereto decided to abide by its ruling in said case and refused to
interfere.

[Page 611]

The Court of Appeal for Alberta in a similar
case of The King v. Anderson[5],
having, in 1914, by a bare majority decided that a charge using similar
language to that now in question, was erroneous and granted a new trial, the
appellant obtained from my brother Anglin leave to appeal to this court, under
and by virtue of chapter 43, section 16, of the Dominion Statutes of 1920,
which provides as follows:—

16. The following section is inserted
immediately after section one thousand and twenty-four of the said Act:

1024a. Either the Attorney-General of the
province or any person convicted of an indictable offence may appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of any court of appeal setting aside
or affirming a conviction of an indictable offence, if the judgment appealed
from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case,

and continues to provide for a judge of this
court giving in such case leave to appeal.

It has been argued before us not only that there
is a substantial conflict between the judgment in question and that in the Anderson
Case5, but also that the ruling of the
Supreme Court of the United States in Davis v. United States[6], is the
correct view to adopt.

The head note to that report is as follows:—

If it appears on the trial of a person
accused of committing the crime of murder, that the deceased was killed by the
accused under circumstances which—nothing else appearing—made a case of murder,
the jury cannot properly return a verdict of guilty of the offence charged if,
upon the whole evidence, from whichever side it comes, they have a reasonable
doubt whether, at the time of killing, the accused was mentally competent to
distinguish between right and wrong, or to understand the nature of the act he
was committing.

No man should be deprived of his life under
the forms of law unless the jurors who try him are able, upon their
consciences, to say that the evidence before them, by whomsoever adduced, is
sufficient to shew beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of every fact
necessary to constitute the crime charged.

[Page 612]

Such is the result of an argument in which about
a hundred authorities were cited, and many of them are referred to in the
judgment of the court.

Such is, as it seems to me, the drift and
probable result of accepting the law as laid down in the Anderson Case[7], in
preference to that by the New Brunswick Court of Appeal.

The grave consequences of our so deciding would
be almost tantamount to repealing the above quoted enactment of our Code,
obviously designed to put an end to what was presumably an undesirable state of
our law as administered, and place it upon clear and, but for what has
happened, I should have supposed unmistakable grounds.

In the Anderson Case7, Mr.
Justice Stuart was, I respectfully submit, apparently unable to define the
difference between a defence to the ""satisfaction of the jury"" or
""dearly proven"" and one ""beyond reasonable doubt.""

And, with great respect, I cannot see how, for a
moment, the protection thrown around a prisoner is, as he suggests, necessarily
interfered with by the due limitation of the defence set up.

Mr. Justice Beck cited therein as authority
Cyc's definition which tends in same direction as ultimately decided in the Davis
Case[8]
I refer to above.

None of the other authorities which he cites, to
my mind, I respectfully submit, when closely examined and considered, really
touch the kernel of what is involved herein.

On the other hand such decisions as Chief
Justice Harvey relies upon, aptly present the identical view he took of the
Anderson case, as that which had been

[Page 613]

presented by eminent judges in England, using the phrase ""beyond reasonable doubt"" in the same sense in relation to the
proof of insanity as did the learned trial judge in that case.

He cited Bellingham's Case, decided in
1812; referred to in Russell on Crimes (7th ed.) at page 65; Reg. v. Stokes[9], decided
in 1848, only five years after McNaghten's Case[10], by
Baron Rolfe, who had been appointed to the Exchequer Chamber in 1839 and hence
possibly one of the judges called to answer the question in the McNaghten
Case10, and (though best known as a leader of
the Chancery Bar) had had considerable experience in criminal trials as
recorder of Bury St. Edmunds, and in presiding at the trial of many notable
criminal cases; and the case of Rex v. Jefferson[11], where
Mr. Justice Bigham, as late as 1908, charged the jury in the same terms as now
objected to.

And although that case went to appeal no one
ever thought of raising such a ground as now taken herein. Why so unless
clearly untenable?

The truth would seem to be that the law as laid
down in the McNaghten Case10, that in order to establish the
defence, on the ground of insanity, it must be ""clearly proven"" and
that ""to the satisfaction of the jury"" has always been, for at least
a hundred years the law in England; and that it has been so presented to juries
concerned in the language now complained of without challenge.

Mr. Tremear, in the second edition of his work
on our code, in his notes upon the section thereof now in question, says that
it was in the draft code prepared by the Imperial Commission, but never adopted
by parliament.

[Page 614]

Law seemingly was found to be more stabilized,
as it were; in England without a code, than in some other countries with one.

That, however, is no reason for our departing
from our criminal code which seems to me in its terms to be more imperatively
adverse to the appellants contention in its terms than the logical result of
the judicially made law of England.

The word ""satisfaction"" has given to
it, in Murray's Dictionary, as one of its many meanings, the following :

6. Release from suspense, uncertainty, or
uneasiness (J.); information that answers a person's demands or needs, removal
of doubt, conviction.

Phrase, to (a person's) satisfaction.

I am unable to find the thing proved, as our
Code so expressly requires, unless it is so beyond reasonable doubt. I should
dislike very much to hold any man proved insane, either in a civil or criminal
proceeding. unless I could do so beyond reasonable doubt.

And I venture to think that the safety and
protection of society is just as important as is the protection of a member
thereof, when that member is placed upon trial. On the one hand he or she has
been most justly protected for ages by the use of a judicial formula, as it were,
lest passion and prejudice should prevail and injustice be done.

And in relation to the defence of insanity,
those who have given thought to the matter at all, must realize how easy it has
been and still is to abuse the defence by suggestions, for example, of
temporary insanity, and mislead those moved by pity or passion, to the
deterioration of the due administration of justice.

I respectfully submit that society as a whole is
quite as much entitled to be protected as a single member thereof. Such
illustrations as proof of an

[Page 615]

alibi, which forms part of the evidence of the
actual facts pro and con, bearing upon the issue raised relative to the actual
perpetration of the offence in question, are quite beside the collateral
substantive issue of mental and moral responsibility.

That is only permitted to be raised as a defence
in law to the actual commission of the offence when rebutting the presumption
of sanity declared by said section until the insanity is proved.

The charge against an accused person should in
regard to the acceptance of and weight to be given the evidence of fact for or
against him or her so far as bearing upon the actual offence charged, be kept
clearly and distinctly severable from the defence of insanity, and each of the
issues thus raised be given its own proper place in the presentation thereof,
made by the judge's charge, or otherwise.

It must be determined first whether or not upon
the evidence bearing upon the actual perpetration of the offence, the accused
can be found ""beyond reasonable doubt"" guilty, and then due
consideration be given to the alternative of whether or not at the time in
question the accused was of sound mind within the meaning of the statute and
that finding must be subject to the like limitations of proof ""beyond
reasonable doubt.""

The appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed.

Duff J.—On the trial of an accused person indicted for murder where the
defence of insanity is set up, it is incumbent upon the accused in order to
negative his responsibility for an act otherwise criminal to prove to the
satisfaction of the jury that he was insane at the time he committed the act. Mcnaghten's
Case[12],

[Page 616]

and Criminal Code, section 19, subsec. 3. The
trial judge told the jury that they ought to convict the prisoner unless the
defence of insanity was established by the prisoner beyond a reasonable doubt,
and he added:

If you entertain any reasonable doubts as
to the sanity of the prisoner at the time he committed the act, why then it is
your duty to convict.

This direction was, in my opinion, an erroneous
one and calculated to mislead the jury.

Broadly speaking, in civil proceedings the
burden of proof being upon a party to establish a given allegation of fact, the
party on whom the burden lies is not called upon to establish his allegation in
a fashion so rigorous as to leave no room for doubt in the mind of the tribunal
with whom the decision rests. It is, generally speaking, sufficient if he has
produced such a preponderance of evidence as to shew that the conclusion he
seeks to establish is substantially the most probable of the possible views of
the facts. This proposition is referred to by Mr. Justice Willes in Cooper v.
Slade[13],
in these words:

The elementary proposition that in civil
cases the preponderance of probability may constitute sufficient ground for the
verdict.

The distinction in this respect between civil
and criminal cases is fully explained in a judgment of Mr. Justice Patteson
speaking for the Judicial Committee in the case of Doe d. Devine v. Wilson[14], The
whole passage is so instructive and so apt that it is worth while reproducing
it in full:—

Now, there is a great distinction between a
civil and a criminal case, when a question of forgery arises. In a civil case
the onus of proving the genuineness of a deed is cast upon the party who
pro-

[Page 617]

duces it, and asserts its validity. If
there be conflicting evidence as to the genuineness, either by reason of
alleged forgery, or otherwise, the party asserting the deed must satisfy the
jury that it is genuine. The jury must weigh the conflicting evidence, consider
all the probabilities of the case, not excluding the ordinary presumption of
innocence, and must determine the question according to the balance of those
probabilities. In a criminal case the onus of proving the forgery is
cast on the prosecutor who asserts it, and unless he can satisfy the jury that
the instrument is forged to the exclusion of reasonable doubt, the prisoner
must be acquitted.

Now, the charge of the learned judge
appears to their Lordships to have in effect shifted the onus from the
defendants, who assert the deed, to the plaintiff, who denies it, for in
substance he tells the jury that whatever be the balance of the probabilities,
yet, if they have a reasonable doubt the defendants are to have the benefit of
that doubt, and the deed is to be established even against the probabilities in
favour of the doubt. Certainly, it has been the practice so to direct the jury
in a criminal case; whether on motives of public policy or from tenderness to
life and liberty, or from any other reason, it may not be material to inquire,
but none of those reasons apply to a cicil case. If, indeed, by the pleadings
in a civil case, a direct issue of forgery or not, be raised, the onus
would lie on the party asserting the forgery, and this would be more like a
criminal proceeding, but even then the reasons for suffering a doubt to prevail
against the probabilities, would not, in their Lordships' opinion, apply.

This exposition of the distinction between the
two classes of cases brings out the point that the rule in criminal cases is a
rule based upon policy.

The distinction may be illustrated by reference
to another class of proceedings in which a similar rule applies, namely,
proceedings to establish illegitimacy and proceedings in which the validity of
a de facto marriage is called in question. Where a child is born of a
married mother and husband and wife have had access during the relevant period
the presumption of legitimacy is of such a character that it can only be
overcome by evidence producing in the mind of the tribunal a moral certainty.
And this moral certainty is contrasted by Lord Lyndhurst in a celebrated
passage in Morris v. Davies[15],
with a conclusion

[Page 618]

reached by weighing the probabilities and
resting upon a mere balance of probabilities. The like rule prevails where a
marriage having been solemnized, there have been cohabitation and issue and a
question arises as to whether the marriage ceremony was formally sufficient. In
such a case it is incumbent upon those who impeach the validity of the marriage
to demonstrate the existence of the defect.

All this is sometimes expressed by saying that
the law presumes innocence and legitimacy but in truth the fact that in given
circumstances there is a rebuttable presumption of law in favour of a certain
conclusion does not necessarily afford any guide as to the weight or strength
of the evidence required to rebut the presumption. The law presumes for example
that a promissory note is given for a valuable consideration; a presumption
which has only the effect of establishing a prima facie case. The law
presumes innocence but it prescribes also a supplementary rule, namely, that in
criminal proceedings, at all events, the presumption of innocence is not
rebutted unless the evidence offered for that purpose demonstrates guilt in the
sense of excluding to a moral certainty all hypotheses (not in themselves
improbable) inconsistent with guilt.

The precise question to be determined is whether
the same rule governs where the presumption to be overcome is a presumption of
sanity. Where the question arises on a criminal prosecution the practice has
been to treat the presumption as a presumption of law and this practice seems
to be sanctioned both by the answers given by the judges in Mcnaghten's Case[16] and by
the provision of the Criminal Code of Canada

[Page 619]

above referred to; but as I have just pointed
out the circumstance that the presumption is a presumption of law tells us
nothing as to the weight of the proof required to overcome it. Is there a
special rule as to this?

I am unable to think of any principle or any
reason of policy comparable in importance to those upon which rest the rules
touching the presumptions of innocence and legitimacy for holding that a
similar rule should be applied as touching the character of the proof to be
exacted where the presumption to be overcome is the presumption of sanity; or
why the general principle should not be adhered to that in judicial proceedings
conclusions of fact may legitimately be founded upon a substantial
preponderance of evidence.

I have moreover no doubt that the expressions
which have for generations been used by judges in instructing juries in criminal
proceedings as to the degree of certainty justifying a conviction (as ""the
prisoner must be given the benefit of the doubt,"" ""guilt must be
established to the exclusion of reasonable doubt""), are expressions which
have passed into common speech; and that a Canadian jury receiving instructions
couched in similar terms as to the probative weight of the evidence necessary
to justify a given conclusion would in the great majority of cases attach to
these expressions the significance which they ordinarily bear and are intended
to bear when used in relation to the presumption of innocence. A jury being
instructed that a finding of insanity would only be proper if they should be
satisfied to the exclusion of all reasonable doubt upon that point, would not,
I am quite sure, understand that an affirmative conclusion would be justified
by proof consisting only of a substantial preponderance in the weight of
evidence.

[Page 620]

It will be necessary to refer very briefly to
some authorities that have been mentioned. And first of the charge of Mansfield
C. J. in Bellingham's Case, which is said to have been approved by Lord
Lyndhurst C. B. in The Queen v. Oxford[17]. The
report of Sir James Mansfield's charge seems to be a newspaper report only, and
Lord Lyndhurst's words of approval seem to be rather directed to the Chief
Justice's definition of insanity than to his remarks upon the burden of proof.
Lord Lyndhurst indeed in Oxford's Case17, contents himself with
stating that the jury must be satisfied that the prisoner was insane before
they can properly acquit him. Bellinghams's Case was a very painful case
and I do not think it can be regarded as a satisfactory authority upon this
point. See The Queen v. Oxford17; The Queen v. McNaughton[18], and
especially the speech of Mr. Cockburn. In Oxford's Case17, just
referred to, Lord Denman C.J., who with Alderson B. and Patteson J. presided,
limited himself to remarking as regards the burden of proof that all persons ""prima
facie must be taken to be of sound mind till the contrary is shewn.""
In similar terms the jury was charged in The Queen v. Vaughan[19]; Reg.
v. Higginson[20];
Reg. v. Davies[21];
Reg. v. Barton[22];
Reg. v. Townley[23];
Reg. v. Layton[24].

It is quite true that in Reg. v. Stokes[25], Rolfe
B. is reported to have said that if the jury were left in doubt it would be
their duty to convict, and similar language is attributed to Bingham J. in Rex.
v. Jefferson[26].
When the remarks of these learned judges are

[Page 621]

read as a whole, however, the fair
interpretation of them seems to be that the jury must be satisfied with the
evidence of insanity. They were not, I think, intended to convey to the jury
the impression that they must arrive at that degree of moral certainty which is
necessary to justify a conviction upon a charge of crime. As against these
observations may be put the language of Tindal C. J. in addressing the jury in McNaughton's
Case[27],
where he presided with Williams J. and Coleridge J. The learned Chief Justice
used these words:—

If on balancing the evidence in your minds
you think the prisoner capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, then
he was a responsible agent and liable to all the penalties the law imposes. If
not so, and if in your judgment the subject should appear involved in very
great difficulty, then you will probably not take upon yourselves to find the
prisoner guilty. If that is your opinion, then you will acquit the prisoner.

It seems clear that there has been no uniform
practice of directing the jury on the issue of insanity in the manner adopted
by the trial judge in this case and as it appears, as I have said, to be more
consistent with principle that the jury should be told that insanity must be
clearly proved to their satisfaction but that they are at liberty to find the
issue in the affirmative if satisfied that there is a substantial, that is to
say, a clear preponderance of evidence, I am constrained to the conclusion that
there was substantial error in the conduct of the trial and that a new trial
should be directed.

Anglin J.—Is it misdirection to instruct a jury that to justify a verdict
of acquittal on that ground (sec. 966 Crim. Code) in a prosecution for murder
the defence of insanity must be established beyond a

[Page 622]

reasonable doubt? The Supreme Court of Alberta
en banc (Harvey C. J. dissenting), held that it was in Rex v. Anderson  [28].
The Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, following its own
previous judgment in The King v. Kierstead[29], has
unanimously held in this case that it is not. Hence this appeal—the first brought
to this court under section 1024 (a) of the Criminal Code, enacted by 10-11
Geo. V., c. 43, s. 16.

If this question were entirely open, I should be
disposed to accept as more logical and humane than that approved in English law
(however defensible the latter may be on grounds of policy) the view which has
prevailed in the Supreme Court of the United States and in many states of the
Union (Lawson on Presumptive Evidence, p. 537; 16 C.J., 775) that, while the
presumption of sanity relieves the prosecutor in the first instance from
proving that fact, if, upon the whole evidence, a reasonable doubt remains in
the mind of the jury whether at the time of the killing the accused was
mentally competent to distinguish between right and wrong or to understand the
nature of his act, it cannot properly render a verdict of guilty. Davis v.
 United States[30];
German v. United States[31].
The reasoning of Mr. Justice Harlan, delivering the judgment of the court in
the Davis Case30, seems to me unanswerable. How can a
man rightly be adjudged guilty of a crime

if upon all the evidence there is
reasonable doubt whether in law he was capable of committing crime? (P. 484).

***

How upon principle or consistently with
humanity, can a verdict of guilty be properly returned if the jury entertain a
reasonable doubt as to the existence of a fact which is essential to guilt,
viz., the capacity in law of the accused to commit that crime ? (P. 488).

[Page 623]

Where, as in murder, intent is an essential
element in the crime, if the evidence as a whole so far rebuts the presumption
of intent that it is left doubtful whether the accused was capable of forming
the necessary intent—could have had mens rea—how can it be held that all
the constituent elements of criminality are established beyond reasonable
doubt? Professor Thayer in his excellent Treatise on the Law of Evidence (1
ed., pp. 381-4) discusses this question with his customary lucidity.

The defence of insanity, which goes to negative
an essential ingredient of the crime—criminal intent—just as does the defence
of inevitable accident—and as the defence of an alibi goes to negative another
essential element, the identity of the accused—is thus put on the same footing
as other defences. Evidence in support of them which creates in the minds of
the jury a doubt whether some essential element of the crime has been
established—a doubt which on the whole evidence is not removed—entitles the
accused to an acquittal, since the burden of satisfying the jury of his guilt
beyond reasonable doubt, which always rests on the prosecutor and never
changes, has not been discharged. Rex. v. Schama[32]; Rex.
v. Stoddart[33];
Rex. v. Myshrall[34].

But this is not the law of England with regard
to the defence of insanity as is stated by the judges in their answers to questions
propounded to them by the House of Lords in McNaghten's Case[35], which,
notwithstanding criticism by eminent judges and writers, have ever since been
generally accepted in English courts as authoritative. It does not suffice in

[Page 624]

English law that a defendant pleading insanity
should create a doubt as to his sanity in the minds of the jury. He must prove
his irresponsibility ""to their satisfaction""—it must be ""clearly
proved."" So said Lord Chief Justice Tindal, speaking for himself and his fellow
judges.

As the learned Chief Justice of Alberta says[36] the authority of McNaghten's
Case[37]
not having been accepted in the United States

a reference to American text writers and
cases can furnish no aid in determining the law in Canada on this subject.

On the other hand our Parliament has seen fit in
s. 19 (3) of the Criminal Code to define the law which is to govern Canadian
courts in these terms:—

Everyone shall be presumed to be sane at
the time of doing or omitting to do any act until the contrary is proved.

It is noteworthy that, although the codifiers
undoubtedly had the language of McNaghten's Case37 before
them, our legislators have not said that, in order to overcome the presumption
of sanity, mental irresponsibility must be ""clearly proved"" or even
that it must be ""established to the satisfaction of the jury""—but
merely that it must be ""proved.""

Another point of difference between our
statutory law and that of England, perhaps not devoid of significance, is that
whereas here on insanity being ""proved"" the verdict is to be
""not guilty"", (the jury being required to find the insanity specially
and, if that be the case, to state that the acquittal is on account of it s.
966), thus indicating that insanity with us goes to the question of guilt or
innocence, in England since 1883 (46-47 Vic., c. 38) in like circumstances the
verdict must be guilty of the act or omission

[Page 625]

charged but insane at the time when he did the
act or made the omission, thus indicating that insanity is there not an absolute
defence but rather matter available in arrest of judgment. This would seem to
be a logical outcome of the view that, notwithstanding reasonable doubt as to
sanity raised by the evidence, criminality involving intent may exist beyond
reasonable doubt.

No doubt, however, ""proved"" in
subsection 3 of section 19 of our Code must mean ""proved to the
satisfaction of the jury,"" which, in turn, means to its reasonable
satisfaction. Braunstein v. Accidental Death Ins. Co.[38]. It may
possibly have been meant to cover the phrase ""clearly proved"" used in
McNaghten's Case[39].
""Clear and positive proof,"" however, was held in an Indian case cited
in Stroud's Jud. Dict. (2 ed.), 323, (the report is not available here) to mean
""such evidence as leaves no reasonable doubt."" If the adverb
""clearly"" adds to the force of the participle ""proved"" its
use, in my opinion, is not warranted under our Code. Still less is it
justifiable to add to the ""proved"" of the Code such a distinctly
qualifying phrase as ""beyond all reasonable doubt,"" if a higher
degree of certainty is thereby required than the word ""proved"" itself
imports.

""Proved"" is not a word of art. Aaron's
Reefs v. Twiss[40].
It may have different shades of meaning varying according to the subject matter
in connection with, and the context in which, it is used. ""Tested"" or
""made good"" or ""established"" are its ordinary equivalents. Murray's Dict. Crampton v. Swete[41];
It may require only evidence of the factum probandum

[Page 626]

sufficient to be left to a jury. Tatam v.
Haslar[42];
see too The People v. Winters[43].
Here I find nothing to warrant requiring evidence of greater weight than would
ordinarily satisfy a jury in a civil case that a burden of proof had been
discharged—that, balancing the probabilities upon the whole case, there was
such a preponderance of evidence as would warrant them as reasonable men in
concluding that it had been established that the accused when he committed the
act was mentally incapable of knowing its nature and quality, or if he did know
it, did not know that he was doing what was wrong. That I believe to be the law
of Canada, as it appears to be that of most of the states of the American
Union. Undérhill on Criminal Evidence, s. 158.

The latter clause of the ancient maxim, stabit
praesumptio donec probetur in contrarium, does not import that any special
amount or degree of evidence is required to rebut the presumption. Its whole
office is to shift to him against whom it operates the burden of adducing such
evidence as will satisfy the tribunal that the presumption should not prevail
(Best on Evidence, 11 ed., p. 314), such proof as may render the view which he
supports reasonably probable. To require that a particular presumption must be
negatived beyond reasonable doubt is to super-add to the force of the presumption
a rule of substantive law—and that has been done in the case of the presumption
of innocence. Thayer, Law of Evidence, 1st ed., pages 336 and 384. The history
of this presumption of law and the distinction between it and the doctrine of
reasonable doubt is dealt with by Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) White in Coffin
v. United States[44],
at pages 452-60.

[Page 627]

I quite appreciate the difficulty experienced by
Harvey C. J.[45],
and by White J.[46],
in formulating the distinction between proof to the satisfaction of the jury
and proof beyond reasonable doubt. How can I be satisfied of a fact if I have
reasonable doubt that it is so? But, with Mr. Justice Beck, (p. 117) I am
convinced that the expression ""proved beyond reasonable doubt"" has
become consecrated by long judicial usage as pointing to an amount or degree of
proof greater than is imported by the word ""proved"" standing alone or
by the expression ""established to the satisfaction of the jury,"" or
even by ""clearly proved""—certainly greater than is required to
discharge the burden of proof in civil matters. That learned judge quotes an
extract from the judgment delivered by Sir John Patteson in Doe d. Devine v.
 Wilson[47],
at page 531, and a passage from Taylor on Evidence (par. 112) as illustrating
this difference. But the actuality of the distinction in law between an
instruction that the existence of a fact or condition must be proved and that
it must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt is perhaps best tested by the
inquiry whether an accused would not have ground for complaint if the trial
judge having charged that the jury must be satisfied of his guilt—that it is
clearly proven—should refuse to direct them that they must be so satisfied
beyond reasonable doubt. I put that question to counsel for the Crown during
the argument. It was not answered. I find it was anticipated by Mr. Justice
Stuart in Andersons's case (pp. 113-4). With that learned judge

I think the rule is well established that
an accused person is entitled to have such a direction given,

[Page 628]

accompanied by an explanation of what is
reasonable doubt. Rex. v. Stoddart[48];
Rex. v. Schama[49];
Reg. v. White[50],
are instances of the recognition of this right in English law. In R. v. Sterne,
cited in Best on Evidence (11 ed.) 84, Baron Parke instructed that there
should be

such moral certainty as convinces the mind
of the tribunal as reasonable men, beyond all reasonable doubt.

I also agree with Mr. Justice Stuart that

if the expression (beyond reasonable doubt)
was not improper in the present case, then it inevitably follows that it is not
necessary in the ordinary case,

i.e., in directing the jury as to the burden of
the prosecution.

The case of Reg. v. Layton[51], in
which the trial took place shortly after McNaghten's Case[52], where
the direction given by Rolfe B. was

the question therefore for the jury would
be not whether the prisoner was of sound mind but whether he had made out to
their satisfaction that he was not of sound mind,

may perhaps be referred to as an instance of a
correct appreciation of the effect of the McNaghten Case. Lord Lyndhurst had
delivered a similar charge in Rex v. Offord[53]. The
charge of Bigham J. in R. v. Jefferson[54], that
the prisoner has to make out the charge of insanity

to your satisfaction without any reasonable
doubt; if you have reasonable doubt as to whether he knew he was doing wrong or
not you must find him guilty.

though similar to that in Bellingham's Case, as
noted in53, and to that in. R. v. Stokes[55], was, I
venture to

[Page 629]

think, a misapprehension of the effect of the
answer of the judges in the House of Lords. Such a charge, would, in my
opinion, be clearly wrong in Canada. These Nisi Prius reports, however,
are really of little value.

On appeal in Jefferson's Case[56],
Lawrence J., delivering the opinion of the court setting aside the verdict on
another ground, was careful to state that no question had been raised as to the
direction of the trial judge (p. 470), probably to make it clear that approval
of it was not to be inferred.

I am, for these reasons, of the opinion that
there was misdirection at the trial of the appellant and that it is not
possible to say that substantial wrong did not result therefrom. The
application of the appellant for leave to appeal should, therefore, be granted
and his conviction set aside and a new trial directed.

Brodeur J.—I concur with my brother Duff.

Mignault J.—A presumption being, by definition, a deduction from a known or
ascertained fact, or, as the old writers expressed it, ex eo quod plerumque
fit, it is clear that the presumption of sanity of mind, entailing civil
and criminal responsibility, would be fully recognized even if it had not been
made the subject of a statutory declaration. So paragraph 3 of section 19 of
the Criminal Code, which states that

every one shall be presumed to be sane at
the time of doing or omitting to do any act until the contrary is proved,

merely gives an unnecessary, I do not say a
useless, legislative sanction to a universally recognized presumption of fact,
entitling us to consider it as a

[Page 630]

presumption of law—although that does not add to
its evidential force—which will stand as proof of the basic element of criminal
responsibility, until it is rebutted or, to use the words of the Code,
""until the contrary is proved.""

This shews that although we have an express
declaration by the legislature, the Code really adds nothing to the common law;
in fact the presumption of sanity of mind, involving criminal responsibility,
is recognized in England as well as in all countries, and our inquiries need
not carry us further, which are subject to the common law.

We may, therefore, take the rule stated by the
judges in McNaghten's Case[57],
that the jurors should be told that every man is presumed to be sane until the
contrary is proved to their satisfaction, (I do not here refer to the further
statement of the judges, speaking by Tindal C. J., that insanity must be
""clearly proved"") as being in effect the rule of our criminal code,
for although the words ""to the satisfaction of the jury"" are not contained
in paragraph 3 of section 19, inasmuch as the contrary of the presumption must
be proved, and the proof must be passed on by the jury, this proof must be
sufficient to satisfy the jury that the presumption has been rebutted.

I do not think that it is necessary to consider
cases that have been decided in the United States, although I have read with
interest and with some measure of sympathetic consideration the able opinion of
the late Mr. Justice Harlan in Davis v. United States[58], to the
effect that if on the whole evidence any reasonable doubt exists as to the
sanity of the accused the jury should acquit. This manifestly would transgress
the

[Page 631]

rule of our Code, for instead of proving his
insanity, it would be sufficient for the accused to create in the minds of the
jury a reasonable doubt whether he was sane when he committed the crime, which
would, in my judgment, deprive the legal presumption of its legitimate effect.

Here the learned trial judge in charging the
jury emphasized that it was their duty to convict the accused unless in their
opinion he had proved his insanity beyond a reasonable doubt. Is this
misdirection in law? The Supreme Court of New Brunswick, whose judgment in the
case of The King v. Kierstead[59],
the learned trial judge followed, has unanimously held that it was not.
Inasmuch, however, as the Appellate Division of Alberta, in Rex v. Anderson[60],
had decided that such a direction was wrong, the appellant was enabled to
appeal to this court by reason of a recent amendment of the Criminal Code 10-11
Geo. V., ch. 43, sec. 16.

My first impression at the hearing was that if
the jury entertained a reasonable doubt whether the plea of insanity was
proved, the legal presumption was not rebutted. Further reflection has,
however, led me to think that it is sufficient that the jury be satisfied on
all the evidence that the plea of insanity has been established, and for that
reason I fear that the direction which was given in this case may have been, to
say the least, misleading. It is, moreover, open to the objection that
something is added to the law, which is content with requiring that the
contrary be proved, without specifying the degree of proof to be adduced. It is
unquestionable that guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, so that the
presumption of innocence is stronger, and rightly so, than the presumption of
sanity. Proof in ordinary matters does not suppose

[Page 632]

that the evidence removes all doubt; it is the
result of a preponderance of evidence, or of the acceptance on reasonable
grounds of one probability in preference to another, and, in the case of
insanity, the evidence generally is largely a matter of expert opinion. To say
that insanity must be proved to the satisfaction of the jury does not weaken
the legal presumption, but it places the plea of insanity on the same footing
as all other defences which must be established so as to satisfy the jury. I
would certainly not say that if the jury be in doubt whether the accused was
sane or insane they should acquit him, because, if they accept his plea of
insanity, they must expressly find that he was insane and return a verdict of
not guilty because of insanity (sect. 966 Crim. Code). But while unquestionably
all the onus here is on the accused, still the jury may accept his evidence as
having greater weight than that of the Crown, although they might not feel that
all reasonable doubt has been removed. Such a doubt might be caused by the
testimony of one reputable expert against the opinion of other experts, and, in
such a case, it is certainly within the province of the jury to accept the
views of the latter in preference to those of the former. I would therefore
think that a proper direction would be to call the attention of the jury to the
legal presumption of sanity and to inform them, the onus being on the accused,
that insanity must be proved by him to their satisfaction. Further than that I
would not go.

A serious wrong or miscarriage may have resulted
from the direction given by the learned trial judge, so on full consideration I
concur in the judgment allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN.

Seduction—Evidence—Indecent assault—Damages.
Sec. 13 Cr. C.

In an action framed for damages for indecent
assault, although the plaintiff's evidence of force and want of consent on her
part is discredited, the court can, nevertheless, accept her evidence that the
defendant is the father of the child and find that there was seduction. Cassels
J. dissenting.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal (14 Sask.
L.R. 117) reversed, Cassels J. dissenting.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Saskatchewan[1],
reversing the judgment of Taylor J. at the trial1, and dismissing the
appellant's action.

This action is one for damages by the
appellant against the respondent alleging that the latter did carnally know her
against her will, whereby she became pregnant. The appellant testified that she
did not consent to the intercourse with the respondent. The trial judge
disbelieved this evidence, but found that she had been seduced by the
respondent and that the defendant was the father of her child, and he allowed
her $2,500 damages. The Court of Appeal

[Page 518]

held that, as the appellant's evidence of
force and want of consent on her part was discredited, and as there was no
other evidence than appellant's that she had been seduced, the respondent
denying any connection at all, the court could not find that there was
seduction.

W. S. Gray for the appellant. It was open to the trial judge to accept the
appellant's evidence in part and reject it in part. E. v. F.[2]; Brown v. Dalby[3].

H. Fisher for respondent. The appellant failed to prove her action as brought
for criminal assault. The appellant on the evidence is not entitled to a
judgment for damages for seduction. Gibson v. Rabey[4].

W. S. Gray for
the appellant

H. Fisher for
respondent

Idington J.—I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs
and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.

I agree so fully with the reasons assigned by
Mr. Justice Lamont in his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal that I
need not repeat same here.

Duff J.—The judgment of Mr. Justice Taylor was reversed by the Court of
Appeal on the ground that the evidence of the plaintiff established that there
was no seduction within the meaning of the statute. Mr. Justice Taylor's view
evidently was that the plaintiff's account of the occurrence to the effect that
she was overwhelmed by force could not be accepted in view of certain facts
which he considered established.

[Page 519]

These facts he thought incompatible with the
hypothesis of serious resistance by the plaintiff. Is the plaintiff precluded
by her own evidence given on cross-examination from maintaining the allegations
of her statement of claim which are the essential allegations of a cause of
action under the statute? The question is not without difficulty; but on the
whole I think it may properly be answered as Mr. Justice Taylor impliedly
answered it. If the rejection of the plaintiff's account necessarily involved
the assumption that she had committed perjury then I think the law would not
permit her to recover a judgment based on that assumption. But here no such
assumption was involved; the learned trial judge might very properly, as he
did, conclude that in the plaintiff's state of health, the plaintiff's
impression of what occurred had become blurred and could not be wholly relied
upon as an accurate register of what actually happened and that the only safe
course was to draw the inference properly arising from certain physical facts
which pointed as he thought very clearly to the conclusion at which he arrived.
As a general rule, no doubt, where a party calls a witness with his eyes open
with full knowledge of what the witness is likely to say (and more especially
where the witness is the party), it is not competent to that party to
contradict him on a vital point. That was held in Sumner v. Brown[5], by Mr.
Justice Hamilton. I think that rule is inapplicable to this case. It is, I
think, a question for the tribunal of fact to determine in such a case whether
statements made on cross-examination by such a witness as the plaintiff with
respect to such an occurrence was one which, having regard to all the
circumstances, ought to be treated as conclusive against her.

[Page 520]

Assuming in any case that there was an absence
of consent there was still a right of action for assault.

It has been laid down (see Smith v. Selwyn[6]), that
where the facts constituting the foundation of a cause of action in themselves
constitute a felony the right of action for tort is suspended until the
plaintiff has prosecuted the defendant if the plaintiff is the person on whom
the duty of prosecution falls; but this is an objection which cannot be raised
as a defense to an action on the pleadings and it is not a proper ground for
non-suit. The defendant's proper course is to raise it by an application to
stay. Section 13 of the Criminal Code of Canada professes to abolish this rule.
It may be questioned whether this is a subject within the competence of the
Parliament of Canada as appertaining to the domain of the criminal law or as a
proper subject for the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction in the enactment of a
Criminal Code. But at least there is a declaration in the most deliberate and
solemn form by the legislative authority having jurisdiction over the criminal
law, that the rule is no longer necessary in the interests of public justice.
As the rule has its foundation in the supposed interests of public justice, it
is at least, I think, exceedingly doubtful whether in this country any action
ought to be stayed on such a ground.

That is a question which does not strictly arise
here because no application was made for a stay of the action and the rule, if
not entirely obsolete, ought at least to operate only within the straitest
limits allowed by precedent.

[Page 521]

Anglin J.—I had occasion very fully to consider the chief question which
arises on this appeal in the case of E. v. F.[7]. I have
had no reason to change the views there expressed. The only difference between
that case and the case at bar is that there the plaintiff was the father
whereas in the present case the girl herself brings the action by virtue of a
statutory provision enabling her to do so. That difference in my opinion does
not suffice to render inapplicable here the ground of decision in E. v. F.7.
I agree with the view of Mr. Justice Lamont that where, in an action
constituted as is that at bar, the plaintiff either in examination-in-chief or
in cross-examination gives evidence of circumstances which negative the
existence of violence sufficient to establish a case of ravishment, her right
to recover is not necessarily destroyed because she has alleged and sworn to
such violence. The reasons assigned by that learned judge in his dissenting
opinion are so satisfactory that I feel I cannot usefully add to them.

I would therefore with respect allow this appeal
with costs here and in the court of appeal and would restore the judgment of
the learned trial judge.

Mignault J.—The appellant testified that the respondent had connection with
her, but that it was without her consent and by force. The learned trial judge
discredited this latter statement, and indeed under the circumstances described
by the appellant it seems impossible that the respondent could have succeeded
in having connection with her unless she had allowed him to do so. But the
learned trial judge none the less believed that connection had taken place and
that the respondent was the father of the child to whom the appellant had given
birth.

[Page 522]

The respondent argues that the appellant's
action was an action for an assault amounting to rape; that in such an action
the learned trial judge could not give her judgment for seduction; and that the
appellant could not obtain a judgment for assault, because her statement that
connection with her was had by force and without her consent was rejected by
the trial judge.

In my opinion the learned trial judge could
credit one part of the appellant's testimony and disbelieve the other part as
being grossly improbable, not to say impossible. If, notwithstanding her
statement that she was not a consenting party but was overcome by force the
learned trial judge really believed, under all the circumstances, that a case
of seduction had been made out, he was certainly entitled to give the appellant
judgment for seduction. Of course, the position of the appellant on this appeal
is somewhat extraordinary for she, or her counsel for her, is forced to contend
that a part of her testimony was rightly discredited by the trial judge. But
there is no doubt in my mind that the judge at the trial could partly accept
and partly reject the appellant's story, as unquestionably a jury could do.
That is all I need to say, for I feel that I can add nothing to the dissenting
opinion of Mr. Justice Lamont in which I fully concur.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal should be
reversed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.

Cassels J. (dissenting).—I would dismiss this appeal. I agree with the
reasons of the learned Chief Justice. The plaintiff, Amelia MacKenzie, was at
the date of the alleged assault or rape (1st July, 1917) of the age of twenty
years. On the 30th

[Page 523]

of June, 1920, she was twenty-three years of
age. Her story as well as her conduct is full of inconsistencies and in my
opinion it would be a dangerous precedent to allow a judgment to stand based on
evidence such as that given on behalf of the appellant.

Appeal allowed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN.

Criminal law—Bribery—Violation of provincial
Act—""Administration of justice""—Cr. C. ss. 2, 157, 164—(C) 31 Vict.
c. 71, s. 3—""The Saskatchewan Temperance Act"" Sask., S. (1917) c. 23.

A bribe given in order to induce a police
officer not to proceed against the party giving it for violation of ""The
Saskatchewan Temperance Act"" is given with intent to interfere with the
""administration of justice"" under section 157 of the Criminal Code.
Idington J. contra.

Per Idington J. (dissenting)—Section 157 of
the Criminal Code can only herein be held relevant to a peace officer or public
officer as defined in the interpretation clause of the said code; and appellant
was not acting within such definition but merely performing a duty of
inspecting books under the ""Saskatchewan Temperance Act"", and
reporting, which could have been discharged by any one. The offence in question
was one against section 39 of the said ""Temperance Act"", and hence impliedly
excluded by section 154 of the said code from falling within section 157
thereof.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Saskatchewan[1],
affirming the judgment of the trial court, with a jury, in the judicial
district of Swift Current, in Saskatchewan.

[Page 176]

The accused appellant was indicted as follows
: ""For that he, … with intent to interfere corruptly with the due
administration of justice, did corruptly give to one … police officer a bribe …
in order to induce (him) not to proceed against the said (accused) for
violation of the Saskatchewan Temperance Act."" The accused was found
guilty by the jury but he prayed for a case to be reserved for the Court of
Appeal.

The question submitted in the reserved case
stated by the trial judge and the circumstances of the case, are fully stated
in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.

F. H. Chrysler K.C. for the appellant.

Harold Fisher for the respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.

Idington J. (dissenting).—The appellant was indicted in the King's Bench
Judicial District of Swift Current, in Saskatchewan, as follows:

……For that he, the said Jacob Kalick, on
the 20th of December, A.D. 1919, with intent to interfere corruptly with the
due administration of justice did corruptly give to one Abraham Weder, a Police
Officer, a bribe to wit—the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000) in order to
induce the said Abraham Weder not to proceed against the said Jacob Kalick for
violation of the Saskatchewan Temperance Act.

On this he was found guilty by the jury and
thereupon the learned trial judge reserved for the Court of Appeal the
following question:—

Was a bribe given in order to induce a
Police Officer not to proceed against the accused for violation of the
Saskatchewan Temperance Act, given with intent to interfere with the
administration of justice under section 157 of the Criminal Code? The evidence
and charge to the jury is hereto annexed.

[Page 177]

The majority of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal
answered in the affirmative.

The dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Newlands
which gives us, by virtue of section 1024 of the Criminal Code, the
jurisdiction to hear an appeal therefrom, held that the offence disclosed by
the evidence did not fall within said section 157 of the Criminal Code inasmuch
as it was not specifically defined by the said Code as a crime, and was
specifically provided for by the 39th section of the Saskatchewan
""Temperance Act"" under and by virtue whereof the officer in question
was acting when alleged to have been bribed.

The section 39 of said Act reads as follows:—

39. 1. No police officer, policeman or
constable shall, directly or indirectly, receive, take or have any money for
reporting or not reporting any matter or thing connected with the
administration of this Act, or for performing or omitting to perform his duty
in that behalf, except the remuneration and allowances assigned him in virtue
of his office by the Government of the Province.

2. Any police officer, policeman or
constable receiving, or any person offering money contrary to the provisions of
this section shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a penalty of $100 and
in default of immediate payment, to imprisonment for three months.

He held that, inasmuch as Parliament has the
exclusive jurisdiction of declaring what is, or may constitute a crime, and had
only declared offences against provincial legislation to be crimes when and so
far as falling within section 164 of the Criminal Code, which he held could not
be so operative or effective as the circumstances in question herein required
in order to maintain said conviction. That section reads as follows:—

164. Everyone is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to one year's imprisonment who, without lawful excuse,
disobeys any Act of the Parliament of Canada or of any Legislature in Canada by
wilfully doing any act which it forbids, or omitting to do any act which it
requires to be done, unless some penalty or other mode of punishment is
expressly provided by law.

[Page 178]

That, which is simply a re-enactment of the
Criminal Code of 1892, seems, not only an express declaration of what (when
merely resting upon disobedience of an Act of Parliament or of a legislature)
is to constitute an indictable offence, but also to limit or restrict the indictable
quality of the offence to something which is not within the reservation
expressed by the term

unless some penalty or other mode of
punishment is expressly provided by law.

That enactment of the Criminal Code of 1892 was
in substitution of 31 Vict. ch. 71, sec. 3, which was the earliest enactment of
the Dominion Parliament giving the added strength of its enactment by virtue of
the exclusive jurisdiction it had over criminal law, to help the enforcement of
provincial legislation.

As I have always understood, the policy pursued
in this regard has been to help the provincial legislation but to carefully
abstain from trenching upon the provincial legislative powers, or wishes of the
provincial legislators, as expressed by themselves relative to the sanctions to
be imposed by provincial legislation.

Such being the case when we find any provincial
legislative enactment containing an express sanction to secure its enforcement,
its terms ought to be respected and be the limit in that regard.

It seems idle to take as our guide the vulgar
idea of what may constitute a crime, when we have a much better guide in the
history of the legislation emanating from Parliament as above outlined.

Then turning to the details of what has to be
considered in light thereof, we have, in section 2 of the Criminal Code, the
definition and interpretation of the words ""Peace Officer"" and
""Public Officer"" which are used in the said section 157, now in
question.

[Page 179]

Why should we go beyond these for the purposes
of this case?

There certainly is nothing in the Saskatchewan
""Temperance Act"" that seems to justify any departure from these
respective definitions, nor in the code to render it imperative to expand
either definition in relation to the particular officer in question herein.

What were his duties? What office did he fill,
under the Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act"" which would render it fitting
he should be looked upon as either a peace officer or a public officer within
the meaning of section 157 of the Criminal Code, now in question?

He may have been in fact a peace officer, or
worn the uniform of such, but the actual duty in question which he had to
discharge was under the liquor department created under said Act to inspect the
books which appellant, as a druggist, was bound by said law to keep as a vendor
of liquor, and compare the incoming supply of liquors with the outgoings served
from said supply, and the prescriptions authorizing sales, and report the
result of such inspection and audit to his superior officer.

Any man or woman sent by the liquor department
to discharge such simple duty could have made just as good a report. It was not
in any legal sense necessary to have sent a constable, or peace officer, or
public officer, as defined by the code, to perform such a duty.

And sending one apparently so decorated surely
did not help to bring him within the meaning of section 157.

The evidence of Weder, the officer in question,
tells the story as follows:—

[Page 180]

Q. What was the first conversation you had
with him?

A. When I came, into the drug store I asked
for the record and Mr. Kalick gave them to me and I went back into the
dispensary to do the work there.

I sat down at the little table in the
dispensary, Mr. Kalick came in and says ""listen here, I will give you $100.00
and you leave the books alone.""

I said I would not do that. I then went to
work and started to check up the books and just before I was through Kalick
came up again and asked me how I was getting along.

I replied that I was of the opinion that he
had to account for some shortage. He said, ""I will give you $500 and you
leave the books alone,"" or rather, ""Fix up the books so that they
will be all right.""

I said I did not know whether he would be
short or not yet, that I was not through.

After I was through checking up the books I
found a shortage of liquor and I asked Mr. Kalick if he could account for the
shortage and he did not say anything to that.

So then he offered me $1,000 to call the
matter square, that is the way he put it.

This illuminates the story relative to the
nature of the duties that were being discharged and the offence of the
appellant.

Unless we are to hold that the administration of
the Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act"" and ""the administration of
justice"" are synonymous terms, I fail to see how we can bring this
offence, which the foregoing quotation and the remainder of the story unfold,
assuming the strict interpretation of it as against the appellant, within the
meaning of the indictment assumed to be founded upon section 157 in question.

I have no doubt upon the facts interpreted as
contended for against the appellant, and in the absence of legislation relevant
thereto, that he might have been held to have offended at common law as
suggested in the court below, or against section 39 of the Saskatchewan
""Temperance Act,""

[Page 181]

I cannot see, even if the conviction herein
stands, how the appellant could plead that, if prosecuted at common law or
under said section 39 of said Act, in bar of such prosecution.

That seems to me not only the fair test, but the
one which the law imperatively requires to maintain this conviction as founded
on section 157.

In short I agree with Mr. Justice Newlands that
the offence now in question disclosed by the evidence was, if interpreted
against the appellant, clearly one against the above quoted section 39, s.s. 2,
and hence impliedly excluded by section 164 of the Criminal Code from falling
within section 157, now in question.

Moreover, assuming there might, in the absence
of special or specific legislation bearing on the question, have been found
something offensive against the common law, it is not that we have to deal with
but section 157. And I submit we must read that and section 164 together, and
apply the law that fits the crime.

I, therefore, am of the opinion that the appeal
should be allowed.

Duff J.—The stated case is in these words:—

On Feb. 5th, 1920, at Swift Current, the
accused was found guilty by a jury on the charge: ""For that he, the said
J. Kalick, on the 20th day of December, 1919, with intent to interfere
corruptly with the due administration of justice, did corruptly give to one
Abraham Weder, a police officer, a bribe, to wit: the sum of one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) in order to induce the said Abraham Weder not to proceed
against the said J. Kalick, for the violation of the Saskatchewan Temperance
Act.""

The question submitted for the opinion of the
Court is:

Was a bribe given in order to induce a
Police Officer not to proceed against the accused for violation of the
Saskatchewan Temperance Act, given with intent to interfere with the
administration of justice under section 157 of the Criminal Code?

[Page 182]

It seems clear that giving a bribe to prevent
prosecution for an offence is prima facie an interference with the
administration of justice. Mr. Chrysler argues that it is not within those
words in the context in which they appear in section 157 on two grounds:

1. That the offence is specifically dealt with
in those parts of the same section as well as in section 164 of the code and
that the normal scope of the phrase must receive some restriction in
consequence. I cannot perceive the application of sec. 164 and as to the other
parts of section 157 they do not touch the case of accepting or giving a bribe
for affording protection against a prosecution for an offence and that the
facts proved established a case of giving a bribe for such a purpose is assumed
in the question submitted.

2. He argues that the application of the section
is limited to offenders or persons supposed to be or suspected of being or
fearing that they are offending against the criminal law strictly so called,
that is to say, against the criminal law as falling within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. While the word ""crime"" in
the Criminal Code generally speaking applies only to crimes strictly so called
and probably has that restricted meaning in this section, I think there is
nothing requiring us to limit the meaning of the words administration of
justice in the way suggested.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Anglin J.—The reserved case assumes that the defendant endeavoured to
stifle a prosecution for a violation of the Saskatchewan ""Temperance
Act"" by bribing a police officer, Was the bribe

given with intent to interfere with the
administration of justice under section 157 of the Criminal Code

is the question propounded. In my opinion it
was.

[Page 183]

It is quite immaterial whether the police
officer actually intended or contemplated instituting a prosecution. It
suffices that the appellant gave the bribe with intent to head off such a
proceeding. The due administration of justice is interfered with quite as much
by improperly preventing the institution of a prosecution as by corruptly
burking one already begun.

Two contentions were pressed by Mr. Chrysler—(a)
that interference with a prosecution for a contravention of a provincial penal
statute is not within the purview of section 157 of the code; and (b) that if
any offence against that section was committed it was that of bribing a police
officer

to protect (the appellant) from detection
or punishment

and not that of

interfering corruptly with the due
administration of justice.

(a) The obvious purpose of section 157 is to
declare criminal and to render indictable the corruption or attempted
corruption of officers engaged in the prosecution, detection or punishment of
offenders. ""Offenders"" is a very wide term (Moore v. Illinois)[2], and the
use of it affords a strong indication that the application of section 157
should not be restricted, as counsel for the appellant argued, to cases in
which the bribe is offered or given to prevent the prosecution, detection or
punishment of a person who is, or apprehends that he may be, charged with a
crime indictable under the criminal code or at common law. The contravention of
a valid provincial penal statute is an offence and a person who commits it is
an offender.

(b) I am unable to agree with the contention
that, if what the appellant did amounted to bribing a Peace

[Page 184]

Officer with intent ""to protect (himself)
from detection or punishment etc."" within the concluding phrases of clause
(a) of section 157, it cannot warrant his conviction for the crime of bribing a
peace officer with intent to interfere corruptly with the due administration of
justice provided for in the earlier and more comprehensive phrases of the same
clause. That the act charged against the appellant was done with intent to
interfere corruptly with the due administration of justice in the ordinary
acceptation of that phrase is conceded. The mere fact that it might also
warrant a conviction under the more restricted terms of the concluding phrase
of clause (a) is not, in my opinion, a sufficient reason for cutting down the
plain meaning of the earlier phrase. Other instances of similar overlapping
occur in the Criminal Code.

Moreover, in order to bring the case within the
concluding phrase of clause (a) a finding that the appellant had committed, or
had intended to commit, a contravention of the Saskatchewan ""Temperance
Act"" would be essential. No such finding has been made. No such issue was
presented to the jury. No such charge was laid. Whether the appellant had in
fact committed, or had intended to commit, an offence against the Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act"" was quite irrelevant and immaterial to the charge
as laid. It was only essential that, being apprehensive of prosecution for such
an offence, the appellant should have bribed the police officer with intent to
prevent the realization of that possibility. Upon the case presented he could
not have been convicted under the concluding phrase of clause (a); but upon the
facts assumed in the reserved case he was, in my opinion, rightly convicted
under the earlier clause.

[Page 185]

It is quite unnecessary to consider whether the
breach of a provincial penal statute which provides its own penalty is a
""crime"" within the meaning of that word as used at the end of clause
(a) of section 157. Expressing no opinion upon that question, I allude to it
merely to observe, with great deference, that cases such as In re McNutt[3], referred to by the learned
Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, and the later and decisive case of Mitchell v.
Tracey[4],
which deal with the meaning and scope of the words ""arising out of a
criminal charge"" in section 39 (c) of the Supreme Court Act, would appear
to me to afford little or no assistance in determining it.

The appeal fails.

Brodeur J.—This is a criminal appeal. The appellant was convicted before a
duly constituted tribunal with having corruptly interfered with the administration
of justice in giving to a police officer a bribe of $1,000 in order to induce
this police officer not to proceed against him for violation of the Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act.""

The charge had been laid under section 157 of
the Criminal Code which makes it an indictable offence for any person to give
to a police officer employed for the prosecution, detection or punishment of
offenders any money with intent

1° to interfere with the administration of
justice; or 2° to procure the commission of any crime; or 3° to protect from
detection or punishment any person having committed or intending to commit a
crime.

The reserved case which is now before us is
submitted in the following words:

[Page 186]

Was a bribe given in order to induce a
police officer not to proceed against the accused for violation of the Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act"" given with intent to interfere with the
administration pf justice under section 157 of the Criminal Code?

It is contended by the accused that he was
prosecuted for having corruptly interfered with the administration of justice,
that the giving of money to protect from detection any one committing a crime
before any proceedings have been instituted for the punishment of that crime is
not interfering with the administration of justice and that it is another
offence dealt with otherwise.

The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan answered
the reserved case in the affirmative, Mr. Justice Newlands dissenting.

The police officer who received the bribe had
been instructed by his superior officers to check the liquor sales made by the
appellant and to see whether the latter had unlawfully sold any liquor contrary
to the dispositions of the Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act,"" and to find
out whether information should not be laid against the appellant.

The work which the police officer was carrying
out was authorized by the law and was absolutely necessary to put the wheels of
justice in motion.

I am of opinion that the ""administration of
justice"" mentioned in section 157 of the Criminal Code should not be
restricted to what takes place after an information had been laid; but it
includes the taking of necessary steps to have a person who has committed an
offence brought before the proper tribunal, and punished for his offence. It is
a very wide term covering the detection, prosecution and punishment of
offenders.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

[Page 187]

Mignault J.—On the ground that the charge against the appellant, and on which
a verdict of guilty was returned by the jury, comes within the terms of article
157 of the Criminal Code, the jury having found the appellant guilty of having,
on the 20th day of December, 1919, with intent to interfere corruptly with the
administration of justice, corruptly given a bribe to a police officer to
induce him not to proceed against the appellant for violation of the
Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act,"" I am of opinion that the question
submitted should be answered in the affirmative. To give a bribe to a police
officer with this intent is a corrupt interference with the administration of
justice within the terms of Article 157. It is, in my opinion, immaterial
whether proceedings were then pending or merely likely to be taken, and I do
not think that the fact that these proceedings were to be instituted under the
Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act"" takes the case out of the operation of
this section of the Criminal Code.

The appeal therefore fails and should be
dismissed.

Appeal
dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Speedy trial—Election—Jury
trial—Requirement by the Attorney-General—Sections 446 (a), 690, 825, 826, 827,
828, 830, 833, 873, 1018, 1024 Cr. C.—(D.) 32-33 Vict, c. 29, s. 28—(D.) 8-9 Ed.
VII, c. 9, s. 2.

The appellant was accused of an offence,
punishable by imprisonment for a period exceeding five years and for which he
had the right of election to be tried by a judge or a jury. He first elected to
be tried by a jury and, after the preliminary hearing, he was committed for
trial. Whilst still in custody of the sheriff, he wrote to the latter that he
was electing for a speedy trial and the sheriff notified the judge of the
sessions of this election. He was then brought before a district magistrate and
there elected for a speedy trial. Later on, the Attorney-General signed a
declaration that the indictment has been on his order ""brought before the
grand jury."" It was so brought, a true bill was found and the appellant
tried before a jury and found guilty.

Held, Idington
J. dissenting, that the conviction of the appellant by a jury was legal.

Per Sir Louis
Davies C.J. and Duff J.—The requirement signed by the Attorney-General was in
compliance with section 825 Cr. C., as amended by 8-9 Ed. VII, c. 9. s.
2.—Idington J. contra and Anglin J. semble.

Per Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.—The election for a
speedy trial made by the appellant before a district magistrate was not valid,
as it should have been made before the residing judge of the sessions of the
Peace, according to section 827 Cr. C.

Per Idington
J. (dissenting).—The election by the appellant for a speedy trial, contained in
his letter to the sheriff, was valid, as being made in conformity with s.s. 2
of s. 828 Cr. C., and any subsequent irregularity could not affect the
appellant's rights.

Judgment of the Court of King's Bench
affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.

[Page 264]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the
trial judge, Desy J., with a jury and dismissing the motion made by the
appellant for a stated case.

The material facts of the case and the
questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments
now reported.

Fernand Choquette for the appellant.

Lucien Cannon K.C. for
the respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—At the close of the argument on this appeal, I
was of the opinion that the only arguable point requiring consideration was to
the effect that the Attorney-General had not complied with the amendment to
section 825 of the Criminal Code, 8-9 Ed. VII., Ch. 9, which enacted that

where an offence charged is punishable with
imprisonment for a period exceeding five years, the Attorney-General may
require that the charge be tried by a jury, etc.

It was admitted that the offence charged in the
indictment came within this section.

After examining the indictment filed with the
record, it seems to me quite clear that there is nothing in this objection.

The indictment appears first to have been signed
by the crown prosecutors on behalf of the Attorney-General under section 873,
but in addition to this the Attorney-General personally signed a requirement on
the back of the indictment that ""it should be brought before the grand
jury."" It was so brought, a true bill was found and the prisoner tried
before a jury and found guilty.

[Page 265]

It seems to me therefore that the amending
section of 825 has been fully complied with.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Idington J. (dissenting).—The appellant was brought before the magistrate of
the District of Quebec upon the accusation of an offence which entitled him to
a right of election to be tried by a judge or jury, and he elected the latter,
on the 28th April, 1920. Thereupon he was duly committed for trial accordingly.

On the 5th of May, following, whilst still in
custody of the sheriff, he availed himself of the privilege given by subsection
2 of section 828 of the Criminal Code, which provides as follows:—

2. Any prisoner who has elected to be tried
by a jury may, notwithstanding such election, at any time before such trial has
commenced, and whether an indictment has been preferred against him or not,
notify the sheriff that he desires to re-elect, and it shall thereupon be the duty
of the sheriff and judge or prosecuting officer to proceed as directed by
section eight hundred and twenty-six.

The sheriff duly notified the judge of the
sessions of this election.

Some question is now raised, for the first time,
as to whether the judge to whom the notice was delivered in fact was a judge of
the sessions.

That, to my mind, is quite immaterial. When once
the accused has duly made his election in the manner prescribed by the statute,
he has duly established his right to be tried by a judge, unless by virtue of
some other provision in the statutes that right has been overruled, or taken
away.

There is no pretence herein that any such
overruling of his election as was possible, under subsection 3 of the said
section, was seriously considered and

[Page 266]

determined against him. No such contention has
been set up. And if any mistake arose in the delivery of the sheriff's notice,
when properly addressed as the record before us shews or in the proceedings
thereon the prisoner must not suffer for that.

What is relied upon with more assurance is that
contained in the Criminal Code Amendment Act, 1909, which, amongst other
changes, amended section 825 as it theretofore stood by adding subsection 5,
which reads as follows :—

5. Where an offence charged is punishable
with imprisonment for a period exceeding five years, the Attorney-General may
require that the charge be tried by a jury, and may so require notwithstanding
that the person charged has consented to be tried by the judge under this part,
and thereupon the judge shall have no jurisdiction to try or sentence the
accused under this part.

Under this sub-section undoubtedly the
Attorney-General for the province can overrule the appellant's election.

The sole question with me herein is one of fact.
Did the Attorney-General deliberately decide, in light of the foregoing facts,
that the appellant should be deprived of his prima facie right of
election to trial by a judge instead of by a jury?

Curiously enough the opinion judgment of Mr.
Justice Martin seems expressly to admit that the indictment upon which the
appellant was convicted by the jury was

on the 9th of June * * * preferred against
the accused before the Grand Jury of the District then in session, upon the
order of the Attorney-General of the Province, under the provisions of Article
873 of the Criminal Code.

And Mr. Justice Pelletier in like manner attributes such action as the Attorney-General took
to have been done pursuant to same article 873 of the Criminal Code.

[Page 267]

That article reads as follows:—

873. The Attorney-General or any one by his
direction or any one with the written consent of a judge of any court of
criminal jurisdiction or of the Attorney-General, may prefer a bill of
indictment for any offence before the grand jury of any court specified in such
consent.

2. Any person may prefer any bill of
indictment before any court of criminal jurisdiction by order of such court.

3. It shall not be necessary to state such
consent or order in the indictment and an objection to an indictment for want
of such consent or order must be taken by motion to quash the indictment before
the accused person is given in charge.

4. Except as in this part previously
provided no bill of indictment shall be preferred in any province of Canada.

If what was done by the Attorney-General in way
of the preferment by the indictment in question is attributable to the
operation of said section, then, what was done by such preferment certainly
does not fall within the meaning of the amendment of section 825, by adding
subsection 5 above.

Up to the time of this express amendment the
Attorney-General could not, nor could any one on his behalf, take away the
right of election given the accused, though the learned judge or prosecuting
officer before him, had long had the power, under section 828, subsection 3, of
refusing to allow the exercise of the right of re-election in special cases
whenever they deemed it would not be in the interests of justice.

The occasion for this, by some mischance I am
unable to understand, possibly never arose. A possibly accidental absence of
the judge qualified to act is one surmise if, as suggested in argument, he who
did act was not, but then that could not deprive accused of the election he
made by his letter to the sheriff and forwarded by the sheriff's letter to the
right judge.

Be all that as it may, if the accused was not
brought up before the right judge, as the statute requires, that was the fault
of the prosecuting counsel,

[Page 268]

else we should not have the judicial assent
indorsed on the sheriff's letter, and that did not take away this right of the
accused, and due regard should have been had to the fact, on the motion to
quash the indictment. Any irregularity on the part of the local authorities in
the matter could not, as appears by Reg. v. Burke[1], affect the appellant's
rights.

With great respect, neither of these learned
judges in appeal seems to me accurately to have distinguished that which may
rest upon section 873 from that which must rest upon section 825, subsection 5,
added by the amendment of 1909. I agree with them that section 873 was all that
parties acting had in mind. The former is intended to govern the right to go
before a grand jury to prefer an indictment, which right at common law was
possessed by all the King's subjects but, by later legislation, was cut down to
what the Attorney-General might permit, or the learned judge presiding might,
on application to him; permit or order.

That modern way of restricting and regulating
proceedings before a grand jury was first introduced, so far as I can find,
into Canada by the Act respecting Criminal Procedure of 1869, 32-33 Vict., Ch. 29, sec. 28, confined to something like half a dozen offences.

Needless to trace how this at one time known as
relating to vexatious indictments was developed until the restriction became
complete and was subjected to the requirements of said section 873, just
quoted.

It is, however, imperatively necessary to bear
in mind herein the origin and purpose of that section and its requirements as
distinguishable from the origin and purpose of the later enactment of 1909,
upon which the decision of this appeal should turn.

[Page 269]

The mode in which the numerous attorneys general
of different provinces carried out the earlier enactment might vary in minor
details and, especially in the method of expression adopted for causing those
concerned to know and understand that required assent, no doubt differed.

That would, speaking generally, be a matter of
minor consequence.

It is a very different object that is to be
attained by the action of the Attorney-General upon the new section 825,
subsection 5, quoted above, which involves the taking away of a right of
election given to an accused person and implies the exercise of a kind of judicial
power or authority which the Attorney-General is, I submit, expected by the
amendment to specially direct his mind to in each case coming up for action.
The power is expressly one given to him alone and cannot be transferred to
another.

I am unable to see on this record any clear
exercise of any such power. What does appear therein seems to me more aptly
attributable to the provisions of section 873 as, by two of the learned judges
below, seems to have been inferred.

What possible reason could exist for the
exercise of such a power relative to what seems, at first blush, a very
ordinary sort of offence?

And again, if the Attorney General really
intended to take away the right from an accused of trial before a judge, I
should have expected I respectfully submit, to find it expressed by apt
language which would have left no room for argument, and that which we are
referred to does not express anything but what is consistent only with a
direction under section 873.

[Page 270]

Moreover how could there have been left in the
mind of any one concerned in the motion to quash the indictment, before accused
was forced to plead thereto, any doubt or difficulty, for if in fact the fiat
indorsed was in truth intended to mean what is contended for, surely in the
City of Quebec, above all places, that could easily have been set at rest by an
affidavit or otherwise.

Those accused of crimes may, in the majority of
cases, be at bottom in some minds entitled to very little consideration.

But we must guard their rights as sacredly as
possible, and remember that society is not well served by the conviction of any
man unless by due process of law strictly adhered to.

I think the appeal should be allowed, for the
reasons I have assigned, and that the right to have a case stated should have
been given him and, by reason not only of default thereof but under and by
virtue of the powers assigned in such event by sections 1018 and 1024,
respectively, to the Court of King's Bench and this Court, the conviction
should be quashed, or, if the majority of the court so conclude, referred back
to the learned trial judge to state such case as he should have stated.

See The King v. Hébert[2], and Reg. v. Hogarth[3],
as well as Reg. v. Burke[4],
already cited.

Duff J.—I concur with the Chief Justice.

Anglin J.—Only one of the objections to the validity of his conviction
taken on behalf of the defendant calls for consideration. It is that based on

[Page 271]

the alleged absence from the record of anything
which establishes the exercise by the Attorney-General of the power conferred
on him by s.s. 5 of s. 825 of the Criminal Code (8-9 Ed. VII, e. 9, s. 2) to
require that a person charged with an offence punishable by imprisonment for a
period exceeding five years shall be tried by a jury notwithstanding that he
has consented to speedy trial by a judge. The jurisdiction of the Court of
King's Bench in proceeding with the trial of this case is thus challenged. If
there was a valid election by the accused for a speedy trial, the jurisdiction
of that court was thereby superseded (ss. 825, 827 and 833, Cr. C.; Reg v.
Burke[5];
Rex v. Bissonnette[6],
per Lamothe C.J.) and could be re-established only by the Attorney-General
personally exercising the special power conferred on him by s.s. 5 of s. 825.
Being a condition of jurisdiction the fact that the authority had been
exercised should appear on the face of the proceedings. The ordinary
presumption in favour of the jurisdiction of a superior court scarcely covers
such a case.

The law does not prescribe any particular method
in which the Attorney-General is to act. Neither is notice to any person or
body required. Nor is it necessary that the Attorney-General should make his
requisition in open court. I am satisfied that the indorsement over his
signature on the indictment of his authorization for its presentment, provided
it is couched in terms which unmistakably imply action under s.s. 5 of s. 825,
will suffice.

But s. 873 Cr. C. likewise provides for the
preferring of indictments by or on behalf of the Attorney-General before a
grand jury. The power which that section confers, however, should not be
exercised where the

[Page 272]

accused has already elected for speedy trial,
and he may so elect after an indictment has been preferred under it. Giroux v.
the King[7].
This latter step was not taken in the present case, counsel for the prisoner
relying on what he assumed to have been a valid election for speedy trial
already made in the Court of Sessions of the Peace, and the case appears to
have proceeded in the Court of Appeal on the footing that such an election had
been duly made.

Counsel for the Attorney-General very frankly
stated, in answer to a direct question put by me, that if the indictment now
before us had been preferred under the authority of s. 873 it would have been
in its present form and might have carried precisely the indorsement found upon
it, namely:

Le présent acte d'accusation ""indictment'' est porté devant le grand jury par
ordre du soussigné procureur général de la Province de Québec.

9 juin 1920.

(Signé) L. A.
Taschereau,

Proc. Général de la
prov. de Quebec.

In other words, so far as the proceedings shew,
the action taken by the Attorney-General in regard to the presentation of this
indictment is referable quite as readily to s. 873 as to s.s. 5 of s. 825. It
is therefore impossible to say that it imports a requisition under the latter
provision. Under these circumstances, if there had been a valid election for
speedy trial, in my opinion it would be extremely doubtful, to say the least,
whether the conviction could stand and whether the motion to quash the
indictment made on behalf of the accused before plea should not have prevailed.

[Page 273]

But I find it unnecessary to determine this
question since, in addition to relying on the indorsement on the indictment as
sufficient evidence of the exercise of the power conferred by s.s. 5 of s. 825,
counsel representing the Attorney-General now insists, as it is quite within
his right to do (a respondent may support the judgment a quo on any
ground), that there was no valid election for a speedy trial because the
attempt of the accused to make such an election did not take place before the
judge of the Sessions of the Peace as contemplated by s. 827 Cr. C. Election
before the prosecuting officer (s.s. 2) is not suggested.

The District Magistrate, Corriveau, before whom
the record shews the accused was brought to make his election, was without
jurisdiction to receive it because there was at that time a Judge of the
Sessions of the Peace for the District of Quebec (s. 823 ii) as appears in the
record and is admitted by counsel for the appellant.

I cannot accede to the suggestion that the
notice to the sheriff, not required in this case (s. 826), but provided for in
other cases by ss. 825 (6), 828 (2), and 830 (2) itself constitutes an
election. Where it is made part of the procedure, that notice is a preliminary
step leading to the accused being given an opportunity to make his election by
being brought before the proper officer for that purpose. But the statute makes
it very clear that the election itself must take place before the judge or the
prosecuting officer ss. 825 (7), 826 and 827.

There was therefore no election by the accused
for a speedy trial sufficient to bring either ss. 3 and 4 of s. 827 or s. 833
into operation. It follows that, the

[Page 274]

jurisdiction of the Court of King's Bench never
having been superseded, its re-establishment by action of the Attorney-General
under s. 825 (5) was not necessary. The indictment can be supported under s.
873.

I regard this rather as a case of first election
within s. 826 (7), than as a case of re-election within s. 828. Section 830 (2)
would be applicable, however, if the accused upon withdrawing his original
election for a summary trial had elected to be tried by a jury and the warrant
of committal for trial had so stated. That warrant is not in the record, and
the election which preceded it is stated in the proceedings to have been merely
to proceed by preliminary investigation in lieu of summary trial.

There was evidence on which a jury could find
the defendant guilty of the charge laid against him. Taken as a whole as it
must be, the charge is not open to the objections raised. The sentence imposed,
while apparently severe, was within the jurisdiction of the court. It is not
within our province to review its propriety.

The defendant may have a real grievance in that
he was not given the opportunity to which he was entitled of making an election
for a speedy trial before a competent judicial officer. But I know of no
redress for that grievance which it is open to us to accord him in this appeal.

Brodeur J.—Il s'agit d'un appel sous les dispositions
de l'article 1024 du code
criminel.

La question qui nous est soumise est de savoir si
la Cour du Banc du Roi avait juridiction pour juger l'appelant.

[Page 275]

Ce dernier allègue qu'ayant été accusé sous l'article 446a du code criminel, il a
opté pour un procès expéditif et que plus tard, malgré son option, il a été
amené par acte d'accusation devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, où il a été jugé et
condamné à quinze ans de pénitencier.

La Couronne pretend que l'appelant n'a jamais fait d'option valable et que, même s'il en a fait
une, le Procureur-Général avait le droit de le poursuivre par acte d'accusation
devant la Cour du Banc du Roi sous les dispositions de l'article 825, s. 5 du code criminel. A cela l'accusé répond que le Procureur-Général ne
paraît pas avoir régulièrement fait la demande dont parle l'article 825, s. 5.

Y a-t-il eu option d'un procès expéditif par l'accusé?
Les pièces que nous avons devant nous ne sont pas très claires sur ce point. Il
est bien évident cependant que l'accusé désirait avoir un procès expéditif sous
les dispositions de la partie 18ème du code criminel. En effet, après que le
magistrat de district qui avait fait l'enquête préliminaire, eut, le 5 mai 1920, jugé la preuve suffisante pour lui faire subir un procès (art. 690) et l'eût envoyé en prison pour y être
détenu en attendant son procès, les avocats de ce dernier ont notifié le
shérif, qui avait la garde de l'accusé, qu'il optait pour un procès expéditif
et qu'il fut amené devant

la Cour des Sessions dans le plus court délai
possible afin qu'il puisse faire sa déclaration à cet effet.

Le shérif, le 6 mai, informe par lettre le Juge des Sessions, suivant les dispositions
de l'article 826 du code criminel,
que Minguy déclare faire option pour ""un procès expéditif"". Cette
lettre du shérif est versée au dossier et nous y voyons sur le dos de la lettre
l'entrée suivante:

[Page 276]

Le Roi vs. Alexandre Minguy. Option pour demander un
procès éxpéditif. Prod le 5 1920.

(Signé)                        T. & G.      G.P.

Le mois n'est pas mentionné, mais les parties
reconnaissent que c'est le mois de mai et que les initiales T. et G. sont
celles de Talbot et Gendron,
Greffiers de la Paix.

Nous voyons ensuite sur le dos de la même lettre
l'entrée suivante:

Québec, 7 mai 1920.

Présent: M. le Juge Corriveau, M.D.D.

Le prévenu étant présent, la décision sur son
option pour procès expéditif est ajournée au 10 mai 1920.

Gus. Chouinard,

D.G.P.

Les initiales M.D.D. signifient Magistrat de
district et celles D.G.P. signifient Député Greffier de la Paix.

Ces deux entrées que nous retrouvons sur la lettre
du shérif me paraissent peu explicites et correctes.

D'abord le 5 mai il n'a pas pu y avoir d'option pour procès expéditif, car à cette
date l'accusé n'avait pas encore été amené devant le Juge des Sessions. La
lettre du shérif adressée au Juge des Sessions n'a été envoyée que le 6 mai et ce n'est que le 7 que le prévenu comparaît devant un juge, qui
n'est pas, cependant, le Juge des Sessions mais un Magistrat de district,
celui-là même qui avait condamné l'accusé à subir son procès.

Il est admis par les deux parties qu'il y a un juge
des sessions à Québec.

En vertu du code criminel (Partie XVIII), les options pour procès expéditifs
doivent avoir lieu (art. 827) devant
le juge qui est défini par l'article 823 comme étant le Juge des Sessions. Le magistrat de district, suivant ce
dernier article, n'a juridiction que dans le cas où il n'y a pas de juge des
sessions.

[Page 277]

Le magistrat de district, M. Corriveau, n'avait
donc pas juridiction dans le district de Québec où il y avait un juge des
sessions. Par conséquent, le prévenu n'a donc pu faire d'option valable pour un
procès expéditif.

D'ailleurs a-t-il fait une option qui enlevait à la
Cour du Banc du Roi toute juridiction?

L'entrée qui est sur la lettre du shérif, en date
du 7 mai, démontre qu'il n'y a pas
eu d'adjudication sur l'option du prévenu pour procès expéditif. L'entrée
n'exprime probablement pas correctement ce qui a eu lieu. A raison de ce qui
est survenu subséquemment, je serais porté à croire que ce jour-là, le 7 mai, la Couronne a fait une demande ou bien a
manifesté l'intention d'avoir un procès par jury, et que la question est restée
en suspens de savoir si l'accusé serait jugé à la Cour des Sessions ou à la
Cour Criminelle.

Avant l'amendement de 1909
(8 et 9 Ed. 7, ch. 9, s. 2), le privilège de
l'accusé de choisir un procès expéditif était absolu; et du moment que son
consentement pour un procès expéditif était inscrit au dossier, son procès
devait avoir lieu conformément aux dispositions de la partie XVIII du code criminel (art. 825, s.s. 2, 3 et 4 code criminel, S.R.C.
1906) c'est-à-dire devant le Juge
des Sessions de la Paix.

Les amendements de 1909 ont ajouté plusieurs autres sous-sections à l'article 825, et notamment une à l'effet que le
Procureur-Général peut faire une demande que le procès ait lieu devant un jury.

Il me semble que cette demande, si elle ne peut pas
être refusée, ainsi que le prétend l'intimé, doit être au moins consignée au
dossier de la cause afin d'évoquer la cause devant la Cour du Banc du Roi ou
bien d'enlever au Juge des Sessions toute juridiction.

[Page 278]

Dans la cause actuelle, je suis d'opinion que
l'accusé a bien désiré opter pour un procès expéditif: mais son consentement
n'a pas été fait devant le juge compétent. Alors le Procureur-Général pouvait,
sous l'article 873 du code
criminel, porter un acte d'accusation devant le Grand Jury.

L'appelant se plaint aussi de l'illégalité des
instructions du juge au jury, mais il n'y a rien dans ces instructions qui
violent aucun principe de droit. Quant aux faits nouveaux qu'il prétend avoir
découvert depuis le procès et quant à la sévérité de la sentence, ce sont des
questions qui ne sauraient justifier notre intervention.

L'appel doit être renvoyé.

Mignault J.—Il y a deux questions à
examiner sur cet appel, car les autres griefs d'appel, dans mon opinion, sont
mal fondés; 1° L'appelant a-t-il
réellement opté pour un procès expéditif; 2° S'il y a eu telle option, l'acte d'accusation (indictment) sur lequel le procès a eu lieu
démontre-t-il que le procureur-général de la province de Québec exerçait le
pouvoir que lui confère le paragraphe 5 de l'article 825 du code
criminel, ou bien celui de l'article 873 du même code, qui permet au procureur-général ou à ses représentants de
soumettre un acte d'accusation au grand jury? Le pouvoir exercé sous l'article 825, al. 5, est d'une portée plus considérable que celui que confère l'article 873, car il rend sans effet l'option pour un
procès expéditif. Mais lorsque telle option n'a pas été valablement faite, il
va sans dire que l'acte d'accusation présenté par le procureur-général sous
l'opération de l'article 873, confère
pleine juridiction à la cour qui juge le procès. Du reste, dans l'espèce, le
magistrat

[Page 279]

de district avait fait l'enquête préliminaire et
avait déclaré qu'il y avait lieu de faire subir un procès au prévenu, de sorte que l'acte d'accusation aurait pu être soumis au grand jury sans l'ordre du
procureur-général.

Maintenant y a-t-il eu option du prévenu pour un
procès expéditif? Si j'arrive à la conclusion que la réponse doit être dans la
négative, je n'aurai pas besoin d'exprimer d'opinion sur la deuxième question.

Il est hors de doute que l'appelant désirait avoir
un procès expéditif, mais le désir ne suffit pas, il faut que l'option
elle-même soit faite devant une personne autorisée à la recevoir. A cet égard,
les parties admettent qu'il y a à Québec un juge des Sessions de la Paix,
l'honorable M. Choquette. Il y a aussi un magistrat de district, M. Philéas
Corriveau.

Après son arrestation, l'appelant fut amené devant
le juge des Sessions de la Paix, où il fit option pour un procès sommaire. Il
lui fut cependant permis plus tard de
se désister de cette option, et de procéder par enquête préliminaire. Cette
enquête, si le magistrat trouvait matière à procès, pouvait, suivant son choix,
le conduire soit à un procès expéditif devant le juge des Sessions de la Paix,
soit à un procès devant la cour du Banc du Roi siégeant au criminel. Pour le
premier, le procès expéditif, il fallait une option du prévenu: pour le second,
le procès devant la cour du Banc du Roi, aucune option n'était requise.

Le 5 mai
1920, le magistrat de district
déclara, je l'ai dit, qu'il y avait matière à procès. Le même jour les
procureurs de l'appelant écrivirent au shérif de Québec le notifiant que leur
client désirait opter pour un procès expéditif et le prièrent, en conséquence,
d'amener l'accusé devant la cour des sessions dans le

[Page 280]

plus court délai possible afin qu'il pût faire sa déclaration à
cet effet. Sur réception de cette lettre, le shérif, le 6 mai, écrivit au juge des Sessions de la Paix,
l'informant que l'accusé

déclare maintenant faire option pour un procès
expéditif.

D'après le code criminel, article 826, paragraphe 1er,

Tout shérif doit, dans les vingt-quatre heures
après qu'un prévenu ainsi que ci-haut est préventivement incarcéré en attendant
son procès, informer le juge par écrit que ce prévenu est ainsi incarcéré,
relatant son nom et la nature de l'accusation portée contre lui, sur quoi le
juge fait comparaître le prévenu devant lui sous le plus court délai possible.

Remarquons que par l'expression ""juge,""
la loi entend, dans le cas du district de Québec, le juge des sessions (art. 823 code crim.). Lorsque le prévenu est amené
devant le juge, celui-ci, après avoir pris communication des dépositions à la
suite desquelles le prévenu a été incarcéré:

(a) fait connaître au prisonnier de quelle
infraction il est accusé et lui en décrit la nature; et (b) lui explique qu'il
peut, à son choix, subir son procès immédiatement devant un juge sans
l'intervention d'un jury, ou rester en prison ou sous caution, selon que la
cour en décide, pour subir son procès de la manière ordinaire devant la cour
qui a juridiction criminelle. (Art. 827 code criminel.)

Si, lors, de cette comparution devant le juge, le
prévenu consent à subir son procès devant lui, sans l'intervention d'un jury,
le procès qu'on appelle expéditif se fait devant le juge.

D'après l'article 828, paragraphe 2,

tout prisonnier qui a opté pour le procès
devant un jury, peut nonobstant l'option ainsi faite, en tout temps avant le
commencement du procès, et soit qu'une accusation ait été ou non portée contre
lui, notifier, au shérif, qu'il désire revenir sur sa décision; sur quoi le
shérif et le juge ou le fonctionnaire poursuivant doivent suivre la procédure
prescrite par l'article huit cent vingt-six.

[Page 281]

Cette notification au shérif se fait dans le cas où
un prévenu, qui a opté pour le procès devant un jury, désire revenir sur sa
décision, et alors le shérif et le juge doivent suivre la procédure prescrite
par l'article 826 dont j'ai cité
le premier alinéa. Dans l'espèce, l'appelant n'avait pas opté en faveur d'un
procès devant un jury, mais avait choisi une enquête préliminaire, laquelle, je
l'ai dit, pouvait conduire soit au procès expéditif devant le juge des
sessions, soit au procès ordinaire devant un jury.

Le deuxième alinéa de l'article 828 suppose qu'il y a eu choix d'un procès
devant un jury, choix que le prévenu désire rétracter. Il y a une disposition
au même effet, et pour le même cas de rétractation d'option, aux alinéas 2 et 3 de l'article 830. Il y a
également une disposition semblable à l'article 825, paragraphe 6, pour les
accusés sous caution, mais il n'y est pas question de rétractation d'option,
mais du choix d'un procès expéditif.

Apparemment on a procédé ici comme si l'appelant
avait choisi un procès par jury et voulait revenir sur ce choix, car c'est dans
ce cas qu'on s'adresse au shérif lorsque le prévenu est incarcéré. Dans
l'espèce, le shérif a informé par écrit le juge des sessions que l'appelant
désirait maintenant fake option pour
un procès expéditif.

Sur réception de cette lettre, le juge des sessions
aurait dû faire comparaître le prévenu devant lui, et lui faire les
déclarations exigées par l'article 827, et c'était alors le moment de faire l'option d'un procès expéditif. Au
lieu de cela, le 7 mai, on a fait
comparaître l'appelant devant le magistrat de district, M. Corriveau, et une
inscription au dos de la lettre du shérif—il semble au moins qu'on aurait dû faire une

[Page 282]

entrée au registre—indique que, le prévenu étant présent, la décision pour son option pour
procès expéditif est ajournée au 10 mai. En regard, on a écrit :

Le Roi vs. Alexandre Minguy, option pour procès
expéditif. Prod. le 5, 1920,

avec les initiales des greffiers de la paix au bas.

Est-ce pour la raison que M. Fernand Choquette,
avocat de l'appelant, nous a indiquée, de sa parenté avec l'honorable M.
Choquette, juge des sessions, dont il est le fils, que M. Corriveau, le
magistrat de district, a siégé le 7 mai? Les dispositions du code de procédure civile qui auraient empêché
M. Fernand Choquette de comparaître devant son père en matière civile ne
s'appliquent évidemment pas à un procès devant une juridiction criminelle, et
alors que j'apprécie hautement le sentiment de délicatesse qu'invoque le savant
avocat de l'appelant, qui a très habilement plaidé cette cause, il est évident
qu'on devait ici suivre la procédure qu'indique le code criminel. Or
malheureusement c'est devant le juge des sessions que devait se faire l'option
d'un procès expéditif, en réponse aux déclarations que celui-ci devait faire au
prévenu au désir de l'article 827; et comme il s'agit d'une matière de juridiction de droit commun, et que
la procédure par voie de procès expéditif est de nature exceptionnelle, et
exige le consentement du prévenu devant le juge des sessions, je ne puis
arriver à la conclusion que la Cour du Banc du Roi, siégeant au criminel, qui
est la juridiction de droit commun, a été dessaisie de la cause par ce qui
s'est passé devant le magistrat de district.

Les honorables juges de la cour d'appel paraissent
avoir pris pour acquis qu'il y avait eu choix d'un procès expéditif. Le fait
qu'ils n'ont pas discuté

[Page 283]

la question dont je viens de parler me dispose à
croire qu'elle a pu n'avoir pas été soulevée devant eux. Mais évidemment cette
question est préjudicielle, car s'il n'y a pas eu choix régulier d'an procès
expéditif, il n'importe nullement que le procureur-général n'ait pas déclaré
expressément qu'il exigeait le procès devant un jury malgré l'option pour un
procès expéditif. Je n'ai donc pas à exprimer d'opinion sur la question que les
honorables juges de la cour d'appel ont longuement discutée.

Les autres moyens invoqués par l'appelant, je l'ai
dit, sont dans mon opinion mal fondés. L'appel doit donc être renvoyé.

and

His Majesty the King Respondent.

Present:—Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Cannon, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Indictment—Formal charge in
writing setting forth offence —Description of offence—Insufficiency—Defects in
matters of sub-stance and essential averments omitted—Conspiracy—Overt act—Sub­stantial
wrong—Sections 852, 859, 878,
s.s. 5, Criminal Code.

Held insufficient
a count in a formal charge in writing (replacing in Quebec, a bill of
indictment before a grand jury no longer required in that province) that the
accused were parties ""to a seditious ""conspiracy in conspiring
together and with (other persons named ""and unknown), thereby committing
the crime of seditious conspir""acy,""

[Page 189]

such a charge containing defects in
matters of substance and essential averments having been wholly omitted.

Although conspiracy to commit a
crime, being in. itself an indictable offence, may be charged alone in an
indictment and independently of the crime conspired to be committed, it is
nevertheless necessary that a count charging conspiracy alone, without the setting
out of any overt act, should describe it in such a way as to contain in
sub-stance the fundamental ingredients of the particular agreement which is
charged, or, in other words, in such a way as to specify in sub-stance, the
specific transaction intended to be brought against the accused.

Under the terms of section 852 Cr.
C., which enacts an imperative requirement (""shall contain""), there
must be in the charge a statement that the accused has committed an indictable
offence; and such offence must be ""specified."" It will be sufficient
if the substance of the offence is stated; but every count must contain such
statement ""in substance."" It will not be sufficient to merely
classify or characterize the offence; it is necessary to specify time, place
and matter and to state the facts alleged to constitute the indictable offence.
The statement ""may be made in popular language, without any tech­nical
averments"" or allegations; or it ""may be in the words of the
enactment describing the offence or declaring the matter charged to be an
indictable offence""; but the statement must contain the allegations of
matter ""essential to be proved"" and must be in. ""words
sufficient to give the accused notice of the offence with which he is
charged"" (ss. 2 and 3 of section 852 Cr. C.) : the main object of such
legislation being that an accused may have a fair trial and consequently that
the indictment shall, in itself, indentify with reasonable precision the act or
acts with which he is charged in order that he may be advised of the particular
offence alleged against him and prepare his defence accordingly.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, sustaining the conviction of the
appellants, on their trial before Belleau J. and a jury, on a charge of having
been parties to a seditious conspiracy. The grounds of appeal, and the.
material facts of the case bearing on the points dealt with by this Court, are
sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed, the indictment
and the conviction were quashed.

R. L. Calder K.C. and Louis Lemay for
the appellants.

Gérard Lacroix K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RINFRET J.—The appellants were found guilty and con­victed in
the province of Quebec of having been parties to a seditious conspiracy. Upon
appeal, the verdict and

[Page 190]

conviction thereon were
unanimously affirmed by the Court of King's Bench (appeal side).

In the province of
Quebec (as well as in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and
British Colum­bia), it is no longer necessary to prefer a bill of indictment
before a grand jury; but it is sufficient that the trial of any person charged
with a criminal offence be commenced by a formal charge in writing setting
forth as in an indictment the offence with which he is charged (Cr. Code, subs.
5 of sec. 873).

In the present case,
the charge was preferred by the Attorney-General and read as follows:

The Attorney-General of the province of
Quebec charges that: during the months of September and October in the year of
our Lord one thousand nine hundred and thirty-three, at the city of Quebec, in
the district of Quebec, and elsewhere in the province of Quebec, George H. Brodie,
of Toronto, and G. C. Barrett, of Belleville, Ontario, were party to a
seditious conspiracy, in conspiring together and with one W. F. Greenwood, W.
G. Brown, Mrs. Charles Alton and Mrs. A. M. Rose and also with other persons
unknown, thereby committing the crime of seditious conspiracy.

One of the grounds of
appeal to the Court of King's Bench was that this indictment was, on the face
of it, insufficient. That court, however, refused to entertain the objection
and to quash the indictment.

The appellants,
thereupon, alleging that the judgment appealed from conflicted with the
judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in a like case (to wit: Rex v. Buck[1]),
were granted leave to
appeal to this Court under section 1025 of the Criminal Code.

There can be no
question of the existence of the con­flict.

In the present case,
the whole indictment, and in the Buck case, the count objected to in the
indictment, charged the accused with being parties to a seditious con­spiracy.
In both cases, the time and place were mentioned, the accused were named and
all that was charged was that, at such time and place, the accused were
""parties to a seditious conspiracy."" In the present case, the
indictment adds:

in conspiring together and with one W. F.
Greenwood, W. G. Brown, Mrs. Charles Alton and Mrs, A. M. Rose and also with
other persons unknown.

[Page 191]

It does not appear in
the report of the Buck case that the count there in issue contained a
similar mention. But otherwise the form of the charge was identical. In the
Quebec court of appeal, the indictment was held valid; in the Ontario Court of
Appeal, the count in the indictment was held invalid. It is evident that the
condition required by section 1025 of the Criminal Code is met; and, leave
having been granted, an appeal lies to this Court.

It remains for us to decide
whether or not a charge pre­ferred in the form stated is sufficient under the
provisions of the Criminal Code.

The general provisions
as to counts and indictments are contained in ss. 852 & seq. of the Code;
and the funda­mental rule is laid down in s. 852 itself, which reads as follows:

852. Every count of
an indictment shall contain, and shall be sufficient if it contains in
substance, a statement that the accused has committed some indictable offence
therein specified.

2. Such statement may be made in popular
language without any technical averments or any allegations of matter not
essential to be proved.

3. Such statement may be in the words of
the enactment describing the offence or declaring the matter charged to be an
indictable offence, or in any words sufficient to give the accused notice of
the offence with which he is charged.

4. Form 64 affords examples of the manner
of stating offences.

This section has given
rise to a diversity of interpreta­tions, not only in the case immediately under
discussion and in the judgment of the Ontario court in Rex v. Buck[2] already adverted to,
but also in other decisions through-out the country. It has been stated by one
court that the requirement that a count shall state in substance that the
accused has committed some indictable offence therein specified has reference
to the particular kind of offence, such as distinguished from other kinds of
offences recog­nized by the law; that it was not directed to the specific acts
and things which constitute the offence alleged to have been committed
(Prendergast, J., in Rex. v. Kelly[3]);
while another court (Rex v. Trainor[4])
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta) thought it was clear the enactment
did not mean that it is sufficient to say that the accused did, on such a day,
"" commit theft,"" or

[Page 192]

""steal,"" or
"" did commit an assault with intent to rob,"" without specifying the
thing stolen, or identifying the person assaulted, not necessarily by name, but
in some way or other.

Such was decidedly the
view of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, as expressed in
its judg­ment in Rex v. Bainbridge[5],
where Magee, J.A., said (p. 222):

It is evident from subsec. 2 (of sec. 852)
that matter which is essential to be proved is not to be omitted, and from
subsec. 3 that the accused is to have notice of the offence and not merely of
the character or class of the offence; while subsec. 1 requires that there is
to be a substantial statement of an offence which, not the class of which, is
specified, and which must be an indictable one.

In the same case,
elute, J. said:

This (subsec. 1 of sec. 852) does not mean
merely naming an offence, as ""murder"" or ""theft,"" but the
offence itself must be specified.

And a little further:

The indictment must contain a valid count
identifying the charge.

The other judges of the
court agreed either with Magee, J.A., or with Clute, J.

Following the same
principle, the Chief Justice of Ontario, speaking for the Court of Appeal in
the Buck case[6] and, as
already mentioned, with reference to an indictment preferred in precisely the
same wording as in the present case, said that the count failed for
insufficiency; and the insufficiency was not cured by the furnishing of particulars showing matter which, if embodied in the
count, would have rendered the count adequate. He expressed the view that the
true functions of particulars was to give further information to the accused of
that which it was intended to prove against him, so that he may have a fair
trial; but it was not intended to be, in effect, the supple­menting of a
defective indictment by supplying that which ought to have appeared in the
indictment itself. He added:

This is very plain from the reading of sec.
859 of the Code (later to be referred to).

On the other hand, in
the judgment now appealed from, Bernier, J., thought

qu'il suffit que l'acte d'accusation
contienne en substance une déclaration que le prévenu a commis quelque acte
criminel et spécifié * * *

[Page 193]

chaque chef d'accusation doit décrire les
circonstances de l'infraction imputée, afin de permettre l'accusé de
reconnaître ce à quoi il se rapporte; néanmoins, ajoute l'article, l'absence ou
l'insuffisance de ces détails ne vicie pas le chef d'accusation.

He further said, it is
true:

Il est possible que l'acte d'accusation
aurait pu décrire en détails la conspiration séditieuse reprochée aux
appelants; chose bien certain e cependant, c'est que cette omission ne leur a
causé, et n.e pouvait leur causer aucun préjudice, aucun .substantial wrong; ils savaient parfaite-ment ce dont ils étaient accusés et ce pourquoi
ils allaient subir une enquête préliminaire suivie d'un procès.

And it is not possible
exactly to surmise how far the latter consideration influenced the decision of
the learned judge.

As for Walsh, J., who
spoke on behalf of the other members of the Court, he held the indictment
sufficient as the appellants were ""charged in the words of the Criminal
Code."" The Crown had submitted and produced certain pamphlets distributed
by the accused, expressive of the seditious intention, and although no specific
passage in those pamphlets had been indicated by the Crown, this, in the
learned judge's view, was not necessary in this case

because no particular, but an ensemble constituted the offence.

The differences in the
legal interpretation of sec. 852 might also be traced in, among other cases: The
Queen v. Weir (No. 5)[7],
Wurtele, J.; Rex. v. Lemelin[8],
King's Bench (Quebec) appeal side; Le Roi
v. Beauvais &
Mon-tour[9];
Hatem v. Rex[10].

It has now become our
duty to decide the question.

If section 852 be
analysed, it will be noticed the impera­tive requirement ("" shall contain
"") is that there must be a statement that the accused has committed an
indictable offence; and such offence must be ""specified."" It will be
sufficient if the substance of the offence is stated; but every count must
contain such statement ""in substance."" In our view, this does not
mean merely classifying or char­acterizing the offence; it calls for the
necessity of specifying time, place and matter (Compare dictum of Channel, J.,
in Smith v. Moody[11]),
of stating the facts alleged to constitute the indictable offence.

The manner of stating
the matter is of no absolute importance, in view of subsections 2 and 3.
The statement may be made in popular language, without any technical

[Page 194]

averments or
allegations; or it may be in the words of the enactment describing the offence
or declaring the matter charged to be an indictable offence; but we think the
latter parts of subsections 2 and 3 are indicative of the intention of
Parliament: the statement must contain the allegations of matter ""
essential to be proved,"" and must be in "" words sufficient to give
the accused notice of the offence with which he is charged."" Those are the
very words of the section; and they were put there to embody the spirit of the
legislation, one of its main objects being that the accused may have a fair
trial and consequently that the indictment shall, in itself, identify with
reasonable pre­cision the act or acts with which he is charged, in order that
he may be advised of the particular offence alleged against him and prepare his
defence accordingly.

What Parliament
intended by using the words ""a statement * * * (of) some indictable
offence therein speci­fied,"" in subsection 1 of section 852 is, to our
mind, clearly illustrated by the ""examples of the manner of stating
offences"" given in Form 64, referred to in subsection 4 of section 852.

Under the Interpretation
Act (Ch. 1 of R.S.C., 1927), by force of sec. 31 (d):

wherever forms are prescribed, slight
deviations therefrom, not affecting the substance or calculated to mislead,
shall not invalidate them;

which obviously means
that any substantial deviation might be sufficient to invalidate the form used.
Now, a perusal of the examples given in Form 64 will be sufficient to indicate
that in no case is the manner of stating offences limited to the mere naming of
them, but in each case the act charged against the accused, though described in
the words of the enactment, is identified by specifying the time, the place and
the matter. We think the examples in Form 64 are referred to for the purpose of
indicating that they ought to be followed in substance. It is not sufficient in
a count to charge an indictable offence in the abstract. Con­crete facts of a
nature to identify the particular act which is charged and to give the accused
notice of it are necessary ingredients of the indictment. An accused person may
not be charged merely of having committed murder; the statement must specify
the matter. In the same way, in the present case, the appellants could not be
charged merely with having been ""parties to a seditious conspiracy,""
or

[Page 195]

having ""committed
the crime of seditious conspiracy."" The particular agreement between each
of them and "" with one W. F. Greenwood, W. G. Brown, Mrs. Charles Alton
and Mrs. A. M. Rose and also with other persons unknown"" into which they
are alleged to have entered and to which the Attorney-General gave the
appellation of "" seditious conspiracy "" ought to have been specified
in the charge prepared, either in popular language or in the words of the code,
in such a way as to show on its face that "" the matter charged ""
(subsection 2 of sec. 852) was an indict-able offence and as to apprise the
accused of the acts com­mitted by them for which they were called upon to
answer.

As a matter of fact,
this requirement of an indictment is further embodied in sec. 853 of the
Criminal Code, which enacts that

Every count * * * shall contain so much
detail of the circum­stances of the alleged offence as is sufficient to give to
the accused reason-able information as to the act or omission to be proved
against him and to identify the transaction referred to.

Such is the rule of the
Criminal Code.

Of course, it is
qualified by the proviso

that the absence or insufficiency of such
details shall not vitiate the count,

and it must be granted
that these words are very strong. It should be noticed, however, that the
proviso, as well as the section itself, relates only to the ""absence or
insuffi­ciency of details."" It does not detract from the obligation
resulting from sec. 852 that the substance of the offence should be stated in
the indictment.

Again do we find in
sec. 855 the confirmation of the construction which must be put on sec. 852, in
accordance with the views now expressed by us.

Sec. 855 is an
enumeration of instances where, notwith­standing the omission of certain
statements, the law says that

no count shall be deemed objectionable or
insufficient for the reason only

of this omission. A
mere perusal of the instances there given will show conclusively, to our mind,
that the require­ments of sec. 852 with regard to the ingredients which ""
every count of an indictment shall contain "" may not be restricted to the
mere naming of the offence charged, with-out specifying the substance of the
particular act com­plained of. If sec. 852 were to be construed in accordance

[Page 196]

with the contentions of
the Crown in the present case, the enumeration in sec. 855 of special
exceptions wherein cer­tain omissions are not to be deemed objectionable, or to
render the counts insufficient, would have been quite unnecessary.

Perhaps, in the
premises, it should be added that the Crown was unable to bring the indictment
within any of the enumerated exceptions, which makes it still clearer that the
indictment under discussion is insufficient. For example: Subsection (d) of
sec. 855 enacts that no count shall be deemed objectionable for the reason

that it does not set out any document which
may be the subject of the charge.

In our view, this
assumes that a document made the sub­ject of a charge should be referred to in
the count, but that it will not be necessary to "" set out "" the
document itself. In the present case, although apparently the Attorney-General
intended to charge against the accused the distribution of certain pamphlets,
no reference in the indictment is made to these pamphlets, or, indeed, to any
pamphlet at all. A fortiori, was there no ""setting out,"" in
whole or in part, of the pamphlets in question; although the omission to ""
set out "" the document is alone stated as being the omission which shall
not be deemed objection-able or shall not render the count insufficient.

The same reasoning may
be made in respect to sub-section (e) of sec. 855, that the count

does not set out the words used where words
are the subject of the charge.

Under subsections (f)
and (g), a count is not insufficient for the reason

that it does not specify the means by which
the offence was com­mitted,

or

that it does not name or describe with
precision any person, place or thing.

It seems to us that the
very terms in which the exceptions are expressed underline the minimum of
ingredients which a valid count of an indictment should contain. It must
contain, in substance, a statement of the specific act which is charged,
although it is not necessary that it should ""specify the means"" by
which the act was committed, or that it, should name, or describe, ""with
precision"" any

[Page 197]

person, place or thing.
In the latter provision, the essen­tial words are the words: ""with
precision.""

That this is the
correct interpretation of sec. 855 is strengthened, in our view, by comparison
with sec. 859 enumerating the cases in which particulars may be ordered.

Subsection (d) of sec.
859 deals with the charge of sell­ing, or exhibiting, an obscene book,
pamphlet, newspaper, printing or writing. If the court is satisfied that it is
necessary for a fair trial, it may order the prosecutor to furnish particulars stating
what passages in the book, pamphlet, newspaper or other printing or writing are
relied on in support of the charge. Which presupposes that the book, pamphlet,
newspaper, printing or writing has already been referred to in the charge.

This is made still
clearer in subsections (e), (f)
and (g) relating to ""
any document or words the subject of a charge""; to ""means by which
any offence was com­mitted""; or to "" any person, place or thing
referred to in any indictment."" Each of these subsections begins by the
words: "" further describing,"" which obviously contemplates
indictments already describing the document or words the subject of a charge,
the means by which any offence was committed, but requiring a ""further
"" description which, in the view of the Court, "" is necessary for a
fair trial.""

As for the
""person, place or thing"" dealt with in sub-section (g), the point is
made doubly clear, since the sub-section speaks of a ""person, place or
thing (already) re­ferred to in any indictment""; and it is stated that a
particular may be ordered ""further describing"" them.

The evident relation
between the matters dealt with in subsections (d), (e), (f) and (g) of sec. 855 and the corre­sponding subsections
of sec. 859 is, we think, illuminating on the subject-matter of the present
discussion. Clearly the result flowing from the two sections read together is:
that some statement of the particular circumstances of the offence charged is
assumed to be already contained in the count; that there may be omissions
which, on account of sec. 855, are not sufficient to make the count
objectionable; that the count will not be deemed insufficient by reason only of
those omissions; and that if the court is satisfied that it is necessary for a
fair trial, it may order particulars to describe further, or with more
precision the matters in question.

[Page 198]

It need not be added
that we are speaking now of counts in general, without reference to special
cases such as are: libel, perjury, false pretence, or other cases which are the
objects of special provisions with regard to indictment in the Criminal Code.

Applying the above
principles to the present appeal, it follows that the indictment must be found
insufficient. It is not the case where an offence is imperfectly stated; it is
a case where essential averments were wholly omitted. The so-called indictment
contains defects in matters of substance. To use the apt words of counsel for
the appel­lants: “it does not describe the offence in such a way as to lift it
from the general to the particular.""

Of course, we are
dealing with a case of conspiracy; and we are not unaware of the fact that in
stating the object of the conspiracy the same certainty may not be required as
in an indictment for the offence conspired to be com­mitted (Archbold's
Criminal Pleading, 29th ed., at p. 1419).

On a charge of
conspiracy, the agreement is itself the gist of the offence (Paradis v. The
King[12]).
The mere agreement to commit the crime is regarded by the law sufficient to
render the parties to it guilty at once of a crime (Kenny, Outlines of Criminal
Law, 13th ed., p. 81).

And we need only recall
the often cited passage of Lord Chelmsford in Mulcahy v. The Queen[13]:

It cannot exist without the consent of two
or more persons; and their agreement is an act in advancement of the intention
which each of them has conceived in his mind.

In other words, to
borrow the expression of Mr. Justice Willes (Mulcahy v. The Queen at p.
317): ""The very plot is an act in itself."" It follows that a person
may be convicted of conspiracy as soon as it has been formed and before any
overt act has been committed. The offence is complete as soon as the parties
have agreed as to their unlawful purpose (Kenny, Outlines of Criminal Law, 13th
ed., p. 289; Belyea v. The King[14]).
Hence the overt acts need not be set out in the indictment (Archbold's Crim­inal
Pleading, 29th ed., p. 1420. The King v. Hutchin­son[15]).

[Page 199]

The conspiracy is the
offence. It is not necessary to show that the accused went on to commit some
overt act towards carrying out the conspiracy. The actual accom­plishment of
the crime agreed upon will not cause the original offence of conspiracy to
become merged in it (Kenny, pp. 289 and 290).

But although conspiracy
to commit a crime, being in itself an indictable offence, may be charged alone
in an indictment and independently of the crime conspired to be committed, it
does not follow that the count charging con­spiracy alone, without the setting
out of any overt act, must not describe it in such a way as to contain in
sub-stance the fundamental ingredients of the particular agreement which is
charged, or, in other words, in such a way as to specify, in substance, the
specific transaction intended to be brought against the accused.

These averments were
omitted and these necessary in­gredients were lacking in the indictment
preferred against the appellants. Their absence constitutes defects in matters
of substance; and we are of opinion that these defects were not cured by the
so-called incomplete particulars verbally given by the Crown when, at the
outset of the trial, objection was taken to the indictment by counsel for the
accused. The Crown, it may be added, in the argu­ment before us did not rely on
these particulars, and took the stand that the indictment was sufficient as it
stood. Nor can we accede to the argument that, in the circum­stances, no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred and that we
should exercise the powers given to us by sec. 1014 of the Criminal Code. In
our view, it was a substantial wrong towards the appellants to have compelled
them to plead to an illegal indictment.

The motion to quash the
indictment made by the accused at the beginning of the trial, and before
pleading, ought to have been granted. The appeal will, therefore, be allowed.
The indictment and the conviction must be quashed, the Crown being at liberty
to prefer a fresh indictment, if so advised.

We do not want to part
with this appeal, however, with-out saying that our decision is strictly
limited to the points in issue. We would not like to be taken as subscribing to
certain generalities contained in some of the judgments to

[Page 200]

which we have been
referred and which would tend to convey the idea that, notwithstanding the
coming into force of the Criminal Code, the criminal law in this country should
continue to be administered as though there were no Code.

Appeal allowed; conviction quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Trial—Circumstantial
evidence—Rule as to evidence consistent with innocence or guilt of
accused—Verdict of guilty by the jury—Proper direction as to rule—Conviction
affirmed by appellate court—Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada—Whether this
Court should interfere with the verdict of the jury.

Where the evidence in a criminal case is
purely circumstantial and the jury has been properly instructed within the rule
as to the value of circumstantial evidence, the verdict of the jury finding the
accused

[Page 297]

guilty is equivalent to a finding that, in
the minds of the jury, the inferences to be drawn from the evidence were
consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with any other
reasonable conclusion, i.e., with the absence of guilt. Likewise, an appellate
court could also decide, on the evidence, whether the facts were such as to be
equally consistent with the innocence as with the guilt of the accused, and
accordingly quash the verdict. But, before this Court, when the accused does
not urge any ground of complaint against the direction of the trial judge and
the evidence is such that the jury might, and could, legally and properly draw
an inference of guilt, as held by the appellate court, it is not for the Court
to decide whether the jury ought or not to have inferred that the accused was
guilty.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King’s
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the conviction of the appellants
by a jury on charges of conspiracy and other offences under the Customs and
Excise Act.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are stated in the judgment now reported.

Lucien Gendron K.C. for the appellant.

J. Crankshaw for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Rinfret J.—The appellants were tried and convicted by a jury in the Court of
King’s Bench, district of Montreal.

The indictment laid against them contains some
nine counts, charging them with the offences of conspiracy and with different
offences under the Customs and Excise Act The appellant Fraser was found
guilty on all counts charged against him. The appellant Brabant was also found
guilty on all counts charged against him (eight in number). The appellant
Pharand was found guilty on four counts representing what may be called the
overt acts, but not guilty on the different counts charging conspiracy.

An appeal was lodged by each of them to the
Court of King’s Bench (appeal side) which confirmed the verdict and maintained
the sentences in each case. The judgment was unanimous; and the appellants are
now before this Court as a result of leave granted by a judge of the Court[1].

[Page 298]

Under the Criminal Code, no appeal lies to the
Supreme Court of Canada on behalf of any person convicted of an indictable
offence, whose conviction has been affirmed, except “on any question of law on
which there has been dissent in the court of appeal” (Cr. Code, sec. 1023), or “if
leave to appeal is granted by a judge” of the Court (Cr. Code, sec. 1025).

In the first case, the appeal is limited to the
question of law which has been the object of the dissent in the court of
appeal. In the second case, leave can be granted, and this Court holds
jurisdiction, only

if the judgment appealed from conflicts
with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case.

In the present case, it was common ground that
all the evidence upon which the appellants were found guilty was circumstantial
evidence. And the point of law on which the judgment appealed from allegedly
conflicted with judgments of other courts of appeal in Canada was that the well
known rule laid down by Baron Alderson, as far back as the Hodge case[2], and generally accepted and acted upon
throughout Canada, had been misinterpreted and misapplied by the Quebec court
of appeal in this instance.

At the conclusion of the argument and having had
the advantage of a complete perusal of the record, we had some doubt as to
whether the conflict which seemed to be apparent at first sight—and which alone
stands as the foundation of our jurisdiction—did not exist perhaps more in the
expression rather than in the real intention of the judgment a quo.

As was observed in McLean v. The King[3], “there is no single exclusive formula”
whereby the rule may be stated. It is, however, a rule of general application,
and some of the statements made by the learned judge who delivered the judgment
of the court were of a nature to convey the meaning that there were exceptions
to the rule. After having stated that one fact in the chain of circumstances
proven was conclusive of the appellants’ guilt, the learned judge added:

On conviendra, je
crois, qu’un tel fait, lorsqu’il se produit, doive mettre en échec la
règle de droit sus-mentionnée

[Page 299]

a statement apparently suggesting that the
present case was one where the rule should not apply. But, at the hearing
before the Court, counsel for the Crown was able to show that, taking the
judgment as a whole, the statement was susceptible of being understood as
indicating that, in view of the existence, in the chain of evidence, of this
outstanding fact found to be conclusive, no further doubt could subsist as to
the guilt of the accused. As a result of this interpretation of the learned
judge’s statement, instead of excepting this case from the application of the
rule, on the contrary, he would thus be applying the rule and declaring that,
as a consequence of that rule, the evidence surrounding the main pivoting fact
established in the case was conclusive of the appellants’ guilt and
incompatible with the theory of their innocence.

However, having now heard the appeal, and more
particularly in view of the result presently to be announced, there would not
be much object in entering upon a more complete discussion of the issue in
respect to the conflict, except in mentioning, as we have just done, the state
of mind in which the Court was left after a full consideration of the able
argument presented to us and a careful examination of the whole record.

We will, therefore, proceed to express our view
upon the merits of the point submitted by counsel for the appellants which is,
in effect, that there was no legal evidence upon which a jury might find a
verdict of guilty in the circumstances. The argument of the learned counsel was
that, in a case where all the evidence is circumstantial, should the court of
appeal not be satisfied, upon its own findings, that the circumstances proven
were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that
the prisoner was the guilty person, it ought to quash the verdict on the ground
that there was not sufficient legal evidence to support it.

Although, as a general rule, the question
whether the proper inference has been drawn by the jury from facts established
in evidence is really not a question of law, but purely a question of fact, for
their consideration (Gauthier

[Page 300]

v. The King)[4], there is authority for the view that the
rule with regard to circumstantial evidence is not exclusively a rule in
respect of the direction which it is the duty of the trial judge to give to the
jury or a rule solely for the guidance of a trial judge unassisted by a jury.

We were referred to, at least, two cases where
the Court of Criminal Appeal in England set aside verdicts and quashed
convictions when, after having considered the evidence as a whole, it seemed to
the Court to be clear that the evidence was as consistent with the innocence of
the accused as with his guilt.

In Rex. v. Bookbinder[5], the accused was convicted of larceny by a
jury at Derbyshire assizes upon wholly circumstantial evidence. The appeal was
heard by Heward L.C.J., Avory and Acton JJ. Counsel for the Crown argued that
the jury were entitled to convict as the case depended solely on the proper inference
to be drawn from the evidence. The Court came to the conclusion that there was
no evidence which was not as consistent with the innocence as with the guilt of
the appellant. Mr. Justice Avory, speaking for the Court, said:

We think that the verdict was
unsatisfactory and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. The
appeal will be allowed and the conviction quashed.

In Rex v. Carter[6], the accused appealed against his
conviction for indecent assault at Cheshire sessions. The ground for the appeal
was that there was not sufficient evidence for the jury in convicting the
appellant. The Court was composed of Mr. Justice Avory, Mr. Justice Hawks and
Mr. Justice Humphreys. The evidence was circumstantial only. Again Mr. Justice
Avory pronounced the judgment of the Court. Summing up the case, he said:

When we come to consider the evidence as a
whole, it seems to be clear that the evidence is as consistent with the
innocence of the appellant as with his guilt.

In all the circumstances, we have come to the
conclusion that this conviction was unsatisfactory and cannot be supported,
having regard to the evidence.

The appeal is allowed and the conviction
quashed.

It would appear, therefore, that, when the
evidence in a criminal case is purely circumstantial and at the same

[Page 301]

time equally consistent with the innocence as
with the guilt of the accused, the Court of Criminal Appeal in England regards
that evidence as insufficient to justify the jury in convicting, holds the
verdict unsatisfactory and quashes the conviction, on the ground that it cannot
be supported, having regard to the evidence.

To a certain extent, this would assimilate
verdicts based on circumstantial evidence “as consistent with the innocence as
with the guilt of the accused” to verdicts where it is claimed that there is no
evidence at all to support them, the view being that the court of appeal is
empowered to set aside those verdicts on the ground that they are
unsatisfactory, whether on account of a total lack of evidence or for want of
sufficient legal evidence to support them.

Let it be granted, however, that such a question
should be deemed a question of law, or of mixed law and fact, when once it is
established that the evidence is of such a character that the inference of
guilt of the accused might, and could, legally and properly be drawn therefrom,
the further question whether guilt ought to be inferred in the premises is one
of fact within the province of the jury (Reinblatt v. The King).[7]

The appellants do not complain of the judge’s
charge to the jury. No objection was entered by them at the trial; indeed,
counsel for the appellants freely admitted at bar that the charge was not open
to objection. The direction there given upon the particular point dealing with
the duty of the jury with regard to the value of circumstantial evidence and
the standard by which it should be measured in the premises appears to us to
have been as comprehensive as could be required. The jury was in substance told
that, in order to reach a verdict of guilty, it should be satisfied, not only
that the circumstances proven were consistent with the appellants having
committed the acts, but they should also be satisfied that the facts were such
as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the
appellants were guilty of the charges brought against them.

In the face of that direction, the jury found
the appellants guilty. The jury having been properly instructed,

[Page 302]

within the terms of the rule, their verdict is
equivalent to a finding that the inferences to be drawn from the evidence were
consistent with the guilt of the appellants, and inconsistent with any other
reasonable conclusion, and that is to say: with the absence of guilt. After the
direction they were given, the jury must be taken to have eliminated all
possibility of the innocence of the appellants as a rational inference from the
facts as they believed and understood them.

Likewise, the court of appeal, to which the case
was brought under sec 1013 of the Criminal Code, could decide, on the evidence
in this case, that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the appellants were guilty.

The appellants having no ground of complaint
against the direction of the trial judge and the evidence being such that the
jury might, and could, legally and properly draw the inference of guilt, as
held by the Court of King’s Bench (appeal side), it is not for this Court to
decide whether the jury ought or not to have inferred that the appellants were
guilty.

The appeal must be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA EN BANC

Criminal law—Theft—Shipping—Customs Act,
R.S.C. 1927, c. 42 (as amended), ss. 207, 151, 2 (o)—Vessel hovering within
territorial waters of Canada
with dutiable goods on board—Pursuit by police cruiser—Continuity of
pursuit—Seizure of vessel on high seas—Forcible escape of vessel—Forfeiture of
vessel—Time of forfeiture—Charge of theft against master—Form of charge.

The schooner K., of Canadian registry,
of which appellant was master, while “hovering within the territorial waters of
Canada” off the

[Page 514]

shores of Cape Breton with a cargo of liquor on board (dutiable in Canada), was approached by a Canadian
police cruiser, and proceeded towards the high seas. It was overhauled within
the territorial waters and summoned to “heave to in the King’s name,” but
before it could be boarded it resumed its course. The cruiser pursued for a
short distance, then turned, picked up its boat which had been lowered for
boarding, and hurried towards shore for about eight miles, then took bearings
and received instructions by radio, and returned to the pursuit and overhauled
and stopped the K. on the high seas about 35 miles from shore. Here its
officers boarded the K., asked appellant what cargo he had, were told in
answer “a bit of liquor,” asked to see and did see the manifest and shipping
papers, and without further examination took the K. in charge and towed
it back to a point within three miles of shore, where appellant, on some claim
of navigation dangers to his vessel, forcibly took charge of the K.’s helm,
turned it out of its course, thereby breaking the tow lines, and sailed away.
The cruiser did not pursue. At trial appellant was convicted of theft of the
schooner and theft of its cargo.

Held: The K.,
at the time when appellant took it away from the officers, was lawfully
under seizure and in control of the officers, and the convictions of theft must
stand (Judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, 9 M.P.R.
97, affirmed). The effect of ss. 207, 151 and 2 (o) of the Customs
Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 42, as amended), when applied to the facts of this
case, is that, by hovering in territorial waters of Canada with dutiable goods
on board, the K. thereby became forfeited by operation of law. When the
presence of liquor in its cargo was established as a fact, the forfeiture
related back to the time of the hovering. The forfeiture was the legal
unescapable consequence of the commission of the offence. The seizing on the
high seas was part of the prolonged or continued act, which, begun within the
territorial waters, and there temporarily frustrated by the K.’s flight,
was consummated on the high seas; and the temporary abandonment of the pursuit
was not such an abandonment as broke the continuity of the pursuit.

Objection on the ground that, according to
the charge, the vessel taken by appellant was one which had “been seized and
detained on suspicion by * * * as forfeited,” was rejected. The words,
“suspicion,” etc., were unnecessary, and when deleted left the allegation as
being “seized * * * as forfeited,” which phrase falls within the definition
“seized and forfeited” within s. 2 (o) of the Act.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1],
affirming (Mellish and Carroll JJ. dissenting) his conviction, on trial before
Doull J. with a jury, for theft of a schooner and theft of its cargo. (Accused
was also convicted of obstructing a public officer in the execution of his
duty, which conviction was affirmed by the said Court en banc. Accused
appealed thereon to this Court with regard to the sentence). The accused was
master of the vessel in question

[Page 515]

and the alleged theft was in taking it away
from the officers of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser when, it was
alleged, it was lawfully under seizure and in the control of those officers.
The questions in issue turned on the meaning and effect of certain provisions
of the Customs Act. The material facts of the case and questions in
issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was
dismissed.

W. P. Potter for
the appellant.

G. McL. Daley K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

Dysart J. (ad hoc)—This appeal from the Supreme Court of Nova
Scotia affirming the conviction of the appellant on three charges—(1) theft of
a schooner, (2) theft of the cargo of the vessel, and (3) obstructing a public
officer in the discharge of his duty—turns on the meaning and effect of certain
provisions of the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1927, ch. 42, and amendments. The dissent on which this appeal is based, opens
up the whole case on the charges of theft.

In the early morning of December 6, 1933, the
schooner Kromhout, of
Canadian registry, of which the appellant was master, was “hovering within the
territorial waters of Canada” off the shores of Cape Breton, with a cargo of
liquor on board. When the Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser, No. 4, which
had been lying in wait, approached her, the Kromhout started up her engines, and, with set sails, proceeded towards the
high seas, but was overhauled before she got beyond the territorial waters and
was summoned to “heave to in the King’s name”—a summons she obeyed only after a
few shots were fired across her bows. A boat was lowered from the cruiser, and officers
thereof set out to row to the schooner, but, before the boat got well away, the
Kromhout resumed her course
towards the high seas. The cruiser pursued for a short distance, and then,
turning about, picked up the boat and hurried towards shore for a distance of
about eight miles, where, after taking bearings and receiving radio
instructions, she returned to the pursuit, and about noon 

[Page 516]

hour overhauled the Kromhout
on the high seas, about thirty-five miles from
shore. Here the schooner was stopped, boarded, and, after some discussion, was
taken in charge by the cruiser’s men, and towed back to a point within three
miles of the shore. At this point the accused, on some pretence of navigation
dangers to his vessel, forcibly took charge of the helm of the Kromhout, turned her out of her course,
thereby breaking the tow lines, and sailed away. This time the cruiser did not
pursue. By arrangement, the
vessel and crew were later, near the French colony of St.
 Pierre, surrendered to Canadian officers without
prejudice to their rights.

When the cruiser’s officers boarded the schooner
on the high seas, they asked the accused what cargo he had and were told, “a
bit of liquor.” They asked to see the manifest and shipping papers, and did see
them, but these were in French and not fully understood. They made no further
examination of the vessel or of the cargo or of the accused. The vessel, as a
matter of fact, had on board seven hundred and fifty-one kegs of rum which were
dutiable in Canada.

Upon these facts the accused was tried at Halifax, N.S., before Doull J. with a jury, and convicted on the three counts
mentioned, and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment on each count, the
sentences to run concurrently. This conviction was upheld on appeal, Mellish
and Carroll JJ. dissenting. The jurisdiction of the trial court in cases such
as this to deal with offences committed on the high seas, is conferred by s.
656 of the Criminal Code.

On this appeal we have to determine whether or
not the Kromhout when the accused
took her away from the police officers, was lawfully under seizure and in the
control of those officers. The language of the charge is that the accused
committed the theft by unlawfully taking the Kromhout openly and with force

without the permission of * * * the person
who seized the same, or some competent authority and before the said vessel had
been declared by competent authority to have been seized without due cause, the
said vessel having been seized and detained on suspicion by the said Moyle A.
Hyson, a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as forfeited under
section 207 of the Customs Act.

The provisions of the Customs Act by
which this case is governed are not confined to s. 207—they include other

[Page 517]

provisions which may now be set out, so far as
necessary. By section 151,

If any vessel is hovering in territorial
waters of Canada, any officer
may go on board such vessel and examine her cargo and may also examine the
master or person in command upon oath touching the cargo and voyage and may
bring the vessel into port (Subs. 1).

Such vessel “shall proceed to come to a stop
when required so to do in the King’s name by any officer” (Subs. 2); and upon
such vessel’s “failing to proceed to come to a stop when required,” the captain
or master of the Government cruiser may, after first causing a gun to be fired
as a signal, fire at or into such vessel (Subs. 3). Further particulars of the
rights and powers of such revenue officers in dealing with such a vessel are
set out in subs. 8. Section 207 reads:—

If upon the examination by any officer of
the cargo of any vessel hovering in territorial waters of Canada, any dutiable
goods or any goods the importation of which into Canada is prohibited are found
on board, such vessel with her apparel, rigging, tackle, furniture, stores and
cargo shall be seized and forfeited * * *

The term “hovering” is not defined by the Act,
but is a term understood by mariners to mean something like fluttering about,
neither coming nor going, in an undecided manner. The term “territorial waters
of Canada,” so far as applicable to this case, means the waters “within twelve
marine miles” of the Dominion of Canada (s. 151 (7)). “Officer” means an
officer of customs (s. 2 (l)). By s. 2 (o)

“seized and forfeited,” “liable to
forfeiture” or “subject to forfeiture,” or any other expression which might of
itself imply that some act subsequent to the commission of the offence is
necessary to work the forfeiture, shall not be construed as rendering any such
subsequent act necessary, but the forfeiture shall accrue at the time and by
the commission of the offence, in respect of which the penalty or forfeiture is
imposed.

Section 143 was also referred to, but really
adds nothing to sections 151 and 207. It seems to have been assumed that a
cargo of rum was dutiable goods in Canada and that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser and men were
acting in discharge of public duty.

The effect of the foregoing provisions, when
applied to the facts of this case, is that by hovering in territorial waters of
Canada with dutiable goods on
board, the Kromhout thereby
became forfeited by operation of law. Proof of the forfeiture itself was
established after the offence had

[Page 518]

been committed, that is, when the officers
stopped and boarded the Kromhout and ascertained from the captain (the master) that dutiable goods
were on board. The fact of hovering was established beyond peradventure by the
general finding of the jury under quite proper directions. The seizing of the Kromhout on the high seas was part of the
prolonged or continued act, which, begun within the territorial waters, and
there temporarily frustrated by the flight of the schooner, was consummated on
the high seas; and the temporary abandonment of the pursuit of the schooner by
the cruiser was not such an abandonment as broke the continuity of the pursuit.
When the presence of liquor in the schooner’s cargo was established as a fact,
the forfeiture which followed as a matter of law related back to the time of
the hovering in territorial waters. The authority given to officers to stop and
board vessels and examine them and their cargoes is intended for no other
purpose than to establish whether or not an offence has in fact been committed.
The forfeiture itself is not brought about by any act of officers, but is the
legal unescapable consequence of the commission of the offence. A failure to
establish that liquor was on board a vessel so hovering, would not mean that
the offence had not been committed, but that the commission had not been
proved.

It is objected that the charge is defective in
that it alleges that the accused took a vessel that had “been seized and
detained on suspicion * * * as forfeited.” This objection, however,
seems to be rather technical, and not of the substance of the matter. The words
“suspicion,” etc., were really quite unnecessary and when deleted leave the
allegation as being “seized * * * as forfeited,” and this phrase, I think,
falls within the definition “seized and forfeited” within s. 2 (o).

Some complaint has also been made that the
charge of the trial judge was not correct, but I find nothing in it that can
properly be objected to in substance.

On the charges of theft, therefore, conviction
must stand.

On the remaining charge—obstructing officers—the
conviction itself is not in dispute. As to the sentence, it is not perfectly
clear that the dissenting judges held it to be illegal. Mr. Justice Mellish
says, “I think it is excessive”.

[Page 519]

Unless they dissented on the ground that it was
illegal, this court has no jurisdiction to deal with the matter. Our
jurisdiction is strictly limited to controversies in relation to some question
of law on which there has been dissent. Whatever may be the proper construction
of the judgments of Mr. Justice Mellish and Mr. Justice Carroll on this point,
we think, since the sentence under the conviction upon the charge of
obstruction runs concurrently with that under the conviction on the charges of
theft, no useful purpose could be served by modifying it, although we are
disposed to agree that, even if not illegal, it is excessive.

The appeal should be dismissed and the
conviction affirmed.

Appeal

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Appeal—Leave to appeal to Supreme Court of
Canada—Court of appeal judgment conflicting with judgment of another court of
appeal “in a like case”—Judgments must be in criminal matters—The Supreme Court
of Canada is a “court of appeal” within section 1025 Cr. C.

Under the provisions of section 1025 of the Criminal Code, a
party applying for leave to appeal must show that “the judgment appealed from
conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case.”

Held that a judgment of a court of appeal “in a like
case” must be a judgment rendered in criminal proceedings or upon criminal
matters.

Held, also, that the Supreme Court of Canada is
comprised among the courts of appeal contemplated in that section.

MOTION under section 1025 of the Criminal Code for leave to
appeal to this court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
upholding the conviction of the appellants. Leave to appeal was refused by the
judgment now reported.

A.N. Lewis K.C. for the motion.

J. Sedgewick K.C. contra.

RINFRET J.—Upon their trial before His Honour Judge Boles,
sitting in the County Court Judge’s Criminal Court of the county of Wentworth,
the appellants were found guilty of having unlawfully, after the presentation
of a

[Page 610]

bankruptcy petition against them, condoned and participated in
the making and presenting of a false statement to the creditors of Minden’s
Ltd. for the purpose of obtaining the consent of the creditors or any of them
to an agreement accepting fifteen cents on the dollar in full of the debt of
Minden’s Limited, and of having thereby committed an offence contrary to ss.
191 (p) and 201 of the Bankruptcy Act.

The Court of Appeal of Ontario confirmed the conviction.

The appellants now apply for leave to appeal from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal on the ground that the judgment conflicts with that of the
Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Electric Motor and Machinery Company,
Limited v. The Bank of Montreal[1].

To understand the situation, it is necessary to state only a few
facts.

Minden, after the presentation of the bankruptcy petition, on the
16th December, 1932, attempted to make an arrangement with the creditors and to
obtain a composition from them. To persuade them to accept his offer, he caused
to be prepared a statement of assets and liabilities. Both courts found that
the statement so prepared to form the basis of the negotiations was fraudulent
and falsely represented the true assets, altogether omitting, as it did, a
large block of goods which he pretended not to regard as seasonable stock.

The statement was made on the 20th December, 1932. The actual
adjudication in bankruptcy did not take place until the 27th December.

One of the questions which the Court of Appeal had to decide was whether
a false and fraudulent statement made between the date of presentation of the
petition in bankruptcy and the date of the adjudication in bankruptcy may be
held an offence under subsection (p) of section 191 of the Bankruptcy
Act.

The Court of Appeal referred to subsection 11 of section 4 of the
Act, which reads as follows:—

11. The bankruptcy of a debtor shall be deemed to have
relation back to and to commence at the time of the presentation of the
petition on which a receiving order is made against him.

[Page 611]

And the Court ruled that the effect of that statutory provision
was to make the bankruptcy begin at the time of the presentation of the
petition for all purposes.

Accordingly the decision was that the accused must be found to
have made the false and fraudulent statement after having been adjudged
bankrupt, and contrary to subsection (p) of section 191. And the appeal
was dismissed.

In the case of Electric Motor & Machinery Company, Limited
v. The Bank of Montreal[2], the
Court had to construe subsections (q) and (r) of section 191 of
the Bankruptcy Act. The debtor had made an authorized assignment on the
3rd November, 1930. Subsequently, through its trustee, it submitted for
approval to the bankruptcy court a proposal for a compromise. The demand of
approval was contested by the Bank of Montreal. The bankruptcy court found as a
fact that in and during the years 1927, 1928 and 1929, the authorized assignor
had knowingly made to the bank three false statements of the character
described in subsections (q) and (r); that these were offences
under the subsections mentioned, and that

this being established, the court, under art. 16, parag. 2,
of the Bankruptcy Act, was bound to refuse the approval of the proposal
of compromise.

In the Court of King’s Bench (Quebec), that judgment was upheld
by the majority of the court (Létourneau and Saint-Germain JJ. dissenting).

Upon appeal to this Court, it was held that the acts dealt with
in subsections (q) and (r) of section 191 are in terms the acts
of a person

who has been adjudged bankrupt, or in respect of whose
estate a receiving order has been made, or who has made an authorized
assignment,

and that, upon the plain meaning of the words, the offences
described in the subsections in question had reference to the acts of a person
who had already been adjudged bankrupt, etc. Therefore, the acts complained of,
committed prior to the bankruptcy, were not criminal acts within the
contemplation of subsections (q) and (r) of section 191.

On the present application it was urged on behalf of the
appellants that subsection (p) is couched in language similar to that of
subsections (q) and (r), and that, therefore, the judgment sought
to be appealed from is in conflict with the judgment of this Court in the Electric
Motor case2.

[Page 612]

The application is made under section 1025 of the Criminal Code.
The appellants must show that

the judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of
any other court of appeal in a like case.

Section 1012 of the Criminal Code defines the interpretation to
be given to the words “court of appeal” in part 19 dealing with Procedure by
Indictment. Those words mean

the court designated by paragraph (7) of section two of this
Act as the court of appeal for the province in which the conviction was had.

If we refer to paragraph (7) of section two, we find that it
enumerates the courts of appeal of final resort in each of the nine provinces
of Canada and in the Yukon Territory. The Supreme Court of Canada is not
mentioned in the enumeration.

Notwithstanding this, I think the Supreme Court of Canada is
among the courts contemplated in section 1025 of the Act under the words: “any
other court of appeal”; and I think it has always been so regarded, both in the
discussion and in the judgments upon applications for leave similar to the
present one (See: Hill v. The King)[3],
although perhaps the point was not expressly decided.

The object of the section being to insure uniformity of
interpretation and of application of the criminal law throughout the Dominion,
it stands to reason that a conflict between the judgment of a provincial court
of appeal and that of the Supreme Court of Canada must necessarily have been
one which Parliament had in view when it enacted the section. The Supreme Court
of Canada is a court to which, by force of the Criminal Code, an appeal may be
brought in certain cases involving criminal matters; and, in that respect, it
satisfies the language of section 1025: “any other court of appeal.”

Therefore, I consider that it was open to the appellants to base
their application upon an alleged conflict between the judgment of the Court of
Appeal of Ontario in the present case and the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Canada in the Electric Motor case[4].

But when it comes to the next point raised by counsel
representing the Attorney-General of Ontario, the appellants do not fare so
well. In Electric Motor & Machinery Company Limited v. The Bank of
Montreal4, the sub-

[Page 613]

ject-matter of the case was not criminal law. As appears by the
short statement of the facts made at the beginning of this judgment, the Electric
Motor case4 was about the approval of a proposal for a
compromise. It was only indirectly and as an incident to the main question that
the court was called upon to construe subsections (q) and (r) of
section 191 of the Bankruptcy Act. It was not done for the purpose of
deciding whether the debtor had to be convicted of the criminal offence covered
by the section, but only with the view of adjudicating upon the application for
approval of the compromise. Obviously this was not a criminal proceeding.

Under these circumstances, I am of opinion that the judgment in
the Electric Motor case[5] does
not meet the condition required in section 1025 that it should be “the judgment
of any other court of appeal in a like case.”

Repeating again that the purpose of the section is to render as
uniform as possible the administration of the law in criminal matters, The
King v. Janousky[6]; Arcadi
v. The King[7], my
view is that, when Parliament used the expression “any other court of appeal in
a like case,” it must be taken to have referred to a court of appeal
adjudicating in criminal proceedings or upon criminal matters. Section 1025 is
in the Criminal Code; and general language of that kind must be presumed to
refer to the subject-matter of the statute where the section is to be found.

For those reasons, I hold that the judgment of this court in Electric
Motor & Machinery Co. v. The Bank of Montreal5 is not a
judgment of another court of appeal in a like case with that of the judgment
sought to be appealed from.

I may say further that, even assuming the other points in favour
of the appellants, I do not understand the judgment of the Court of Appeal to
be in conflict with the judgment of this Court in the Electric Motor case5.
The latter judgment, as already stated, decided that, in order to be offences
under subss. (q) and (r) of s. 191, the acts must have been
committed by the debtor after he has been adjudged bankrupt. In the present
case, the Court of Appeal also expresses the same view in respect to another
subsec-

[Page 614]

tion of section 191, to wit: subsection (p). Then,
however, Middleton, J.A., delivering the written judgment of the Court of
Appeal, points out:

The Supreme Court of Canada, in its judgment, did not
attempt to discriminate between the date of the presentation of the bankruptcy
petition and the date when the person was adjudicated bankrupt, nor was the
effect of section 4 (11) considered and that decision cannot be regarded as
having any direct bearing upon the present case.

In the Electric Motor case[8], that
point did not come up, for the false statements complained of had been made and
submitted to the creditors long before the date of the presentation of the
petition, in fact, several months before and at a time when it might even have
been a question whether the debtor was then insolvent. The neat point which the
Court of Appeal had to decide in the present case was not present in the other
case. So that the two judgments did not turn on the same question.

The application for leave to appeal will, therefore, be
dismissed.

Motion dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Bankruptcy—Concealing or
removing property of bankrupt—Offences enacted by section 191 of the Bankruptcy
Act, R.S.C. [1927] c. 11—Persons other than bankrupt convicted—Conviction
valid—Criminal Code R.S.C. [1927], c. 36, s. 69—Interpretation Act, R.S.C.
[1927], c. 1, s. 28.

The appellants, one being the manager and the
other an employee of a bankrupt company, were convicted for having concealed and
fraudulently removed goods belonging to the bankrupt, contrary to section 191
(d and e) of the Bankruptcy Act. The ground of appeal was that no other
person than the bankrupt could be indicted for any offence under that section.

Held, affirming
that conviction, that the offences created by section 191 of the Bankruptcy
Act were offences within section 69 of the Criminal Code; or, to put
it alternatively, by force of section 69, or, by force of the enactments of
section 28 of the Interpretation Act, section

[Page 27]

69 is to be read as if the offences created
by section 191 were specifically named therein.—In other words, section 191
must be read and construed on the footing that the provisions of the Criminal
Code should apply to offences created by that section, as there is nothing
in the provisions of that section necessarily or reasonably implying the
exclusion of section 69 of the Criminal Code. Crocket J. dissenting.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, sustaining the conviction of the
appellants, on their trial before Cusson J., president of the Court of Sessions
of the Peace, on charges of having concealed and removed property of a
bankrupt, under s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act. The ground of appeal, and
the material facts of the case bearing on the point dealt with by the Court are
stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal was dismissed; and the
conviction was affirmed.

Phillippe Mouette K.C. for the appellant.

Ernest Bertrand K.C. for the respondent.

Duff C.J.—This appeal raises a question as to the sufficiency of an
indictment in these terms:

Irving Simcovitch et Harry Simcovitch, en la cité de Montréal, en
rapport avec la compagnie “Paris Shoe Shoppe”, magasin de chaussures dont Cecilia Simcovitch était propriétaire, et dont le dit Irving
Simcovitch était le gérant et l’autre dit accusé était
l’employé et complice avant le fait, la dite compagnie ayant été déclarée en
faillite, le ou vers le 7 décembre,
mil-neuf-cent-trente-deux, ont commis les actes criminels de faillite suivants:

(d) Dans les six mois qui ont précédé
la dite faillite ou après ils ont caché une partie des biens de la dite
faillite pour une valeur au delà $50 et ils ont caché des comptés recevables de la dite faillite;

(e) Durant la même période de temps,
ils ont frauduleusement enlevé une partie des biens de la dite faillite pour
une valeur d’au delà $50, à savoir; pour une valeur de $5,000.

S.R.C. Loi des faillites, c. 11, art. 191, d et e.

The sole point in controversy before this court is
a point raised by the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice St. Jacques, which is
stated in the formal judgment of the Court of King’s Bench in these words,

* * * because, according to section 191 of
the Bankruptcy Act, no other than the bankrupt can be indicted for an
offence under that article.

The argument presented is substantially as
follows: Section 191 declares that any person who has been adjudged a bankrupt,
or in respect of whose estate a receiving order has been made, or who has made
an authorized assignment

[Page 28]

under this Act, shall in each of the cases
following be guilty of an indictable offence.

Neither of the appellants falls within the
description of the classes of persons to whom, in the circumstances mentioned
in the subsections, the indictable offences created by the section are imputed
by the statute. It follows, it is said, that the appellants cannot be convicted
of such an offence.

The validity of this contention turns upon the
proper answer to the question whether the offences created by section 191 are
offences within section 69 of the Criminal Code; or, to put it
alternatively, whether, by force of section 69, or, by force of the enactments
of the Interpretation Act, section 69 is to be read as if the offences
created by section 191 were specifically named therein.

The Interpretation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c.
1, s. 28) enacts that,

Every Act shall be read and construed as if
any offence for which the offender may be

(a) prosecuted by indictment,
howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred to, were described
or referred to as an indictable offence

* *
*

and all provisions of the Criminal Code relating
to indictable offences, or offences as the case may be, shall apply to every
such offence.

The language of this enactment is quite plain
and unqualified.

I have no doubt that it applies to offences
created by section 191. First of all, there is nothing in section 28 which is
(in the words of section 2) “inconsistent with the object or scope of” the Bankruptcy
Act; or, which (in the words of that section) “could give any word,
expression or clause,” in section 191, “an interpretation inconsistent with its
context.” The circumstance that the acts enumerated in section 191 are limited
to acts committed by the classes of persons described in that section is in no
way inconsistent with the proposition that the offences defined by the section
are indictable offences, as section 28 declares, or that to them, as indictable
offences, the provisions of the Criminal Code apply. With great respect,
I cannot give my adherence to the view that in sections 191 to 201 of the Bankruptcy
Act there is sufficient evidence that these sections were intended to
constitute a code, having an operation which excludes the Criminal Code. True
it is, section 28 lays down a rule of interpretation, and necessarily,

[Page 29]

therefore, the provisions of the Criminal
Code must give way to the enactments of the statute to be interpreted, to
the extent to which, by express words, or by necessary or reasonable
implication, such statute evinces an intention to exclude those provisions.
But, subject to this qualification, section 191 must be read and construed on
the footing that the provisions of the Criminal Code apply to the
offences created by it, and, in particular, that the provisions of section 69
are to be construed as if such offences were specifically nominated in that
section.

Now, the effect of section 69 in this view, is
simply this: persons aiding or abetting the bankrupt or other person, whose
acts are embraced within the enactment, are guilty of the offences created by
the enactment. I see nothing here inconsistent with section 191 read by itself
alone. The bankrupt himself is not affected by this reading of the provisions
of section 69; as regards him, section 191 takes full and complete effect
according to its terms. On this construction of section 69, we have a
substantive enactment, co-ordinate with section 191, by which, persons aiding,
abetting, counselling or procuring, are put upon the same plane as the
bankrupt, and become indictable and punishable for the offence in relation to
which they have so acted.

There is, therefore, nothing in the provisions
of section 191 necessarily or reasonably implying the exclusion of section 69.

Section 201 cannot, I think, be properly read as
evidencing an intention on the part of the legislature to exclude the operation
of section 69. It is limited to the case of offences committed by incorporated
companies, and it may well be that the framers of the Act desired to provide
against difficulties that might conceivably arise where the bankrupt is a
corporation. See King v. Daily Mirror[1].

On the other hand, I am unable to agree with the
argument advanced on behalf of the Crown, that section 198 affords an answer to
the contention of the appellants. Section 198 assumes that persons other than
the bankrupt may be guilty of an offence under the Act (for example, a creditor
or person claiming to be a creditor who has committed an offence under section
194). Section 198 does

[Page 30]

not indicate that any person other than the
classes of persons enumerated in section 191 can be guilty of an offence
created by that section.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Cannon J.—The appellants were convicted under the following indictment:

Irving Simcovitch et Harry Simcovitch, en la cité de Montréal, en rapport avec la compagnie “Paris Shoe Shoppe”, magasin de chaussures dont
Cecilia Simcovitch était
propriétaire, et dont le dit Irving Simcovitch était le gérant et l’autre dit accusé était l’employé et
complice avant le fait, la dite compagnie ayant été déclarée en faillite, le ou
vers le 7 faillite suivants:

(d) Dans les six mois qui ont précédé
la dite faillite ou après ils ont caché une partie des biens de la dite
faillite pour une valeur au delà $50 et ils ont caché des comptes recevables de la dite faillite;

(e) Durant la même période de temps,
ils ont frauduleusement enlevé une partie des biens de la dite faillite pour
une valeur d’au delà $50, à
savoir: pour une valeur de $5,000.

S.R.C. Loi des faillites, c. 11, art. 191, d et e.

The appeal to the Court of King’s Bench on the
facts and on points of law was dismissed, Mr. Justice St-Jacques dissenting on
a point of law which is now submitted to our consideration.

According to the formal judgment of the Court of
King’s Bench, the learned justice would have quashed the conviction

because, according to 191 of Bankruptcy
Act, no other than the bankrupt can be indicted for an offence under that
article; and because the trustee, by himself or by a representative, cannot
lodge a complaint against another than the bankrupt, for a bankruptcy offence,
unless he follows the enactment of 195 and 198 of the Act; and this procedure
was not followed.

As the second reason of the dissenting judge was
not mentioned amongst the grounds of appeal, the appellants very properly state
in their factum that they cannot now support it before this court. We,
therefore, have to decide only whether or not none but the bankrupt can be
indicted for an offence under 191 of the Bankruptcy Act.

The learned dissenting judge says in his reasons
for judgment:

La question se pose
comme suit:

Les offenses, ou les séries d’offenses, que l’article 191 de la Loi de faillite édicte, peuvent-elles être mises à la
charge d’autres personnes que du failli lui-même? Et subsidiairement, peut-on
recourir à l’article 69 de la Loi
criminelle pour compléter l’article 191 de la Loi de faillite, et par application de cet article 69 du Code criminel, mettre en
accusation d’autres personnes que le failli lui-même pour la commission de
quel-

[Page 31]

qu’une ou de quelques-unes des offenses
édictées par l’article 191 de la Loi de faillite?

Il me paraît certain que le parlement fédéral
dans l’exercice des pouvoirs que lui donne la constitution de notre pays, a
voulu, en légiférant au sujet des faillites, créer un mécanisme complet, tant
au point de vue de la procédure civile que de la procédure criminelle.

Il a défini, entre autres, dans les articles
191, 195, 198 et 201, quels sont les actes qui, sans être criminels en
eux-mêmes, le deviennent eu égard à la faillite et s’ils sont commis dans les
délais et les conditions posés par la Loi de faillite. Par exemple, si
un commerçant enlève de son établissement de commerce une certaine quantité de
marchandises pour la porter ailleurs, cet acte n’est pas en soi un crime; mais
cet enlèvement devient une offense criminelle punissable, si l’enlèvement est
fait dans les six mois qui précèdent la faillite ou après la présentation d’une
requête de faillite avec l’intention de causer du préjudice aux créanciers,
c’est-à-dire avec une intention frauduleuse.

Cette offense créée par le statut des
faillites est punissable par une amende n’excédant pas $1,000, ou un terme
d’emprisonnement n’excédant pas deux années, ou, en même temps, l’amende et
l’emprisonnement.

(L’article dit que “toute personne (any
person) qui a été déclarée en faillite” etc, sera, dans chacun des cas énumérés
à l’article, coupable d’une offense “indictable” etc.

On sait que l’expression “personne” employée
dans cette loi de faillite s’applique aussi bien aux corporations qu’aux
individus.

Et pourtant, afin de donner une sanction
efficace à la loi de faillite, le législateur a disposé dans l’article 201 que
lorsqu’une offense, prévue par la loi de faillite, a été commise par une
compagnie incorporée, chaque officier, directeur ou agent de la compagnie qui a
participé dans la commission de l’offense, sera passible de la même pénalité
que la compagnie elle-même et tout comme s’il avait commis cette offense
personnellement.

A première vue, il semblerait étrange que les
termes généraux employés dans l’article 191 eussent été trouvés insuffisants
par le législateur pour permettre d’atteindre toute personne, autre que le
failli, qui aurait commis une offense de faillite.

Je crois que l’article 191 vise le failli
lui-même et nul autre.

Si le failli a commis l’une queconque des
offenses édictées par cet article, il peut être recherché en justice criminelle
et condamné à la punition prévue par la loi.

Dans le cas actuel, Cécilia Simcovitch
déclarée en faillite et ayant refusé de signer le bilan préparé par les
syndics, il y a contre elle de fortes présomptions qu’elle n’ignorait pas les
actes frauduleux commis par son gérant, à la veille même de la faillite. Elle
aurait pu, je crois, être atteinte par les dispositions de l’article 191.

Le législateur n’a pas voulu, toutefois, que
les personnes qui ont pu participer, soit directement, soit indirectement, à la
fraude ou aux actes frauduleux que la loi de faillite punit, échappent à la
justice.

En vertu de l’article 195, la cour des
faillites peut ordonner la poursuite de telle personne pour de telles offenses.

The Crown contends that section 191 of the Bankruptcy
Act created an indictable offence for any person who has been adjudged
bankrupt, or in respect of whom a receiving order has been made, in each of the
cases therein enumerated.

[Page 32]

Once this offence has been committed, the Interpretation
Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 1, s. 28) applies. It reads as follows:

Every Act (of the Parliament of Canada) shall
be read and construed as if any offence for which the offender may be:—

(a) prosecuted by indictment,
howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred were described or
referred to as an indictable offence; and

(b) punishable
on summary conviction, were described or referred to as an offence; and,

all
provisions of the Criminal Code relating to indictable offences, or
offences, as the case may be, shall apply to every such offence.

Therefore, says the Crown, the Bankurptcy Act
not excluding this rule of interpretation, the provisions of the Criminal
Code, including section 69, apply to this particular offence.

The Crown further contends that the appellants,
having aided and abetted the bankrupt Cecilia Simcovitch in the commission of
this indictable offence, were liable to arrest and conviction, as they have
been in this case. Cecilia Simcovitch, the bankrupt, could have have been
prosecuted together with her brothers and could even to-day be prosecuted for
the said offence.

First of all, it must be noticed that, as
pointed out by Mr. Justice Walsh in the majority judgment of the Court of
King’s Bench, the legislators provided in section 198 of the Bankruptcy Act that

where there is ground to believe that the
bankrupt or any other person has been guilty of any offence under this
Act, the Court may commit the bankrupt or such other person for trial.

This section is designed to enable the court to
commit the bankrupt or any other person for trial without the necessity of a
preliminary inquiry before a magistrate; but it does not exclude the ordinary
procedure which has been adopted in the present case. The facts show clearly
that the offence was committed with the aid of the appellants. Can they escape
punishment on the technical ground that the goods that were concealed and
carried away were not their goods, but those of their bankrupt sister?

A somewhat similar question was raised in the
case of The King v. Kehr (No. 3)[2], in
which

it was urged on behalf of defendant that
the facts did not disclose an offence by the defendant, nor a lending by the
company, of whose branch office he was in charge as manager; that the offence
declared by the Money Lenders Act being purely statutory and its
prohibition not being

[Page 33]

general as to all persons, but limited to
the class specially named therein, i.e. “money lenders,” there could be no
conviction for aiding and abetting, (with the possible exception of another
money lender); that the class limitation of the statute excluded the operation
of sec. 69 of the Criminal Code (1906), under ss. 2 and 28 of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. (1906), c. 1.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario
was delivered by Meredith J., who said in part:

I am also unable to see why one who is not
a money lender, within the meaning of the Act, may not be an aider and abettor
of one who is, in an infraction of its provisions.

It does not follow, from the fact that the
person who aids in the commission of a crime is, by the Criminal Code, declared
to be a party to and guilty of the offence, that one who could not alone have
committed it, cannot be convicted. One may be physically incapable of
committing a crime and yet guilty of it, through the act of another who is
capable and whose act is the act of both; and why not equally so where there is
legal incapacity?

That which the accused did would have been
none the more harmful, none the more against the object of the enactment, if
the accused, as well as his employer, had been a money lender.

Under section 69 of the Criminal Code,

Every one is a party to and guilty
of an offence who

(a) actually commits it;

(b) does or omits an act for the
purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence;

(c) abets any person in commission
of the offence; or

(d) counsels or procures any person
to commit the offence.

This has always been given this meaning: If a
person assists another in the commission of an offence, he is responsible as
though he had committed it himself. By aiding or abetting in the commission of
an offence, he becomes a party to and guilty of an offence. He does become a
party principal and there appears to be no reason why he should not be indicted
or charged as principal under the Code.

See: Rémillard v. The King[3] and Rex v. Daily Mirror[4].

I, therefore, reach the conclusion that the
rather technical point raised before us cannot prevail in face of the
provisions which are intimately connected of the Bankruptcy Act, the Interpretation
Act and the Criminal Code. The evident intention of Parliament was
that these three statutes should complete and aid one another in order to bring
to justice those who aided or abetted a bankrupt to commit offences to defraud
his creditors.

I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.

[Page 34]

Crocket J. (dissenting): There is no doubt that the acts, with which the
appellants were charged as offences against clauses (d) and (e)
of s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act, are declared to be offences by that
section only when committed by a person, who has been adjudged bankrupt or in
respect of whose estate a receiving order has been made or who has made an
authorized assignment under that Act. The learned counsel for the Crown
conceded that the conviction could not be maintained against either appellant
under that section alone, inasmuch as neither was a person answering the
specific description stated in its opening words. Seeking for other provisions
with which s. 191 might be read to extend its application to any person,
whether the bankrupt or not, he argued in the first place that s. 198 of the Bankruptcy
Act itself had this effect. This argument, however, is not admissible for
the reason pointed out in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice, viz: that
the language relied upon in the latter section comprehends not only the
offences described in s. 191 but other offences described in other sections of
the Act as well, which might be committed by other persons than the bankrupt
himself.

The real, substantial contention which has been
advanced in support of the conviction is that s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act must
be read together with s. 69 of the Criminal Code in virtue of the
provisions of s. 28 of the general Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1927, c.
1, and that s. 69 of the Criminal Code makes any one, who abets the bankrupt
in the commission of the offence, or who does or omits an act for the purpose
of aiding the bankrupt to commit the offence, liable to prosecution for
committing the offence described in s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act as well as the
bankrupt himself.

Singularly enough, therefore, there is no
difficulty in the interpretation of s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act itself—the
enactment which creates and defines the alleged offence of which the appellants
have been convicted. Its language is as unequivocal as any language could well
be. The difficulty is encountered in the interpretation of s. 28 of the Interpretation
Act, through which it is sought to read s. 69 of the Criminal Code into
the Bankruptcy Act for the purpose of reaching the appellants, not as
offenders who could themselves have committed the described offence, but as

[Page 35]

offenders, who might nevertheless be convicted
of that offence as accessories.

I regret that after much anxious reflection I
find myself quite unable to adopt the view of the majority of the judges of the
Court of King’s Bench of the province of Quebec and of my brethren in this
Court, that s. 28 of the Interpretation Act brings into operation, as
regards the particular offences created by s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act, the
provisions of s. 69 of the Criminal Code, so as to render a person liable to
prosecution and punishment therefor, who could not himself be guilty of the
offence as created and defined in the particular Act.

As I read s. 28 of the Interpretation Act, it
does not purport to do any more than to enact that whenever any statute of the
Parliament of Canada creates an offence, for which any person may be prosecuted
by indictment or liable to punishment on summary conviction, all the provisions
of the Criminal Code relating to indictable offences, or offences, as
the case may be, shall apply to such offence. This section itself
prescribes a limitation to the words “any offence” in the same way as s. 191 of
the Bankruptcy Act prescribes a limitation to the words “any person.” It
qualifies the words “any offence” by the immediate addition of the words “for
which the offender may be prosecuted by indictment” or is “punishable on
summary conviction,” as s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act qualifies the words
“any person” by the words “who has been adjudged bankrupt,” etc.

It is in my judgment only to an offence, which
has been created or defined by the particular statute, to which the designated
provisions of the Criminal Code are intended to be applied, not to an
act, which itself has not been declared by the statute to be an offence at all,
and that offence must be one, for which the offender within the
contemplation of the particular statute may be prosecuted by indictment or is
liable to punishment on summary conviction.

Once you have an offence created by the Bankruptcy
Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, of which any person,
whether adjudged a bankrupt or not, can be guilty and for which any
person can be prosecuted by indictment or is liable to punishment on
summary conviction, then I have no doubt that s. 28 of the Interpretation
Act

[Page 36]

would operate to apply all the provisions of the
Criminal Code relating to indictable offences, or offences, to such an
offence in the same manner and with the same effect as they would apply to all
offences defined by the Criminal Code itself. These provisions of the Criminal
Code would then apply to such an offence without in any manner altering the
effect of the special enactment by which the offence is created.

If, however, s. 28 of the Interpretation Act is
construed in the sense contended for by the Crown we are at once confronted by
two contradictory enactments: one—the special enactment, providing that only a
person who answers a specific description, can commit the offence, which it has
created; and the other, s. 69 of the Criminal Code, providing that
anybody, whether he answers the specific description or not, can commit it. If
no one but the bankrupt is indictable for any of the offences described in the
special enactment, when that enactment is read by itself, as the Crown
concedes, and anybody is indictable for any of them, whether he be the bankrupt
or not, if the provisions of s. 28 of the Interpretation Act and s. 69
of the Criminal Code are read together with it, as the Crown contends
they ought to be, it necessarily follows, not only that the intendment of the
one enactment is radically different from that of the other, but that s. 69 of
the Criminal Code is the governing enactment. Yet s. 2 of the Interpretation
Act itself, the controlling section of that statute, clearly recognizes
that it is the intention of the particular enactment which must always prevail
in the event of there being any inconsistency or repugnance between the
particular enactment and any provision of the Interpretation Act. S. 2
reads as follows:

Every provision of this Act shall extend
and apply to every Act of the Parliament of Canada, now or hereafter passed,
except in so far as any such provision,—

(a) is inconsistent with the intent
or object of such Act; or

(b) would give to any word,
expression or clause of any such Act an interpretation inconsistent with the
context; or

(c) is in any such Act declared not
applicable thereto.

In my opinion s. 28 of the Interpretation Act
and s. 69 of the Criminal
Code can be read into s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act only in so far as
their provisions can consistently be read with those of s. 191. If its language
is clear and free from all ambiguity in constituting any of the acts

[Page 37]

described in its various clauses as indictable
offences only when they are committed by a person who answers the specific
description stated in its opening and governing words, and there is no other
provision in the Bankruptcy Act to the contrary, it seems to me that it must
be taken that it was not intended to incorporate in the Act any provision of
the Interpretation Act, or of the Criminal Code, which would give
to that enactment any other effect than that which its own language so clearly
connotes.

With all deference to those who have reached an
opposite conclusion, I think the ground of Mr. Justice St. Jacques’ dissent in
the Court of King’s Bench was well taken. I would adopt his judgment, allow the
appeal to this Court and quash the conviction as one which discloses no offence
against s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act.

Hughes J.—The appellants were tried and convicted in the Sessions of the
Peace at Montreal on an indictment the material parts of which are as follows:

Irving Simcovitch et Barry Simcovitch, en la cité de Montréal, en
rapport avec la compagnie “Paris Shoe Shoppe"", magasin de chaussures dont Cecilia Simcovitch était propriétaire, et dont
le dit Irving Simcovitch était le
gérant et l’autre dit accusé était l’employé et complice avant le fait, la dite
compagnie ayant été déclarée en faillite, le ou vers le sept décembre,
mil-neuf-cent-trente-deux, ont commis les actes criminels de faillite suivants:

(d) Dans les six mois qui ont précédé
la dite faillite ou après ils ont caché une partie des biens de la dite faillite
pour une valeur au delà $50 et ils
ont caché des comptes rerevables de la dite faillite;

(e) Durant le même période de temps,
ils ont frauduleusement enlevé une partie des biens de la dite faillite pour
une valeur d’au delà $50, à
savoir: pour une valeur de $5,000.

S.R.C. Loi des faillites, c. 11, art. 191, d et e.

The accused appealed to the Court of King’s
Bench, appeal side, and the appeal was dismissed with costs, Mr. Justice St.
Jacques dissenting. The grounds of dissent of the learned judge are set forth
in the formal judgment of the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, as follows:

The Honourable Mr. Justice St. Jacques
dissenting, because, according to 191 of Bankruptcy Act, no other than
the bankrupt can be indicted for an offence under that article; and because the
trustee, by himself or by a representative, cannot lodge a complaint against
another than the bankrupt, for a bankruptcy offence, unless he follows the
enactments of 195 and 198 of the Act; and this procedure was not followed.

The appellants concede that the second reason
for dissent of Mr. Justice St. Jacques was not mentioned in the notice of
appeal as a ground of appeal and that it cannot now be urged before this Court.

[Page 38]

In his notes Mr. Justice St. Jacques said:—

Je crois que l’article 191 vise le
failli lui-même et nul autre.

The Crown, however, submits that section 69 of
the Criminal Code is made applicable by the Interpretation Act, R.S.C.
1927, c. 1, s. 28, which reads as follows:

28. Every Act shall be read and construed
as if any offence for which the offender may be

(a) prosecuted by indictment,
howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred to, were described
or referred to as an indictable offence;

(b) punishable on summary
conviction, were described or referred to as an offence; and

all provisions of the Criminal Code relating
to indictable offences, or or offences, as the case may be, shall apply to
every such offence.

I am of opinion that section 69 of the Criminal
Code is applicable.

The appeal should be dismissed.

St. Germain J. (ad hoc): I concur in the dismissal of the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Murder—Poisoning—Jury
trial—Misdirections by trial judge—Evidence—Admissibility—Declarations by
deceased—Res gestae—Ante mortem—Testimony by brother of accused, an
accomplice—Warning given to jury—Illegal comments by trial judge in his charge
—Whether “substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice”—New trial Section 1014
(2) Cr. C.

The appellant was tried for the murder of her
husband, convicted and sentenced to death, the indictment charging her with the
administering of poison (arsenic). The conviction was affirmed by the appellate
court, two judges dissenting. The grounds of dissent were based on
misdirections by the trial judge in his charge to the jury on the

[Page 54]

two following matters. First: the Crown
brought witnesses who testified to declarations made by the deceased, in the
presence of the accused, four or five days before his death and nearly two
weeks after the date of the alleged offence, such declarations being to the
effect that he was dying from poison given to him by the accused. Counsel for
the accused having objected to the admissibility of such evidence, the trial
judge held that it could not be admitted “as being a deposition ante mortem,”
but he allowed it “as being a declaration made by the victim in presence of the
accused.” But, in his charge to the jury, the trial judge did not restrict
himself to instruct the jury accordingly, and, treating these declarations by
the deceased as being an important part of the evidence, he proceeded to make
an analysis of same and emphasized the statement made by the deceased that he
was going to die, and so to give more weight to the truthfulness of the
latter’s declarations that he had been poisoned by his wife. Secondly: the
principal witness for the Crown was one Gédéon Bernard, brother of the accused.
At the time of the trial he was serving a sentence of five years’ imprisonment
following a verdict of manslaughter on an indictment for the murder. He
testified that the appellant came to his house and asked him if he had any
poison, as she wanted to get rid of her husband, that she agreed to pay him
$200; that he gave her some poison; that the appellant, seeing her husband ill
but not yet dead, asked him for more poison and he gave it. At the request of
counsel for the accused, the trial judge warned the jury of the danger of
convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, although it was
within their legal province so to do; but he added (translation): “* * * to
tell you to take the evidence of Gédéon Bernard as that of an accomplice, I am
bound, at the request of the defence, to tell you that he was the aider and not
the principal. To be an accomplice, it is necessary that there should be a
principal, that another should have committed the crime. If it is absolutely
desired that I say to the jurors to regard Gédéon Bernard as an accomplice in
the present case, it would be necessary that the principal should be the
accused. It is not possible to be the accomplice of one who does not exist. * *
* He is not an ordinary accomplice. If he be the accomplice, he is the brother
of the accused.”

Held that the
trial judge misdirected the jury upon each of the two grounds of appeal above
mentioned and that those material misdirections were so grave as to necessitate
a new trial, the Crown having failed to shew that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice did not occur owing to such misdirections. Section 1014
(2) Cr. C.

Held, also,
that the declarations made by the deceased that he had been poisoned by his
wife were not admissible as forming part of the res gestae. These
declarations were made at the hospital nearly two weeks after the date of the
alleged offence and four or five days before his death: therefore they were too
much separated by time and circumstance from the actual commission of the
alleged criminal act. These declarations should have been alluded to only in
connection with the attitude of the accused.

Held, further
(St. Germain J. ad hoc expressing no opinion), that the trial judge
misdirected the jury in his remarks concerning the evidence of the brother of
the accused, if considered as an accomplice. The trial judge after having set
out to warn the jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence
of an accomplice,

[Page 55]

destroyed in effect by his subsequent remarks
the warning given; some jurors may have in view of those remarks considered
that the request of the defence was tantamount to an admission of guilt.

Per Duff C.J.
and Crocket J.—The observations of the trial judge fall within the description
“matters which ought not to have been submitted” to the jury for consideration
by them “in aiming at their verdict.” Makin v. A. G. for N.S.W. ([1894]
A.C. 70).

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, sustaining the conviction of the
appellant, on her trial before Louis Cousineau J. and a jury, on a charge of
murder. The grounds of appeal, and the material facts of the case bearing on
the points dealt with by this Court, are sufficiently stated in the above
head-note and in the judgments now reported. The appeal was allowed; the
conviction was quashed, and a new trial ordered.

Antoine Rivard K.C. and Césaire Gervais
K.C. for the appellant.

Wilfrid Lazure K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of Duff C.J. and Crockett J. was
delivered by

Duff C.J.—I concur with the conclusion of my brother Hughes and of Mr.
Justice St. Germain. I agree with my brother Hughes that the learned trial
judge misdirected the jury in the matter of the evidence of Gédéon Bernard, and
that this misdirection in itself was so grave as to necessitate a new trial. I
agree, moreover, with Mr. Justice St. Germain in what he says as to the statements
alleged to have been made by the unfortunate deceased, Ludger Chapdelaine, in
the presence of the accused.

The rule as to the admissibility of statements
made in the presence of the accused is stated by Lord Atkinson in Rex v.
Christie[1] in
these words:

As to the second ground, the rule of law
undoubtedly is that a statement made in the presence of an accused person even
upon an occasion which should be expected reasonably to call for some
explanation or denial from him, is not evidence against him of the facts stated
save so far as he accepts the statement, so as to make it, in effect, his own.
If he accepts the statement in part only, then to that extent alone does it
become his statement. He may accept the statement by word or conduct, action or
demeanour, and it is the function of the jury which tries the case to determine
whether his words, actions, conduct, or demeanour at the time when a statement
was made amounts to an acceptance of it in whole or in part. * * *

[Page 56]

Of course, if at the end of the case the
presiding judge should be of opinion that no evidence has been given upon which
the jury could reasonably find that the accused had accepted the statement so
as to make it in whole or in part his own, the judge can instruct the jury to
disregard the statement entirely. It is said that, despite this direction,
grave injustice might be done to the accused, inasmuch as the jury, having once
heard the statement, could not, or would not, rid their mind of it. It is,
therefore, in the application of the rule that the difficulty arises. The
question then is this: Is it to be taken as a rule of law that such a statement
is not to be admitted in evidence until a foundation has been laid for its
admission by proof of facts from which, in the opinion of the presiding judge,
a jury might reasonably draw the inference that the •accused had so accepted
the statement as to make it in whole or in part his own, or is it to be laid
down that the prosecutor is entitled to give the statement in evidence in the
first instance, leaving it to the presiding judge, in case no such evidence as
the above mentioned should be ultimately produced, to tell the jury to
disregard the statement altogether?

In my view the former is not a rule of law,
but it is, I think, a rule which, in the interest of justice, it might be most
prudent and proper to follow as a rule of practice.

The practice indicated in the judgment of
Pickford J. in Rex v. Norton[2]
which Lord Atkinson says

* * * where workable, would be quite
unobjectionable in itself as a rule of practice, and equally effective for the
protection of the accused,

is explained by Mr. Justice Pickford in these
words:

The fact of a statement having been made in
the prisoner’s presence may be given in evidence, but not the contents, and the
question asked, what the prisoner said or did on such a statement being made.
If his answer, given either by words or conduct, be such as to be evidence from
which an acknowledgment may be inferred, then the contents of the statement may
be given and the question of admission or not in fact left to the jury; if it
be not evidence from which such an acknowledgment may be inferred, then the
contents of the statement should be excluded. To allow the contents of such
statements to be given before it is ascertained that there is evidence of their
being acknowledged to be true must be most prejudicial to the prisoner, as,
whatever directions be given to the jury, it is almost impossible for them to
dismiss such evidence entirely from their minds. It is perhaps too wide to say
that in no case can the statements be given in evidence when they are denied by
the prisoner, as it is possible that a denial may be given under such
circumstances and in such a manner as to constitute evidence from which an
acknowledgment may be inferred, but, as above stated, we think they should be
rejected unless there is some evidence of an acknowledgment of the truth. Where
they are admitted we think the following is the proper direction to be given to
the jury:—That if they come to the conclusion that the prisoner had
acknowledged the truth of the whole or any part of the facts stated they might
take the statement, or so much of it as was acknowledged to be true (but no
more), into consideration as evidence in the case generally, not because the
statement standing alone afforded any evidence of the matter contained in it,
but solely because of the prisoner’s acknowledgment of its truth; but unless
they found as a fact that there was such an acknowledgment they ought to
disregard the statement altogether.

[Page 57]

It is desirable to emphasize what Lord Atkinson
says. These observations cannot, except in so far as they relate c to the
direction to the jury, now be regarded as laying down the law, but they may
properly be regarded as outlining a practice which “where workable” is
“unobjectionable” and may prove “effective for the protection of the accused.”

To these observations it may be useful to add
the following extract from the judgment of Lord Moulton at p. 559 of the same
case[3]:

There remains the second ground, namely,
that it is evidence of a statement made in the presence of the accused, and of
his behaviour on that occasion. Now, in a civil action evidence may always be
given of any statement or communication made to the opposite party, provided it
is relevant to the issues. The same is true of any act or behaviour of the
party. The sole limitation is that the matter thus given in evidence must be
relevant. I am of opinion that, as a strict matter of law, there is no
difference in this respect between the rules of evidence in our civil and in
our criminal procedure. But there is a great difference in the practice. The
law is so much on its guard against the accused being prejudiced by evidence
which, though admissible, would probably have a prejudicial influence on the
minds of the jury which would be out of proportion to its true evidential
value, that there has grown up a practice of a very salutary nature, under
which the judge intimates to the counsel for the prosecution that he should not
press for the admission of evidence which would be open to this objection, and
such an intimation from the tribunal trying the case is usually sufficient to
prevent the evidence being pressed in all cases where the scruples of the
tribunal in this respect are reasonable * * *

* * * The evidential value of the
occurrence depends entirely on the behaviour of the prisoner, for the fact that
some one makes a statement to him subsequently to the commission of the crime
cannot in itself have any value as evidence for or against him.

It is not seriously open to dispute that the
learned trial judge’s charge was calculated to convey to the jury the belief
that they were entitled to weigh the evidential value of the statement as if
the statement were evidence of the facts stated, apart from the behaviour of
the prisoner. This was done, moreover, in a manner calculated to influence
weightily the judgment of the jury in arriving at a verdict.

I find myself quite unable to accept the
contention made on behalf of the Crown that the appeal ought to be dismissed on
the ground that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.
To quote the language of the Lord Chancellor in delivering the judgment of the
Judicial Committee in Makin v. A.G. for N.S.W.[4].

Their Lordships do not think it can
properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice, where on a point

[Page 58]

material to the guilt or innocence of the
accused the jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge to
consider in arriving at their verdict matters which ought not to have been
submitted to them.

The matters discussed by the learned trial
judge, already referred to, in dealing with the statements of the accused,
plainly fall within the description “matters which ought not to have been
submitted” to the jury for consideration by them “in arriving at their
verdict.” This applies also to the observations of the learned trial judge upon
the evidence of Gédéon Bernard.

It is not within the province of this court to
substitute itself for the jury in such cases.

It is, I think, desirable, since there is to be
a new trial, that something should be said as to the principle governing the
admissibility of dying declarations. Whether the conditions of admissibility
are fulfilled is a question for the judge, and it is his duty to pass upon that
question before admitting evidence of the statement alleged to have been made.

First of all, he must determine the question
whether or not the declarant at the time of the declaration entertained a
settled, hopeless expectation that he was about to die almost immediately.
Then, he must consider whether or not the statement would be evidence if the
person making it were a witness. If it would not be so, it cannot properly be
admitted as a dying declaration. Therefore, a declaration which is a mere
accusation against the accused, or a mere expression of opinion, not founded on
personal knowledge, as distinguished from a statement of fact, cannot be
received.

In Rex v. Sellers, a decision
pronounced in 1796, reported in 1828 in the third edition of Carrington’s
Supplement to the Criminal Law, it was laid down that,

Nothing can be evidence in a declaration in
articulo mortis that would not be so if the party were sworn. Therefore,
anything the murdered person, in articulo mortis, says as to facts, is
receivable, but not what he says as matter of opinion.

That this statement of the law governs the
practice to-day is evidenced by the fact, that it is found in the leading current
textbooks on criminal law, Russell on Crimes, 8th ed., p. 1930; Archbold,
Criminal Evidence, 28th ed., 392; Roscoe, Criminal Evidence, 15th ed., 31;
Wills, Evidence, 2nd ed., 197.

[Page 59]

In the section of Lord Hailsham’s edition of
Lord Halsbury’s Laws of England devoted to the criminal law (9 Hals. 452) it is
reproduced almost ipsissimis verbis. The authors of that section are Mr.
Justice Avory, Sir Archibald Bodkin and Mr. R. E. Ross.

If alleged ante mortem declarations of
Ludger Chapdelaine are tendered as such during the course of the new trial, it
will be the duty of the judge to consider and decide, before permetting
evidence of them to go before the jury, whether or not these conditions have
been satisfied.

The appeal should be allowed and a new trial
should be ordered.

Cannon J.—I agree with my Lord the Chief Justice that the learned trial
judge erred in matters of substance with respect to the declarations of the
deceased in the hospital, in the presence of the accused, and also in his presentation
to the jury of the appellant’s position if Gédéon Bouchard’s evidence was to be
considered as that of an accomplice. But I have pondered with grave anxiety
over paragraph 2 of article 1014 of the Criminal Code which would allow this
court to dismiss the appeal and avoid a third trial if, notwithstanding our
opinion on the above grounds, we were also of opinion that no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. I cannot, however, reach the
conviction, to use the language of Lord He wart, C.J. re Jones alias Wright[5], that, without these irregularities
in the trial, the jury must inevitably have reached the same verdict of
guilty against the accused.

It is impossible for us to enter into a
speculation about what the jury might, could, would or should have done, and as
we do not feel able to say that they must “inevitably” have come to the
conclusion to which they did come, in the absence of the material improperly
admitted,

the conviction must be quashed and a new trial
ordered.

Hughes J.—The appellant was tried before Mr. Justice Louis Cousineau and a
jury at Sherbrooke, Quebec, January, 1934, on the following indictment:—

A East Angus, dans le district de St. François, dame Béatrice Bernard a assassiné son mari, Ludger Chapdelaine, dans les circonstances
suivantes, savoir: en faisant prendre, le ou vers 1e 15ème jour de février 1932, au dit Ludger Chapdelaine, malicieusement
et dans le but de l’empoisonner, un poison violent, savoir de l’arsenic,
qu’elle mêla à son breuvage, lors de son repas, le tout à l’insu du dit Ludger
Chapdelaine, et

[Page 60]

ce dernier mourut le 6
mars 1932, à
Sherbrooke, dit district, des suites du dit empoisonnement, la dite dame
Béatrice Bernard commettant par là un meurtre.

The accused was convicted and sentenced to
death.

The accused appealed to the Court of King’s
Bench, appeal side. The appeal was dismissed by a majority judgment, Chief
Justice Sir Mathias Tellier and Mr. Justice St. Jacques dissenting.

From the judgment of the Court of King’s Bench,
appeal side, the accused now appeals to this Court.

The grounds of dissent as set out in the formal
judgment of the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, are as follows:

Sir Mathias Tellier et
M. le Juge St-Jacques sont dissidents, parce que, suivant eux, le verdict est
vicié par suite de la preuve illégale admise au dossier, comme celle des
déclarations du défunt Ludger Chapdelaine et par suite de la direction illégale
et injuste donnée au jury, et que, dans ces conditions, il est impossible de
dire que, sans ces illégalités, le verdict du jury aurait été le même.

The notes of the Chief Justice and those of Mr.
Justice St. Jacques both shewed that the misdirection above referred to
concerned the declarations of the deceased and also concerned the evidence, as
an accomplice, of Gédéon Bernard, a brother of the appellant.

The declarations of the deceased, both as to
admissibility and direction, may first be taken up. It is not in dispute that
the deceased, on or about February 17, 1932, felt ill about two hours after he
had eaten some tomato soup prepared by the appellant, the remains of a can
opened by the deceased the day before. At first he thought it was indigestion
and had the doctor treat him. On February 23, the patient was removed by the
doctor to St. Vincent de Paul Hospital at Sherbrooke. He died there on Sunday,
March 6, 1932.

When, at the trial, Josephine Chapdelaine
Brault, sister of the deceased, was testifying to a statement made by the
deceased in the presence of the appellant the Tuesday or Wednesday before his
death, the Crown counsel endeavoured to lay a foundation for the admission of
the evidence as an ante mortem statement. The defence counsel objected,
and the learned trial judge said:—

Je ne l’accepterai pas comme une déposition ante mortem, mais comme une déclaration
ordinaire formant partie du res gestae en présence de l’accusée.

The learned judge added:—

Je ne permets pas la preuve comme étant une
déposition ante mortem, mais
je la permets comme étant une déclaration faite par la victime en présence de
l’accusée.

[Page 61]

The witness had, before the objection, testified
that the deceased had said, in his wife’s presence: “C’est toi qui m’as
empoisonné; tu le sais.” After the learned judge’s ruling, the witness added
that the deceased had also said that the appellant would appear in court and
would be hanged for it. The witness further testified that the appellant
appeared indifferent and did not reply at all. In cross-examination the witness
said the deceased had not spoken that way previously. The witness said to the
deceased that she should not say such things, but the deceased replied: “Oui,
ma tante, c’est elle qui m’a empoisonné.” He further
said:

Je pense que je vais mourir parce que je suis empoisonné; c’est de la soupe que j’ai
mangée * * * Oui, ma tante, c’est
elle qui m’a empoisonné avec la soupe qu’elle m’a donnée.

Napoléon Brault, a cousin of the deceased,
testified that he had been at the hospital to see the deceased the Sunday
before he died and also on the Wednesday or Thursday before his death. He was
asked by the Crown counsel if the deceased had spoken in the presence of the
appellant of what had happened to him. The defence counsel objected to the
admission of the statement of the deceased as a dying declaration. The learned
trial judge then ruled:—

Je suis de votre opinion. Mais je ne la prends pas comme ça. Je la prends comme une déclaration
faite en présence de l’accusée et comme faisant partie du res gestae, et je la permets.

The witness then testified that on the Wednesday
or Thursday the accused had said in the appellant’s presence: “C’est elle qui m’a
empoisonné”. The appellant did not say anything in reply.

Elie Chapdelaine, a brother of the deceased,
testified that he had gone to the hospital five or six times to see the
deceased and that he had met the appellant there on almost every occasion. The
Crown counsel asked the witness whether the deceased, during the last days, had
spoken of his dying condition, and what he had said. The defence counsel
objected to the admissibility of the evidence as a dying declaration. The
learned trial judge then ruled as follows:

Je suis de cette opinion là. Mais je ne la prends pas comme telle. C’est la déclaration de la
victime qu’il faut interpréter et non pas l’opinion du témoin; ce n’est pas une
déclaration ante mortem, mais
ça fait partie du res gestae. Ensuite ça ne regarde pas l’opinion du témoin, ça regarde la
déclaration de la victime elle même et elle fait partie du res gestae. Je permets la preuve.

[Page 62]

The defence counsel then objected to the
admission of the evidence as part of the res gestae. On this objection
the learned trial judge ruled as follows:

Je rends toujours le même décision et pour les
mêmes raisons.

The witness then testified that the deceased
had, on the Wednesday or Thursday before his death, said, in his wife’s
presence: “Je suis empoisonné, je vais mourrir; c’est elle Béatrice qui m’a
empoisonné.” The witness was asked what attitude the appellant had taken to
this statement and replied that the appellant had smiled and, to change the
subject, had said to the witness: “Ta femme est bien?” Previously the deceased
had always told the witness that he was ill of indigestion from eating soup
which the appellant had prepared from the balance of a can opened by the
deceased the day before his first illness.

Raoul Gosselin, also a Crown witness, testified
that he was a hospital attendant. He was asked by the Crown counsel if he had
heard what the deceased had said to the appellant about his illness and about
poison. He replied that he had heard it on two occasions. The defence counsel
objected to the admission of the evidence as a dying declaration or as part of
the res gestae. The learned trial judge ruled:

L’objection est renvoyée parce que toute
déclaration ainsi faite ne serait pas prise comme déclaration ante mortem faite par la victime, mais
comme déclaration de la victime en présence de l’accusée faisant partie du res gestae.

The witness then testified that the deceased had
said in the presence of the appellant:

Tu peux sortir ma maudite hypocrite, c’est toi
qui m’a empoisonné, et tu viens ici m’en faire acroire.

The witness did not remember any reply by the
appellant. The witness added that the deceased had been delirious almost
continually for three or four days before he died. From the arrival of the
deceased at the hospital he had been delirious at times.

Dealing with the declarations of the deceased
the learned trial judge charged the jury as follows:

Maintenant, il y a pour moi la partie la plus
importante, quoiqu’on en dise. Ce sont les déclarations de la victime à
l’hôpital. Voici un homme qui dit à tout le monde qu’il va mourir, qu’il est
empoisonné, en présence de l’accusée; elle est là, elle est là tout le temps.
Il ne dit rien les premiers jours.

* *
*

Dans les premiers jours il ne dit rien; il ne
sait pas encore; mais c’est quand il est rendu à hôpital et puis que sa maladie
augmente tout

[Page 63]

le temps qu’il parle. C’est à vous autres à
vous demander:—Est-ce que c’est en
pleine santé, se voyant disparaître tout à coup, sachant qu’il est empoisonné,
et qu’il est empoisonné, d’après sa conviction, par sa femme, croyez-vous qu’il
est bien naturel qu’il ne se soit pas tu alors? Tous les médecins de l’hôpital
disent qu’il délirait par moment; tous ceux qui l’ont vu disent qu’en les
voyant entrer il les reconnaissait. Même ceux qui disent, du côté de la
défense, qu’ils y sont allés et qu’il a jamais parlé de rien, qu’ils ont jamais
crû qu’il était empoisonné, ne disent pas qu’il délirait dans ce temps là. Il
avait toute sa connaissance et souffrait. Maintenant quel intérêt avait-il
d’affirmer, de venir dire ça? Quel intérêt aurait cette dame Brault, sa tante.
Elle a rendu un témoignage, si je pouvais me servir d’une expression connue, de
sainte femme, sans aucune malice, au contraire. Et quand le savant procureur de
la défense lui demande si l’accusée a protesté contre les accusations du mari,
elle dit:—Non, elle n’a pas
protesté; c’est moi qui ai dit:—Ne
parle donc pas comme ça.—Et elle
dit sa réponse à lui:—C’est vrai
ma tante, c’est vrai ma tante.—Il
déclare qu’elle l’a empoisonné; et puis même il demande à son ami de la sortir
et il la traite d’hypocrite. Tous ces témoignages ont été entendus. C’était le
mercredi ou le jeudi; c’était quatre ou cinq jours avant sa mort, il n’était
pas encore entré dans le coma. Alors voici des déclarations excessivement
sérieuses d’un homme, quand même ça ne serait pas une déposition ante mortem, mais qui déclare qu’il sait
qu’il va mourir. Vous aurez à vous demander: quel intérêt Ludger Chapdelaine
avait-il d’accuser sa femme, puisque la défense reconnaît qu’ils vivaient bien
et étaient heureux tous les deux. Si encore on avait prouvé une animosité;
s’ils étaient déjà séparés, détestés. S’il y a eu une preuve de faite c’a été
contre l’accusée, qu’elle n’aimait pas son mari. Toute la défense a démontré
que c’était un ménage modèle, c’est son expression, elle a démontré qu’il n’y
avait aucun conflit entre les deux.

Vous devez vous demander si un homme qui a son
bon sens,—d’après tous les
témoins,—l’infirmier a dit:—Pour moi il était absolument normal,—et les réponses qu’il a données à sa tante au
moment où elle a dit:—Ne parle pas
comme ça.—C’est vrai ma tante, ce
n’est pas une réponse d’un homme qui délire. Vous êtes obligés de vous
demander, dans vos délibérations, quel intérêt avait-il d’accuser sa femme
plutôt qu’un autre? pourquoi? Enfin il disait qu’il croyait qu’il était
empoisonné, qu’il était pour mourir.—Je vais mourir, je meurs empoisonné; sortez moi cette hypocrite; je ne
veux pas la voir; elle essaie de m’en faire accroire.— Il disait qu’il allait mourrir et de fait il est mort.

It is clear that the declarations of the
deceased above referred to were not admissible as forming part of the res
gestae. They were made at the hospital within a week or thereabouts of the
death of the deceased and consequently long after the commencement of the
illness of the deceased They were, as Lord Atkinson said, in Rex v. Christie[6], so separated by time and circumstance from
the actual commission of the alleged criminal act that they were not admissible
as part of the res gestae. The Crown contended, however, that, if not
admissible as part of the res gestae, the declarations were admissible
statements made in the

[Page 64]

presence and hearing of the accused under such
circumstances that she might reasonably have been expected to have made some
answer or done something in repudiation thereof. Gilbert v. The King[7]. Hubin v. The King[8]. The appellant, on the other hand,
contended that the statements were mere opinions and therefore inadmissible,
but, assuming that the declarations were admissible as the Crown contended, the
learned trial judge did not explain to the jury that the statements made in the
presence of the appellant, even upon an occasion which should be expected
reasonably to call for some explanation or denial from her, were not evidence
against her of the facts, if any, stated save so far as she accepted the
statements or part thereof, so as to make them or part thereof, in effect, her
own, and that the evidential value of the statements depended on her behaviour
in response thereto. The King v. Christie[9].

The Crown further contended that the
declarations were admissible as dying declarations in any event and that the
learned trial judge sufficiently charged the jury. But the learned trial judge
refused to admit them as dying declarations and, in view of the disposition
that I think must be made of this appeal on the next ground, it is not
necessary to discuss them here in that light.

We now come to the evidence of Gédéon Bernard.
This witness, at the trial, testified that he was then serving a sentence of
five years’ imprisonment at St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary following a
verdict of manslaughter on an indictment for the murder of the same deceased,
Ludger Chapdelaine. He testified that during the winter of 1932, he lived at
Bishop Crossing, seven or seven and one-half miles from East Angus where the
deceased and the appellant lived. On “Samedi gras” the latter came to his house
and asked him if he had any poison for the purpose of poisoning her husband, as
she wanted to be rid of him. She told him that she would pay him $100. He asked
$300 and she said that she would give $200. He set out for East Angus on the
evening train. On Sunday morning he returned home. On Monday he went back to
East Angus. That evening he gave her some poison which he had brought in an
envelope and which he had taken from a

[Page 65]

little bottle in his own barn. He had purchased
it for his horses. Before that the appellant had written him a letter asking
for poison but the witness had thrown it in the stove. On February 21, he
received another letter, containing one dollar, which he took home and which
his wife read. The letter was as follows: “Tu viendras à East Angus. Tu sais
pourquoi.” That evening he went to East Angus. Ludger Chapdelaine was ill. The
appellant said to the witness:

Je lui en ai donné, je pensais qu’il était
pour mourir et il n’est pas mort. Tu vas m’en donner
encore.

The deceased was complaining of sickness at the
stomach and said he was going to die. The following morning, the appellant said
to the witness: “Tu vas m’en envoyer, tu m’en enverras, j’en ai plus.” That
evening she put in his pocket an envelope addressed to her at East Angus. In
the morning when he arrived home, he put the balance of the poison from the
bottle into the letter and sent it to her. After the death he asked her twice
for the hundred dollars she had promised him. The Crown
counsel then asked the witness:

Monsieur Bernard, le
vingt-deux, lorsque vous avez répondu à sa lettre et que vous êtes allé à East Angus, qu’est-ce qui s’est passé entre
vous et elle?

To the question the defence counsel objected.
The learned trial judge ruled, “Je permets la question.” The Crown counsel then
asked the witness if he had talked with the appellant and the witness answered,

Oui, j’ai causé avec elle quand je suis allé
chez elle; j’ai causé avec elle et j’ai eu des relations avec elle une fois.
C’est ça que vous voulez savoir, je vais vous le dire.

The Crown counsel then asked if that occurred on
the trip of the 6th or on the trip of the 21st, and the witness answered that
it was on February 8. In cross-examination the witness was asked about a
statement in writing previously made by him in which he had said that his wife
had heard the appellant say that she wanted poison to get rid of her husband,
and that his wife had said to make her pay dearly, to ask two hundred dollars.
To this question, he answered: “Je peux assermenter que non.” The witness also
in cross-examination was asked the following questions and made the following
answers:

Et puis, qu’un nommé Gagné le savait lui aussi; votre homme engagé, Oliva Gagné?
Je vous demandais, Monsieur Bernard, à la prison, avant votre procès, si ce que
vous aviez dit aux détectives, les déclarations aux

[Page 66]

détectives si c’était vrai, et vous avez dit
que c’était tout de travers, que l’arsenic, vous n’en aviez pas donné à votre
sœur, que vous aviez tout donné à vos chevaux, et que Oliva Gagné savait ça?—R.
Monsieur Gagné a travaillé pour moi dans l’été.

Q. Je vous demande si vous m’avez dit ça
déjà?—R. Oui, je vous l’ai déjà dit.

Introducing and speaking of the evidence of this
witness, the learned trial judge charged the jury as follows:

Maintenant, venons en aux faits. C’est là
dessus que je dois traiter de la question du complice.

S’il n’y avait que les symptômes trouvés par
les médecins tant durant la maladie de Chapdelaine que les symptômes trouvés
après sa mort, je dirais que la Couronne n’a pas tenté de faire la preuve
complète de l’accusation portée contre l’accusée. Mais il y a d’autres preuves
et la Couronne a essayé de démontrer, a lié, par des faits antérieurs, la
maladie soufferte par Chapdelaine qui a amené sa mort.

Le principal témoin c’est Gédéon Bernard.
C’est un complice * * * Vous devez prendre le témoignage d’un complice, pour me
servir d’une expression assez connue, avec un grain de sel. Vous devez le
prendre avec beaucoup de précaution, malgré que vous ayez le droit de
considérer ce témoignage, celui du complice, sans corroboration. Vous avez
droit de le croire, mais il doit être supporté, d’après moi, pour que, dans une
accusation aussi sérieuse que celle-ci, vous deviez le prendre en considération
* * *

Dans les circonstances je ne crois pas que
vous ayez de doute que Gédéon Bernard était un complice, parce qu’il a subi son
procès sur la même offense et a été condamné à cinq ans de pénitencier, qu’il
purge à l’heure actuelle. Mais la question présente un côté assez sérieux au
point de vue des précautions que vous devez prendre, avant de prendre son
témoignage, surtout dans la présente cause. Il y a un caractère absolument
particulier qui se présente dans cette cause spécialement, qui n’est pas dans
une autre cause. Pour que Gédéon Bernard soit complice, soit l’aide de
quelqu’un qui a commis un meurtre ou un crime, il faut qu’il y ait un crime. La
défense me demande de vous dire de prendre le témoignage de Gédéon Bernard avec
beaucoup de précaution parce qu’il est complice dans la mort de Ludger
Chapdelaine; on me dit de vous demander de prendre son témoignage avec beaucoup
de précaution, parce que si on a tué par le poison, l’arsenic, Ludger
Chapdelaine, Gédéon Bernard y a participé.

Donc, pour que je vous dise de prendre le
témoignage de Gédéon Bernard comme complice, je suis obligé, à la demande de la
défense, de vous dire qu’il a été l’aide et n’a pas été le principal auteur.
Pour être le complice de quelqu’un il faut un auteur, il faut qu’un autre
commette le crime. Si on veut absolument que je dise aux jurés de reconnaître
Gédéon Bernard comme complice dans la présente cause, il faudrait que le
principal acteur soit l’accusée. Il ne peut pas être le complice de quelqu’un
qui n’existe pas. Il faut que le meurtre ait existé pour que je vous demande de
le considérer comme complice, et dans ce cas, prenez son témoignage avec
beaucoup de précaution. Mais s’il est vrai, d’après les prétentions de la
défense, qu’il n’y a pas eu de meurtre, que Ludger Chapdelaine est mort de mort
naturelle et non de mort violente par arsénic, il n’est plus le complice; c’est
un témoignage indépendant qui n’aurait aucun défaut, et que vous seriez obligés
de prendre en entier. L’un ou l’autre, ou il est le complice ou il ne l’est
pas. S’il est complice

[Page 67]

il est complice de l’accusée et le meurtre a
été commis. S’il n’est pas le complice, c’est un témoin absolument impartial et
vous devez le prendre en entier. Je ne sais pas si je m’exprime assez
clairement pour vous démontrer dans quelle position assez embarrassante au
point de vue de l’interprétation du complice vous êtes. Alors, s’il est le
complice, prenez le avec précaution. En dehors de ça je suis obligé de vous
dire: ce n’est pas un complice ordinaire, s’il est le complice, c’est le frère
de l’accusée.

Il est en preuve qu’il
n’y a jamais eu aucune animosité entre l’accusée et Gédéon Bernard; il est en
preuve qu’ils se visitaient. Ce n’était pas rien qu’un frère, c’était un ami,
et un ami très intime. C’est en preuve. On n’a pas amené dans cette cause qu’il
y avait une rancune quelconque existant entre les deux. Gédéon Bernard est
condamné à cinq ans de pénitencier; il ne peut pas être touché de nouveau sur
la même accusation. Il a été trouvé coupable et c’est fini. Quand même on découvrirait
aujourd’hui qu’il est l’acteur principal, on ne peut pas le mettre en
accusation. Quel intérêt le complice aurait-il à venir rendre témoignage? Quel
intérêt avait-il? Vous pouvez vous demander ça. La vengeance? Ca n’a pas été
prouvé. Au contraire, c’est de l’amitié qu’on vous a démontrée entre les deux.
Ils ont eu un intérêt commun, à un moment donné, au point de vue du meurtre,
mais aujourd’hui il n’y en a plus; il n’y a aucun danger pour lui de parler.
Quant aux promesses qu’il aurait pu recevoir pour rendre son témoignage, où en
est la preuve? Aucune * * * vous
devez vous demander toutes ces questions. C’est en analysant toutes les
attitudes de Gédéon Bernard depuis le commencement jusqu’à aujourd’hui que vous
aurez la véritable interprétation de son témoignage.

In Vigeant v. The King[10], a new trial was ordered by this Court
where the trial judge had omitted to instruct the jury on what was an
accomplice in law and to warn them of the danger of convicting on the
uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice although it was within their legal
province so to do. This rule applies whether there is or is not corroborative
evidence of the testimony of the accomplice. Boulianne v. The King[11]. In the case at bar the learned trial
judge appeared to have set out to warn the jury of the danger of convicting on
the uncorroborated evidence of Gédéon Bernard, but he destroyed, in effect, by
the subsequent remarks, particularly those beginning with the words “Mais la
question * * *” and ending with the words “* * * de l’accusée,” the warning
given. Some jurors may have, in view of those remarks, considered that the
request of the defence was tantamount to an admission of guilt.

But the Crown alleges that, if there was
misdirection, in respect of the declarations of the deceased or in respect of
the evidence of Gédéon Bernard or both, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice actually occurred and that

[Page 68]

there should not be a new trial, Criminal Code,
section 1014 (2), particularly as there was ample other evidence of guilt. Boulianne
v. The King[12]. It is
not possible in the case at bar to say to what extent the jury or some of the
jurors were materially prejudiced against the appellant by the misdirection
concerning the evidence of Gédéon Bernard alone, but it is clear that there was
material misdirection. Allen v. The King[13]. Where the jury has been misdirected on a
material matter, the onus is upon the Crown to shew that the jury, charged as
they should have been, could not, as reasonable men, have given on the evidence
a verdict other than one of guilt. Brooks v. The King[14]. The Crown has failed to shew this.

The appeal should be allowed and a new trial
ordered.

St-Germain J. ad hoc: Regarding the admission of the declarations made
by Ludger Chapdelaine, at the hospital, and narrated by some of the Crown
witnesses, as evidence in the case, I am of the opinion that these declarations
were rightly rejected by the learned trial judge as “dying declarations.” In
making these declarations, Chapdelaine was merely expressing the opinion that
he had been poisoned by his wife and was not asserting a statement of fact. Had
Chapdelaine been able to testify himself at the trial, such declarations would
not have been allowed. In a case of Rex v. Sellers, reported in
Carrington’s Treatises on the Criminal Law, p. 233, it was decided that:

Nothing can be evidence in a declaration in
articulo mortis that would not be so if the party were sworn. Therefore,
anything the murdered person, in articulo mortis, says as to facts, is receivable,
but not what he says as matter of opinion.

These declarations, however, though rejected as
“dying declarations,” were admitted as res gestae. Here again I must
come to the conclusion that said declarations should have also, as such, been
rejected, first, for the very same reason above mentioned as to “dying
declarations,” and, secondly, for the further reason that, having been made
several days after the date on which the appellant was accused of having given
poison to her husband, said declarations did not “constitute or accompany
and explain, the fact or transaction in issue” and therefore were

[Page 69]

not admissible “as forming parts of the res
gesta”; (Phipson, 7th Ed., p. 54).

These declarations could only have been admitted
to prove the accused’s attitude or answers and, thereby, allow the jurors to
draw their own conclusions as to such attitude and answers of the accused.
Unfortunately, the learned trial judge in his charge did not restrict himself
to instruct the jury accordingly; on the contrary, treating said declarations
as the most important part of the evidence, he proceeded to make an analysis of
same and emphasized the statement made by Ludger Chapdelaine that he was going
to die, and so to give more weight to the truthfulness of the latter’s
declarations that he had been poisoned by his wife.

Maintenant, il y a pour moi la partie la plus
importante, quoiqu’on en dise. Ce sont les déclarations de la victime à
l’hôpital. Voici un homme qui dit à tout le monde qu’il va mourir, qu’il est
empoisonné, en présence de l’accusée; * * *

Est-ce que c’est bien naturel pour un homme de
trente ans encore en pleine santé, se voyant disparaître tout à coup, sachant
qu’il est empoisonné, et qu’il est empoisonné, d’après sa conviction, par sa
femme, croyez-vous qu’il est bien naturel qu’il ne se soit pas tu alors? * * *

Maintenant quel intérêt avait-il d’affirmer,
de venir dire ça? * * *

Alors voici des déclarations excessivement
sérieuses d’un homme, quand même ça ne serait pas une déposition ante mortem, mais qui déclare qu’il sait
qu’il va mourir. Vous aurez à vous demander: Quel intérêt Ludger Chapdelaine
avait-il d’accuser sa femme, puisque la défense reconnaît qu’ils vivaient bien
et étaient heureux tous les deux * * *

Thus by his remarks the learned trial judge
invites the jurors to consider as the most important part of the evidence the
declarations of the deceased, while they should have been alluded to only in
connection with the attitude of the accused. These declarations as commented
were surely illegal evidence submitted to the jury.

Having reached that conclusion, even after the
reading of the whole evidence, in view of the decisions of Allen v. The
King[15], and Gouin
v. The King[16], I
cannot but conclude that the appeal must be allowed, the conviction quashed and
a new trial directed.

Seeing my conclusion on the first ground raised
by the appellant, I need not express any opinion with regard to the second
ground as to the comments of the learned trial judge concerning the accomplice.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Appeal—Jurisdiction—Formal
judgment of appellate court—Mere mention of dissenting opinion—Not specifying
grounds of dissent—Section 1023 Cr. C.—Subsection 6 of section 1013 Cr. C.—21-22 Geo. V, c. 28, s. 14.

The appellant was convicted under subsection
(a) of s. 415 Cr. C. Upon
appeal, the conviction was affirmed by a majority of the Court, the dissent of
one judge being merely mentioned in the formal judgment. Under a recent
amendment (s. 14 of c. 28 of 21-22 Geo. V), subsection 6 was added to s. 1013
Cr. C. providing that, in case of a dissenting opinion, the formal judgment
should specify the grounds in . law on which such dissent was based. The Crown
contended that, owing to the failure of the appellate court so to specify the
grounds of dissent, an appeal to this Court was not open to the appellant.

Held that this
Court had jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. The only section of the
Criminal Code dealing with the jurisdiction de plano of the Supreme Court of Canada is section 1023, under which the fact
that there has been a dissent on a question of law is the sole condition for
the foundation of its jurisdiction: the circumstance that the grounds of
dissent are not specified in the formal judgment of the appellate court does
not avoid the fact of there having been a dissent, which is the only
requirement contained in section 1023 Cr. C.

APPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of
the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, dismissing his
appeal by a majority of the Court from his conviction by the Court of King’s
Bench, criminal side.

The appellant was convicted of the following
offence: Being president and general manager of a company called

[Page 695]

Rayon Trimmings Limited, which company had
been declared insolvent and was being wound up, he has, during the year
preceding the winding up order of the company, committed the following
indictable offence, to wit: “Acting in his capacity of president and general
manager, with intent to defraud, he did destroy, alter, mutilate and/or falsify
the books, papers, writings, valuable securities and documents belonging to the
Rayon Trimmings Limited, and/or concur in the same being done.” This is an
offence against subsection (a) of section 415 of the Criminal Code. The
accused had also been found guilty of an offence under section 417 of the
Criminal Code, but his appeal was unanimously allowed on this last conviction
by the appellate court. The Crown contended that the appeal to this Court
should be dismissed, because the judgment of the appellate court was not
rendered in accordance with section 1013 of the Criminal Code as amended. In
1931, 21-22 Geo. V, c. 28, s. 14, subsection (6) was added to 1013 of the
Criminal Code reading as follows: “Whenever an appeal under this section is
dismissed by the Court of Appeal, and any judge of such Court expresses an
opinion dissenting from the judgment of the Court, the formal judgment of the
Court shall specify any ground or grounds in law on which such dissent is based
either in whole or in part.”

The formal judgment of the appellate court
did not specify the grounds in law on which the Honourable Judge Howard was
dissenting: it merely stated that Howard J. was dissenting.

On the appeal to this Court, it was held that
the Supreme Court of Canada had jurisdiction to entertain the appellant’s
appeal. On the merits of the appeal this Court held that there was evidence on
which it could well be found that the appellant was guilty.

Lucien Gendron K.C. and Moses Doctor for
the appellant.

Gérald Fauteux K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment follows:

The Court:—The appellant was convicted under subsection (a) of section
415 of the Criminal Code.

[Page 696]

Upon appeal, the conviction was confirmed by the
majority of the Court of King’s Bench, but Mr. Justice Howard dissented. In the
formal judgment of the Court, the dissent is merely referred to as follows:

This is the judgment of this Court, Mr. Justice
Howard dissenting.

Under a recent amendment (sec. 14 of s. 28 of
21-22 Geo. V), the following subsection was added to section 1013 of the
Criminal Code:

(6) Whenever an appeal under this section
is dismissed by the Court of Appeal and any judge of such court expresses an
opinion dissenting from the judgment of the court, the formal judgment of the
court shall specify any ground or grounds in law on which such dissent is based
either in whole or in part.

In this case, the formal judgment does not
specify the grounds on which the dissent of Mr. Justice Howard is based, and
the Attorney-General, invoking former judgments of this Court (Davis v. The
King)[1]; Gouin
v. The King[2], and De
Bortoliv. The King[3]),
contends that, owing to the failure so to specify the grounds of dissent, an
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was not open to the appellant.

We are of opinion that such contention cannot be
up-held. The only section of the Code dealing with the jurisdiction de plano of the Supreme Court of Canada is section 1023. It gives to

any person convicted of any indictable
offence, whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section
1013 (the right of appealing) against the affirmance of such conviction on any
question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.

The fact that there has been dissent on a
question of law is therefore the only requirement.

In the Davis case1 and in
the others referred to by the Crown, upon the state of the law as it then was,
no dissenting judgment could be legally pronounced, unless the court of appeal
directed to the contrary, and unless the direction was plainly “evidenced by
the order of the Court” (Gouin v. The King[4]); and this Court held that dissenting
opinions expressed contrary to the prohibition of the statute should be treated
as non-existent—the consequence being that there was to be found, in the
record, no dissent as a result of which the right of appeal could operate under
section 1023 of the Code.

ON APEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA

Criminal law—Murder—Jury—Proper instructions as to
circumstantial evidence—Prospective jurors—Examination on voir dire—Not given
under oath—Mention by the trial judge as to the possibility of executive
clemency.

[Page 688]

The appellant was convicted of murder and sentenced to be
hanged. Upon appeal the conviction was affirmed, McGillivray J. dissenting. The
questions of law upon which the latter based his dissent are: (1) That the
trial judge failed to give to the jury a proper direction with respect to the
law relating to circumstantial evidence; (2) that his ruling with respect to
the questions permitted to be asked of the prospective jurors on their
examination on the voir dire was erroneous and that the examination was
not under oath—the alleged error was that, although the trial judge allowed the
accused to ask each juror challenged for cause, if, from what he had heard or
read, he had formed an opinion on the case to be tried, he refused to allow a
further question as to the nature of that opinion—; and (3) that the direction
of the trial judge to the jury respecting the possibility of executive
intervention was, as given, insufficient.

Held that the appeal should be dismissed.

On the first point, this Court is of the opinion that the
accused had no substantial ground of complaint, taking the charge to the jury
as a whole, although the trial judge could have given a more proper direction
to the jury as to the circumstantial evidence. There is no single formula which
it is the duty of the trial judge to employ; but as a

[Page 689]

rule he would be well advised to adopt
the language, or its equivalent, of Baron Alderson, in the Hodge case (2
Lewin C.C. 227): the trial judge should instruct the jury that, in so far as
they relied upon circumstantial evidence in the case before them, they must be
satisfied not only that the circumstances proved were all consistent with the
guilt of the accused, but also that they were inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion.

On the second point, this Courts is of the opinion that the
accused had a fair trial. Whether the accused had a right to have the question,
which the trial judge disallowed, put to the jurors, it is unnecessary to
determine; for, assuming that he had, he had suffered no prejudice by the trial
judge's refusal. As to the objection that the juror witnesses were not sworn, held
that it was the duty of the accused, as the challenging party, to see that
the witnesses he called to support the challenge were properly sworn.

On the third point, although the reference to the executive
clemency was an unfortunate one, this Court is satisfied that no harm has been
done to the accused, if the trial judge's instructions to the jury are taken as
a whole.

APPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, dismissing his appeal by a majority
of the Court from his conviction by Ewing J. and a jury, for murder.

The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are
stated in the head-note and in the judgment now reported.

E. F. Newcombe K.C. and Neil Primrose for the
appellant.

J. J. Frawley for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court follows:

THE COURT:—The appellant was convicted of the murder of
Walter James Parsille, near Manville, Alberta, and sentenced to be hanged. Upon
appeal the conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of Alberta (McGillivray J. dissenting).

The questions of law upon which McGillivray J. based his dissent,
and to which we are confined in this appeal, are set out in the formal judgment
of the court as follows:

(1) That the learned trial judge failed to give to the jury
a proper direction with respect to the law relating to circumstantial evidence.

(2) That his ruling with respect to the questions permitted
to be asked of the prospective jurors on their examination on the voir dire was
erroneous and that the examination was not under oath.

(3) That the direction of the learned trial judge to the
jury respecting the possibility of executive intervention was, as given,
insufficient.

[Page 690]

(1) The respect in which the learned
judge's charge is said to be insufficient as a proper direction to the jury is
that he did not instruct them that, in so far as they relied upon
circumstantial evidence in the case before them, they must be satisfied not
only that the circumstances proved were all consistent with the guilt of the
accused, but also that they were inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion. This is the rule laid down by Baron Alderson as far back as the
Hodge case[1],
and it has ever since been recognized as a proper direction to jurors.

It is of last importance, we do not doubt, where the evidence
adduced by the Crown is solely or mainly of what is commonly described as
circumstantial, that the jury should be brought to realize that they ought not
to find a verdict against the accused unless convinced beyond a reasonable
doubt that the guilt of the accused is the only reasonable explanation of the
facts established by the evidence. But there is no single exclusive formula
which it is the duty of the trial judge to employ. As a rule he would be well
advised to adopt the language of Baron Alderson or its equivalent.

One most important element in the case advanced against the
appellant was the evidence of one Ward. The accused, Ward deposed, admitted to
him when they were in gaol together in Knoxville, Tennessee, that he (the
accused) and his father, having decided to rob the deceased Parsille, decided
also, in order to avoid a possible subsequent recognition of them by the
deceased, that it would be necessary to kill him. This design, according to the
statement of the accused as recounted by Ward, was carried out and the deceased
was shot by the father in the presence of the son.

The learned trial judge did not explicity tell the jury that they
ought not to convict the prisoner unless they believed the testimony of Ward,
but, on the other hand, he did not explicitly tell them that it would be open
to them to find a verdict against the accused if they disbelieved Ward. As to
this there are, first of all, these three relevant sentences:—

It may be that in the trial of a criminal charge there are
facts or sets of facts which are very suggestive but which if standing alone
would fall far short of being sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused
beyond.

[Page 691]

any reasonable doubt. But it may
also be that there are facts or sets of facts in sufficient number and of
sufficient cogency which combined may amount to proof beyond all reasonable
doubt. Such facts or sets of facts if appearing in sufficient numbers and of
sufficient force may prove beyond all reasonable doubt not only that the
accused committed the offence but that on no other reasonable hypothesis could
anyone else have committed it.

If these sentences contain a suggestion
that the jury might find a verdict of guilt without regard to Ward's testimony,
then they seem also to convey, pretty clearly, the caution that, if they should
proceed upon the circumstantial evidence alone, they must be satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that the only rational conclusion, consistent with the facts
proved, was that the accused was guilty. But the final sentence of the learned
judge's remarks on this subject is this:

You will weigh all the evidence in this case including all
these statements alleged to have been made to Ward and if you believe them to
have been made and if you believe them to be true you will say whether or not
they satisfy you beyond all reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.

We think that this sentence, when read with the learned judge's
exposition of the facts and the evidence in the earlier part of his charge,
would be calculated to convey to the jury the impression that their verdict
ought to turn chiefly, if not entirely, upon their belief or disbelief of the
testimony of Ward and of the truth of the statement of fact which, according to
Ward's account, was made to him by the accused.

We are satisfied that the accused has no substantial ground of
complaint under this head.

(2) The error alleged in the judge's ruling as to the questions
which might be put to prospective jurors on their examination on the voir dire
was, that, although the judge allowed the accused to ask each juror challenged for
cause, if, from what he had heard or read, he had formed an opinion on the case
to be tried, he refused to allow a further question as to the nature of that
opinion.

The accused had challenged several jurors for cause, and the
challenges were tried. In the case of three jurors the triers found against the
challenge and declared the jurors indifferent. In each such case the accused
challenged peremptorily. When the full: complement of jurors had been sworn the
accused had one peremptory challenge left, and he had a jury, every man of
which the accused, through

[Page 692]

his counsel, had expressly declared to be
unobjectionable. Notwithstanding this the accused now contends that he had a
right to put to each of these jurors the question which the learned judge
disallowed, and that, as his rights were denied him, he is entitled to a new
trial.

We are fully conscious that in the administration of criminal
justice nothing is more important than that the constitution of the jury should
be free from all objection and that the accused should have the full advantage
of every safeguard which the law has provided to enable him to secure this
right, which is of the very essence of a fair trial. We, however, think that
the accused had a fair trial. Whether the accused had a right to have the
question, which the trial judge disallowed, put to the jurors, it is
unnecessary to determine, for, assuming that he had, he has suffered no
prejudice by the judge's refusal. By his own act in peremptorily challenging
these jurors, he elected to pursue that remedy instead of having the question
of their indifference as between himself and the King determined by way of
challenge for cause. This was held in the case of Whelan v. The Queen[2]. In that case the accused desired to
challenge for cause one S., one of the jurors called. The judge ruled that he
must first exhaust his peremptory challenges. In deference to the judge's
ruling the accused challenged S. peremptorily. Afterwards, having exhausted his
twenty challenges, including S., he claimed the right to challenge peremptorily
one H. on the ground that he had been compelled to challenge S. peremptorily
and should not be obliged to count him as one of the twenty. It was held that
the trial judge was wrong in ruling that the accused must exhaust his
peremptory challenges before challenging for cause and that if S. had been
sworn there must have been a venire de novo, but it was also held that
by the peremptory challenge of S., which excluded him from the jury, the error
in the judge's ruling was nullified. As to H. the objection could not be
maintained because the accused had, in fact, twenty peremptory challenges. That
judgment was given by a very strong court and, in our opinion, the point was
rightly determined, and governs the objection now under consideration.

[Page 693]

In reference to the further objection that these juror witnesses
were not sworn, it is sufficient to point out that it was the duty of the
accused, as the challenging party, to see that the witnesses he called to support
the challenge were properly sworn.

As to the third ground of objection, the passage in question is
in these words:—

You need not concern yourselves with the penalty that is
attached to this or to any offence. It does not follow that because a man is
convicted on a capital charge that he will necessarily be hanged. It is true
that the Criminal Code of Canada makes it incumbent upon the Court to pronounce
the sentence of death but the responsible officers of the Crown may in their
wisdom if they see fit commute that sentence. In any case that responsibility
is theirs and not yours or mine. The oath which you have taken calls upon you
to decide this case upon the evidence which you have heard from this witness
box and upon nothing else. And I need scarcely add you need have no moral fear
about doing your duty whether that duty leads you to conviction or to
acquittal.

We have no doubt that the reference to the executive clemency was
an unfortunate one. There was not the least ground for supposing that a verdict
against the accused founded on the evidence adduced and on a proper charge
would be interfered with. Such a reference could not assist the jury in
performing their duty to decide the issue of fact before them, and there is
always some risk that a suggestion that the verdict is to be reviewed may
result in some abatement of the deep sense of responsibility with which a jury
ought to be brought to regard their duty in passing upon any criminal charge,
and, preeminently, when the offence charged is murder, to which the law
attaches the capital penalty. Such observations as those addressed to the jury
by the counsel for the defence can always, if they seem likely to be harmful,
be counteracted without resorting to suggestions which may mislead the jury into
a misconstruction of their own duty.

In this case, however, we are satisfied that no harm was done.
There is, first, the immediate context of the impeached observations; which in
itself was perhaps sufficient to counteract the effect of those observations.
But, however that may be, the learned judge's observations, as a whole, were
admirably calculated to impress upon the jury a sense of the duty, with which
they were charged, to examine for themselves, and to bring to the test of their
own judgment, all the matters submitted to them; and the con

[Page 694]

text of the two sentences of which the
accused complains must, we are satisfied, have made it quite clear to the jury
that those sentences were not intended to qualify the instructions already
given to them, or to modify the impressions they must have received from what
had already been said.

The appeal will therefore be dismissed with costs.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Leave to appeal—Section 1025 Cr. С.—Application
should indicate judgments alleged to be in conflict—Rule 54 of this
court—Conviction of an insolvent for not having kept books—Whether conflicting
decisions were “in a like case” and from an “other court of appeal”—Section
417c Cr. С—Section 193 Bankruptcy Act.

When application is made under section 1025 Cr. С. for leave to
appeal in a criminal case, it is not sufficient to allege that the decision
which is intended to be appealed from “conflicts with decisions of different
courts of equal jurisdiction”; but the application, in order to comply with
rule 54 of this court, should indicate specifically the judgments of other
courts of appeal alleged to be in conflict with the decision to be appealed
from.

The appellant was an insolvent trader and had
been convicted under section 417c Cr. С. for not having kept proper books of
account. Application for leave to appeal under s. 1025 Cr.
С. was made on the ground
that, inasmuch as section 417c Cr. С. was alleged to have been virtually
abrogated by section 193 of the Bankruptcy
Act subsequently enacted, the decision of the appellate court in
affirming the conviction failed to apply the principle of law that a subsequent
statutory enactment has the effect of abrogating an anterior enactment which is inconsistent
with it; and, at the hearing, counsel for the applicant cited three judgments
which were alleged to be in conflict with the above decision.

Held that the application for leave to appeal should be dismissed as the
judgments cited were not rendered “in a like case” and by an “other court of appeal”
within the provisions of section 1025 Cr. С.; besides, they were not in conflict
with the decision intended to be appealed from: the appellate court had clearly
admitted the principle of law above cited; but it had held that section 193 of
the Bankruptcy Act was not
inconsistent with the provisions of section 417c Cr.
С.

Semble that a single judge, although sitting on appeal from a conviction by
a magistrate, is not a “court of appeal” within the meaning of section 1025 Cr. С.

[Page 102]

Rinfret, J.—Les conditions exigées par l’article 1025 du code criminel pour qu’un juge de cette
cour puisse permettre l’appel sont que

le jugement dont il est interjeté appel (soit)
en apposition à celui d’une autre cour d’appel dans une cause de même nature.

La requête que l’on m’a présentée se contente d’alléguer
ce qui suit:

Whereas the decision of the said Court of
Appeal conflicts with the definition of the Criminal Code and that of the Bankruptcy Act, which two acts are in
contradiction, and also with the decisions of different courts of equal
jurisdiction:

Je doute que cette allégation soit rédigée conformément à la règle 54 des Règles de cette cour. Dire simplement
que la décision dont on entend interjeter appel “conflicts
with the decisions of different courts of equal jurisdiction” ne me paraît guère se
conformer à la règle qui veut que “the notice of motion shall set out fully the grounds upon which it is based”; et je croirais qu’un avis de motion, pour se prévaloir de cet article,
devrait nécessairement indiquer quels sont les jugements des autres cours d’appel
avec lesquels la décision dont on se plaint est en opposition. Cependant le
savant procureur de la Couronne ne s’est pas objecté à ce que la requête me fût
présentée dans la forme où elle était; et je me bornerai donc à indiquer qu’à
mon avis cette requête n’était pas rédigée conformément aux règles de la cour.

A l’audition, de la part de l’appelant, l’on m’a
indiqué trois jugements où l’on prétendait trouver le conflit exigé par l’article
1025 pour qu’un appel pût être
permis. Ce sont les causes de Regina v. Rose[1], The King v.
Stone[2] et Rex v. Staneley[3].

L’offense dont l’appelant a été trouvé coupable est

* * * que depuis cinq
ans ou environ en la cité de Québec, dans le district de Québec, un nommé Sam Liebling, faisant affaires à Québec sous la raison
sociale “La Maison Lucille”, comme commerçant, ayant un passif de
plus de mille douars, étant incapable de payer intégralement ce qu’il doit à
ses créanciers, n’a point tenu de livres de compte qui, dans le cours ordinaire
du commerce ou du négoce qu’il a exercé, étaient nécessaires pour faire
connaître ou expliquer ses opérations, contre les dispositions de l’article 417c
du code criminel.

Le conflit, d’après ce que l’on prétend, existerait
dans le fait que le paragraphe с de l’article 417 du code
criminel

[Page 103]

constituerait une législation en matière de
faillite et qu’il aurait été implicitement abrogé par l’adoption de l’article 193 de la loi de faillite, qui, suivant le
savant procureur de l’appelant, a pour but et pour effet de pourvoir à un cas
semblable à celui qui était jusque-là couvert par le sous-paragraphe С de l’article 417. La Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Québec, en confirmant la
conviction de Liebling, aurait donc
refusé de reconnaître le principe bien établi qu’une loi spéciale postérieure
abroge la disposition incompatible qui se trouve dans une loi générale
antérieure; Maxime qui nous vient du vieux droit romain: “Leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant” (2
Inst. p. 685).

L’appelant ne saurait obtenir la permission d’appeler
à raison des jugements qu’il m’a cités.

Et d’abord, ces jugements n’ont pas été rendus dans
une cause semblable, ni par une autre cour d’appel, au sens de l’article 1025 du code criminel.

Dans Regina v. Rose[4], il s’agissait d’un habeas corpus pour obtenir l’élargissement d’un
prisonnier qui avait été trouvé coupable de “personation”,
en vertu des dispositions de The Consolidated Municipal
Act—1892 d’Ontario. La
requête a été présentée, non pas à une autre cour d’appel, mais à Boyd С. Sa décision
fut:

Where a clause in a statute prohibits a particular
act and imposes a penalty for doing it, and a subsequent clause in the same statute imposes a different
penalty for the same offence, which cannot be reconciled either as cumulative
or alternative punishment, the former clause is repealed by the latter.

Nous n’avons donc ici ni une “cause de même
nature”, ni le jugement “d’une autre cour d’appel"". En plus, comme
nous le verrons plus loin, le jugement n’est pas en opposition avec celui de la
Cour du Banc du Roi dont on se plaint.

Dans The King v. Stone[5], il s’agissait encore d’une requête pour habeas corpus présentée
à M. le juge Trenholme,

to review the decision of Extradition
Commissioner Choquet, who decided that the prisoner, Isaac Stone, alias
Schwartz, be surrendered on application by the United States Government on the
charge of having committed an offence against the bankruptcy law of the United
States, section 26b, United States Bankruptcy Act.

Si le juge Trenholme, en l’espèce, pouvait être considéré comme étant “une autre cour d’appel”
conformément aux

[Page 104]

exigences de l’article 1025,
il ne s’agissait pas, à tout événement, d’une cause
semblable; et le procureur de l’appelant a admis qu’il ne me citait cette cause
que pour signaler que le juge avait assimilé l’article 417
du code criminel à une législation en matière de faillite.

Enfin, dans Rex v. Staneły[6], il s’agissait, là encore, seulement d’une requête à un juge (Boyle J.) pour faire
annuler une conviction par un magistrat en vertu de The Government Liquor Control Act, 1924, de l’Alberta.

Ici encore, je doute fort que, par le seul fait que
le juge Boyle siégeait en appel de la
conviction prononcée par un magistrat, il pourrait être considéré comme étant
une cour d’appel teille que l’envisage l’article 1025 C.Cr. Mais je n’ai pas besoin de m’arrêter à la discussion de ce point,
puisqu’il ne s’agit pas d’une cause semblable, et surtout parce que cette
décision n’est pas en conflit avec cesile dont l’appelant veut interjeter appel.

En effet, il n’est pas exact de dire que, dans la
présente cause, la Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Québec s’est prononcée
à l’encontre du principe bien connu qu’une législation spéciale postérieure a
pour effet d’abroger une législation antérieure sur le même sujet et avec
laquelle elle est incompatible. Au contraire, chacun des juges qui a écrit des
notes tient ce principe pour acquis et s’applique à démontrer qu’il n’y a pas
lieu de le suivre en l’espèce, parce que l’article 193 de la loi de faillite n’est pas, à son avis, incompatible avec l’article
417c du code criminel.

Voici, en effet, ce que dit M. le juge Tellier:

Comme on le voit, ledit article.
193 et ledit article 417 ne sont pas faits pour le même cas.
Ils peuvent donc exister simultanément, l’un et l’autre; et l’accusé a tort de
prétendre que ledit article 193, parce
qu’il est de date plus récente que ledit article 417, a implicitement abrogé ce
dernier.

Voici maintenant ce que dit M. le juge Rivard:

Il est vrai que l’un et l’autre article font
une contravention du défaut de tenir des livres de compte; mais ila s’arrête la similitude entre les deux
dispositions. Ce n’est pas pour si peu que, de deux lois inscrites dans les
statuts et conservés dans leur refonte, on peut dire que l’une d’elles se
trouve implicitement rappelée. Entre 193 de la Loi de faillite et 417 du code ‘criminei, il n’y
a rien d’incompatible, rien qui répugne. Ce sont deux contraventions
distinctes.

Et voici cе que dit M. le juge Galipeault:

Il s’agit donc, encore une fois, de deux
recours distincts qui ne s’excluent pas. Il serait donc oiseux de discuter, si
la Loi de Faillite étant

[Page 105]

postérieure au code criminel, et si étant une loi spéciale, alors que le code criminel est
une loi générale, si la peine prévue par l’Acte
de Faillite est moins lourde que celle portée au code criminel, il y
avait Heu de poursuivre en vertu de la Loi
de Faillite.

Bien loin de répudier le principe, comme on le
voit, chacun de ces honorables juges s’en inspire, mais fait remarquer qu’il ne
s’agit pas d’un cas où le principe s’applique et que, par conséquent, il ne
peut servir de base au jugement.

Bien entendu, l’appelant
n’a pas été capable de me citer un jugement d’une autre cour d’appel qui
décidait que l’article 193 de la Loi de faillite était
incompatible avec l’article 417c du code criminel, et que, par conséquent, le
premier devait prévaloir. Une décision dans ce sens eût fait tomber la requête
actuelle strictement dans les conditions prévues par l’article 1025 du
code criminel.

L’appelant n’avait même pas besoin de se trouver
dans une situation aussi claire. Il n’était pas nécessaire que l’arrêt ‘d’une autre cour d’appel fût dans
une cause identique, pourvu qu’il eût soulevé une question de droit analogue tranchée dans un sens différent. (The King v. Boak[7]; Barré v. The King)[8].
Mais ici non seulement il n’y a pas conflit entre les
décisions; l’on est, au contraire, en
présence de cours qui, partant du même principe général qu’elles admettent
toutes, font la distinction entre des cas où l’application
du même principe entraîne des résultats différents.

La Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Québec a
admis sans discussion le principe invoqué par l’appelant;
mais elle déclare dans son jugement que ce principe ne s’applique pas à la
présente cause. En décidant ainsi, le jugement qu’elle a rendu n’est
certainement pas en opposition à ceux des autres cours que l’on m’a cités, et il se conforme
exactement à la règle telle qu’elle est
exprimée dans Beale’s Cardinal Rules of Legal
Interpretation, 3rd ed., p. 525:

Every affirmative statute is a repeal by
implication of a precedent affirmative statute, so far as it is inconsistent or
repugnant thereto and no further.

J’arrive donc à la conclusion que la requête pour
permission d’appeler doit être rejetée
avec dépens.

Application dismissed
with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Club—Benevolent
Societies Act, R.S.B.C., 1911, c. 19—Place "" kept for gain""—Common
gaming house—Game of cards played—Criminal Code, section 226—The Societies Act,
R.S.B.C., 1914, c. 236.

The appellant was steward of a
bona fide club organized pursuant to the Benevolent Societies Act
(now the Societies Act) of British
 Columbia.

[Page 627]

The club had a membership of
1,700 and provided all the regular facilities of a social club, including
meals, billiard rooms, reading rooms, various card games, etc.; it also leased
and operated a football field. Members contributed ten cents apiece to the
funds of the club for each half hour's play at the poker table, irrespective of
whether they were winning or losing. This money was not taken from the stakes
or the pot, but was collected by the appellant, as steward, from the players
and paid over to the club. Only members were allowed in the premises, a by-law
expressly forbidding the introduction of visitors to any part of the club
property. The appellant was convicted, under section 226 of the Criminal Code,
of unlawfully keeping a common gaming house; and the conviction was affirmed by
the appellate court.

Held, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal
([1932] 1 W.W.R. 154), that, upon the facts, the club was not ""a house ***
kept *** for gain "" within the meaning of section 226 Cr. C. and that the
appellant had been wrongly convicted.

R. v. Riley ( (1917) 23 B.C.R. 192 and R. v.
Cherry and Long ( (1924) 20 Alta. L.R. 400) approved; R. v.
Sullivan ( (1930) 42 B.C.R. 435) overruled.

APPEAL from the decision of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , maintaining the conviction of the appellant of
having kept a common gaming house.

The material facts of the case
and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the
judgments now reported.

J. W. de B. Farris K.C.
for the appellant.

E. F. Newcombe K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgments of Anglin C.J.C.
and Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ. were delivered by

ANGLIN C.J.C.—After careful
consideration of this appeal, I am satisfied that the order made by Newcombe J.
granting leave herein was providently made and that this court has jurisdiction
to entertain this appeal, on the ground of conflict between the decision of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia in it and the decision of the

[Page 628]

same court in R. v.
Riley[2]
, which, although impliedly overruled in R. v. Sullivan[3]
, had in the meantime been followed in R. v. Cherry and Long[4],
decided by the Appellate Division of Alberta in 1924. No allusion was made by
the Court of Appeal, either in the Sullivan case[5]
or in the present case, to R. v. Riley[6]
or R. v. Cherry and Long[7]
, although both were brought to the attention of the court, as appears in the report
of the Sullivan case[8] at p.
436, and here in the appeal case and factums, probably because they had to do
with payments for refreshments and were thought, on that ground, to be
distinguishable.

We might have been disposed to
hold that this case fell within clause (b) (ii) of s. 226 of the
Criminal Code, but for the fact that the evidence does not shew that

the whole or any portion of
the stakes or bets or other proceeds at or from such games (i.e., games of
chance, or mixed games of chance and skill) (was) either directly or indirectly
paid to the person keeping such house, room or place.

In fact, the players would appear
to have paid this money to the steward out of their own pockets rather than
from any proceeds of the game. This appears from the evidence throughout the
case. On this point we adopt the view of Beck J.A. in R. v. Cherry
and Long[9]
(at p. 407), where that learned judge says:

In my opinion, the only
reasonable interpretation of this clause ( (b) (ii) of s. 226 Cr. C.) is
that it refers, and refers only, to a payment made to the keeper out of one or
all of the ""pots"" under a rule, regulation, agreement or
understanding exacted by the keeper that such a payment shall be made as a rake-off,
commission or other form of profit to the keeper.

As to clause (a) of s. 226, we
find it difficult to say that the "" house, room or place (was) kept ***
for gain."" No doubt, the moneys paid by the players constituted largely
the revenue of the club and belonged to its members, playing being confined to
them.

The question really presented for
our determination is whether the decision of the Appeal Court of B.C. in R. v.
Sullivan[10]
or that earlier delivered by the same court (then (1916) composed of Macdonald
C.J.A. and Martin and McPhillips JJ.A.) in Rex v. Riley[11]
appeals to us as the better.

[Page 629]

In R. v. Riley (1),
Macdonald C.J.A. said:

In Halsbury's Laws of England, vol.
4, p. 406, (par. 860), a club is defined as

A society of persons
associated together for social intercourse, for the promotion of politics,
sport, art, science or literature, or for any purposes except the
acquisition of gain.

There is no finding that the
Pender Club was not a bona fide club; there is no suggestion that the
accused conducted the house under the name of the Pender Club for personal
gain, and apart from the finding as to the "" rake-off"" it is not
suggested that the Pender Club was conducted by the members thereof for gain.
The real question involved in the submission therefore turns on whether or not
the receipt by the club of moneys for refreshments, in the manner above set
out, proves a keeping of the club premises for gain.

The rake-off was not
compulsory; that was merely the method adopted by the players of paying for
their refreshments. Instead of each one paying for his own refreshments, or
treating in turn, they took from their common store from time to time
sufficient money to pay for all the refreshments which they consumed.

*****

I think the section is aimed
at the keeping of a house for gain to which persons come by invitation, express
or implied. The members of a bona fide club come as of right. This case
is analogous to the case of Downes v.Johnson[12],
where it was held that members of a bona fide club were not to be
considered persons who resorted to the club.

and Martin J.A. said :

It cannot properly be said,
on such facts (i.e., those in the case) that the house or place in question,
conducted by the hundred (here seventeen hundred) members of the social club
all equally interested (cf. Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 4, p. 406, par.
862) was ""kept *** for gain"" within the meaning of the section and as
defined by e.g., Rex v. James[13].

That learned judge concluded his
judgment as follows:

His Worship has found that
this benevolent club is only enabled to be kept open because of the gambling
that is admittedly going on there, its revenue being otherwise very
insufficient, but the correction of such an evil is for the legislature, and in
the circumstances the courts can do nothing to stop it.

In R. v. Cherry and Long[14]
, Beck J.A., in delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division of Alberta
said,

There is a company, duly
incorporated under The Companies Act as ""The Cooks and Waiters
Club."" In the memorandum of association, the objects of the company are
stated as follows:

*****

(b) To carry on a
club for the use and recreation of cooks and waiters in Edmonton.

*****

The company was incorporated
on December 7, 1923. The company undoubtedly carried on a bona fide club
*** there was provision for admitting visitors or temporary members, on the
recommendation of two

[Page 630]

members, for thirty days,
after which period, if they desired to become permanent members they had to be
voted for. Persons who were not cooks or waiters could not become permanent
members; others could become visitors for thirty days.

*****

The club kept generally a
small stock of soft drinks, coca-cola, etc., "" just ordinary refreshments
served in a club,"" but there was no restaurant in the club.*** 

There was evidence given by
the police, who watched the playing through the window on two occasions for a
very few minutes, that Cherry was seen taking, sometimes twenty-five and
sometimes fifty cents, from the ""pot,"" on several occasions; that
Cherry put this in the outside pocket of his coat. It seems to me the natural
thing that, if provision was being made for paying for refreshments, the money
should be kept by one person. Cherry was evidently selected as that person. It
is not probable that he kept his own money in the outside pocket of his coat,
so that it is to be inferred that he was keeping this refreshment money
separate, to be used as occasion arose for the purpose intended.

It was suggested during the
argument that we should infer that Cherry, who was only a visiting member, had
in some way rented or got control of the use of the particular room in which he
was, for his own purposes and profit, but such an inference from the evidence
would, to my mind, be quite unreasonable. Long was a permanent member of the
club, and was voluntarily in charge on the occasion in question for a portion
of the time during which the play was going on.

*****

The first question for
decision *** is whether the place was being conducted "" for gain.""

As to whether a place is
kept for gain, if, from the stakes, bets or other proceeds at or from the game,
money is paid to a bona fide club, in whose premises the game is being
played, in payment for refreshments supplied by the club, I adopt the decision
of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in R. v. Riley[15]
, and hold that in such a case the club is not kept for gain within the meaning
of the statute.

*****

Such a payment is not made
to the keeper qua keeper, but as a seller of refreshments. Nor is the
money paid qua part of the pot, but is in reality a contribution by the
several players out of their own pockets, just as much as if they severally
contributed to the fund from their own pockets. It is paid for a purpose and
for a consideration in no way incident to the game as a game, and I think,
therefore, for the two reasons indicated, it is not the kind of payment which
is contemplated by the Act.

This view is strengthened by
two considerations: (1) The Act under consideration is criminal, and nothing is
to be found in it by intendment, but only what is clearly expressed ; and (2)
To hold otherwise would be to interfere with a harmless practice which is not
uncommon in what perhaps may be called high-class social clubs, those resorted
to by persons of divers callings, occupying the highest positions in the public
and social life of the country.

[Page 631]

The case at bar, in its facts,
seems to be clearly indistinguishable from R. v. Sullivan[16]
. For instance, here, as there, the bona fide existence of the club is
conceded, the players, who sat at the poker table for a certain period of time,
all contributed (ten cents apiece for each half hour in this case), to the
funds of the Club; no profits were or could be distributed amongst the members,
although all the property of the Club and its revenues belonged to them (The
Societies Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 236, s. 5) ; the steward collected this
money from the players and paid it over to the club; only members were allowed
in,—in fact, in the present case, by-law no. 18 expressly forbade the
introduction of visitors to any part of the club premises; the accused was
steward of the club. In all these features the case resembles R. v.
Sullivan[17]
, where the decision was based on s. 226, 1 (a), of the Code, and the
Chief Justice, delivering the judgment of the court said,

The appellant swore that he
received nothing but his salary as steward. I think, however, that s. 69 of the
Criminal Code is applicable to the appellant, since it is apparent that the
club was a common gaming house.

From this passage and the rest of
the report, however, it would seem that the main question considered by the
court was the responsibility of the steward in the premises, rather than the
question now before us.

But, we agree with Martin J.A.,
where he said, in the case at bar,

This case cannot, in my opinion,
be distinguished in principle from our decision in R. v. Sullivan[18]
. Indeed, in some respects it is a stronger case for conviction than that ***.

Not improbably the learned judge
here referred to the fact that, in the Sullivan case[19]
, the club in question had, in addition to other features, a lunch counter
where patrons could buy meals, soft drinks, tobacco and cigars,—a feature which
was entirely lacking in the present case.

The same points made at bar in
the present case would appear to have been made in the Court of Appeal in the Sullivan
case[20] , yet
the court there held that,

The appellant, therefore,
was properly convicted of being a keeper (of a common gaming house kept for
gain within clause (a) of s. 226).

The present case, however, would
seem to be a fortiori a case for conviction in that here the moneys paid
by the

[Page 632]

card players constituted a chief
source of revenue of the club.

After having given to this case,
and to the cases cited at bar, the fullest consideration, we prefer the
decisions and the reasoning put forward in the Riley case[21]
and in R. v. Cherry and Long[22]
to the decision and the reasons in support thereof given in the Sullivan
case[23] . That
being so, it follows that the Sullivan case[24]
must be overruled, the appeal herein allowed and the conviction against the
appellant must be quashed.

DUFF J.—The question is whether,
on the facts disclosed in evidence, the appellant could be lawfully convicted
of keeping a common gaming house, within the meaning of section 226 of the Criminal
Code. The relevant parts of the section are as follows:

Section 226. A common gaming
house is

(a) a house, room or
place kept by any person for gain, to which persons resort, for the purpose of
playing at any game of chance, or at any mixed game of chance and skill; or

(b) a house, room or
place kept or used for playing at any game of chance, or any mixed game of
chance and skill in which

1. ***

2. The whole or any portion
of the stakes or bets or other proceeds at or from such game is either directly
or indirectly paid to the person keeping such house, room or place.

The appellant was the steward of
the club, which, admittedly, was a social club, incorporated under the Benevolent
Societies Act (now the Societies Act), which owned a club house, as
well as a football ground, and provided facilities for the social intercourse
and the amusement of its members. The indoor amusements consisted of billiards,
card games, including poker.

The point in controversy concerns
the manner in which poker games were conducted, and the particular fact upon
which the Crown relies is this: every half hour a member occupying a seat at a
table and engaged in playing poker was charged a certain sum. It is true also
that the respondent, the steward, provided chips to members for which no charge
was made, a circumstance, which, so far as 'I can see, has no bearing on the
question at issue.

[Page 633]

Members only were admitted to the
premises; and it is well perhaps to emphasize the fact already mentioned that
the club was not a proprietary club, but a club incorporated under the Societies
Act. I have no hesitation in holding that there is no evidence that this
club was "" a house, room or place kept by any person for gain."" There
is not the slightest evidence to indicate that the club was not precisely what
it purported to be—a club kept for the amusement and recreation, and solely for
that purpose, of the members. Fees and other contributions made by the members
were for the purpose of defraying the expenses.

The real question seems to be
whether or not the accused can be convicted under subsection (b) 2 of
section 226, i.e., whether or not the room in which poker was played was

a room or place kept or used
for playing therein at any game of chance or any mixed game of chance and skill
in which the whole or any portion of the stakes or bets or other proceeds at or
from such games as either directly or indirectly paid to the person keeping
such house, room or place.

It is argued by Mr. Farris that
the small fee charged for the use of the chair cannot be described as a
""gain,"" within the meaning of these words. I pass by that question
because my mind is perfectly clear upon this point, namely, that the payment of
this fee is not a payment of

the whole or any portion of
the stakes or bets or other proceeds at or from

the games. Admittedly, it is, of
course, not a payment from the bets or stakes. Is it a payment of ""the
whole or any portion "" or "" other proceeds at or from such games
""? The word "" proceeds"" here must be read in connection with
bets and stakes, and I think we are justified in saying that the word is noscitur
a sociis, and that it is limited to the proceeds of a betting or gambling
game as such, and proceeds similar in character to bets and stakes. The broader
construction would lead to consequences which it is impossible to suppose could
have been contemplated. The section is aimed, I think, at the participation by
the owner of the place where the game is carried on, in the profits or other
proceeds accruing to members from the game itself.

No doubt where it is shewn that
gain is the real object of the keeping of the place, you have a case within
subsection (a). But, as I have said, no such case is made out 

[Page 634]

here, and I think the argument
based upon subsection (b) fails also.

The appeal should be allowed and
the conviction quashed.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF
THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.

Criminal
law—Appeal—Jurisdiction—Statutes—Retrospective construction—Statute giving new
right of appeal—21-22 Geo. V, c. 28, s. 15 (amending s. 1025, Cr. Code).

Legislation
conferring a new jurisdiction on an appellate court to entertain an appeal
cannot be construed retrospectively, so as to cover cases arising prior to such
legislation, unless there is something making unmistakeable the legislative intention
that it should be so construed. The matter is one of substance and of right. (Doran
v. Jewell, 49 Can. S.C.R. 88; Upper Canada College v. Smith,
61 Can. S.C.R. 413).

In the present
case, held, that 21-22 Geo. V, c. 28, s. 15 (amending s. 1025 of the Cr. Code)
did not give a right to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the
sustaining of the appellant’s conviction by a judgment of the Appellate
Division, Ont., rendered prior to such legislation.

APPEAL by the
defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
Ontario[1], dismissing his appeal from his
conviction by Wright J.[2]

[Page 71]

of offences against
the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 26, and of conspiracy,
contrary to the provisions of s. 498, subs. 1 (a), (b) and (d)
of the Criminal Code.



Singer, the present
appellant, was tried jointly with others, namely, Belyea, Weinraub, O’Connor,
Paddon and Ward. At the trial, Singer, Paddon and Ward were found guilty; and
Belyea, Weinraub and O’Connor were found not guilty2 Singer, Paddon
and Ward appealed from their conviction; and the Attorney-General for Ontario
(under the provisions of the Act of 1930, 20-21 Geo. V, c. 11, s. 28, amending
the Criminal Code) appealed against the acquittal of Belyea and
Weinraub. The Appellate Division1 dismissed the appeals of Singer,
Paddon and Ward; and allowed the appeals of the Attorney-General, and set aside
the acquittal of Belyea and Weinraub and adjudged them guilty.[3]










The present appeal was
brought under s. 1025 of the Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1927, c. 36), as
amended by 21-22 Geo. V (1931), c. 28, s. 15. By said amending Act (s. 15), the
following was substituted for subs. 3 of said s. 1025:



3. Any person
whose acquittal has been set aside may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
against the setting aside of such acquittal, and any person who was tried
jointly with such acquitted person, and whose conviction was sustained by the
Court of Appeal, may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the
sustaining of such conviction.



The present appellant
was convicted on March 23, 1931, and his conviction was sustained by the
Appellate Division on June 26, 1931. The said amending Act, which was assented
to on August 3, 1931, provided (s. 16) that it should come into force on
September 1, 1931.



A question of
jurisdiction arose, counsel for the respondent contending that no appeal lay;
that the said amendment, which was subsequent to the judgment in question of
the Appellate Division, was not retroactive, and upon the delivery of the
judgment the conviction was affirmed, and the right of appeal must date from

[Page 72]



At the opening of the
hearing of the appeal, argument was heard upon the question of jurisdiction,
and after hearing counsel for the parties, the Court retired for a few minutes
for consideration and, on its returning to the Bench, the Chief Justice delivered
judgment orally as follows:



ANGLIN C.J.C.—The
appeal in this case was taken under s. 15, c. 28, Stats. of Canada, 1931, which
became law on the 1st of September, 1931. The appellant was convicted on the
23rd of March, 1931, and his conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal on
the 26th of June, 1931.



It is common ground
that, unless there is something making unmistakeable the intention of the
Legislature that a retrospective construction should be put upon the
legislation so that it may cover cases arising prior thereto, no clause,
conferring a new jurisdiction on an appellate court to entertain an appeal, can
be so construed. The matter is one of substance and of right.










The decision in Doran
v. Jewell[4], is binding upon us and is conclusive to that
effect. If further authority be required on this point, it may be found in Upper
Canada College v. Smith[5].



The language relied
upon here, as indicative of the intention of the Legislature to require a
retrospective construction of the Act, consists merely in the fact that the
perfect tense is used in dealing with the matter. This, however, is legislation
in regard to appeals, where it seems almost inevitable that the past, or
perfect, tense should be used, as the matter dealt with, viz., the conviction
in the judgment appealed from, must necessarily be an event of the past when
the appeal is taken. At all events, we find nothing in the language of the
Legislature in this amendment to the Criminal Code indicative of an
intention that it should receive a retrospective construction.

Appeal
quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Section
1025 Cr. С.—Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada—Conflicting decisions—“Judgment
of any other court of appeal”—Must be courts within Canada—Cr. C. s. 1012, 1025.

The provisions of section 1025 of the
Criminal Code, giving right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, upon
leave to appeal being granted, “if the judgment appealed from conflicts with
the judgment

[Page 159]

of any other court of appeal,” must be taken
to refer to courts within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament and not
to courts outside the Canadian territory. Brunet v. The King ([1928] S.C.R. 161) ref.

APPLICATION for leave to appeal from a
decision of the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], upholding the conviction of the appellant
for the offence of selling narcotic drugs.

Lucien Gendron for the applicant

Gustave Monette contra.

RINFRET J.—The application is made under section 1025 of the Criminal Code, on
the ground that the judgment appealed from conflicts with two decisions of the
Court for Crown Cases Reserved, in England, respectively delivered in 1890 and
1894.

I think the alleged conflict does not bring the
case within the condition essentially required by section 1025 of the Criminal
Code. The wording of the section is that the conflict must be “with the judgment
of any other court of appeal.” In my view, those words used without
qualification in a Canadian statute mean any other Canadian court of appeal.
When the legislature of this country uses language of that kind it must be
taken to refer to courts within its jurisdiction, and not to courts outside the
Canadian territory. (Jeffrys v. Boosey [2]; Cooke v. Charles A. Vogeler
& Company[3]. It is
to no purpose to argue that criminal courts in Canada may, and possibly will,
follow the decisions of the English courts of criminal appeal. The whole
question here is what parliament is presumed to have intended when referring to
“any other court of appeal” in section 1025 of the Canadian Criminal Code; and
I think the principle is that general words in a statute refer only to persons
or things within the territory, unless the con intention is shewn.

In addition to the rule just stated, we have in
section 1012 of the code the legislative interpretation of the words in
question precisely for that part of the Criminal Code

[Page 160]

dealing with appeals from convictions on
indictments. Under subsection (b) of section 1012,

“court of appeal” means the court
designated by paragraph (7) of section. 2 of this Act (i.e., the code) as the
court of appeal from the province in which the conviction or indictment was
had.

Paragraph 7 of section 2 just mentioned is an
enumeration of the courts of the several provinces of Canada which are stated
to be included in the expression “court of appeal.”

The evident intention of Parliament in enacting
section. 1025 was to insure uniformity in the administration of criminal law by
the courts of Canada. Bearing that in mind, the expression “any other court of
appeal” should, I think, be interpreted as meaning any other court of appeal to
which “a like case” may be brought under the Canadian Criminal Code, and
therefore: any other court of appeal in Canada.

I have, for these reasons, reached the
conclusion that the petitioner does not allege nor show a conflict between the
courts of appeal contemplated by section 1025 of the Criminal Code, and that
this is not a case where I have jurisdiction under that section to grant leave
to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.

The petitioner relied, of course, on the
decision in Brunet v. The
King[4], where
special leave was granted in not dissimilar circumstances. It will be seen,
however, that when the case came before the full court (including the learned
judge who granted leave), the court took particular care to state (Brunet v. The King)[5], that it was not. “passing on the question
of whether or not this is an appealable matter, even with leave.”

For that reason, I feel that I am at liberty to
decide as above. If I am wrong the appellant may yet find relief by asking the
full court to revise my decision. (In re Sproule[6]; The Industrial Acceptance Corporation v.
Canada Permanent Trust Company[7].

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Practice and procedure—Jury
trial—Charge of the trial judge—Misdirection—Sworn statement by stenographer
conflicting with report of the judge—Section 1020 Cr. C.

The appellant, having been convicted of the
crime of rape and condemned to fifteen years imprisonment and lashes, appealed
to the court of appeal principally on the ground that the trial judge had erred
in his

[Page 195]

instructions given to the jury. In the record
were the notes of the stenographer at the trial who certified, under oath, to
the delivery of a charge by the trial judge which, as reported by him,
contained a clear misdirection. The appellate court, having determined that, on
the stenographic transcription, the appeal should be allowed, directed that a
report be furnished by the trial judge in accordance with section 1020 Cr. C.
The trial judge then prepared, two or three months after the trial, a
certificate containing a number of statements made by him in answer to a
corresponding number of objections to his charge which formed the grounds of
appeal and stating, according to his recollection, that in fact his direction
was precisely the contrary of that reported.

Held that such
certificate of the trial judge was not a report within section 1020 Cr. C.: it
did not contain the judge’s “notes of the trial” nor was it a “report giving
his opinion upon the case or upon any point arising in the case”; and,
therefore, the court being left with nothing authentic and regularly before the
court to establish that the charge was not as reported, the appellant was
clearly entitled to a new trial. Section 1020 Cr. C. apparently contemplates
that the judge or the magistrate should furnish “his notes of the trial” or his
report immediately after the trial, or at least, so soon as an appeal is
lodged; and it was never intended by this section to enable the trial judge,
after an appeal had been argued, to put before the court of appeal, by way of
certificate or otherwise, whether proprio motu or by direction of the
court of appeal, his answer to the various points taken upon the appeal.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the conviction of the
appellant for the crime of rape.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment
now reported.

C. Bourgeois K.C. for the appellant.

P. Bigué K.C. and Laetare Roy K.C. for
the respondent.

At the close of the arguments by counsel for the
appellant and for the respondent, the judgment of the court was orally
delivered by

Anglin C.J.C.—We regard this as a case of the utmost importance. A
conviction for the crime of rape is always a serious matter. In the present
case it is more than ordinarily so because the penalty imposed is fifteen years
imprisonment and lashes.

[Page 196]

It is the aim of this court, as of all courts of
law, to do justice,—not abstract justice, but justice according to law.
Elementary justice seems to require that a conviction for a serious crime
should not stand if it may have been based on illegal evidence.

In criminal matters, under s. 1014 of the Code,
the court of appeal may set aside a conviction, if of the opinion “that on any
ground there was a miscarriage of justice.” This power might well have been
exercised here having regard to the charge as a whole. But, our jurisdiction is
much more restricted. Under s. 1023 we can entertain an appeal only

against the affirmance of (a)
conviction on any question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court
of Appeal.

The present case has some most unpleasant
aspects. A stenographer of repute has certified, under oath, to the delivery of
a charge by the trial judge which, as reported by him, contains a clear
misdirection. The learned trial judge, as reported, told the jury that a
statement of the complainant to her aunt, which was admissible only to show the
consistency of her conduct, in itself amounted to distinct evidence of the
guilt of the accused.

On the other hand, we have also before us a
statement or certificate, furnished by the trial judge under direction of the
Court of King’s Bench, in which he says his direction was not as so reported,
but precisely the contrary. This is relied upon by the Crown as a report under
s. 1020 of the Criminal Code, and it is contended that effect must be given to
it and the stenographer’s transcription ignored.

Were the certificate of the trial judge before
us really a report made in conformity with s. 1020 of the Criminal Code, the
case would present greater difficulty and it may be that effect would have to
be given to it. But, as we read s. 1020, the certificate of the trial judge now
before us, which consists in a number of statements made by him in answer to a
corresponding number of objections to his charge, which formed the grounds of
appeal, and was prepared by him some two or three months after the trial and
after the argument of the appeal in the Court of King’s Bench—indeed, counsel
assure us, after that court had determined that, on the stenographic
transcription, the appeal before it must be allowed,—is not such a report as

[Page 197]

s. 1020 contemplates. It certainly does not
contain the learned judge’s “notes of the trial”; nor is it a “report giving
his opinion upon the case or upon any point arising in the case.”

S. 1020 provides that, as part of the material
to be put before the court of appeal, the trial judge or magistrate shall
furnish to the court “his notes of the trial” and shall also send “a report
giving his opinion upon the case or upon any point arising in the case” and
apparently contemplates this being done immediately after the trial, or at
least, so soon as an appeal is lodged. It was never intended by this section to
enable the trial judge, after an appeal had been argued, to put before the
court of appeal by way of certificate or otherwise, whether proprio motu or
by direction of the court of appeal, his answer to the various points taken
upon the appeal. That, in substance, is what has been done in this case. We
cannot regard such a certificate of the trial judge as having been properly
given, nor as a report within s. 1020. That being so, we are left with nothing
authentic and regularly before the court to establish that the charge was not
what the stenographic transcription shews; and upon that, as already stated,
the misdirection is so plain and so fatal in its consequences that a new trial
is inevitable. Justice requires that a conviction where there is such grave
uncertainty as to the propriety of the direction under which it was made should
not be allowed to stand.

That such uncertainty exists in this case is
obvious, since, against the accuracy of the note made at the moment of
utterance by a careful, sworn stenographer, acting in the discharge of his
usual functions, there is nothing but the recollection by a judge, however
eminent and careful, of the precise language used by him some two or three
months before.

This case is most exceptional. We trust such
circumstances will not again arise; and the present decision can be relied upon
only in a case which is on all fours with that before us.

The conviction will accordingly be set aside and
a new trial had.

Appeal allowed.

Per Rinfret J.—Under section 654 of the Criminal Code,
any person, upon reasonable or probable grounds, may make a complaint or lay an
information against an accused person in respect of the offences, relating to
illicit distilling, mentioned in section 176 of the Excise Act; but even
if it should be inferred from the provisions of that Act taken as a whole that
officers of excise alone were competent to lay such information, it would not
be necessary, though perhaps desirable, to specify particulars of the informant
in the warrant of commitment. Moreover, the information laid against some of
the applicants, which describes the informant, as a customs and excise officer
acting "" on behalf of His Majesty the King "" was quite sufficient to
justify the magistrate in proceeding with the trial. R. v. Limerick
(37 C.C.C. 344) and R. v. Ed. (47 C.C.C. 196) dist.

Per Rinfret J.—On an application for habeas corpus,
a contention by the petitioner that no proof of the authority of the informant
was adduced at the trial does not raise a question of jurisdiction: if the
judge before whom the application is made is right in his view that the
magistrate had the right to enter on, and proceed with, the case, he had not to
consider the sufficiency of the evidence on which the former was convicted. R.
v. Nat Bell Liquors ([1922] 2 A.C. 128, at pp. 151, 152) foll.

 [Page 46]

Per Rinfret J. Under sections 127 and 128 of the Excise
Act, a magistrate has the power both to imprison and fine the accused by
summary conviction and is not restricted to impose one penalty to the exclusion
of the other.

Per Rinfret J.—When the order of imprisonment is
absolute for a term and a further term is imposed in default of payment of a
fine and costs, the conviction and commitment of the inferior tribunal are
severable. Therefore, when a petitioner urges, as a ground for the issue of a
writ of habeas corpus, the illegality of the part dealing with the
further imprisonment, such application is premature before the expiration of
the term for which the conviction imposed an absolute order of imprisonment; up
to that time, the applicant cannot complain that he is illegally restrained of
his liberty.

Per Rinfret J.—Where a warrant of commitment contains a
valid order of imprisonment and also an order imposing a lighter fine than the
minimum imposed by the statute, this order being illegal, the portion providing
for imprisonment is nevertheless valid; and the illegal order can still be
remedied by applying the provisions of sections 754 and 1125 of the Criminal
Code.

Per Rinfret J.—A warrant of commitment requiring the
payment of the costs of conveying the accused to jail is not invalid for
failure to state the amount of these costs.

Per Rinfret J.—The word "" penalties "" in par.
2 of s. 4 of the Opium and Narcotic Drugs Act means the imprisonment and
the fine and does not include the costs. Therefore, a condemnation to a fine of
"" two hundred dollars"" will not be invalid as being a lighter fine
than the minimum ($200 and costs), imposed by section 4, par. (d) (b)2(?)
of that section. Moreover, nothing in the Act compels the magistrate to award
costs; and in such a case, section 735 of the Criminal Code, under which the
costs are in the discretion of the magistrate, would apply.

The judgments of Rinfret J.,
in chambers, rendered upon these four applications for habeas corpus,
were, on appeal, affirmed by the Court,

Held, that, in the cases of Henderson, Broder and Joe Go
Get, the warrant of commitment shewed a valid conviction, and even assuming it
to be defective because the amount of the costs is not stated, that would not
be a ground for discharging the prisoners on habeas corpus: Section
1121, Criminal Code.

Held, also, that, in the Stewart case, assuming the
defects alleged on behalf of the prisoner, he is not at present held under any
of the defective clauses, and the application is at best premature.

APPEAL from the judgments of
Rinfret J. dismissing petitions for a writ of habeas corpus.

The material facts, and the
grounds of the petitions are sufficiently set out in the judgments of Rinfret
J. now reported.

The appeal from the judgments was
dismissed.

The petitions were heard by
Rinfret J. on June 4, 1929.

[Page 47]

Stuart Henderson for the
applicants.

E. F. Newcombe K.C. for the Attorney-General for British Columbia.

P. D. Wilson, for the Minister of Justice and the Minister of
National Revenue.

On June 5, 1929, Rinfret J. gave
judgment as follows:

RINFRET J.:—

In re John Henderson.

In re John George Broder.

The applicant Henderson complains
that he is illegally detained in custody in Oakalla Prison Farm, a common gaol
for the county of Vancouver,
and prays for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus directed to W. G.
McMynn, the warden of the prison, and for his subsequent discharge.

The same relief has already been
refused by the late Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and
by Mr. Justice W. A. Macdonald, a judge of the same province[1].

According to the warrant of
commitment by reason of which he is held prisoner, Henderson was
convicted before H. O. Alexander, a stipendiary magistrate in and for the county of
Vancouver, for that he,

on December 5, 1928, at
Pocahontas Bay, in the county of Vancouver, unlawfully, without having a
licence under the Excise Act then in force, did have in his possession a still
suitable for the manufacture of spirits, without having given notice thereof as
required by the Excise Act, such still not having been a duly registered
chemical still of capacity not exceeding three gallons, as provided for in the
Excise Act, contrary to the form of statute in such case made and provided

and he was adjudged

to be imprisoned in the
common gaol for the said county of Vancouver at
Oakalla Prison farm, Burnaby, in the county of Westminster, in the province of British
  Columbia, for the term of twelve
months,

and also that he shall

forfeit and pay the sum of
five hundred dollars ($500) to be paid and applied according to law and, in
default of payment of the said sum of $500, that he should be imprisoned in the
said common gaol for the county of Vancouver in the county of Westminster for a
further term of six months unless the said sum of $500 and the costs and
charges of conveying (him) to the said common gaol should be sooner paid.

[Page 48]

The warrant commanded the
constables or peace officers in the county of Vancouver to take and convey Henderson 

to the common gaol at
Oakalla Prison Farm aforesaid and there to deliver him to the said keeper
thereof, together with this precept;

and commanded the keeper to
receive Henderson

into (his) custody in the
said common gaol and there to imprison him for the term of twelve months.

The warrant further commanded the
keeper to imprison Henderson

for the further term of six
months to commence at the expiration of the said term of twelve months awarded
by the sentence above set out unless the said sum of $500 and the costs and
charges of the commitment and of the conveying of the said Henderson *** to the
said gaol are sooner paid unto the said keeper or until he shall be otherwise
discharged in due course of law.

The application is based on a
number of grounds and I will endeavour to consider and determine them in the
order in which they are submitted to me:

1. The trial magistrate is
alleged to have been

without jurisdiction to try
the case and to take proceedings on the information sworn or to act thereon

because the informer

did not swear that he was an
excise officer or acting under instructions from the Minister of National
Revenue, and the proceedings were void ab initio, as no averment is
sufficient in excise cases.

There is authority in this court for
the proposition that, on the return of a writ of habeas corpus, the only
consideration which can be entered upon by a judge of the Supreme Court of
Canada is the sufficiency of the commitment. (In re Trépanier[2];
In re Sproule[3];
Ex parte McDonald[4].

In this case, however, the
applicant further complains that the magistrate neglected

to show in the warrant and
conviction that the proceeding by summary conviction was by virtue of the
authority of the Minister of National Revenue, Department of Excise, ss. 133
and 134 of the Excise Act.

And, in addition to a copy of the
warrant of commitment, the petitioner has filed before me, without objection
from the Crown, copies of the conviction, of the information and other papers
accompanied by an affidavit, to show the alleged want of jurisdiction.

[Page 49]

I find nothing in sections 133
and 134 of the Excise Act to the effect that the commitment must show
the proceedings to have been held

by virtue of the authority
of the Minister of National Revenue, Department of Excise.

The offence, of which Henderson
is stated in the warrant to have been convicted, is covered by s. 176 (e)
of the Excise Act where it is declared to be an indictable offence,
(although by force of section 127 of the Act, the penalty or forfeiture and the
punishment may be sued for and recovered or imposed by summary conviction). The
offence is not in terms one which is only cognizable upon the information of a
specified class of persons. All provisions of the criminal code relating to
indictable offences apply to it (see Interpretation Act, c. 1 of R.S.C.
1927). It may therefore be argued with great force that anyone, upon reasonable
or probable grounds, may make a complaint or layan information against an
accused person in respect of such offence. (Crim. Code, s. 654). There are
sections of the Excise Act giving special powers to inspectors and
officers appointed under it for the purposes of entry into buildings, or into
the premises of any dealer, of inspection and examination of apparatus, works,
stills, etc.; also, under the authority of a writ of assistance, for the
purpose of searching for, seizing and securing goods or things liable to
forfeiture under the Act and of arresting and detaining any person whom they
detect in the commission of any offence against the provisions of the Act. No
powers are stated to be required to lay an information in respect of an offence
under s. 176; and counsel for the petitioner was unable to point to any section
of the Act having that effect.

Should we, however, infer from
the provisions of the Excise Act taken as a whole that officers of
excise alone are competent to lay informations concerning offences against
section 176, even then it is not necessary, though perhaps desirable, to
specify particulars of the informant in the warrant of commitment (Paley on
Summary Convietions, 9th ed. p. 470). This would dispose of the argument that
the authority of the informant is not shown in the warrant of commitment.

Assuming however that ""for
the purpose of an inquiry into the case of commitment"" (which is the
extent of my

[Page 50]

jurisdiction under s. 62 of the Supreme
Court Act) I should go behind the warrant, I find in the information laid
against Henderson, and of which he himself filed a copy before me,
that the informant is therein described as a customs and excise officer acting
"" on behalf of His Majesty the King "". The information was taken and
sworn before the stipendiary magistrate and, in my view, the oath of the
informant covered the particulars relating to his capacity and authority to
act. This was quite sufficient (Crim. Code 1128) to justify the magistrate in
proceeding with the trial, even if it be true that only an officer of excise
could lay the information.

I will say nothing of the fact
that, admittedly, this point was not taken at the trial.

I am not overlooking the
decisions in Rex v. Limerick[5], and Rex v. Ed.[6]
In addition to what I have already said upon the points which they cover, I may
add that neither case was an application for habeas corpus. Rex v. Limerick[7]
was a proceeding for the enforcement of the Inland Revenue Act and was
before the court on an order for certiorari. It was there made to appear
that the informant was not an officer of the department of Inland Revenue and,
at the hearing, the magistrate's jurisdiction had been challenged. In Rex v.
Ed[8],
a case was stated for the opinion of the court after the appellant was found
guilty in a prosecution under the Income War Tax Act, and 

as stated by the magistrate,
it was not alleged in the information or shown in the evidence before him that
(the informant) was authorized by the Finance Department or any other
department of the Government to lay the information or otherwise to enforce the
provisions of the Income War Tax Act (Rex v. Ed.[9]
).

Both cases are distinguishable
from the present one.

As to the contention that no
proof of the authority of the informant was adduced at the trial, I would say
that it does not raise the question of jurisdiction. If I am right in my view
that the magistrate had the right to enter on the case, I am not to consider
the sufficiency of the evidence on which he convicted. (In re Trépanier[10].
In the words of Lord Sumner, re Rex v. Nat. Bell Liquors[11],

[Page 51]

A justice who convicts
without evidence is doing something that he ought not to do, but he is doing it
as a judge, and if his jurisdiction to entertain the charge is not open to
impeachment, his subsequent error, however grave, is a wrong exercise of a
jurisdiction which he has, and not a usurpation of a jurisdiction which he has
not ***. To say that there is no jurisdiction to convict without evidence is
the same as saying that there is jurisdiction if the decision is right, and
none if it is wrong; or that jurisdiction at the outset of a case continues so
long as the decision stands, but that, if it is set aside, the real conclusion
is that there never was jurisdiction.

For all these reasons the
petitioner fails on the first ground of his application.

2. The second ground may be
stated as follows: The information was first laid before P. C. Parker,
stipendiary magistrate. It was afterwards withdrawn and a new information was
laid before H. O. Alexander, another stipendiary magistrate whose jurisdiction,
so it is contended, was barred by sections 85 (4) and 129 of the Excise Act.

Section 85 must be disregarded.
It has no application to this case, which is not a prosecution under its
provisions, but, as already stated, a proceeding by summary conviction under
sections 176 and 127 of the Act (as amended by c. 24 of 18-19 Geo. V).

Section 129 reads as follows:

129. If any prosecution in
respect of an offence against any provision of this Act is brought before a
judge of a county court, or before a police or stipendiary magistrate, or
before any two justices of the peace, no other justice of the peace shall sit
or take part therein: Provided, however, that in any city or district in which
there are more than one judge of a county court, or more than one police or
stipendiary magistrate, such prosecution may be tried before any one of such
judges or police or stipendiary magistrates.

It is not disputed that
Alexander, the stipendiary magistrate who tried the case, found the conviction
and signed the commitment, had jurisdiction territorially and otherwise to try
a case of this kind, but it is contended that he could "" not sit or take
part therein "", because the prosecution was brought first before P. C.
Parker.

On the facts as stated, section
129 does not apply. The information laid before Parker having been withdrawn,
Alexander cannot be said to have sat or taken part in a prosecution brought
before Parker. But whatever the facts may have been, they are not apparent on
the face of the warrant of commitment and, under the well settled jurisprudence
of this court referred to in Ex parte McDonald[12]

[Page 52]

my jurisdiction in the present
case ""is limited to an inquiry into the cause of commitment, that is, as
disclosed by the warrant of commitment"".

The second ground of attack
cannot therefore be entertained by me.

3. As a third ground for the
application, it is contended that the magistrate

had no power to imprison and
fine by summary conviction, but that he could only do one or the other.

Sections 127 and 128 of the Excise
Act afford a complete answer to this contention. The offence of Henderson
must be taken to have been his first offence, inasmuch as the commitment does
not shew otherwise. Under section 176, the penalty for a first offence is

a penalty not exceeding
$2,000 and not less than $200 and to imprisonment, with or without hard labour,
for a term not exceeding twelve months and not less than one month, and, in
default of payment of the penalty, to a further term of imprisonment not
exceeding twelve months and not less than six months.

Section 127 (as amended by c. 24 of
18-19 Geo. V.) reads in part as follows:

127. (1) Every penalty or
forfeiture incurred and any punishment for any offence against the provisions
of this Act, or any other law relating to excise, may be sued for and
recovered, or may be imposed (a) before the Exchequer Court of Canada or
any court of record having jurisdiction in the premises; or (b) if the
amount or value of such penalty or forfeiture does not exceed five thousand
dollars and such punishment does not exceed twelve months imprisonment with
hard labour, whether the offence in respect of which it has been incurred is
declared by this Act to be an indictable offence or not, by summary conviction,
under the provisions of the Criminal Code relating thereto, before a judge of a
county court, or before a police or stipendiary magistrate, or any two justices
of the peace having jurisdiction in the place where the cause of prosecution
arises, or wherein the defendant is served with process.

*****

(3) Any such pecuniary
penalty may, if not forthwith paid, be levied by distress and sale of goods and
chattels of the offender, under the warrant of the court, judge, magistrate, or
justices having cognizance of the case; or the said court, judge, magistrate,
or justices may, in its or their discretion, commit the offender to the common
gaol for a period not exceeding twelve months, unless the penalty and costs,
including those of conveying the offender to such gaol and stated in the
warrant of committal, are sooner paid.

Section 128 reads:

128. Any term of imprisonment
imposed for any offence against the provisions of this Act, whether in
conjunction with a pecuniary penalty or not, may be adjudged and ordered

(a) by the Exchequer
Court of Canada, or any court of record having jurisdiction in the premises; or

[Page 53]

(b) if such term of
imprisonment does not exceed twelve months, exclusive of any term of
imprisonment which may be adjudged or ordered for non-payment of any pecuniary
penalty, whether the offence in respect of which the liability to imprisonment
has been incurred is declared by this Act to be an indictable offence or not,
by summary conviction under the provisions of the Criminal Code relating
thereto by a judge of a county court, or by a police or stipendiary magistrate,
or any two justices of the peace having jurisdiction in the place where the
cause of prosecution arises, or wherein the defendant is served with process.

As will have been noticed,
section 127 alone was sufficient in this case to found jurisdiction in the
stipendiary magistrate; and section 128 applies when the term of imprisonment
is imposed "" whether in conjunction with a pecuniary penalty or not.""

4. The next contention in support
of the application is that the warrant of commitment is bad

in neglecting to state where
the defendant was found or the cause of prosecution arises.

The warrant states

that the said John Henderson
*** on December 5, 1928, at Pocahontas
 Bay, in the county of Vancouver, unlawfully *** did have in his
possession a still, etc.

H. O. Alexander, before whom Henderson was
found guilty and was convicted, is "" a stipendiary magistrate in and for
the said county of Vancouver.""
The jurisdiction appears on the face of the proceedings. Moreover, courts would
take judicial notice of the "" local divisions of their country.""
(Taylor on Evidence, 10th ed., 17; Sleeth v. Hurlbert[13].)

Nor was it necessary, as urged by
counsel, that, at the time of the arrest, Henderson should have the still in his own actual possession
at Pocahontas Bay. Having possession includes as well having in
the custody of any other person or having in any place for the benefit or use
of one's self or of any other person (Criminal Code, s. 5).

5. Then it is contended that the
warrant is bad, ""by neglecting to show to whom the fine is to be
paid,"" the words used being: "" to be paid and applied according to
law.""

The warrant shews that Henderson
is condemned to an imprisonment of twelve months and also to a fine of $500,
and to a further imprisonment of six months unless the said sum of $500 ""
should be sooner paid."" The further term of six months is

[Page 54]

to commence at the
expiration of the said term of twelve months awarded by the sentence above set
out unless the said sum of $500 and the costs and charges of the commitment and
of the conveying *** to the said jail are sooner paid unto *** the said keeper.

To avoid further imprisonment, Henderson
knows from the warrant that he must pay to the keeper. Assuming that he is
concerned with the subsequent appropriation of the fine, s.s. 133 and 134 of the
Excise Act make a complete and determinate disposal of it. If they did
not, art. 1036 of the Criminal Code would apply. So that the judgment can be
unequivocally carried into effect by reference to the Act alone (R. v. Seal
[14]).

6. The last objection taken by
the petitioner is as to the question of costs. It is urged by him

that the conviction and
warrant do not comply with the statutes in regard to "" costs of conveying
to gaol "" or costs of "" commitment.""

Under s. 127 of the Excise
Act, the magistrate could

commit the offender to the
common gaol for a period not exceeding 12 months, unless the penalty and costs,
including those of conveying the offender to such gaol and stated in the
warrant of committal are sooner paid.

The adjudication in the warrant
now before me, in default of payment of the fine of $500, is that Henderson
should be imprisoned

for a further term of six
months unless the said sum of $500 and the costs and charges of conveying (him)
to the said common gaol should be sooner paid.

Then, in the operative part of
the warrant, the keeper is commanded to imprison him for the further  term of
six months *** unless the said sum of $500 and the costs of the commitment and
of the conveying *** to the said gaol are sooner paid unto *** the said keeper.


But the further term of six
months is to commence (only)

at the expiration of the
said term of twelve months awarded by the sentence.

Henderson complains that:

(a) The costs of
commitment were not adjudged against him and that yet, under the warrant, he
will have to remain six months in prison, unless he pays them.

(b) The amount of the
costs which he must pay is not stated in the commitment.

Henderson was validly convicted on the 5th January, 1929. It was
then validly adjudged, for the offence of which he was legally found guilty,
that he should be im-

[Page 55]

prisoned for the term of twelve
months. It is not disputed that the punishment is perfectly good under the
statute. The term of twelve months will expire only on the 5th day of January,
1930. Until then he cannot complain that he is illegally restrained of his
liberty, nor kept in illegal confinement. The warrant of commitment is
sufficient for the keeper to retain him in gaol until the expiration of the
term of twelve months for which the conviction imposed an absolute order of
imprisonment.

Where the order of imprisonment
is absolute for a term and a further term is imposed in default of payment of a
fine and costs, the conviction and commitment of an inferior tribunal are
severable. This proposition has now been accepted by our courts. The court of
appeal for Ontario in The King v. Carlisle[15];
the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) of Quebec in La Commission des
Liqueurs de Québec v. Forcade[16];
and the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Rex v. Fox [17];
to which may be added the opinion of Mr. Justice Beck of the Court of Appeal
for Alberta in Rex v. Miller [18]. I see
no reason to differ from these judgments.

Paley on Summary convictions (8th
ed. at p. 201) admits that an order is divisible and "" may be quashed in
part "", and, as said in Rex v. Robinson[19],
quoted by Mr. Justice W. A. Macdonald in his judgment on a similar application[20],

there is no reason worthy of
the name to be found in the books why there should be any distinction in this
respect between an order and a conviction.

I therefore think that, so far as
concerns that portion of the warrant of commitment dealing with further
imprisonment in default of payment of fine and costs, the application is
premature. I do not want however to be understood as meaning that that part of
the commitment is invalid. The writ of habeas corpus is a prerogative
process available when "" there is a deprivation of personal liberty
without legal justification "" (Halsbury, Laws of England, vol. 10, p. 48).
Courts should not permit the use of this great writ to free criminals on mere
technicalities. It is

[Page 56]

the spirit of our Criminal Laws
and more particularly of our law on summary convictions that defects and
informalities be corrected so as "" to prevent a denial of justice ""
(Crim. Code 723, 753, 754, 1120, 1124, 1125 and 1129).

I have been referred to a number
of judgments holding a warrant of commitment invalid because it required
payment of conveyance to gaol and it did not state the amount of those costs. I
have noticed that none of the learned judges who have so decided took the
trouble of telling us at the same time how the magistrate, so as to insert the
amount in the warrant, could determine in advance the costs of conveyance. I
fully agree with what is said on that point by Murphy J. in Rex v. Wong[21].
A proper method—and there should be others—for the determination of those costs
is set out in Poulin v. City of Quebec[22]
where Sir François Lemieux, at page 392, decides as follows:

By this petition for habeas
corpus (the petitioner) demands to be discharged on two main grounds, *** ;

secondly, because the
conviction should have stated the amount of conveying the petitioner to gaol.

This last ground is without
foundation.

The condemnation for the
costs includes the cost of conveyance, and these expenses, contrary to the
claim of the petitioner, should not, and could not, be included in the
conviction.

When the law permits
conviction for costs, it includes, not only the costs of the prosecution but
also those of carrying out the judgment of the conviction.

It is impossible for the
magistrate or the Recorder's Court, and it is not in a position to fix and
determine in advance the cost of conveyance. These costs are, or should be,
stated or certified by the officer who executes the commitment upon the back of
the commitment, which is the general practice and which was done in this very
case. The certificate authorizes the jailer to require payment of the amount if
the offender desires to be discharged from gaol.

In this case, I have, for the
above reasons, come to the conclusion that the objections fail to support the
application for the prisoner's release and the said application will therefore
be dismissed.

In the case of George Broder, the
conviction and the warrant of commitment are identical and for a similar
offence; the application is based on exactly the same grounds as that of John
Henderson and it will accordingly be dismissed for the same reasons.

[Page 57]

In re James Stewart

This is an application for habeas
corpus by James Stewart, formerly of the city of Vancouver and
at present imprisoned at Oakalla Prison Farm, Burnaby, county of
Westminster, province of British Columbia.

The offence for which Stewart was
convicted, the conviction and the warrant of commitment are similar to those in
the cases of John Henderson and George Broder. The grounds of the application
are the same, except one which I shall state presently. For the reasons already
given in dismissing the petitions of Henderson and Broder, to which I refer the
parties and their counsel, I think the similar objections raised in this case
fail to support the application for Stewart's release.

The other ground, which was
available neither to Henderson, nor to Broder, consists in the following:

It was adjudged by the
conviction, as appears by the warrant of commitment, that Stewart should be
imprisoned for the term of six months, and it was also adjudged that he should
forfeit and pay the sum of $100 to be paid and applied according to law; and it
was further adjudged that, in default of payment of the said sum, Stewart
should be imprisoned

for a further term of two
months, unless the said sum of $100 and the costs and charges of conveying
(him) to the said common gaol should be sooner paid.

The operative part of the warrant
of commitment is in the same terms, except that the keeper is commanded also to
exact "" the costs and charges of the commitment"", in addition to
those "" of the conveying "", before he discharges the prisoner.

Under section 176 (d) of the Excise
Act, the offence of which Stewart was found guilty is an indictable offence
(though triable by summary conviction-s. 127) and made him liable to a penalty

not exceeding $2,000, and
not less than two hundred dollars, and to imprisonment, with or without hard
labour, for a term not exceeding twelve months and not less than one month,
and, in default of payment of the penalty, to a further term of imprisonment
not exceeding twelve months and not less than six months.

As will have been perceived, the
absolute order of imprisonment for a term of six months is within the
limitation contained in the enactment. Stewart is now detained in

[Page 58]

gaol under a perfectly good award
of imprisonment and the commitment, as well as the conviction, is a legal and
sufficient warrant for the gaoler to keep him in prison.

There seems to be no doubt
however that the magistrate had no power to impose less than the minimum fine
or to order imprisonment, in default of payment of fine and cos's, for a term
shorter than prescribed by the statute.

According to the Interpretation
Act (c. 1 of R.S.C. 1927, s. 28)

Every Act shall be read and
construed as if any offence for which the offender may be

(a) prosecuted by
indictment, howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred to,
were described or referred to as an indictable offence;

(b) punishable on
summary conviction, were described or referred to as an offence; and

all provisions of the
Criminal Code relating to indictable offence, or offences, as the case may be,
shall apply to every such offence.

By force of sections 1028 and
1029 of the Criminal Code the magistrate had no discretion to inflict a
punishment or to award a fine or a penalty outside the limitations contained in
s. 176 (e) of the Excise Act. And section 1054 of the same code
provides

that no one shall be
sentenced to any shorter term of imprisonment than the minimum term, if any,
prescribed for the offence of which he is convicted.

I think therefore that the
conviction for a fine of $100 and the adjudication of imprisonment for a
further term of two months, in default of payment of the fine and costs, were
bad and illegal.

Had Stewart, at the present time,
been kept in gaol because of his failure to pay the fine of $100 and costs, I
would not however have maintained the writ of habeas corpus. Applying
section 1120 of the Criminal Code, I would have made an order for the further
detention of Stewart and have directed the magistrate, under whose warrant he
is in custody,

to do such further act as
*** may best further the ends of justice.

And it may not be out of place to
draw the attention of the petitioner to the fact that by s. 1125 of the
Criminal Code,

the punishment imposed being
less than the punishment by law assigned to the offence stated in the
conviction or order

is treated as an irregularity
which may be dealt with in all respects as the court may do upon appeal under
section

[Page 59]

754 of the Code. Section 1125 has
reference to convictions removed by certiorari, but there is no apparent
reason why an order to a similar effect could not be made on habeas corpus
under s. 1120 of the code.

I am not however so deciding. In
my reasons for judgment on the similar petitions of John Henderson and George
Broder, I have explained why I thought that the conviction as made in this case
was severable. It consists first in an absolute order for the payment of a
fine. By the terms of the conviction and of the warrant, the term of two
months, in default of payment of the fine, is "" to commence (only) at the
expiration of "" the absolute term of imprisonment of six months. The
conviction and warrant are dated the 5th day of January, 1929. The six months
will expire only on the 5th day of July. In the meantime and at present a valid
case of detention is shewn, the petitioner is legally in gaol and he cannot
succeed in his present application. The application is therefore dismissed.

In re Joe Go Get

Joe Go Get, was, on the 23rd
January, 1929, convicted before Thos. McClymont, a police magistrate, for that
he

did have in his possession a
drug, to wit prepared opium, without lawful authority, contrary to the
provisions of section 4 (d) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act,
1923, and amendments thereto.

He was adjudged to be imprisoned
for the term of six months. He was also adjudged to forfeit and pay the sum of
$200, and he was further adjudged, if the said sum was not sooner paid, to be
imprisoned

for the additional space of
three months to commence at and from the expiration of the term of imprisonment
aforesaid.

Joe Go Get was imprisoned under a
warrant of commitment reciting the above conviction and now applies for his
release from custody by habeas corpus. He says his conviction, as
appears by the commitment, is incomplete and in improper form and contrary to
the Opium and Narcotic Act because:

1. The penalty imposed is less
than the minimum penalty which may be awarded under the Act.

2. There is no adjudication as to
costs, which is necessary in such an offence.

3. The conviction and warrant of
commitment do not "" provide for costs and charges of commitment.""

[Page 60]

The offence of which Joe Go Get
was found guilty is covered by section 4 (d) of the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act, which made him liable

upon summary conviction, to
imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding eighteen
months

and not less than six months, and
to a fine not exceeding

one thousand dollars and
costs and not less than two hundred dollars and coss.

Then paragraph 2 of section 4
says:

2. Notwithstanding the
provisions of the Criminal Code, or of any other statute or law, the court
shall have no power to impose less than the minimum penalties herein
prescribed, and shall, in all cases of conviction, impose both fine and
imprisonment; * * *

In the present case, no objection
is taken to the absolute term of imprisonment imposed, but the sum ordered to
be forfeited and paid as a fine is only two hundred dollars, and it is argued
that this was illegal and outside the jurisdiction of the magistrate because,
under the Act, the fine may not be less than two hundred dollars and costs. The
conclusion would be that either a fine for the minimum amount without costs is
below the penalty imperatively prescribed or that the conviction is bad because
it contains no adjudication as to costs.

I do not so understand the
statute, and I read it as Murphy J. did in Rex v. Wong Yet [23].

Section 4 (2) of the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act must be applied

notwithstanding the
provision of the Criminal Code, or of any other statute or law.

For the determination of this
objection, I must therefore look only to the provisions of the Act. The Act
says that

the court shall have no
power to impose less than the minimum penalties herein prescribed.

I think the word "" penalties
"" means the fine and the imprisonment and does not include the costs. The
magistrate

shall, in all cases of
conviction, impose both fine and imprisonment.

He may not impose a fine alone,
or an imprisonment alone. He must not impose a term of imprisonment or a fine
outside the limitations contained in the enactment, but the costs remain in his
discretion. Applying this interpretation to the wording of the relevant section
4d (b), I would say that the magistrate could, as he has done in this case,
impose a fine of $200, without speaking of the costs. The

[Page 61]

words "" not less than ""
in the section apply to the "" fine "" only; and the "" fine ""
does not comprise "" the costs."" This is shown by section twelve of
the Act, whereby when "" the conviction adjudges payment of a
fine,"" the sentence may direct that in default of payment of the fine

and costs, the person so convicted shall be imprisoned until
such fine and costs are paid, etc.

The limitation in s. 4 applies
therefore to the penalties, being the imprisonment and the fine, but not to the
total amount of fine and costs. The object of the enactment "" according to
its true intent, meaning and spirit "" is that the minimum fine may be
imposed, outside of the costs.

Nor do I think that an
adjudication as to costs is necessary for such an offence. There is no
provision making it so. The effect of section 4d (b) even were I to put
upon it the construction suggested by counsel for the petitioner, would not be
that costs must be ordered to be paid by the person found guilty, it would be
that the combined amounts of fine and costs may not be less than $200, a result
which to my mind only goes to strengthen the view I have expressed on the first
ground of this application.

Outside of section 4d (b),
no other sections of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act were pointed to me
compelling the magistrate to award costs. In such a case the provisions of the
Criminal Code apply (Interpretation Act, s. 28, c. 1 of R.S.C., 1927).

In summary matters under the
Criminal Code, costs are in the discretion of the magistrate (s. 735) and, as
said by my brother Mr. Justice Duff in the Marino case (22nd August,
1927, not reported), I cannot

assume that the police
magistrate did not judicially consider and pass upon that question.

What I have just said also
applies to the costs and charges of commitment. I may add that I fail to see
what interest the petitioner may have of complaining on habeas corpus
that the warrant of commitment makes no mention whatever of those costs. The
only effect is that he will not have to pay them in order to escape restraint
of liberty.

The application is dismissed
without costs.

The appeal from the above
judgments was heard by the court, composed of four judges (s. 28 (2), Supreme
Court Act), on June 13, 1929.

[Page 62]

Stuart Henderson for the
appellants.

J. A. Ritchie K.C. for the Attorney General for British Columbia.

P. D. Wilson for the Minister of Justice and the Minister of
National Revenue.

On June 14, 1929, the court
delivered its judgment affirming the judgments of Rinfret J.

THE COURT.—In the cases of Henderson,
Broder and Joe Go Get, the warrant of commitment shews a valid conviction, and
even assuming it to be defective because the amount of the costs is not stated,
that would not be a ground for discharging the prisoners on habeas corpus :
Section 1121, Criminal Code. It is not necessary to express any opinion on the
question of severance. The appeals are dismissed.

In the Stewart case, assuming the
defects alleged on behalf of the prisoner, he is not at present held under any
of the defective clauses. The statute clearly contemplates that the proceedings
are not wholly void, for there are curative provisions which, in the meantime,
may be invoked. If these are not available to this court, they may nevertheless
conveniently be resorted to elsewhere, and, in the interests of justice, it
seems right that the Crown should not be deprived of its judicial remedies.

We think therefore that this
application is at best premature, and should be dismissed.

Appeals
dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA IN BANCO

Criminal law—Evidence—Tender of evidence
given on former trial, under Cr. C., s. 999—Admission by accused’s counsel of
“every fact essential to the admission of the evidence” under s. 999—Extent of
admission—Lack of proof that evidence put in was in fact the evidence given at
former trial—Materiality of the evidence as affecting findings against
accused—New trial—Warning to jury where evidence tendered under s. 999 which
was given on former separate trials of persons now tried together.

The appellants were convicted of removing,
and two of them of importing, goods of over $200 in value and liable to
forfeiture, contrary to s. 193 of the Customs Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42.
At their trial the Crown proposed to put in, under s. 999 of the Cr. Code, evidence
given at previous trials (at which the juries had disagreed) by one W. Counsel
for the accused admitted “every fact essential to the admission of the evidence
of [W.] under s. 999 of the Code,” and the evidence offered was put in.

Held: The
admission of counsel, while it rendered unnecessary the establishment of the
various facts required by s. 999 to be proved before the evidence of W. could
have been admitted, did not in any way identify the documents read to the jury
as the evidence given by W. on the former trials; and, there being no proof
that the statements put in were in fact the evidence of W., and there being no
consent that they were, they were wrongly received, and appellants were
entitled to a new trial. The appellant C, convicted of removing but not of
importing, was so entitled, notwithstanding that the depositions put in did not
in terms incriminate him; they were important on the point that the goods in
question were goods liable to forfeiture under the Act; that was an essential
element of the charge and of the proof, and although C. might have been
connected with it only through other evidence, it was not possible to
appreciate how far the depositions on the main charge concerning the character
of the goods imported might have influenced the jury in its findings.

The said previous trials had been, one of the
appellant O. alone, and the other of the other appellants and one P. On the
trial in question, at which said depositions were received, they were all tried
together. One alleged ground for a new trial was that W.’s evidence on either
previous trial was inadmissible against any accused who had not been a
defendant on the previous trial at which it was given. The Court found it
unnecessary to pass upon the point, but remarked that, should similar
circumstances happen at the next trial, and W.’s depositions properly and
legally identified be tendered, it would be most

advisable for the trial judge to warn the jury
that each deposition should be considered as evidence only against the accused
in whose former trial such deposition purported to have been taken.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia in banco, sitting as a Court of Appeal under the
provisions of the Criminal Code, dismissing the appeals of the present
appellants from their convictions for violation of s. 193 of the Customs
Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42.

The three appellants and one Petrie were
tried together before Ross J. with a jury on an indictment containing three
counts, the charges being that they, at Sydney in the County of Cape Breton, on
or about the 3rd September, 1929, did knowingly and unlawfully, and without
lawful excuse, assist, or were otherwise concerned in, (1) unshipping goods,
(2) the importing of goods, (3) landing or removing goods; to wit (in each
case): spirituous liquors over the value of $200 which said goods were liable
to forfeiture under the Customs Act, contrary to the provisions of s.
193, c. 42, R.S.C., 1927, and amendments thereto.

The jury found the appellants McDonald and
O’Hearn guilty on the second count (importing) and all three appellants guilty
on the third count (removing). They found Petrie not guilty. The appellants
were sentenced to terms of imprisonment, Conter for two years under the third
count, and McDonald and O’Hearn for two years under each of the second and
third counts, such sentences to run concurrently. Petrie was acquitted.

It appeared that at a previous sittings of
the court, O’Hearn had been tried alone, and McDonald, Conter and Petrie had
been tried together, and there were disagreements by both juries; that at each
of those trials one Captain Wheeler had given evidence; and that he was now
absent from Canada. At the present trial it was proposed by the prosecution to
put in the evidence given by Captain Wheeler at the previous trials, under s.
999 of the Criminal Code, which reads as follows:

If upon the trial of an accused person such
facts are proved upon oath or affirmation that it can be reasonably inferred
therefrom that any person, whose evidence was given at any former trial upon
the same charge, or whose deposition has been theretofore taken in the
investigation of the charge against such accused person, is dead, or so ill as
not to be able to travel, or is absent from Canada, or if such person refuses
to be sworn

[Page 571]

or to give evidence, and if it is proved that
such evidence was given or such deposition was taken in the presence of the
person accused, and that he or his counsel or solicitor if present had a full
opportunity of cross-examining the witness, then if the evidence or deposition
purports to be signed by the judge or justice before whom the same purports to
have been taken, it shall be read as evidence in the prosecution, without
further proof thereof, unless it is proved that such evidence or deposition was
not in fact signed by the judge or justice purporting to have signed the same.

Counsel for the accused made an admission in
the following form

[Names of counsel] admit every fact essential
to the admission of the evidence of Captain Wheeler under section 999 of the Code.

and the evidence offered was put in.

Appeals taken from the convictions were
dismissed by the Court of Appeal, Mellish and Carroll JJ. dissenting, and,
pursuant to order of the Court, pronouncing separate judgments.

The judgment of the majority of the court was
delivered by Harris C.J. He held that the admission of counsel, on its face and
as understood at the trial, meant that the evidence of Wheeler was to be
admitted against all the defendants; that the authorities show that the consent
of the accused or his counsel is binding in such cases; and the evidence of
Wheeler given on the two previous trials was properly received and binding on
all the defendants. He further stated:

We think it is proper to point out that the
suggestion that the admission of the evidence was only intended to be for the
purpose of making it available as against the particular defendant or
defendants who had been on trial on the previous occasion is not in our opinion
the meaning of the admission which contains no such limitation.

If that view had been maintainable it would
have involved a consideration of various questions and among others as to what
if any difference there was between the evidence of Captain Wheeler in the two
cases and whether or not these differences affected all or any of the issues.
It was strongly argued that these differences were immaterial and it was
pointed out that even if they were material, none of Wheeler’s evidence
affected the question of the guilt, if any, of the accused under the third
count of the indictment. The guilt of all the accused under that count was
clearly established by other evidence and was in no way affected by the admission
of Wheeler’s evidence. This seems to be so, and as the same punishment was
awarded upon each of the convictions to run concurrently it seems to follow
that no injustice would have been done any of the prisoners even if we had
reached a different conclusion as to the effect of the admission of Captain
Wheeler’s evidence.

[Page 572]

Another objection raised was that none of the
evidence taken on the two previous trials purported to be signed by the Judge,
but that objection is obviously covered by the admission of counsel.

The grounds of dissent of Mellish J. were
“that the evidence given by Wheeler in the previous trial of McDonald, Conter
and Petrie was inadmissible in this trial as evidence against O’Hearn,” and
“that the evidence given by Wheeler in the previous trial of O’Hearn was
inadmissible in this trial as against Conter, McDonald and Petrie;” that s. 999
of the Criminal Code is clearly intended to deal with evidence given on
the former trial of the same defendant and the admission of counsel aforesaid
was therefore “wholly insufficient to allow of the reception of evidence taken
on the previous trial of one party as against a different party on a later
trial;” further, that “there is no proof that the statements put in were in
fact the evidence of Captain Wheeler and there is no consent that they were.”
Carroll J. concurred with the reasons of Mellish J., and added some further
reasons, including the ground (in connection with s. 999) that the evidence was
not signed by the judge “before whom the same purports to have been taken;”
that this fact of non-signature, apart from all other considerations, made all
this evidence non-admissible.

By the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Canada, now reported, the appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered as regards
the three appellants.

J. W. Maddin K.C. and M. A. Patterson for
the appellants.

D. A. Cameron K.C. for the respondent.

The Court.—In our opinion one ground upon which the appellants are entitled
to a new trial is that taken by Mellish J., in his dissenting judgment, namely,
that there is no proof that “the statements put in were in fact the evidence of
Captain Wheeler and there is no consent that they were.” The admission of
counsel for the appellants rendered unnecessary the establishment, by the
prosecution, of the various facts required by section 999 of the Code to be
proved before the evidence of Captain Wheeler could have been admitted, but
that admission did not, in any way, identify the document which was read to the
jury, as the evidence given by him on the former trial.

[Page 573]

It is true that the deposition of Captain
Wheeler, as admitted, does not, in terms, incriminate the appellant Conter. The
deposition is, however, very important on the point that the goods which the
appellants were charged with having assisted or having been otherwise concerned
in importing, unshipping, landing or removing were goods liable to forfeiture
under the Customs Act; that was an essential element of the charge and
of the proof, and although Conter may have been connected with it only through
other evidence, it is not possible to appreciate how far the depositions of
Captain Wheeler on the main charge concerning the character of the goods
imported may have influenced the jury in its findings.

Our view on the above point makes it unnecessary
to pass upon the other ground of dissent, to wit: “that the evidence given by
Wheeler in the previous trial of McDonald, Conter and Petrie was inadmissible
in this trial as evidence against O’Hearn” and “that the evidence given by
Wheeler in the previous trial of O’Hearn was inadmissible in this trial as
against Conter, McDonald and Petrie.” We wish only to add that, should similar
circumstances happen at the next trial and Wheeler’s deposition properly and
legally identified be tendered, it would be most advisable for the trial judge
to warn the jury that each deposition should be considered as evidence only
against the accused in whose former trial such deposition purported to have
been taken.

The appeal is allowed and a new trial is ordered
as regards the three appellants.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
  ALBERTA

Criminal law—Charge of robbery with violence—Sufficiency of
evidence to justify conviction—Alleged misdirection in charge to jury.

[Page 143]

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1]
dismissing (Hyndman J.A. dissenting) their appeal from their conviction, at a
trial before Tweedie J. and a jury, of the crime charged against them, namely,
robbery with violence.

The grounds urged on behalf of the appellants on the appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada were:1 that there was no evidence to justify
the conviction of the accused for the crime charged; and (2) that the trial
judge did not properly charge the jury with regard to the evidence of Eva
Rosychuk.

On conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellants,
and without calling on counsel for the respondent, the Court orally delivered
judgment dismissing the appeal; being of opinion that there was evidence
sufficient to warrant the jury in inferring that the accused were guilty of the
crime charged; and that there was no misdirection by the trial judge with
regard to the evidence of the witness Eva Rosychuk; that, while perhaps he did
not go into that evidence as fully as he might have done, yet he went into it
quite as fully as was necessary and described it fairly in what he said of it;
that no wrong was done the accused in this connection.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Evidence—Conviction on charge
of receiving stolen goods—Evidence of statements made by the thieves in
presence of accused——Misdirection in judge’s charge to jury—Contention that no
miscarriage of Justice (Cr. Code, a. 1014 (2)).

The accused was convicted on a charge of
receiving stolen goods, knowing them to have been stolen. At his trial,
evidence was admitted of statements made in his presence by the supposed
thieves to a constable. In charging the jury, the judge referred to these
statements as evidence that might be regarded, but warned them of the danger of
accepting evidence of accomplices without corroboration. On objection by
accused’s counsel to the charge, he recalled the jury and said: “I have already
warned you in this case it would be most dangerous for you to rely on (the
thieves’) evidence as against the prisoner without feeling it was corroborated
in other respects because (of) what they said (when) the prisoner was there. He
did not express any particular assent to it and you should reasonably be bound
by what he did assent to and I think on the whole it is almost worthless
evidence for you.”

Held: The
conviction should be set aside and a new trial ordered, on the ground of
misdirection. It is only when the accused, by “word or conduct, action or
demeanour,” has accepted what they contain, and to the extent that he does so,
that statements made by other persons in his presence have any evidentiary
value; and there was no evidence from which a jury might infer anything in the
nature of an admission by accused of the accuracy of what was incriminating in
the statements in question. The jury should have been told that, in the absence
of any assent by the accused either by word or conduct to the correctness of
the statements, they had no evidentiary value whatever as against him and
should be entirely disregarded. It was impossible to say that there had been no
miscarriage of justice, and apply s. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code; it
may be that sometimes objectionable testimony as to which there has been
misdirection is so unimportant that the court would be justified in taking the
view that in all human probability it could have had no effect upon the jury’s
mind, and, on that ground, in refusing to set aside the verdict (Kelly v.
R. 54 Can. S.C.R. 220); but here, in a most vital matter, the judge had
not only failed to warn the jury to disregard the statements, but had actually
stressed them, in that he in effect told the jury that they were “evidence”
upon which, if corroborated, they might act.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba
(37 Man. R. 367) reversed.

APPEAL on behalf of the accused from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1]
affirming (Fullerton J.A. dissenting) his conviction at trial before Galt J.
with a jury, for the offences of unlawfully receiving and of unlawfully
retaining stolen goods, knowing same to have been stolen.

The grounds of appeal were: insufficiency of
evidence on which a jury could convict, wrongful admission of evidence, and
misdirection in the trial judge’s charge to the jury.

At the trial the Crown called as a witness
one Alexander, a detective, who, in the course of his evidence, deposed that,
after the accused was arrested, he confronted him with the two men (one after
the other) who had been charged with the theft of the goods in question, that
(after giving the usual caution to these men and to the accused) he had
questioned these men in the accused’s presence; and what was said on that
occasion (of which Alexander took notes at the time) was given by Alexander in
evidence, counsel for the accused objecting to its admissibility. On the appeal
it was contended (inter alia) on behalf of the accused that that
evidence should not have been admitted, and that the statements made by the
said two men on the occasion in question, to which the accused had not
assented, were, in the trial judge’s charge to the jury, wrongfully assumed to
be evidence against the accused.

On the ground of misdirection in the trial
judge’s charge to the jury, this Court allowed the accused’s appeal, set aside
the conviction, and ordered a new trial. Portions of the judge’s charge to
which this Court made special reference are set out in the judgment now
reported.

J. M. Isaacs for
the appellant.

J. Allen K.C. for
the respondent.

Argument by counsel for the appellant on the
ground of misdirection was stopped by the Court, but he was directed to
proceed, if so advised, on the other ground of his appeal, namely: that there
were not sufficient evidence of identification of the goods alleged to have
been stolen. Counsel

[Page 555]

representing the Attorney General was informed
that he might confine his answer to the questions of misdirection and whether
substantial wrong or miscarriage had resulted therefrom.

On the conclusion of the argument, the judgment
of the court was rendered by

Anglin C.J.C.—We are all of opinion that the conviction cannot stand. There
was clearly misdirection by the learned trial judge on a very important and
most material matter.

Certain statements made in the presence of the
accused by the supposed thieves to a constable (Alexander) were deposed to by
the latter. In reference to these statements, and after reading at length to
the jury the evidence pertinent thereto given by Alexander, the learned trial
judge said:

That’s the interview that was mentioned to
you by Alexander, and as I said before you must accept that evidence. Bear in
mind it is very dangerous to accept the evidence of accomplices like these
fellows unless you feel satisfied it corresponds with the truth as told by
other witnesses;

and again

In the 9th volume of Halsbury it states: To
prove that the goods were stolen, a confession by the thief is admissible; if
it was made in the prisoner’s presence, but not otherwise. * * * The thief is
an admissible witness but the alleged receiver should not be convicted on his
evidence alone without corroboration.

But for the introductory allusion to the
Alexander interview, all this might be taken to have reference to the testimony
given orally by Paulin and Webster at the trial, which, however, was markedly
less incriminating for the accused than were their answers to Alexander in the
interview related by him—and the learned judge may have so intended these
observations. Moreover, on objection being taken by the prisoner’s counsel,
citing R. v. Christie[2],
counsel for the Crown replied:

Rex v. Christie
lays down this, that where a statement is made in the presence of the
accused it is admissible in evidence, but in instructing the jury on the
Statute (sic), your Lordship must point out that what is contained in
the statement is not evidence unless it is admitted.

The learned judge thereupon recalled the jury
and said to them:

Objections are being raised by Mr. Isaacs
(to) the evidence that has been put in by these two thieves, who did steal
coats from Eatons. I have

[Page 556]

already warned you in this case it would be
most dangerous for you to rely on their evidence as against the prisoner
without feeling it was corroborated in other respects because (of) what they
said (when) the prisoner was there. He did not express any particular assent to
it and you should reasonably be bound by what he did assent to and I think on
the whole it is almost worthless evidence for you.

This is very far indeed from telling the jury,
as the learned judge should have done, that, in the absence of any assent by
the accused either by word or conduct to the correctness of the statements made
in his presence, they had no evidentiary value whatever as against him and
should be entirely disregarded.

Counsel representing the Attorney General at bar
admitted that in his original direction the trial judge had failed to
appreciate the rule laid down in Christie’s Case[3], but argued that he had corrected this
error when the jury was recalled. We think he rather accentuated it, however,
by again referring to the statements as “evidence” susceptible of
corroboration.

It has been urged that this misdirection did not
cause a miscarriage of justice and that s. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code, therefore,
applies. That subject has been ably dealt with in a recent article on “Evidence”
by Dr. D. A. MacRae, a professor in the Law School at Osgoode Hall, published
in the Fourth Volume of the Canadian Encyclopaedic Digest, Ontario Edition,
which reviews all the leading decisions. In section 17, at p. 405, referring to
the Makin Case[4], the
writer points out (notes “x” and “y”) that Lord Herschell, in delivering the
judgment of the Privy Council, said:

The evidence improperly admitted might have
chiefly influenced the jury to return a verdict of guilty, and the rest of the
evidence which might appear to the court sufficient to support the conviction
might have been reasonably disbelieved by the jury. * * * Their Lordships do
not think it can properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice, where on a point material to the guilt or innocence of
the accused the jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge
to consider in arriving at their verdict matters which ought not to have been
submitted to them. In their Lordships’ opinion substantial wrong would be done
to the accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved
by legal evidence, and there were substituted for it the verdict of the court
founded merely upon a perusal of the evidence.

[Page 557]

Dr. MacRae also quotes from the judgment of the
Privy

Council, delivered by Lord Sumner, in Ibrahim
v. R.[5]:

Where the trial judge has warned the jury
not to act upon the objectionable evidence, the Court of Criminal Appeal * * *
may refuse to interfere, if it thinks that the jury, giving heed to that
warning, would have returned the same verdict * * * or where evidence has been
admitted inadvertently or erroneously, which is inadmissible but of small
importance * * * or most unlikely to have affected the verdict. * * * Where the
objectionable evidence has been left for the consideration of the jury without
any warning to disregard it, the Court of Criminal Appeal quashes the
conviction, if it thinks that the jury may have been influenced by it, even
though without it there was evidence sufficient to warrant a conviction.

The present provision of the Criminal Code of
Canada (s. 1014 (2)) is substantially the same as that dealt with in the Makin
Case[6], and in
Ibrahim v. R[7]. This
Court had, in the Allen Case[8],
already taken the same view of the effect of the former section 1019 of the
Criminal Code and, since the substitution for it in 1923 of s. 1014 (2) in its
present form, the statement of the law made in the earlier case (Allen v.
The King8) was reaffirmed in Gouin v. The
King[9].

It is impossible to say that in the case now
before us there has been no miscarriage of justice. It may be that sometimes
objectionable testimony as to which there has been misdirection is so
unimportant that the court would be justified in taking the view that in all
human probability it could have had no effect upon the jury’s mind, and, on
that ground, in refusing to set aside the verdict. (Kelly v. R.[10]. But it is impossible so to regard this
case, where, in a most vital matter, the learned judge did not merely fail to
warn the jury to disregard the objectionable matter contained in the statements
which had been admitted in evidence, but actually stressed it. It is only when
the accused by “word or conduct, action or demeanour” has accepted what they
contain, and to the extent that he does so, that statements made by other
persons in his presence have any evidentiary value. In the present case there
is no evidence in the record from which a jury might infer anything in the
nature of an admission by the accused of the accuracy of what was incriminating
in the statements

[Page 558]

of the thieves given in evidence by Alexander.
When the jury was recalled, the learned trial judge, far from telling them, as
Crown Counsel had suggested was the course indicated in Christie’s Case[11], that the statements in question had no
evidentiary value in the absence of some such admission by the accused, in
effect told them that they were “evidence” upon which they might act, if
corroborated, inasmuch as he said to them that it would be dangerous for them
to rely upon such evidence as against the prisoner “without feeling that it was
corroborated.”

On this ground we are of opinion that the appeal
must succeed.

As to the other ground taken by Mr. Isaacs, we
are clearly of the view that there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury
and that, if there had been a proper direction as to the statements so much
discussed, the attack upon the conviction must have failed.

As in the recent cases of Brooks v. The
King[12], and Hubin
v. The King[13], “the
circumstances do not seem to call for an unqualified order quashing the
conviction and directing the discharge of the appellant.” On the contrary, we
think it clear that our discretion “should be exercised in such a manner as to
afford the Crown an opportunity of once more putting the law in motion.” R. v.
Burr[14].

The conviction will, accordingly, be set aside
and a new trial ordered.

Appeal allowed, conviction set aside and
new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Indictment containing three
counts, charging: manslaughter (Cr. C., s. 268); causing grievous bodily injury
(Cr. C., s. 284); and causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving, etc.,
of motor vehicle (Cr. C., s. 285)—Acquittal on first two counts, and conviction
on third count—Joinder of counts—Right of jury to find guilty on third count,
while finding not guilty on other counts.

The appellant was tried on an indictment
containing three counts (referring to the same occurrence), viz., (1)
manslaughter (Cr. C., s. 268); (2) causing grievous bodily injury (Cr. C., s.
284); and (3)

[Page 43]

causing bodily harm by wanton or furious
driving, etc., of a motor vehicle (Cr. C., s. 285). The jury found him not
guilty on the first and second counts, but guilty on the third count. From the
affirmance by the Appellate Division, Ont., of his conviction on the third
count, he appealed, on the ground that, as the facts upon which the three counts
were based were the same as to each of the three offences charged, it was not
open to the jury, after acquitting him upon the first two counts, to convict
him upon the third.

Held: It was
open to the jury to find as they did. It was permissible to join the other
counts to the first one charging manslaughter (Cr. C., s. 856). Whether the
three counts should be tried together was in the discretion of the trial judge
(Cr. C., s. 857). Had appellant been charged only with manslaughter, but so
described as to include the offences charged in the said second and third
counts, then, under s. 951, Cr. C., he could properly have been convicted of
either of these latter offences, as “other offences” the commission of which
was included in the offence “as charged in the count,” if, in the jury’s
opinion, “the whole offence charged was not proved.” (R. v. Shea, 14
Can. Cr. Cas. 319, if it
implies the contrary, overruled). In the case at bar, that the jury had found
that the whole offence charged either in the first count or in the second count
had not been proved, was an intendment which must be made in support of the
verdict; and it was within the jury’s province so to find, while finding that
the offence charged in the third count was proved; and it was not open to this Court
to consider the evidence for the purpose of determining whether upon it the
jury, as reasonable men, could have negatived the existence of any element
necessary to constitute either of the offences charged in the first and second
counts, consistently with their finding of guilty on the third count.

R. v. Forseille,
35 Can. Crim. Cas. 171,
overruled.

Judgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., (35
Ont. W.N. 172; Middleton J.A. dissenting) affirmed.

Smith J. dissented, agreeing with the
dissenting judgment of Middleton J.A., in the Appellate Division, and with the
judgment in R. v. Forseille, and holding that, where injuries
have been caused by the accused to a deceased person (as found in this case)
and these injuries have caused the death, as was unquestionably so in this
case, counts under ss. 284 and 285, Cr. C., should not be allowed to go to the
jury; an acquittal on the charge of manslaughter is necessarily a finding that
there was no criminal negligence, which negligence is necessary to constitute a
crime under ss. 284 and 285.

APPEAL by the defendant under
section 1023, and, by leave of Lamont J., under section 1025 of the Criminal
Code, from the affirmance of his conviction by the Appellate Division of
the Supreme Court of Ontario, Mr. Justice Middleton dissenting[1].

The question raised is whether, as was decided
by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in R. v. Forseille[2]

[Page 44]

when an accused is tried on a charge containing
two counts, one for manslaughter and the other for causing grievous bodily
harm, the second count should not be allowed to go to the jury; and, a jury
having found him not guilty of manslaughter but convicted him on such second
count, the conviction must be quashed.

In the case at bar the appellant was acquitted
on the first two counts and was convicted on the third count in the following
indictment:

1. That [he] at the Township of Sandwich
East, in the County of Essex, on the sixteenth day of September, 1928, did
unlawfully kill and slay one Albert J. Strockean, contrary to section 268
of the Criminal Code.

2. That [he, at the place and on the date
aforesaid] by an unlawful act, or by doing negligently or omitting to do an act
which it was his duty to do, did cause grievous bodily injury to one, Albert J.
Strockean, contrary to section 284 of the Criminal Code.

3. That [he, at the place and on the date
aforesaid] having charge of a motor vehicle, by wanton or furious driving or
racing, or other wilful misconduct, or by wilful neglect, did cause or caused
to be done, bodily harm to one Albert J. Strockean, contrary to
section 285 of the Criminal Code.

As authorized by subs. 5 of s. 1013 of the Criminal
Code, Middleton, J.A., adverting to the view to the same effect which he
had expressed in R. v. Stark[3]
delivered a dissenting judgment, avowedly to enable the appellant to appeal as
of right to this Court. The sole ground of this dissent is expressed in these
terms:

This case seems to me to be one well
illustrating the difficulty resulting from what I humbly think is a departure
from sound principle. The unfortunate victim was undoubtedly killed as the
result of the accident. If his death was the result of the fault of the
accused, the crime was manslaughter. He has been acquitted and as the death and
the fact that the death resulted from the accident are not disputed, the
finding of not guilty can only mean that in the opinion of the jury the death
was not caused by the misconduct of the accused.

Similarly the finding of not guilty on the
second count, that of causing grievous bodily harm, must mean that in the
opinion of the jury the bodily harm unquestionably sustained by the deceased
was not caused by the misconduct of the accused.

The finding of guilt on the third count
must, in the light of the finding on the other counts, mean that the jury
understood that it had the right to find this man guilty of the lesser offence
while acquitting him of the only offence of which it was open to them to find
him guilty upon the evidence.

[Page 45]

The only relevant ground of appeal to the Appellate Divisional Court is thus stated
in the judgment of the majority of that Court delivered by Orde, J.A.:

That, as the facts upon which the three
counts are based are the same as to each of the three offences charged, it was
not open to the jury after acquitting the accused upon the first two counts, to
convict him upon the third.

After alluding to the fact that the Appellate Divisional Court had in the Stark
case[4]
declined to follow the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in R. v. Forseille[5], Orde, J.A., proceeds:

It may be difficult to understand how upon
the evidence in a particular case a jury could come to the conclusion that the
accused had by his negligence done bodily harm to another and at the same time
acquit him of manslaughter. But it is not open to us in my opinion to approach
the matter in that way. The question is one of law simply, and I can see no
legal reason for saying that a verdict of guilty of doing bodily harm is bad
because upon the same state of facts the Appellate Court, not the jury, thinks
it ought to have convicted the accused of manslaughter.

The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code are
as follows:

856. Any number of counts for any offences
whatever may be joined in the same indictment, and shall be distinguished in
the manner shown in form 63, or to the like effect: Provided that to a count
charging murder no count charging any offence other than murder shall be
joined.

857. When there are more counts than one in
an indictment each count may be treated as a separate indictment.

2. If the court thinks it conducive to the
ends of justice to do so, it may direct that the accused shall be tried upon
any one or more of such counts separately: Provided that, unless there be
special reasons, no order shall be made preventing the trial at the same time
of any number of distinct charges of theft, not exceeding three, alleged to
have been committed within six months from the first to the last of such
offences, whether against the same person or not.

898. Every objection to any indictment for
any defect apparent on the face thereof shall be taken by demurrer, or motion
to quash the indictment, before the defendant has pleaded, and not afterwards,
except by leave of the court or judge before whom the trial takes place, and every
court before which any such objection is taken may, if it is thought necessary,
cause the indictment to be forthwith amended in such particular, by some
officer of the court or other person, and thereupon the trial shall proceed as
if no such defect had appeared.

2. No motion in arrest of judgment shall be
allowed for any defect in the indictment which might have been taken advantage
of by demurrer, or amended under the authority of this Act.

907. On the trial of an issue on a plea of autrefois
acquit or autrefois convict to any count or counts, if it appear
that the matter on which the accused was given in charge on the former trial is
the same in whole or in part as that on which it is proposed to give him in
charge, and that he

[Page 46]

might on the former trial, if all proper
amendments had been made which might then have been made, have been convicted
of all the offences of which he may be convicted on the count or counts to
which such plea is pleaded, the court shall give judgment that he be discharged
from such count or counts.

2. If it appear that the accused might on
the former trial have been convicted of any offence of which he might be
convicted on the count or counts to which such plea is pleaded, but that he may
be convicted on any such count or counts of some offence or offences of which
he could not have been convicted on the former trial, the court shall direct
that he shall not be convicted on any such count or counts of any offence of
which he might have been convicted on the former trial, but that he shall plead
over as to the other offence or offences charged.

951. Every count shall be deemed divisible;
and if the commission of the offence charged, as described in the enactment
creating the offence or as charged in the count, includes the commission of any
other offence, the person accused may be convicted of any offence so included
which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not proved; or he may be
convicted of an attempt to commit any offence so included.

2. On a count charging murder, if the
evidence proves manslaughter but does not prove murder, the jury may find the
accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, but shall not on that
count find the accused guilty of any other offence.

S.W. Springsteen for the appellant.

E. Bayly, K.C., for the respondent.

After hearing counsel for the appellant and the
Court having retired for consideration of his argument, the Chief Justice,
without calling on counsel for the respondent, announced that a majority of the
Court was of the opinion that the appeal failed and should be dismissed.

Subsequently the following reasons for judgment
were delivered.

The judgment of the majority of the Court
(Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by

ANGLIN, C.J.C.—The only question open on this
appeal is whether in law it was competent to the jury to convict the accused on
the third count of the indictment while finding him not guilty on the first and
second counts. No ground of appeal involving a question of fact, or mixed fact
and law can be considered here (s. 1023, Cr. C.). Whatever the evidence may
disclose, all findings or intendments of fact necessary to support the verdict
must now be made. Thus, it must be assumed that the jury, while it found that
the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused while

[Page 47]

having charge of a motor vehicle, by wanton
or furious driving or racing, or other wilful misconduct, or by wilful neglect,
did cause or caused to be done, bodily harm to one Albert J. Strockean,
contrary to Section 285 of the Criminal Code.

nevertheless deemed such evidence insufficient
to warrant a finding that some other elements or ingredients necessary to
constitute either of the offences charged in the two other counts of the indictment,
on which they returned a verdict of not guilty, were also proven. Especially
must this be the case when, as here, the trial judge had correctly instructed
the jury as to what constituted each of the two offences of which they
acquitted the accused.

While, sitting here and considering the evidence
as reported, we may find it difficult to appreciate how the jury, finding that
the accused by doing an unlawful act had caused bodily harm to Strockean,
could, death having ensued, acquit him of manslaughter, we cannot give effect
to such a view without invading the realm of fact, which is closed to us by the
statute.

Having regard to the provisions of s. 856 of the
Criminal Code, and notably to the proviso thereto, it was, in our
opinion, clearly permissible for the Crown to join counts nos. 2 and 3 to the
first count charging manslaughter. Whether the three counts should be tried
together was in the discretion of the trial judge (s. 857, Cr.C.).

Under s. 951, had the accused been charged only
with manslaughter, but so described as to include the offences charged in
counts nos. 2 and 3 of the indictment now fore us, he could properly have been
convicted of either of these latter offences as “other offences” the commission
of which was included in the offence “as charged in the count,” if, in the
opinion of the jury, “the whole offence charged was not proved.” If R. v.
Shea[6],
implies the contrary, that decision cannot be supported. In a case such as that
at bar, that the jury had found that neither the whole offence charged in count
no. 1 nor the whole offence charged in count no. 2 had been proved, is an
intendment which we must make in support of the verdict. Moreover, had the
accused been tried on an indictment framed as above indicated though charging
manslaughter only, and been acquitted, and had he been sub-

[Page 48]

sequently charged upon the same facts with
either of the offences set forth in the second and third counts, he could
successfully have pleaded autrefois acquit (s. 907 (2), Cr. C.). No harm
can result from the indictment expressly charging the two lesser offences set
forth in the second and third counts respectively, of either of which the jury
might have convicted the accused upon an indictment charging manslaughter only,
but so describing that offence as to include such lesser offences. Moreover,
any objection to the indictment on the ground of the unlawful inclusion in it
of counts nos. 2 and 3, if tenable, should have been the subject of a demurrer
or motion to quash the indictment under s. 898 of the Code.

Whatever may be the powers of the provincial
appellate courts in that regard, it is not open to this court to consider the
evidence for the purpose of determining whether upon it the jury, as reasonable
men, could have negatived the existence of any element necessary to constitute
the offence of manslaughter, or the offence charged in the second count,
consistently with their finding of guilty on the third count. It is clearly
impossible to say as a matter of law that in no case where manslaughter is
charged can a jury convict of some lesser offence included in that charge as
laid, or that an indictment may not contain counts charging such lesser
offences as well as the offence of manslaughter, which the evidence may not
prove. It was within the province of the jury to find that the offence charged
in the third count was satisfactorily proven, but that, for reasons which we
can only surmise and as to the validity or the adequacy of which we are not at
liberty to inquire, some essential element of each of the offences charged in
the first and second counts respectively was, in their view, not established
beyond reasonable doubt.

SMITH J. (dissenting).—With great respect I
differ from the view expressed by the Chief Justice in this case. I am in accord
with the view taken in the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Forseille[7], and by Mr. Justice Middleton in this
case. Where the death of a person is caused by the criminal negligence of
another, the crime is manslaughter. Sections

[Page 49]

284 and 285 have no application, in my opinion,
in such a case, as they are only applicable where the injuries have not caused
death. Where injuries are caused by the accused to a deceased person (as has
been found here), and these injuries have caused the death, as was
unquestionably the case here, I agree with the Court of Appeal for
Saskatchewan, and Mr. Justice Middleton, that counts under
sections 284 and 285 should not be allowed to go to the jury.

In such case an acquittal on the charge of
manslaughter is necessarily a finding that there was no criminal negligence,
which negligence is necessary to constitute a crime under sections 284 and
285. It is, in my opinion, not proper in such a case to endeavour to entice a
jury to convict the accused by presenting to it an option to convict of a
lesser offence, not warranted by the facts, because it may be thought more easy
to get a conviction for such lesser offence. It is an invitation to the jury to
stultify themselves as the jury in this case has done, by first finding that
the accused was not guilty of criminal negligence, and then that he was so
guilty. It is said that the jury may have concluded that the injuries did not
cause the death. If they made such a finding, it was contrary to all the
evidence, and should be set aside.

The jury concluded that the accused was guilty
of criminal negligence, and, had it not been for the holding up to them of the
option of convicting either for the real crime or a lesser crime, they would in
all probability have convicted for the real crime. At all events the crime
committed by the accused, if any, was manslaughter and nothing else, and he was
entitled to a trial and a verdict on that charge, untrammelled by the
introduction of minor charges of which he could not, in my opinion, be properly
convicted on the facts.

In submitting a count for the lesser offence to
the jury in such a case, the prosecution is in effect saying to the jury, “The
accused is first charged with having, through criminal negligence, killed the
deceased, which is the very serious crime of manslaughter, of which you may not
be inclined to convict him. There is, however, a less serious offence charged,
which has nothing to do with the killing of the deceased. Under that count the
only question is, did the accused, by criminal negligence in driving his auto-

[Page 50]

mobile, inflict bodily harm on the deceased? If
you conclude that he did, you may disregard the killing altogether, and convict
him of the minor offence under this count.”

Where there is a real question as to whether or
not the injuries inflicted by the accused caused the death, the case is
entirely different, and the alternative counts are quite proper. In that case
it would be the duty of the trial judge to tell the jury that if they found
criminal negligence, they must then find whether or not death resulted from the
injuries inflicted by the accused, and that if they should find that death did
result from these injuries, they must convict of manslaughter, but if they
should find that death did not result from this cause, they should convict of
an offence under s. 284 or s. 285.

Criminal law—Conviction under Customs Act,
R.S.C. 1927, c. 42, s. 217—Harbouring goods unlawfully imported into
Canada—Summary jurisdiction under s. 217 (2)—Value of goods not shown to be
under $200.

Appellant was convicted before a stipendiary
magistrate (the conviction being affirmed, on appeal, by the County Court
Judge) for harbouring spirits unlawfully imported into Canada whereon the
duties had not been paid, contrary to s. 217 of the Customs Act, R.S.C.
1927, o. 42. The warrant of commitment did not show that the value of the goods
was under $200, and was, on that ground, attacked as bad on its face, as not
showing jurisdiction in the convicting court.

Held (Mignault
J. dubitante): In not
showing such value to be under $200 the warrant of commitment did not fail to
show jurisdiction.

Per Anglin C.J.C., Newcombe and Smith JJ.: Subs. 3 of said
s. 217, introduced by amendment in 1925 (c. 39), does not impliedly limit the
summary jurisdiction to cases where the value of the goods is less than $200.
The special jurisdiction conferred by subs. 3 to proceed, alternatively, by
indictment, for a more rigorous penalty, where the value is $200 or over, does
not, so long as the procedure by indictment is not invoked, detract from the
power exerciseable by magistrates under subs. 2, interpreted independently.

Per Rinfret J.:
The warrant recited a conviction of an offence described in terms strictly
following those of subs. 1 of s. 217; then subs. 2 enacts that “every such
person” guilty of the offence so described is “liable on summary conviction,”
etc. Therefore it could not be said that, on its face, the warrant did not show
jurisdiction. It may be that subs. 3 makes the offence indictable when the
goods are of the value of $200 or over; but there was nothing in the
proceedings before the court or on the face of the commitment to show they had
that value; moreover, the presumption is that the jurisdiction was rightly
asserted.

MOTION by way of appeal from the judgment of
Lamont J., dismissing an application by the present appellant for a writ of habeas
corpus.

The appellant was convicted before a
stipendiary magistrate “for that he * * * did, in the city of Halifax, on * * *
unlawfully, without lawful excuse, harbour a quantity of spirits, to wit, rum
unlawfully imported into Canada, whereon the duties lawfully payable have not
been paid, contrary to the provisions of section 217” of the Customs Act, c.
42, R.S.C. 1927. The conviction
was affirmed, on appeal, by the County Court Judge.

The warrant of commitment, which recited the
conviction in the above terms, was attacked on the ground that

[Page 110]

it did not show that the value of the goods
alleged to have been harboured was under $200, and, therefore, that it was bad
on its face, as not showing jurisdiction in the convicting court. It was
contended, on appellant’s behalf, that the effect of the enactment, in 1925 (c.
39), of what is now subs. 3 of s. 217, was to make the offence an indictable
one where the goods are of the value of $200 or over, and impliedly to limit
the summary jurisdiction to cases where the value of the goods is less than
$200. Rex v. Thompson[1] was
cited in support of the motion.

Duncan MacTavish for the motion.

John F. MacNeill for the Attorney-General of Canada,
contra.

The judgment of Anglin C.J.C. Newcombe and Smith JJ., was delivered by

Newcombe J.—This motion comes by way of appeal from the judgment of my
brother, Lamont, of 23rd November, 1928, dismissing an application by the
prisoner for a writ of habeas corpus. The papers shew that the prisoner was
convicted before Mr. Cluney, Stipendiary Magistrate of the city of Halifax, on
4th July, 1928, for the offence which will be literally described; and that the
conviction was, on 14th November, affirmed on appeal by the County Court Judge
for the district. A verified copy of the warrant of commitment dated 27th
November, 1928, is produced, and, in it, the conviction is recited as follows:—

Whereas John Manuel, late of Halifax, in
the county of Halifax, was on this day convicted before the undersigned, Judge
of the County Court for District No. 1 (acting on appeal by the said John
Manuel from a conviction made on the 4th day of July, 1928, before A. Cluney,
Stipendiary Magistrate in and for the city of Halifax), for that he, the said
John Manuel did, in the city of Halifax, on the 24th day of April, A.D. 1928,
unlawfully, without lawful excuse, harbour a quantity of spirits, to wit, rum
unlawfully imported into Canada, whereon the duties lawfully payable have not
been paid, contrary to the provisions of Section 217 of the Customs Act,
chapter 42, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, and it was thereby adjudged that
the said John Manuel for his said offence should forfeit and pay the sum of one
hundred and fifty dollars, to be paid and applied according to law, and should
pay to the prosecutor the sum of five dollars and fifty cents for his costs in
that behalf;

[Page 111]

and it was thereby further adjudged that if
the said several sums were not paid forthwith the said John Manuel should be
imprisoned in the city prison of the said city of Halifax in the said city of
Halifax, for the term of three months, unless the said several sums and the
costs and charges of the commitment and of the conveying of the said John
Manuel to the said city prison were sooner paid.

The ground of the application is that the
commitment is bad upon its face, because it does’ not shew “that the value of
the said goods alleged to have been harboured is under $200.”

The most recent revision of the Public Statutes
of Canada came into force on 1st February, 1928, although declared by the proclamation
to operate by the designation of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927. Section
217 of the Customs Act, c. 42, as contained in that revision, is
immediately derived from c. 39, s. 2, of 1925, and c. 50. ss.
25 and 26, of 1927.

The question arises under subs. 2 of the Act as
it appears in the revision designated 1927. That subsection originally formed
part of s. 197 of the Customs Act, as enacted by c. 14, s. 38, of 1888,
and it was re-enacted in a subsection, as it now stands, by the Revised Statutes
of 1906, c. 48, s. 219. In 1925, s. 219 was repealed and at the same time
re-enacted with some amendments, including the addition of subs. 3; but there
was nothing in any of the earlier Acts corresponding in anywise with subs. 3.
Subsection 1 of section 219, as enacted in 1925, in conformity with the
repealed section, had made it an offence, knowingly to harbour or conceal goods
unlawfully imported into Canada, and had provided that, if such goods were
found, they should be seized and forfeited; and that, if not found, the person
offending should forfeit the value thereof; and by subss. 2 and 3 it was enacted that

(2) Every such person shall, in addition to
any other penalty, forfeit a sum equal to the value of such goods, which may be
recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction, and shall further be liable,
on summary conviction before two justices of the peace, to a penalty not
exceeding two hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars, or to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year and not less than one month, or
to both fine and imprisonment.

(3) Where the goods so harboured, kept,
concealed, purchased, sold or exchanged are of the value of two hundred
dollars, or over, such person shall be guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding seven years and not less than
one year for a first offence, and to a term of imprisonment not exceeding ten
years and not less than three years for a second and each subsequent offence.

[Page 112]

These two subsections were
not in themselves altered by the amendments of 1927, and are introduced into
the revision, in the terms in which they were enacted, by c. 39 of 1925.
Subsection 2 has in effect thus been in force for forty years, and, as a
separate subsection, since 1906. The amendments by c. 50 of 1927 are immaterial
to the question now at issue. It is the interpretation of subsections 2 and 3
of c. 39 of 1925 which is really involved, and the question is, whether the
commitment is bad because it is not stated therein that the value of the rum
unlawfully imported and harboured by the prisoner was less than $200.

It will be perceived that, by subsection 2, the
person harbouring the goods is liable, in addition to the penalties previously
provided, on summary conviction, to a penalty not exceeding $200, and not less
than $50, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, and not less
than one month, or to both fine and imprisonment. There is, in this subsection
itself, no limitation of the magistrates’ jurisdiction to proceed summarily,
depending upon the value of the goods. It is, however, provided by the
following subsection that, where the value of the goods is $200 or over, the
offender shall be guilty of an indictable offence, and liable to the
imprisonment therein prescribed; and it is argued that that provision impliedly
limits the summary jurisdiction to cases where the value of the goods is less
than $200.

I would reject that contention. It is not
uncommon practice, in Dominion legislation, to provide that a statutory offence
may be prosecuted either summarily or upon indictment; s. 499 of the Criminal
Code is an example; and ss. 127
and 128 of the Excise Act are other examples; there is no inherent
objection to such alternative methods of procedure, and another specimen is
introduced by the enactments now in question. Subsection 2, in express terms,
applies to “every such person”; that is, to any person who, without lawful
excuse, harbours any goods unlawfully imported into Canada, whereon the duties
lawfully payable have not been paid. He is to forfeit a sum equal to the value
of the goods, recoverable in any court of competent jurisdiction, and is
further liable, on summary conviction, to the additional penalties prescribed.
I

[Page 113]

think the intention of Parliament is
sufficiently obvious; and that the special jurisdiction conferred by subsection
3 to proceed, alternatively, by indictment, for more rigorous penalties, where
the value of the goods is $200 or over, or, in such a case, for first, second or
subsequent offences, at the option of the prosecuting authority, does not, so
long as the procedure by indictment is not invoked, detract from the power
exerciseable by the magistrates under subsection 2, interpreted independently.

It is not said, and cannot, I think, be said
with any justification, that subsection 3 affects the liability of an offender
under subsection 2 to forfeit a sum equal to the value of the goods, if that
value be $200 or more; and, if not, why should it affect the offender’s liability
to the penalties enforceable by summary proceedings, also imposed by subsection
2? The two subsections appear to be independent and self-contained, and
subsection 3 does not, in my opinion, imply or suggest any intention to abridge
or affect the operation of subsection 2 as it theretofore existed, and
continues to exist. I cannot help thinking that, when, in 1925, Parliament
amended the original section, if it were the intention to reduce the well
established jurisdiction of the magistrates, apt words would have been used,
and that it was not meant to change the law in such an important particular by
a far-fetched inference.

I am fortified in my conclusion by the judgment
of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, pronounced in the case of Rex
v. Boutillier[2].

The appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed.

Mignault J.—I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of my brother
Newcombe dismissing the appeal of the prisoner Manuel from the refusal by my
brother Lament of a writ of habeas corpus to enquire into the cause of
his commitment, which commitment purports to have been made under section 217
(formerly 219) of the Customs Act, chapter 42, R.S.C., 1927.

I understand that a majority of my learned
colleagues concur with my brother Newcombe in rejecting the appeal. I have not
been able, however, to free myself from

[Page 114]

considerable doubt as to the correctness of his
decision. Subsection 2 of section 217 (formerly 219), as originally drafted,
undoubtedly conferred upon two justices of the peace jurisdiction to try the
offence created by subsection 1, without regard to the value of the goods.
When, however, Parliament repealed the whole section in 1925 and re-enacted it,
a very important provision was inserted in the new section as subsection 3, declaring
that when the goods so harboured, etc., are of the value of $200 or over, such
person (the person harbouring the goods) shall be guilty of an indictable
offence and subject to a term of imprisonment not exceeding seven years, and
not less than one year, for a first offence.

It seems clear that in proceedings by
indictment, it would be essential to the validity of the indictment that it
should set out that the goods are of the value of $200 or over. When this value
exists, the statute creates an offence which, as it appears to me, is triable
only by indictment. The words “where the goods so harboured * * * are of the
value of two hundred dollars or over, such person shall be guilty of an
indictable offence,” seem to me to exclude any proceedings other than by
indictment. I cannot, therefore, in a case coming within the condition of
subsection 3, conceive that it should be tried under the summary conviction
provisions referred to by subsection 2.

I do not think that there is any parity between
this case and the case contemplated by section 499 of the Criminal Code. Parliament,
no doubt, by express enactment, can provide that an offence shall be punishable
either on conviction on an indictment, or on summary conviction. Under section
499 the offence and the punishment are the same, whether the one or the other
mode of trial is selected. Here, however, where the value of the goods is under
$200, the offence is not the same as that contemplated by subsection 3, nor is
the punishment the same.

I am not in favour of dissents in criminal cases
coming before this Court by way of appeal, so I merely give expression to the
doubt I feel with respect to the decision of the majority of my colleagues.

Rinfret J.—The ground of the application by John Manuel for a writ of habeas
corpus was: That the warrant

[Page 115]

of commitment is bad on its face because it does
not shew jurisdiction in the convicting court, inasmuch as the goods unlawfully
imported into Canada are not
therein alleged to have been valued under $200.

I think the application was rightly refused by
my brother Lamont and the appeal from his judgment ought to be dismissed.

The warrant of commitment recites that John
Manuel was convicted, first, before a stipendiary magistrate; and then, on
appeal, by a judge of the County Court, for that he did

unlawfully, without lawful excuse, harbour
a quantity of spirits, to wit: rum unlawfully imported into Canada whereon the duties lawfully payable
have not been paid, contrary to the provisions of section 217 of the Customs
Act.

Subsections 1 and 2 of section 217 of the Customs
Act read in part:—

1. If any person * * * without lawful
excuse, * * * harbours * * * any goods unlawfully imported into Canada * * *
whereon the duties lawfully payable have not been paid * * *

2. Every such person shall * * * be liable,
on summary conviction before two justices of the peace, to a penalty not
exceeding two hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars, or to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year and not less than one month, or
to both fine and imprisonment.

The warrant, therefore, recites that Manuel was
convicted of an offence which is described in terms strictly following those of
subs. 1 of s. 217 of the Act. Then subs. 2 enacts that “every such person” guilty
of the offence so described is “liable on summary conviction, before two
justices of the peace,” etc.

I fail to see how, under those circumstances, it
can be said that, on its face, the warrant of commitment does not show
jurisdiction in the stipendiary magistrate.

It may be that subs. 3 of s. 217 makes the
offence indictable when the goods so harboured “are of the value of two hundred
dollars or over,” but there is nothing in the proceedings before us or on the
face of the commitment to shew that the spirits harboured by Manuel had that
value. Moreover, the presumption is that the jurisdiction was rightly asserted.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON PROPOSED APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF
NOVA SCOTIA, EN BANC

Criminal law—Appeal—No possible appeal to
Supreme Court of Canada under s. 1025, Cr. Code, by person found guilty on
summary conviction.

There is no possible appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada under s. 1025 of the Criminal Code by a person found
guilty on summary conviction under Part XV of the Code. S. 1025, under the
special conditions

[Page 137]

therein mentioned, applies to an appeal by a
person convicted of an indictable offence, and this really means a conviction
on indictment as would appear from s. 1013. (S. 765, and Attorney-General of
Alberta v. Roskiwich, [1932] S.C.R. 570, also cited.)

APPLICATION under s. 1025 of the Criminal
Code for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia
en banc affirming (on appeal by way of stated case under s. 761 of the Criminal
Code) the conviction of the present applicant by a police magistrate on the
trial on the information and complaint that he did ""without lawful
authority or without a permit signed by the Minister or some person authorized
by him in that behalf, have in his possession a drug, to wit, opium, contrary
to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, and amendments thereto"".

Gordon Henderson for the applicant.

C. Stein for the
respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—In this case the appellant was found guilty on
summary conviction under Part XV of the Criminal Code.

I have come to the conclusion that the case does
not come within section 1025 of the Criminal Code. That section, under
the special conditions therein mentioned, applies to an appeal by a person
convicted of an indictable offence; and this really means a conviction on
indictment as would appear from section 1013 of the Code.

There is no possible appeal under section 1025
by a person found guilty on summary conviction.

Moreover, the judgment a quo was rendered
on a stated case and, under sec. 765 of the Criminal Code, such an order
is final and conclusive upon all parties. (Attorney-General for Alberta v.
Roskiwich[1]).

The motion, therefore, will be dismissed.

Application dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Accused charged on three counts
of conspiracy—Speedy trial before Court of Sessions—Only one trial on the three
charges—Only one complaint or information charging accused with the three
charges, one preliminary inquiry and one option—Not the same as if several
counts arise from separate informations and commitments, each charging distinct
offences—This case distinguished from decision of this Court in The King v.
Balciunas ([1943] S.C.R. 317).

[Page 436]

The accused, respondents, were charged on
five counts, one for conspiracy to commit fraud, two for conspiracy to commit
indictable offences and two for having committed the substantive offences
themselves. The trial having been limited to the three conspiracy counts, the
accused, having elected to be tried speedily under part 18 of the Criminal
Code, were found guilty, but on appeal the conviction was set aside and a new
trial was ordered. The decision of the appellate court was based on the ground
that the trial judge upon speedy trial had no jurisdiction to try the three
different counts in the indictment at the same time, that Court being of the
opinion that it was contrary to the rule laid down by this Court in The King
v. Balciunas ([1943] S.C.R. 317). The Crown appealed to this Court, leave
having been granted under section 1025 of the Criminal Code.

Held that the
appeal should be allowed. The judgment of this Court in the Balciunas case
(supra) should not be considered as governing the present case, the true
effect of that decision being that it is limited in its restriction of trial to
cases where the several counts arise from separate informations and
commitments.

The procedure was different in the two cases.
In the present case, there was only one complaint which charged the respondents
with the three conspiracy offences, there was only one preliminary inquiry
referring to the three counts and there was only one charge sheet and one option.
In the Balciunas case (supra), three separate informations were
laid, each charging a distinct offence; there was a commitment for trial in
each of the cases, although the three charges were set forth on a single Charge
sheet, there was one speedy trial on all three Charges and the accused was
convicted on each charge. Therefore, in the Balciunas decision, it was a
case of a joinder for trial purposes of charges originating in different
complaints, or in different and distinct commitments, or, in short, a joinder
of different cases; and it was held that it was improper to try the three
separate charges together.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, which allowed the respondents'
appeal on questions of law and ordered a new trial, without giving any decision
on questions of facts.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now
reported.

Gérald Fauteux K.C. and Gustave Adam K.C.
for the appellant.

Philippe Monette K.C. and M. Gameroff
K.C. for the respondents.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin
and Hudson JJ. was delivered by

[Page 437]

The Chief
Justice.—The respondents were, by the Court of Sessions
sitting in and for the district of Montreal, found guilty on three counts of
conspiracy on which they had been tried. These counts of conspiracy formed part
of a single charge sheet. The accused were charged with having conspired to
commit a number of offences and also, on two other counts, with having
committed the substantive offences themselves. Upon objection of the
respondents, by way of motion to quash, against the joinder of the conspiracy
charges and of the two other charges for having committed the substantive
offences, the hearing of the two latter counts was adjourned and the case
proceeded only upon the conspiracy charges, to the joinder of which, at that
particular time, no objection was forthcoming from the respondents.

Against the conviction on the three counts of conspiracy,
the respondents appealed on questions of law and on questions of facts.

By judgment rendered on the 30th of December,
1943, the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) unanimously allowed the appeal on
the questions of law and ordered a new trial; but, although the Court had heard
counsel for the parties both on the law and on the facts, no reference either
in the formal judgment or in the reasons for judgment was made to the appeal on
questions of facts.

The decision of the Court was that the presiding
judge, upon speedy trial under part 18 of the Criminal Code, had no
jurisdiction to try the three different counts in the indictment at the same
time, as he had done; that this was contrary to the rule laid down by the
Supreme Court of Canada in The King v. Balciunas[1]. For that reason the
conviction was quashed and the Court ordered a new trial.

Although the formal judgment of the Court of
King's Bench states that the respondents took exception to the mode of trial,
it now appears that this was a mistaken impression and that the trial proceeded
and the accused were found guilty without raising the objection which they
alleged in their notice of appeal.

The Crown moved for leave to appeal to this
Court, under section 1025 of the Criminal Code, alleging conflict

[Page 438]

in a like case between the judgment now appealed
from and the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Nova Scotia in the case of The
King v. Cross[2].
Leave to appeal was granted.

There is no doubt about the jurisdiction of the
learned judge who gave leave, because the conflict is evident. In the Cross
case2
the Court decided that a judge holding a speedy trial may deal with each charge
as the counts in one indictment might be dealt with and is not bound to proceed
with a speedy trial upon each formal charge. There was, as here, only one
information. The Court of Appeal of Nova Scotia held that the magistrate had
jurisdiction to try together the three charges there referred to and that the
several charges were not to be treated as separate indictments and to be tried
separately. The conviction was affirmed.

The judgment rendered by the Court of King's
Bench in the present case is, therefore, clearly in conflict with the Cross case2,
and the case comes under section 1025 of the Criminal Code, unless it may be
said that the judgment of this Court in the Balciunas case[3] overruled the judgment in the Cross case2
and that the Court of King's Bench of Quebec only followed the decision
rendered in this Court in the Balciunas case3.

Leave having been granted, the Court first heard
the appeal during the May sittings and judgment was then reserved; but, in the
course of its deliberations, the Court felt there were points on which it would
like to have a reargument. Accordingly counsel were advised that they were
called upon to argue the following points:—

Whether, under the judgment of this Court
in the Balciunas case,3 in no case can more than one count be
the subject of trial under Part 18 of the Code at the same time, or whether the
judgment is limited in its restriction of trial to cases where the several
counts arise from separate informations and commitments.

Counsel on both sides had full opportunity to be
heard on the points thus submitted.

The reargument took place at the present
sittings of the Court. Counsel for the Attorney-General for the province of
Quebec took the position that the second alternative in

[Page 439]

the question submitted by the Court was the
correct one and that to which one should adhere. I have come to the conclusion
that the latter view is the true effect of the Balciunas judgment[4]. As appears in the judgment of the Court,
the facts in that case were as follows:—

Three separate informations were laid against
Balciunas. He was committed for trial on all three. A single charge sheet
setting forth the three charges was prepared by the Crown Prosecutor and on
this the accused was arraigned and elected to be tried speedily under part 18
of the Criminal Code. There was one trial on all three charges before the
County Court judge and Balciunas was convicted on each charge. On appeal to the
Court of Appeal this conviction was set aside/and a new trial directed on the
ground that it was improper to try the three separate charges together, the
point being that, although there was authority in the Criminal Code to include
in an indictment a number of separate charges, this was not the case as to a
charge under the provisions of part 18. In this Court the judgment of the Court
of Appeal was affirmed.

In the present case the procedure was different.
There was only one complaint which charged the respondents with the three
conspiracy offences. There was only one preliminary inquiry referring to the
three counts, and there was only one charge sheet and one option.

A motion to quash was made, but it objected to
the joinder of the conspiracy charges with the other charges of having
committed the offences themselves; it did not object to the joinder of the
three conspiracy charges.

As appears, there was a single complaint, a
single inquiry, a single charge comprising the three counts, a single
option in relation to that charge, and a single trial on the three counts. No
objection was made to having the conspiracy counts tried simultaneously, and
objection was made only to the joinder with the substantive offences counts.

The procedure, therefore, was different in the
two cases and I do not think the Balciunas judgment[5] should be considered as governing the
present case. What the Court had before it in the Balciunas case5
was the fact of three separate informations, a commitment for trial on all
three

[Page 440]

and a single charge sheet on which the trial
proceeded to conviction on all three charges. The Court did not pretend to
decide anything else than what was then before it. The effect of the judgment
is that, in the premises, it was improper to try the three charges together;
and the decision should not be extended to a different case. Speaking broadly,
however general the terms may be in which a judgment is expressed, unless a
contrary intention clearly appears, they extend only to the facts and to the
questions with which the Court is at the moment concerned.

In the Balciunas case[6] what was condemned was the joinder for
trial purposes of charges originating in different complaints, or different
informations, the joinder of separate records, or, in short, of different
cases. It should not, therefore, be considered as concluding this particular
case.

Now, as can be seen by the notice of appeal,
there was substantially only one ground of appeal on the law before the Court
of King's Bench in Quebec. The respondents contended that the trial judge had
exceeded his jurisdiction in hearing simultaneously three counts in the
indictment. Likewise, the Court of King's Bench decided that contention
favourably to the respondents by resting its decision on the Balciunas judgment6;
but, in my opinion, the two cases are different and, as this was the real
ground of the decision in the Court of King's Bench, it follows that the appeal
ought to be allowed.

However, this does not dispose of the case.
There was an appeal to the Court of King's Bench not only on the question of
law just discussed, but also on questions of fact. The respondents were
entitled to a pronouncement by the Court of King's Bench on their appeal on facts.
In view of the result on the question of law, the Court of King's Bench gave no
decision on the appeal on facts. The case ought, therefore, to be remitted to
the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) of the province of Quebec in order that
that Court may pass upon the grounds of appeal based on facts. In so ordering,
I am adopting the course followed by this Court in The King v. Boak[7].

The appeal should be allowed to the extent
indicated.

[Page 441]

The judgment of Taschereau and Rand JJ. was
delivered by

Rand J.—The respondents were charged before the Court of Sessions,
district of Montreal, under the speedy trials provisions of the Criminal Code
on five counts, one for conspiracy to commit fraud, two for conspiracy to
commit indictable offences against sections 164 and 169 of the Excise Act, and
two for those offences themselves. The charges had been laid in one information
and the commitment was on all of them. On the objection of the respondents and
with the consent of the Crown, the trial was limited to the conspiracy counts.
The accused were found guilty but on appeal the conviction was set aside and
new trials ordered. From that judgment the Attorney-General of Quebec appeals.

The ground on which the Court of King's Bench
proceeded was that under part 18 of the Code, as interpreted by this court in
the case of The King v. Balciunas[8],
no more than one count or charge can be the subject of such a trial. But that
was not, in my opinion, the effect of the Balciunas judgment8
nor do I think it governs this case. An examination of its facts shows that
three informations had been laid, each charging a distinct offence. There was a
commitment in each case. The three charges, however, were set forth on one
charge sheet; on them the accused elected for a speedy trial and they were
tried together. It was, therefore, a case of joining charges contained in
separate and distinct commitments. The Court of Appeal for Ontario had held
that there was no power under part 18 to do that and that section 834 had no
application because all three were contained in the commitments; and it had
directed

that the appellant be tried regularly upon
the charges upon which he was committed for trial.

That judgment was affirmed in this court (1). In
both, reference was made to section 856 of part 19 of the Criminal Code and
assuming that section would have cured what was otherwise a misjoinder, it was
held not to apply to proceedings under part 18.

[Page 442]

These judgments imply that, if the three charges
had been properly on the charge sheet, they could have been tried together, and
this is clearly the assumption underlying section. 856 in relation to an
indictment. If the question had been simply whether there was jurisdiction
under part 18 to try two charges together, it would have been quite unnecessary
to emphasize the precise procedure followed or to make any reference to section
834.

Then does part 18 exclude all joinder of counts
in a charge sheet? The commitment on the five charges was unobjectionable.
Section 827 requires, for the purposes of election, that the prisoner be
informed that he is charged with ""the offence"", which ordinarily
means that upon which he has been committed, but the singular number is not to
be taken as a limitation. By subsection 3,

the prosecuting officer shall prefer the
charge against the accused for which he has been committed for trial or any
charge founded on the facts or evidence disclosed on the depositions.

Section 834 has already been considered. Section
839, giving all powers of amendment, authorizes the division of a count under
section 891.

By the common law rule, an indictment could in
general contain any number of counts. In felonies, when it appeared that they
did not all arise out of the same body of facts, the court, not as a matter of
jurisdiction but of judicial discretion, followed this practice: if the
discreteness was detected before the prisoner pleaded, the court would quash
the indictment; if it did not appear until after plea, the prosecutor was
called upon to elect upon which count he would proceed; but after verdict the
joinder was not available on a writ of error. So long, however, as the counts
were statements of different offences arising out of what was in substance a
single transaction, there was no misjoinder and all could be tried together: The
King v. Lockett et al.[9],
and in this background both the purpose of section 856 and the interpretation
of part 18 are clarified. If a joinder of two or more counts, arising as in
this case, were not allowed, then either speedy trials would be limited to
commitments on a single charge or a separate trial would be necessary for each
of any number of charges

[Page 443]

although they all arose out of the same
transaction, and the real object of part 18 would, in large measure, be
defeated. Section 710 in part 15 shows with what specific language such a
limitation of trial has been prescribed.

The ground, then, upon which the court below
proceeded lay in a misconception of what the Balciunas judgment (1)
decided and the appeal must be allowed but, as the accused had appealed as well
on the facts and this ground has not been considered below, I would return the
case to the Court of King's Bench to be dealt with accordingly.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Burglary—Possession
by night of implements of house-breaking—Ordinary tools of the accused's trade
as truck driver—Prooj of unlawful purpose—Lawful excuse—Onus of proof—Evidence—Sufficiency—Criminal
Code, section 464a.

The appellant, a truck driver, was charged with having been
found in possession by night, without lawful excuse, of instruments of house
breaking, contrary to section 464a of the Criminal Code and was convicted
before a judge of the County Court. The trial judge found that some of the
instruments, but not all of them, were tools a truck driver might use in his
trade, while all of the instruments so found were capable of being used for
purposes of housebreaking. But he further stated that he was satisfied, in all
the surrounding circumstances established in evidence, that at that particular
time and place the tools were not in the appellant's possession for an innocent
purpose, and, ""on the whole of the evidence"", he found the appellant

[Page 10]

guilty. The conviction was affirmed by a majority of the Court
of Appeal. The dissenting judge was of the opinion that the trial judge failed
to apply the principle in Rex v. Ward (85 L.J.K.B. 483), where it
was held that the accused had prima facie satisfied the onus cast upon
him of proving that he had a lawful excuse for his possession of the tools and
that the onus was then cast upon the prosecution of proving affirmatively that
the accused had no lawful excuse for being in possession of the tools at that
particular time and place.

Held, Kellock J. dissenting, that, in the circumstances
of this case and upon the evidence, the trial judge was legally warranted in
drawing the conclusions he arrived at. The decision in Rex v. Ward
(supra) does not apply. In that case, the trial judge had directed the jury
that it was for the accused to establish to their entire satisfaction that his
possession of the implements was lawful; while the Court of Criminal Appeal
held that the jury had not been properly directed with regard to the onus of
proof. In the present case the trial judge was sitting alone without a jury; it
was not necessary for him to expound the law and then verbally apply it to the
facts in giving his reasons for judgment; and it should be sufficient if it
appears he was alive to the law and that he properly charged himself when
reaching his finding upon the evidence. Moreover, the findings alone would be
sufficient to take this case out of the application of the Ward case.

Per Kellock J. dissenting:—The trial judge did not
properly direct himself as to the law applicable as laid down in the Ward
case. Therefore, the question for decision is as to whether or not he must
""inevitably"" have come to a conclusion of the guilt of the accused on
the evidence, notwithstanding such misdirection; and this must depend upon
whether the Crown discharged the onus of establishing beyond reasonable doubt
that the accused had possession with guilty intent. The circumstances disclosed
in evidence upon which the Crown can rely are not sufficient to make the
result, that the accused was guilty, inevitable. There should be a new trial.

APPEAL by Mihalchan, one of
the accused, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1]
dismissing (O'Halloran J.A. dissenting) his appeal from his conviction, on a
trial before the County Court of Westminster, Whiteside J., on a charge of
being found by night in possession of instruments of housebreaking without
lawful excuse, contrary to section 464 (a) of the Criminal Code.

The appellant and one Smylski
were charged jointly with possession of housebreaking instruments. The
implements consisted of a substantial assortment of tools, together with a
piece of celluloid, found in the car the

[Page 11]

appellant was driving. The trial
judge acquitted Smylski but convicted the appellant and sentenced him to six
months' imprisonment.

No one appearing for the
appellant.

E. Pepler K.C. for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice
and of Kerwin, Taschereau and Rand JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—The appellant
was convicted in the County Court Judge's Criminal Court at New Westminster,
B.C., of having been found in possession by night, without lawful excuse, of
instruments of housebreaking, contrary to section 464 (a) of the
Criminal Code.

The conviction was affirmed by
the Court of Appeal, but there was a dissent in that Court and the appeal here
is on the question on which there has been dissent.

In the formal judgment appealed
from the dissent is expressed thus:—

Mr. Justice O'Halloran
dissents from this judgment upon the grounds that the trial judge misdirected
himself as to the onus of proof and failed to apply the correct legel
principles in considering the explanation of the appellant in relation to his
possession of the alleged housebreaking instruments and in discharging the onus
placed upon him by section 464 (a) of the Criminal Code.

In his reasons the learned
dissenting judge stated that, in his opinion, the trial judge failed to apply
the principle in Rex v. Ward[2]
. The point would be that when once the instruments found in the possession of
the accused, although capable of being used for purposes of housebreaking, are
also shown to be the ordinary tools which the accused might well use in his trade,
the accused thus establishes prima facie a sufficient excuse, and the
burden shifts upon the prosecution of satisfying the jury, from the other
circumstances, that the accused had no lawful excuse for being in possession of
these tools at that particular time and place.

In the Ward case[3]
, the Deputy Chairman had directed the jury that it was for the accused to
establish to their satisfaction that his possession of the implements in ques-

[Page 12]

tion was lawful. It was held by
the Court of Criminal Appeal that the jury had not been properly directed with
regard to the onus of proof and the appeal was allowed.

In the present case the trial
judge was sitting alone without a jury. It was not necessary for him to expound
the law and then verbally apply it to the facts in giving his reasons for
judgment. It should be sufficient if it appears he was alive to the law and
that he properly charged himself when reaching his finding upon the evidence. (The
King v. Frank[4]
).

Here no error in direction, or
self-direction, was made manifest and the learned judge's reasons do not
warrant the conclusion that he misdirected himself, or that he proceeded upon
an erroneous view of the law, and this is not to be assumed.

The appellant is a truck driver
and the learned judge found that some of the instruments in the appellant's
possession—but not all of them—were tools a truck driver might use in his
trade; while all of the instruments so found were capable of being used for
purposes of housebreaking. These findings alone would be sufficient to take the
case out of the application of Rex v. Ward.[5]
.

But, moreover, the learned judge
was satisfied, in all the surrounding circumstances established in evidence,
that at that particular time and place the tools were not in the appellant's
possession for an innocent purpose; and, as stated in his judgment, ""on
the whole of the evidence"" the learned judge found the appellant guilty.

It was recognized in the Ward
case[6]
that ""other circumstances"" might displace the prima facie
proof, or show a guilty intent, and it was, of course, for the learned trial
judge in the present case, acting as judge and jury, to say whether or not, in
the particular circumstances, the possession was innocent.

With deference, I do not see here
any misdirection on the part of the trial judge and I think, in the
circumstances and upon the evidence, he was legally warranted in drawing the
conclusions he arrived at.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 13]

KELLOCK J. (dissenting).—All the
members of the Court of Appeal were of opinion that, with the exception of the
piece of celluloid, all the tools found in the possession of the accused were
tools which the accused might reasonably require in his occupation as a truck
driver in Northern British Columbia. The possession of such tools, excepting
the celluloid, was then prima facie explained. (Rex v. Ward[7].)
The learned trial judge believed the statement of the accused that the
celluloid had come into his possession with the car when he purchased the
latter some months earlier. O'Halloran J.A. who dissented did so because in his
view the learned trial judge had misdirected himself in failing to apply the
principle of the above decision with the result that the evidence was never
properly considered from the standpoint of the burden under which the Crown
came by reason of the explanation furnished by the accused's occupation for his
possession of the tools, excepting the celluloid.

A reading of the judgement at
trial, coupled with the learned judge's report, satisfies me that the learned
judge did not properly direct himself as to the law applicable as laid down in Rex
v. Ward[8]
. In his report he says that the accused's excuse for being on his way to Port
Haney seemed flimsy

when heard in connection
with his explanation of why he happened to have such a complete housebreaking
equipment in his truck

(he should have said car). The
explanation of the accused for his possession of the tools apart from the
celluloid by reason of his occupation was perfectly good, and as I have said,
was so regarded by all the members of the Court of Appeal, and as to the
celluloid, the learned judge believed the accused when he said it had come with
the car. To my mind the above passage indicates that the learned judge paid no
attention to the fact that the tools were tools of the accused in connection
with his occupation and regarded the burden imposed by section 464 (a)
Cr. C. as never having been other than throughout on the accused.

If that be so the question for
decision is as to whether or not the learned trial judge must inevitably have
come to a conclusion of the guilt of the accused on the evidence,

[Page 14]

notwithstanding the misdirection;
Stirland v. Public Prosecutor[9]
. This must depend upon whether the Crown discharged the onus of establishing
beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had possession with guilty intent.

The circumstances disclosed in
evidence upon which the Crown can rely is (1) the presence of the celluloid,[10]
the evidence as to the errand in Port Haney upon which the accused was engaged
at the time and (3) the evidence of the appellant and Smylski that they had
approached the garage thinking it was a place where they could buy cigarettes.

In my opinion there is no
""inevitability"" about the celluloid in view of the acceptance by the
learned trial judge of the explanation with regard to it, and if it amounts to
nothing it adds nothing to the other circumstances. As to number 2, its
coupling by the learned judge in his report, with the explanation by the
accused of his possession of the tools, as already pointed out, makes it
impossible for me to say he would not have believed this evidence had he not
been in error with regard to the tools. In addition there was a tailor by the
name of Mostrenko in Port Haney, and the learned judge has misapprehended this
part of the evidence as he refers to ""the very inadequate sum"" of
three dollars paid to the appellant by Smylski ""for the trip"". It was
not paid for the trip but for the gas which would be used on the trip. It was
therefore not an inadequate sum at all.

This leaves (3) above. What is
the evidence with regard to this? Smylski says:—

I thought I would go and buy
a chocolate bar, or soft drink. We got near the side-walk, and he (the
appellant) said ""It is closed"". And we were talking about it was too
far to go back, and then he said ""There is someone stealing the car"".
We ran back.

The appellant said:—

At that time I did'nt think
it was constable Saunders, but we passed the car, walking to the garage. We
stopped there and noticed there was it was not a business place at night, like
it was a confectionery; not in our line. We decided to turn back because it was
too far to go to town from there. It would be foolish. Either that or we would
have to go back. And sudden, I heard the car start, and I said ""Joe
somebody is stealing our car"".

Constable Saunders said that he
noticed the car, which later proved to be the appellant's, parked by the
roadside

[Page 15]

with its lights out. He stopped
and got out and before the appellant and Smylski came up he had been there long
enough to get into the car, start and stop the engine and get out of the car.
As he had driven past the garage previously he had noticed ""two figures
near the garage and I thought it was somebody just walking by"".

The reason given by the accused
and Smylski for leaving the car and approaching the garage was that they
thought it was a place where they could buy cigarettes. They had previously
driven past a number of places where they could have done so.

Would the learned trial judge
have refused to believe this as an explanation of the presence of the accused
near the garage or should he have done so, had he correctly approached a
consideration of all the evidences. With respect I find myself unable to say
that such a result was inevitable. I therefore think that there should be a new
trial and I would allow the appeal accordingly.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Accused, respondent, prosecuted
for alleged infractions of Order in Council dealing with maximum or ceiling
prices—Accused convicted after speedy trial under Part XV of the Criminal Code—Order
in Council by federal authorities creating leave to appeal to Supreme Court of
Canada in cases of offences against wartime regulations—Regulations made by the
Order in Council—Extent of such right of appeal—Interpretation of the conditions
imposed by the Order in Council—Right of appeal to Supreme Court of Canada
still subject to sections 1023 and 1025 of the Criminal Code.

Under the provisions of the Criminal Code,
there existed no right of appeal to provincial courts of appeal or to the
Supreme Court of Canada from judgments rendered on summary conviction under
Part XV of the Code. But right of appeal to these courts was allowed, on
certain conditions, by a federal order in council, coming into force on the 7th of June, 1943, from such judgments when
rendered on convictions for offences against wartime regulations. Certain
regulations were made and established by the order in council, amongst which
those material to this appeal read as follows: an appeal shall lie to a
provincial court of appeal, by leave of such court, on any ground which
involves a question of law or of mixed law and fact; a further appeal from the
judgment of the court of appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada by
leave of such Court; and it was also regulated that ""sections 1023 to 1025
inclusive of the Criminal Code shall, insofar as the same are not inconsistent
with this regulation, apply to any appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada***"".

Held: That the
effect of the regulations made by the order in council was not to give a right
of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

[Page 2]

from any and all judgments or decisions of a
provincial court of appeal, with the sole proviso that leave of the Supreme
Court of Canada be given by that Court; but

Held: That the
result and effect of the regulations were that an appeal only lies to the
Supreme Court of Canada, by leave of that Court ""on any questions of law
on which there has been a dissent in the court of appeal"" (s. 1023 Cr. C).
or ""if the judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other
court of appeal in a like case"" (s. 1025 Cr. C). The provisions contained
in these two sections are not in any way inconsistent with the regulations and
must be taken into account in any appeal to this Court under the regulations
made by the order in council.

Therefore, applying to the appellant's
application for leave to appeal to this Court the regulations so interpreted,
the motion should be dismissed: there having been no dissent in the Court
below, this Court has no jurisdiction to grant leave, as the applicant has not
shown that the judgment to be appealed from, in respect to the main point
involved in the appeal, conflicts with the judgment of any other court of
appeal in a like case.

APPLICATION for leave to appeal to this Court
from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec,
allowing the respondent's appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench
(Crown side) and quashing the conviction of the respondent, after speedy trial
before the Court of Sessions of the Peace, for having committed infractions of
an Order of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. The Court of King's Bench
(Crown side) had quashed the conviction in one out of ten charges, but had
affirmed the convictions in the others.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now
reported.

Gérard Lacroix K.C., for the application.

Chas. A. Cannon K.C. contra.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

The Chief
Justice.—The appellant is an investigator of the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board. The respondent, which is a manufacturer of
packing boxes, was prosecuted by the appellant, acting on behalf of the Board,
before the Court of the Sessions in the city of Quebec for ten alleged
infractions of order in council no. 8528, dated the 1st of November, 1941 (and
amendments thereto),

[Page 3]

which deals with maximum or ceiling prices at
which manufactured goods may be sold after the 1st day of December, 1941.

For the purpose of the present judgment, I do
not find it necessary to enter into the particulars of each one of these
charges (no. 22171 to no. 22180).

The accused was tried under Part XV of the
Criminal Code and found guilty of all charges. It appealed to a judge of the
Court of King's Bench (Crown Side), who heard the appeals, quashed the
conviction in no. 22172, but affirmed the convictions in all the other cases.

By order in council no. 4600, which came into
force on the 7th of June, 1943, the Minister of Justice having reported

that in many of these prosecutions under
Part XV aforesaid, questions of law of first rate importance are not
infrequently raised relating to the validity and the construction of wartime
regulations and it has been represented to him that, in the interest of
uniformity of decisions, as well as the true construction of all wartime
regulations, further appeals should be allowed to the provincial courts of
appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada wherever, in the opinion of the Court to
be appealed to, an important question of law or of mixed law and fact is
raised, it was deemed necessary or advisable,

for the security, defence, peace, order and
welfare of Canada that such
appeals be provided for.

Certain regulations were accordingly made and
established and those which are material to the present appeal read as
follows:—

2. In any proceedings under Part XV of the
Criminal Code for an offence against wartime regulations, an appeal from a
judgment of the county or district court judge, or in the province of Quebec,
the judge of the Court of King's Bench, Crown Side, on any ground of appeal
which involves a question of law or of mixed law and fact shall lie to the
court of appeal by leave of such Court.

3. A further appeal from a judgment or
decision of the court of appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada by
leave of such Court.

***

6. Sections 1023 to 1025 inclusive of the
Criminal Code shall, insofar as the same are not inconsistent with this
regulation, apply to any appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada taken pursuant
to this regulation.

7. The Attorney General of Canada shall have a right of appeal in any
case where the Attorney General of the province in which the offence is alleged
to have been committed has such right.

The respondent secured from the Court of King's
Bench (Appeal Side) (that Court being the court of appeal for

[Page 4]

the province of Quebec referred
to in the regulations) leave to appeal in the nine cases where the conviction
had been affirmed. The appeals were heard by that Court both on questions of
law and on questions of mixed law and fact. They were allowed in every one of
the cases and the nine convictions were quashed.

The appellant then moved for leave to appeal to
this court from these judgments of the Court of King's Bench under the
provisions of the Order in Council No. 4600.

In his notice of motion the appellant alleged
that the cases involved questions of public law and of the meaning and real
extent of the regulations enacted under the War Measures Act of Canada;
and that, amongst other questions, the Court was asked to decide mainly:—

9. (a) What may constitute a
sale during the basic period under regulations enacted pursuant to the War
Measures Act of Canada and especially in virtue of order in council no.
8528, as well as orders flowing therefrom;

(b) If the mens rea, or
criminal intent, constitutes a necessary element in offences created by order
in council no. 8528, and the orders flowing therefrom;

(c) Which is the meaning and the
extent of the reference to the Canadian Criminal Code in said order in council
no. 8528, and the orders made pursuant thereto.

The appellant further alleged that the decisions
of the courts up till now were not unanimous on these specific points and,
moreover, that the judgment rendered in the premises by the Court of King's
Bench (Appeal Side) was in conflict with several other judgments of other
courts of appeal in similar cases, while the Supreme Court of Canada had never
so far decided these specific points in relation to the interpretation of the
regulations and orders enacted pursuant to the War Measures Act of
Canada.

The petition for leave to appeal, as originally
served, did not indicate the judgments of the other courts of appeal alleged to
be in conflict with the decision appealed from. As a preliminary objection the
respondent, therefore, invoking the judgment in Liebling v. The King[1], argued that the Court
should not entertain the application.

The appellant, however, had subsequently served
an additional notice in which he referred to four different

[Page 5]

judgments which he alleged to be in conflict
with the judgment now appealed from and, as this additional notice was served
sometime before the motion came to be heard before the Court., it was thought that
this was a sufficient compliance with the rules of the Court and it was decided
that the respondent ""should take nothing"" by the objection so made by
him.

Another objection made by the respondent was
that, while both the Court of King's Bench (Crown Side) and the Court of King's
Bench (Appeal Side) had delivered two separate judgments on the matters now
before the Court, there was only one notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada and the respondent was entitled to be told from which of the two judgments
the appellant intended to appeal to this Court. The appellant, being requested
to optate between the two, thereupon declared that he abandoned the appeal from
the judgment rendered on the case numbered 22171 and bearing number 3573 in the
Court of King's Bench (Crown Side) and thus limited his appeal to the eight
other convictions and to the judgment in the appeal bearing number 3574 in the
Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side).

Two questions stand to be decided on the
application for leave to appeal. The first one concerns the extent of the right
of appeal conferred by the regulations under order in council no. 4600. The
other question is whether, under those regulations as they must be interpreted,
the appellant has succeeded in making out before this Court a case where leave
to appeal ought to be granted to him in the circumstances.

Dealing with the first question. It must be
remembered that up till order in council no. 4600 there existed no right of
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from judgments rendered on summary
conviction under Part XV of the Criminal Code. (Attorney General for Alberta
v. Roskiwich[2];
Au Chung Lam alias On Lim v. The King[3].
The object of order in council no. 4600 is, amongst other things, to give a
right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada in proceedings under Part XV of
the Criminal Code

[Page 6]

for an offence against wartime regulations, but
such right of appeal is given only under certain conditions and what we have to
decide is precisely what those conditions are.

It was contended by counsel for the appellant
that the effect of the regulations under order in council no. 4600 is to give a
right of appeal from any and all judgments or decisions of the court of appeal,
with the sole proviso that leave of the Supreme Court of Canada be given by
that Court.

The respondent, however, questioned such an
interpretation of paragraph (3) of the regulations and argued that there was no
intention by order in council no. 4600 to change the ordinary conditions under
which an appeal could be brought to this Court, except that in these matters
leave of the Court itself would be required. As the law stood before, there was
a right to appeal de plano ""on any question of law on which
there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal""; and also

there was a right of appeal when the
judgment intended to be appealed from conflicted with the judgment of any court
of appeal in a like case, provided leave to appeal was granted by a Judge of
the Supreme Court of Canada.

This was under sections 1023 and 1025 of the
Criminal Code and, in both instances, it applied only to proceedings in respect
of an indictable offence.

If we were to accept the appellant's
interpretation of the regulations, it would mean that no account should be
taken of paragraph (6) which enacts that

Sections 1023 to 1025 inclusive of the
Criminal Code shall * * * apply to any appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
taken pursuant to this regulation.

This paragraph states that the sections
mentioned ""shall apply"" and, therefore, effect must be given to it
""in so far as the same are not inconsistent 'with these regulations"",
as stated in the paragraph.

Now, the only inconsistency with sections 1023
to 1025 of the Criminal Code that we can find in the regulations is the proviso
that the appeal lies to the Court only ""by leave of such Court"".
Otherwise the provisions contained in sections 1023 to 1025 are not in any way
inconsistent with the regulations and, therefore, must be taken into account in
any appeal to this Court under these new regulations. This

[Page 7]

interpretation is further strengthened by the
fact that if order in council no. 4600 were not to be construed as just
indicated, it would mean that appeals in proceedings upon summary convictions
under Part XV of the Criminal Code, which did not exist before the order in
council was passed, would, by such order in council, be made wider than appeals
in proceedings in respect of indictable offences. That, of course, would lead
to absurd consequences.

More particularly, having regard to the fact
that, by force of section (9) of the order in council no. 8528, the same
contravention, or failure, to observe any regulation, or order, constitutes an
offence which may be tried either upon summary conviction under Part XV, or, if
the Attorney General of Canada or of any province so directs, upon indictment.
So that the trial of the same offence, according as upon summary conviction or
upon indictment, would thus be made susceptible of an appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada under different conditions, and conditions which would be such
that the right of appeal in proceedings in respect of indictable offences would
be more restricted than in proceedings upon summary conviction.

It is only reasonable to believe that the intent
of the order in council was to put the appeals in one or the other of these
matters upon the same footing, except that on indictable offences, as already
provided for by the Criminal Code, no leave is necessary when there has been in
the court of appeal a dissent on a question of law, or, where there has been no
dissent, a right of appeal lies by leave of a judge of the Court where the
judgment conflicts with that of another court of appeal in a like case; and in
proceedings on summary conviction under. Part XV of the Criminal Code a new
right of appeal is created, where none existed before, and all the usual
conditions under sections 1023 to 1025 Cr. C. apply, except that in each case
no appeal lies unless the Supreme Court itself grants leave to appeal.

In our view, therefore, the effect and result of
the regulations under order in council no. 4600, so far as it applies to
appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada, are as follows: In proceedings under
Part XV of the Criminal Code for offences against wartime regulations an

[Page 8]

appeal now lies to the Supreme Court of Canada
by leave of that Court ""on any questions of law on which there has been
dissent in the court of appear (Criminal Code, section 1023), or ""if the
judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal
in a like case"" (Criminal Code, section 1025).

Applying to the present application for leave
the regulations so interpreted, as there has been no dissent in this case, this
Court has jurisdiction to grant leave only if it can be shown that the judgment
appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a
like case.

The appellant was able to suggest that such a
conflict existed only on two of the questions mentioned in his notice of
motion, one being:

If the mens rea, or criminal intent,
constitutes a necessary element in offences created by order in council no.
8528, and orders flowing therefrom;

the other being:

Which is the meaning and the extent of the
reference to the Canadian Criminal Code made in said order in council no. 8528,
and the orders made pursuant thereto.

Perhaps it should be noted that, after all, this
second question is really included in the first question.

But the appellant was unable to refer the Court
to any judgment of another court of appeal conflicting with the judgment
appealed from on the main point involved in the appeal, to wit:—

What may constitute a sale during the basic
period under regulations enacted pursuant to the War Measures Act of Canada and especially in virtue of order in
council no. 8528, as well as orders flowing therefrom.

The latter is really the fundamental point in
the proceedings against the respondent.

The Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), held
that the proof made by the appellant of the alleged sales by the respondent
during the basic period were not sales within the meaning of order in council
no. 8528, but merely deliveries of articles covered by contracts of sale within
the meaning of the said order entered into long prior to the 15th day of
September, 1941. In consequence of that decision, the appellant has failed to
establish one of the two essential elements of the offences

[Page 9]

charged. The appellant, in view of the fact that
there has been no dissent and that no conflict is alleged, is unable to ask
this Court to reverse the judgment of the court of appeal on this fundamental
question, and it means, therefore, that, even assuming there is a conflict on
the other points raised in the appeal and even if he should succeed in getting
this Court to reverse the judgment of the court of appeal on these other
points, the respondent would, nevertheless, remain acquitted. The appeal would
be devoid of any possible practical result and the Court would be asked only to
pass upon an academic question.

In the circumstances the appeal cannot be
entertained, leave to appeal should not be granted, and the motion to that
effect should be dismissed.

Application dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Charge of rape—Evidence—Corroboration—Charge to
jury—Misdirection—New trial.

The appeal was from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario (81 C.C.C. 319) dismissing (Laidlaw J.A. dissenting) appellant’s appeal
from his conviction on a charge of rape. The issue at the trial was whether or
not the complainant voluntarily consented to the intercourse. A witness, R.,
who had arrived at the scene of the alleged offence shortly after what took
place, testified to there being a “matted down” area of about 20 x 6 feet. The
complainant in her evidence had said nothing about such condition. Appellant
testified that such condition existed before what took place. In charging the jury
the trial Judge said that the evidence of R. and two other men corroborated the
complainant’s story in regard to some of the material aspects thereof and he
followed by detailing certain matters of their evidence, including the
condition of the area as described by R.

Held (Taschereau and Kellock JJ. dissenting): The
conviction should be quashed and a new trial directed.

Per the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.: It was not
necessary that the complainant should have given some particular bit of
evidence before an independent witness upon that point could corroborate her
general story on the issue of consent. As part of the Crown’s case, it was
quite proper to show the condition of the particular area when R arrived, and
the jury would not be bound to believe appellant’s evidence as to its condition
before the occurrence. But it was misdirection to say that evidence of the
matted down condition of the area after the occurrence could constitute
corroboration of a material aspect of the complainant’s story as to which she
had not testified. And it could not be said that the misdirection had caused no
miscarriage of justice.

Per Rand J.: It was beyond controversy on the evidence
that the state of the surface of the area could not have furnished the
slightest corroboration to the complainant’s story or to the case of the Crown.
The charge to the jury was, therefore, in that respect, a misdirection in law
and of such a nature that it could not be said that it might not have
influenced the jury in reaching their verdict.

Per Taschereau and Kellock JJ. (dissenting): The
reference in question in the charge to the condition of the area, having regard
to its context, related, not to any supposed statement of the complainant as to
the condition of the area which was corroborated by R., but to a reference
earlier in the charge to the complainant’s evidence as to the nature of the
alleged assault, and would be so understood by the jury; and R.’s evidence as
to the condition of the area was consistent with, and could properly be
regarded as corrobora-

[Page 135]

tive of, the complainant’s evidence with respect to the
struggle alleged by her to have taken place, unless it were clearly established
as a matter of fact that the struggle described by her was of such a limited
character that it could not have been the cause of an area of the extent
described by R., and on that question the jury, if accepting complainant’s
evidence that she did not consent and was attacked, and giving due weight to
the circumstances, might well have considered that no difficulty arose, and
that was a question of fact, expressly left as such to, and entirely one for,
the jury. There was really no question of law involved in the dissent in the
Court of Appeal, but merely matters of fact, and therefore the appeal should be
quashed.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
dismissing (Laidlaw J.A. dissenting) the appellant’s appeal from his
conviction, at trial before Greene J. and a jury, on a charge of rape.

H. Freshman for the appellant.

W.B. Common K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by

KERWIN J.—The conviction of the appellant Mclntyre on a charge of
rape was upheld by the Court of Appeal for Ontario with Mr. Justice Laidlaw
dissenting. As I consider there should be a new trial, I refrain from
discussing the evidence except as it may be necessary to explain my reasons for
so doing.

If the offence occurred, there is no doubt that the appellant
committed it. He admits that he had intercourse with the complainant, Eva
Pettigrew, at the time and place mentioned by her but his defence is that she
consented voluntarily. The intercourse took place about noon on a bright
Sunday, May 23rd, 1943, not far from a travelled highway in the Township of Ancaster.
The exact spot is part of the abandoned right-of-way of an electric railway
company and is described in the evidence as being about twenty feet by six feet
in area. The ground surrounding it is filled with weeds and tall grass.

After the occurrence, Eva Pettigrew complained to one or more of
the occupants of a neighbouring farm house, one of whom described the condition
of the particular

[Page 136]

area immediately thereafter as “matted down”. There would appear
to be no denial of this fact but, in view of the defence, the important
question in this connection was as to the condition of that area before the
complainant and accused had reached it. The only one who gave any evidence on
this question was the accused, who said it was “well flattened” and “the only
matted down spot in the whole territory.”

The vital point in the whole case was as to whether the
complainant consented or, if she had consented, whether such consent had been
extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm (Criminal Code, s. 298). The
trial judge told the jury that they “should be reluctant to convict in a case
of this kind upon the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant” but that “it
is within your power to do so.” He then dealt with the question “whether the
story of the complainant had been corroborated in a material aspect.” He stated
that the evidence of three people in the farm house “amply corroborates the
story as told by Eva Pettigrew in regard to some of the material aspects of
that story.” He then detailed some of these aspects and stated, as one of
them:—“They described the condition of the area twenty feet by six where the
grass was pressed down”, and concluded:—“So in several matters they
corroborated the evidence of Eva Pettigrew as she gave it in the witness box here
to-day.” Later in his charge he said:—“She says that she did not consent, and
that she was overpowered by fear when he threatened her with bodily harm.
Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or evasion—it is for you
gentlemen to say—there was a beaten down area in the grass and weeds there of
some twenty feet by six.”

It was pointed out in argument before us that the trial judge was
in error in stating that three occupants of the farm house had described the
condition of this lot where the grass was pressed down. As a matter of fact
only one had referred to it but, as we may deal only with the dissent in the
Court below, I disregard this discrepancy. All that was required was that the
corroboration should be of the evidence of the complainant that the accused had
carnal knowledge of her without her consent or with consent that had been
extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm

[Page 137]

It was not necessary that the complainant should have testified
to some particular bit of evidence before an independent witness upon that
point could corroborate her general story on the issue of consent. As part of
the Crown’s case, it was quite proper to show the condition of the particular
area when the independent witnesses arrived, and the jury would not be bound to
believe the evidence of the accused as to its condition before the occurrence.

However, that is not what the trial judge told the jury. He
instructed them that the evidence could be taken by them as corroborating her
story in regard to some of the material aspects thereof and then gave as one
aspect the condition of the area. As a matter of fact she had said nothing
about it. It was misdirection to say that evidence of the matted down condition
of the area after the occurrence could constitute corroboration of a material
aspect of the complainant’s story as to which she had not testified. It is in
this sense that I understand Mr. Justice Laidlaw’s statement:—“There could
not, of course, be corroboration, ample or otherwise, of evidence not given by
the complainant, Eva Pettigrew, and in my opinion there was a misdirection to
the jury in this matter.” In any event, later in his judgment he states:—“There
was again [referring to the same point] misdirection of such a character and
magnitude as to make the trial unfair to the appellant.”

In other parts of his charge, the trial judge had told the jury
that they were the sole judges as to what facts had been proved by the
evidence; that while it was his duty to review some of the highlights of the
evidence and to comment on them, if he saw fit, he could not pretend to review
everything and, if he expressed an opinion of the facts, they were not bound to
follow it unless their own opinion happened to be the same; and, towards the
conclusion of his charge, he stated that he did not pretend to have covered all
the evidence,—that there might be parts of it that were important that they
recalled which he had not gone over but that he was satisfied that among their
twelve joint memories they would have before them everything that was of any
real importance.

[Page 138]

These general observations, however, cannot weigh in this case
where the question of consent was of prime importance, nor does it matter that
the judge was right in pointing out other evidence which, if the jury believed
it, would warrant them in treating it as corroboration. There being
misdirection, I am unable to say that there has been no miscarriage of justice.
The fact that counsel for the accused did not object at the trial should not be
taken, in the circumstances, to indicate that the point was negligible. There
had already been one trial where the jury disagreed, and, considering the
evidence as a whole in the record before us and the importance attached to the
matted down area by the trial judge, the Crown has failed to convince me that
but for the misdirection the verdict would necessarily have been the same. Gouin
v. The King[2].

The appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new
trial directed.

The judgment of Taschereau and Kellock JJ., dissenting, was
delivered by

KELLOCK J.—This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing an appeal from the conviction of the appellant on a
charge of rape. Appellant relies upon the dissenting judgment of Laidlaw J.A.
as establishing jurisdiction in this Court pursuant to the provisions of
section 1023 of the Criminal Code.

The difference of opinion in the Court below was with regard to
certain portions of the charge of the learned trial judge. Laidlaw J.A. was of
opinion that there was material misdirection and that the Crown had not met the
onus thereby cast upon it of showing that there had been no miscarriage. The
Chief Justice of Ontario and Gillanders J.A. were of opinion that there was no
misdirection, the Chief Justice being further of the view that even if it could
be said that misdirection existed, it was quite improbable that it had had any
effect upon the result. The question in issue at the trial was as to whether or
not there had been consent on the part of the complainant, the defence being
that there had been such consent.

[Page 139]

In his charge, the learned trial judge said:

The evidence of the three gentlemen near by, the farmer Mr.
Robson, his father-in-law and his brother-in-law Scott, amply corroborates the
story as told by Eva Pettigrew in regard to some of the material aspects of
that story. In other words, they painted the scene as she has told it to you.
They found the man naked. They told you how she arrived at the house with
nothing but her skirt and jacket on, and they described (the condition of the
area twenty feet by six where the grass was pressed down. So in several matters
they corroborated the evidence of Eva Pettigrew as she gave it in the witness
box here to-day.

The complainant did not give any evidence with regard to the
condition of the area at any time. In the course of his judgment, Laidlaw J.A.,
after pointing this out, refers to the description given by complainant as to
her struggle with the appellant, and the evidence of the appellant that the
place in question was matted down at the time he and the complainant came
there. The ground of dissent was that Robson’s evidence could not amount to
corroboration of any evidence given by complainant either as to the condition
of the area or as to her struggle with the appellant, for the reason that she
had given no evidence as to the condition of the area and the extent of the
beaten down area described by Robson could not have been caused by the struggle
described by the complainant.

In considering whether or not there was misdirection in the
charge, the language of the learned trial judge is to be scrutinized to see
what the jury might reasonably be considered to have understood from it. It is,
of course, misdirection if a jury is directed to treat something as
corroboration which is not in law corroboration. In the present case, the
question is whether there is to be taken from what the learned trial judge told
the jury that the complainant had made some statement in evidence with regard
to the condition of the area which was corroborated by Robson, or whether his
charge is to be taken as referring only to her evidence as to her struggle, and
if the latter, then was the evidence of Robson in any way corroborative of it?

To my mind, the context in which the above portion of the charge
appears affords an answer to the first branch of the question.

The learned trial judge had first warned the jury that they
should be reluctant to convict upon the uncorroborated

[Page 140]

evidence of the complainant and pointed out that if they did so,
it was a very serious responsibility to assume unless her story had “been
corroborated in some material aspect”. He then proceeded to say:

It is proper that we should take just a moment to consider
as to whether the story of the complainant has been corroborated in a material
aspect. I think I need only recall to you her story as to what took place in
that gully or depression in the land that has been referred to, about her
clothes being removed, and the nature of the assault which she alleges
this man made upon her.

Then followed the portion of the charge which is objected to as
already set out above. In my opinion, the reference to the condition of the
area in the part objected to relates to the reference in the earlier part to
the complainant’s evidence as to the nature of the assault which she alleged
had been made upon her and, in my opinion, would be so understood by the jury.
The learned trial judge in a subsequent passage of his charge, returns to the
relation of the complainant’s evidence as to the assault and the existence of
the beaten down area and the bearing of the one upon the other when he said:

Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or
evasion—it is for you gentlemen to say—there was a beaten down area in the
grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by six.

I am of opinion, therefore, that in the portion of the charge
objected to as first set out above, there is no implication that the learned
trial judge was telling the jury that the complainant had made any statement
with regard to the condition of the beaten down area.

There remains to be considered the second branch of the question,
namely, as to whether or not the evidence of Robson could be properly regarded
as corroborative of the evidence of the complainant with respect to the
struggle which she alleged had taken place between herself and the appellant.
To put the matter another way, while the complainant had not said that the
grass was pressed down as the result of the struggle, she had given evidence of
a struggle and Robson’s evidence as to the condition he found would be
consistent with a struggle having taken place at that point and therefore
corroborative of the evidence of the complainant unless it were clearly
established as a matter of fact that the struggle described in evidence by the

[Page 141]

complainant was of such a limited character that it could not
have been the cause of an area of the extent described by Robson. In
considering this matter, it is to be remembered that if the complainant’s
evidence that she did not consent and that she was attacked was accepted by the
jury, the latter may well have considered that the complainant was not to be
held literally to her account of the struggle as she was not, in her agitated
condition in the circumstances of the attack, likely to have noted it in detail
or to have remembered it fully afterwards. Giving due weight to the
circumstances, the jury may well have considered that no difficulty arose in
this matter. In my view, this was a matter of fact entirely for the jury and no
ground is presented for interference by the court. This question of fact was
expressly left to the jury as such in the second passage of the charge to which
I have referred, namely: “Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or
evasion—it is for you gentlemen to say—there was a beaten down area in the
grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by six”. The learned dissenting judge
refers to this part of the charge but takes the view that the complainant’s
description of the struggle and the extent of the beaten down area were quite
inconsistent the one with the other. This is a finding of fact. With respect,
this was, in my opinion, a matter purely within the province of the jury.

The fact that appellant had given evidence that the area was
beaten down when he and the complainant first arrived at the place has no
relevancy to the point under discussion. The learned trial judge in the passage
of his charge referred to, was not dealing with any evidence given by the
appellant, but was dealing with the evidence of the complainant and some
aspects in which her evidence was corroborated by that of Robson. He had
already charged the jury—

There are two things that I wish to stress in regard to the
facts of the case as apart from the law: in my review I cannot pretend to
review everything; I try to assist you with a review of some of the more
important parts of the evidence, but that does not relieve you from your duty,
with your twelve joint memories, of recollecting and considering anything that
may be of importance in deciding the real issue

[Page 142]

in this case; and if I express an opinion on the facts, or
seem to express an opinion, you are not bound to follow my opinion unless your
own happens to be the same.

Viewing the evidence as I do, there is no question of law
involved in the dissent below, but merely matters of fact. I would, therefore,
quash the appeal.

RAND J.—This is an appeal by the accused from a conviction for
rape and comes here through the dissent in the Court of Appeal for Ontario of
Laidlaw, J.A., on a point of law.

The only issue at the trial was consent or no consent, and the
point on which the dissent arose was in relation to a portion of the judge’s
charge which dealt with corroboration.

The woman was twenty years of age and the young man eighteen. Her
story was of struggle until exhaustion, although terrified by threats of bodily
injury. The occurrence took place a short distance in the country from the city
of Hamilton in a low-lying area about twenty feet by six, over which the grass
had been beaten down until it was almost flat. Pictures of the surrounding land
indicated the grass to be fairly high and somewhat coarse and heavy.

A witness, who had reached the spot while the accused was still
there and naked, gave evidence of that state of the grass. The complainant had
not in her evidence referred to it. The accused gave a similar description of
it but added that it was in that condition when he and the complainant had come
to it. This latter feature was not challenged either in cross‑examination
or in rebuttal.

In his charge to the jury, the trial judge used the following
language:

They told you how she arrived at the house with nothing but
her skirt and jacket on, and they described the condition of the area twenty
feet by six where the grass was pressed down. So in several matters they
corroborated the evidence of Eva Pettigrew as she gave it in the witness box
here to-day.

And later in the charge:

Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or
evasion—it is for you gentlemen to say—there was a beaten down area in the
grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by six.

[Page 143]

In the peculiar circumstances of the case presented,
extraordinary even as told by the complainant, and in view of the sole issue
before the jury, I doubt that any single suggestion could have carried more
weight to incline the balance of their judgment than that the grass in this
spot might have shown the condition it did as a result of her struggles. So far,
however, from that being the fact, it is beyond controversy, on the evidence,
that the state of the surface of the area could not have furnished the
slightest corroboration to the story of the complainant or to the case of the
Crown. It was, therefore, a misdirection in law and of such a nature that we
are quite unable to say that it might not have influenced the jury in reaching
their verdict.

The conviction should, therefore, be quashed and a new trial
directed.

Appeal allowed, conviction quashed, and new trial
directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Perjury—Declaration
made by vendor pursuant to Bulk Sales Act—Statement proved to be false—Whether
offence is perjury under section 172 Cr. C.—Substitution of lesser offences
under sections 175 and 176 Cr. C—Criminal Code, sections 170, 171, 172, 173,
174, 175, 176, 951 (1), 1016 (2)—Bulks Sales Act, R.S.B.C. 1986, c. 29—British
Columbia Evidence Act, R.S.B.C., 1936, c. 90.

The Bulk Sales Act of British Columbia provides that
the vendor of any stock in bulk shall give to the purchaser a list of his
creditors with the amount of all accounts owing by him in connection with his
business. Such statement had to be verified by the solemn statutory declaration
of the vendor. The respondent sold his cafe business and gave the required
statement to the purchaser, declaring that he did not owe any debts. The
declaration proved to be false and he was convicted on a charge of perjury. The
conviction was quashed by a majority of the appellate court.

Held, affirming the judgment appealed from (58 B.C.R.
51), Kerwin and Hudson JJ. dissenting, that the respondent did not give a false
statement under oath while called as a witness in a judicial proceeding (s. 170
Cr. C.) nor did he give a false oath in a judicial proceeding in the manner
contemplated by section 172 Cr. C., and therefore, cannot be charged of having
committed the crime of perjury under these sections.

Per Rinfret and Taschereau JJ.:—Section 170 Cr. C.,
defining perjury, enacts that it may be committed only ""by a witness
in a judicial proceeding""; and section 172 Cr. C. provides that
""every one is guilty of perjury who ***"". So, any violation of this
last section amounts to perjury: it must necessarily be perjury as
defined in section 170 Cr. C. and, therefore, in a judicial proceeding.

Per Davis J.:—The concluding words of section 176 Cr.
C: ""makes a statement which would amount to perjury if made on oath in a
judicial proceeding"" show that section 172 Cr. C. is limited to false
statements made on oath in a judicial proceeding.

Per Kerwin J. dissenting:—Section 172 Cr. C. contains
no reference to section 170 Cr. C. nor does it state that the enumerated acts
must be done by a witness or in a judicial proceeding. By section 172 Cr. C.,
Parliament has enacted that every one who does the things specified is guilty
of a crime (perjury). In view of the plain language of that section, a person
falling within its terms is just as guilty of what Parliament has chosen to
call perjury as one who falls within the ambit of section 170 Cr. C—The
respondent's solemn statutory declaration contains the statement that such
declaration was of the same force and effect as if made under oath and by
virtue of the Canada Evidence Act. The declaration having been proven to
be false. the respondent was guilty of perjury under section 172 Cr. C.

[Page 104]

Per Hudson J. dissenting:—The taking of the statutory
declaration falsely by the respondent, is perjury within the meaning of section
172 Cr. C.

As to the question whether or not a conviction could or should
have been made for a lesser offence under sections 175 and 176 Cr. C., pursuant
to sections 951 (1) and 1016 (2) Cr. C.,

Held that the respondent could not have been found
guilty under 176 Cr. C.

Per Rinfret and Taschereau JJ.:—There is no evidence
that the commissioner, before whom the respondent gave the statutory
declaration, was an officer authorized by law to receive a statement or a
declaration of the particular character mentioned in section 176 Cr. C.—No
opinion expressed as to whether that section contains the elements of a lesser
offence.

Per Davis J.:—Perjury, as defined in the Criminal Code
(s. 170) does not ""include"" the commission of the offence defined in
section 176 Cr. C.; and perjury was the only offence charged in this case.

Per Kerwin J.:—The offence dealt with in section 176
Cr. C. is not a lesser offence but a different one, as the declaration
mentioned therein simpliciter is not the same as the statutory declaration
referred to in section 172 Cr. C.

Held, also, that it is not open to this Court to decide
the question whether the respondent may have been found guilty of a lesser
offence under section 175 Cr. C, as there was no dissenting opinion on that
point in the appellate court.

APPEAL by the Attorney-General
for British Columbia from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], which
(McDonald C.J.B.C. and O'Halloran J.A. dissenting in part, but on different
grounds) quashed the conviction of the respondent for perjury.

R. L. Maitland K.C. for
the appellant.

John A. Sutherland for the
respondent.

The judgment of Rinfret and
Taschereau JJ. was delivered by

TASCHEREAU J.—The Bulk Sales
Act of British Columbia provides that the vendor of any stock in bulk shall
give to the purchaser a list of his creditors, with the amount of the
indebtedness or liability due, owing, or accruing due or to become due. This
statement which has to be verified by the statutory declaration of the vendor,
may be in the form set forth in schedule A of the Act, or to the like effect.

[Page 105]

The respondent Charles T. Orford
who was the owner of a café in British
 Columbia sold his business in August,
1941, and in compliance with the law, gave the required statement to the
purchaser Mrs. Myra E. Ticehurst. He stated that all the accounts owing by him
in connection with his business were paid, whereas in fact, he owed over
$2,500. A charge was laid against him for perjury and he was convicted and
sentenced to the time spent in gaol and to pay a fine of $500.

The Court of Appeal quashed the
conviction on the ground that the accused could not be convicted of perjury,
the Chief Justice of British Columbia and O'Halloran J.A. dissenting on questions of law.
The Chief Justice thought that the taking of a statutory declaration falsely is
perjury within the meaning of section 172 of the Criminal Code, and that in any
event, perjury contrary to section 172 of the Criminal Code and making a false
oath contrary to section 176 of the Criminal Code, are cognate offences, and
that a conviction ought to be entered against Orford for taking a false oath.

Mr. Justice O'Halloran reached
the conclusion that the accused should have been found guilty of the lesser
offence of making a false declaration under section 176 Cr. C.

The Attorney General for British Columbia now appeals to this Court.

The respondent at the outset of
the argument raised the question of jurisdiction of this Court, and cited the
case of The King v. Wilmot[2].
The authority of this Court to hear criminal appeals coming from the Crown is
founded on section 1023, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code. Such an appeal
lies, when any court of appeal sets aside a conviction, or dismisses an appeal
against a judgment or verdict of acquittal, on any question of law on which
there has been dissent in the court of appeal.

In the present case, the Court of
Appeal has set aside the conviction of the respondent, and there have
undoubtedly been dissents on questions of law in the court below. I have no
hesitation in coming to the conclusion that this court has jurisdiction to hear
this appeal, and that the Wilmot case [3]
has no application. In that case, the accused was charged with manslaughter but
found

[Page 106]

guilty of driving in a manner
dangerous to the public under section 285(6) of the Criminal Code. The court
came to the conclusion that he had not been acquitted, and that therefore it
was not open to the Attorney General to appeal under section 1023(2) Cr. C. We
are confronted with an entirely different matter, because the accused has been
acquitted by the Court of Appeal.

The first submission of the Crown
is that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the offence in question did
not constitute perjury under section 172 of the Criminal Code. With deference,
I do not agree with this contention and I am of opinion that the majority of
the Court of Appeal was right.

At common law, in order to amount
to perjury, the offence had to be committed in a judicial proceeding. False
swearing was a different offence. In Canada, after Confederation, an Act respecting perjury was
introduced in Parliament in 1869 (ch. 23, 32-33 Victoria) and it is found in a
modified form in the Revised Statutes of 1886, ch. 154. The reading of this Act
will show that it was the clear intention of Parliament to do away with the existing
law, for the word ""perjury"" in the new Act did not apply only to a
witness giving evidence under oath in a judicial proceeding, but to any one,
who having taken any oath, affirmation, declaration or affidavit, in any case
in which by any Act or law in force in Canada, or in any province in Canada, it
is required or authorized that facts, matters or things be verified or
otherwise assured or ascertained. The wide extension given to the word perjury
was a complete departure from the law of England, where the Star Chamber, in 1613, declared that
perjury by a witness only was punishable at common law. Kenny in his
""Outlines of Criminal Law"", 4th ed., says at page 295:—

The common law offence of
perjury, thus created, consists in the fact that a witness, to whom an oath has
been duly administered in a judicial proceeding, gives, upon some point
material to that proceeding, testimony which he does not believe to be true. It
will thus be seen that false oaths do not always involve a perjury.

The Act of 1869 remained the law
of the land until 1893, when our Criminal Code based on the English Draft

[Page 107]

Code was enacted. We now find
section 170 Cr. C. which defines perjury as follows:—

Perjury is an assertion as
to a matter of fact, opinion, belief or knowledge, made by a witness in a
judicial proceeding as part of his evidence, upon oath or affirmation, whether
such evidence is given in open court, or by affidavit or otherwise, and whether
such evidence is material or not, such assertion being known to such witness to
be false, and being intended by him to mislead the court, jury or person
holding the proceeding.

It is for all practical purposes
a copy of the English Draft Code, except that, in Canada, it is
not necessary that the evidence given be material. But the main feature of this
section is that perjury may be committed, only by a witness in a
judicial proceeding, whether the witness gives his evidence orally, or by
affidavit or otherwise. This is obviously a return to the former notions of
perjury and a limitation of its definition to a much narrower field.

Our section 171 Cr. C, which is
also found in the Draft Code, defines what is a judicial proceeding and it
states that every proceeding is judicial which is held not only under the
authority of a Court of Justice, but also before a grand jury, or before the
Senate or House of Commons or a committee of either House, or similar bodies.

The Criminal Code deals also with
false oaths which would amount to perjury if made in judicial proceedings.
Section 175 Cr. C, different from 122 of the Draft Code only in its
phraseology, reads as follows:—

Every one is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to seven years' imprisonment who, being required
or authorized by law to make any statement on oath, affirmation or solemn
declaration, thereupon makes a statement which would amount to perjury if made
in a judicial proceeding.

This section covers the case of a
false oath given in a non-judicial proceeding. It is not called perjury, but is
merely described as being an indictable offence.

Then comes section 176 Cr. C.
drafted as follows:—

Every one is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to two years' imprisonment who, upon any occasion
on which he is permitted by law to make any statement or declaration before any
officer authorized by law to permit it to be made before him, or before any
notary public to be certified by him as such notary, makes a statement which
would amount to perjury if made on oath in a judicial proceeding.

[Page 108]

It is significant that as in the
Draft Code the legislator uses the words ""any statement or
declaration"". We do not find as in section 175 Cr. C. ""statement on oath
or solemn declaration"". It was not sure if the giving of a false
statement or declaration not on oath to a person authorized by law to permit it
to be made before him, was a common law misdemeanour, but in their report the
English Commissioners said:—

False statements not on oath
to which faith is given are not perjury, etc.

But they felt that it should be
made indictable and proposed the enactment of section 123 which we have adopted
and embodied in our Code. It is now section 176 Cr. C. It cannot be said that
any untrue statement or false declaration is an offence under this section. But
when the false statement is given to a person authorized by law to require it,
it is an offence as it would be for instance in the case of an authorized
custom or excise officer to whom a false statement is given.

It can now be seen that the law
deals with three different offences: The crime of perjury, always committed by
a witness in a judicial proceeding; the indictable offence of giving a false
oath in a non-judicial matter; and the last, the indictable offence of giving a
false statement, not under oath, to a person authorized by law to receive it.
For those three offences the punishment is different. The gravest of all is
obviously perjury, because made in a judicial proceeding, and which renders the
offender liable to 14 years' imprisonment. The second, less serious because
extra-judicial, provides for a penalty of seven years; and the third one of a
minor character, where the penalty is only two years.

But the Criminal Code contains
another section, which is section 172 and which is not in the English Draft
Code. It is as follows:—

Every one is guilty of
perjury who,

Having taken or made any
oath, affirmation, solemn declaration or affidavit where, by any Act or law in
force in Canada, or in any province of Canada, it is required or permitted that
facts, matters or things be verified, or otherwise assured or ascertained by or
upon the oath,

[Page 109]

affirmation, declaration or
affidavit of any person, wilfully and corruptly, upon such oath, affirmation,
declaration or affidavit, deposes, swears to or makes any false statement as to
any such fact, matter or thing; or 

Knowingly, wilfully and
corruptly, upon oath, affirmation or solemn declaration, affirms, declares or
deposes to the truth of any statement for so verifying, assuring or
ascertaining any such fact, matter or thing, or purporting so to do, or
knowingly, wilfully and corruptly takes, makes, signs or subscribes any such
affirmation, declaration or affidavit as to any such fact, matter or thing, if
such statement, affidavit, affirmation or declaration is untrue in whole or in
part.

The appellant contends that the
offence committed by the accused is covered by paragraph 2 of this section, a
false oath being in a non-judicial matter. I do not think that section 172 Cr.
C. can be interpreted in the manner suggested by the appellant.

Any violation of this section
amounts to perjury. ""Every one is guilty of perjury who""
etc. says section 172 Cr. C. It must necessarily be perjury as defined in
section 170 Cr. C. and therefore in a judicial proceeding, otherwise, we would
have to reach the illogical conclusion that 172 and 175 Cr. C. both cover extra-judicial
oaths, although the punishment for violating 172 Cr. C. is 14 years, and 7
years for 175 Cr. C.

The crimes described in sections
175 and 176 Cr. C. are not qualified as ""perjury"" but it is said in
both sections, that they would amount to perjury ""if made in a judicial
proceeding"", and these last words are omitted from 172 Cr. C, obviously
because they are unnecessary. The intention of the legislator in enacting
section 172 Cr. C. was not to repeat what was already enacted in section 175
Cr. C. concerning extra-judicial oaths, but to declare that it would be a crime
amounting to perjury, for any person other than a witness (whose case is
covered by section 170 Cr. C.), to give a false statement under oath, in a
judicial proceeding. And it is very frequent that affidavits have to be given
in judicial proceedings by persons who are not witnesses, as for instance
affidavits by plaintiffs in civil actions, before the writ of summons may be
issued.

This is, to my mind, the case
which the legislator had in mind when he enacted section 172 Cr. C, and which
otherwise would not amount to a crime under the Criminal Code. Indeed, it would
not be an offence under 170 Cr. C. because the false oath would not have been
given

[Page 110]

by a witness, and it cannot be
said that it would be a violation of section 175 Cr. C. because the oath would
be given in a judicial proceeding.

In the present case, the
respondent did not give a false statement under oath while called as a witness
in a judicial proceeding, nor did he give a false oath in a judicial proceeding
in the manner contemplated by section 172 Cr. C, and therefore, he cannot be
charged of having committed the crime of perjury.

Did the respondent commit a
lesser offence, and should he have been found guilty under sections 175 or 176
Cr. C? It seems useless to examine the question as to whether section 175 Cr.
C. could apply, because there is no dissenting judgment on this point in the Court
of Appeal, and our jurisdiction being limited to questions of law on which
there has been a dissent, it is not open to us to deal with the matter. The
contention that section 176 Cr. C. applies is found in both dissenting
opinions, and it is based on section 951 of the Criminal Code which says:—

Every count shall be deemed
divisible; and if the commission of the offence charged, as described in the
enactment creating the offence or as charged in the count, includes the
commission of any other offence, the person accused may be convicted of any
offence so included which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not
proved; or he may be convicted of an attempt to commit any offence so included.

It is most important to note in
this section the words ""may be convicted of any offence so included, which
is proved"".

It has been proved that on the
11th of August, 1941, the respondent gave a statutory declaration under oath
before John P. Berry, a commissioner for taking affidavits within British Columbia. But in order to find the respondent guilty under section 176 Cr. C, it
would be necessary that there should be some evidence to show that John P.
Berry is an officer authorized by law to receive a statement or declaration
under 176 Cr. C. John P. Berry may be a person authorized to receive a
statement under oath, but there is nothing to show that he is an officer
authorized by a statute to receive a statement or a declaration of the
particular character mentioned in section 176 Cr. C. The falsity of the contents
of such 

[Page 111]

a declaration or statement
amounts to a crime only when the statement or declaration is made before such
officers which are empowered, in view of the functions they occupy, to receive
them. It has not been established that Berry was clothed with such authority.

This reason is, I think,
sufficient to dispose of this last point raised by the appellant, and in view
of my conclusion, it is unnecessary to express any opinion as to whether
section 176 Cr. C. contains the elements of a lesser offence.

The appeal should be dismissed.

DAVIS J.—The respondent was charged and convicted of
perjury. On appeal the Court of Appeal for British Columbia set aside the
conviction, the Chief Justice and O'Halloran J., dissenting. The Attorney
General of British Columbia appealed to this court.

The charge was perjury but it was
not stated to have been laid under any particular section of the Criminal Code.
The majority of the judges of the Court of Appeal agreed that the facts did not
bring the case within the definition of perjury in the Criminal Code; the
statutory declaration made by the respondent under sec. 5 of the Bulk Sales
Act of British Columbia not being made in a judicial proceeding. See secs.
170, 171 and 172 of the Criminal Code. By sec. 174 Cr. C. everyone is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to 14 years' imprisonment who commits perjury
or subornation of perjury; if the crime is committed in order to procure the
conviction of a person for any crime punishable by death, or imprisonment for
seven years or more, the punishment may be imprisonment for life.

The two dissenting judges in the
Court of Appeal thought that a conviction could have been made under sec. 176
Cr. C.:

176. Every one is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to two years' imprisonment who, upon any
occasion on which he is permitted by law to make any statement or declaration
before any officer authorized by law to permit it to be made before him, or
before any notary public to be certified by him as such notary, makes a
statement which would amount to perjury if made on oath in a judicial
proceeding.

The concluding words,

makes a statement which
would amount to perjury if made on oath in a judicial proceeding,

[Page 112]

show, I think, that sec. 172 Cr.
C. is limited to false statements made on oath in a judicial proceeding. I
think as a matter of proper construction one is not justified in reading two
different sections of the Criminal Code (secs. 172 and 176) as if they covered
the same thing, but that the construction should be approached in an endeavour
to give to each of the sections its own independent meaning. Here we have secs.
170, 171, 172 and 173 Cr. C. defining perjury, followed in 174 Cr. C. with a
very heavy penalty. Subsequently sec. 176 Cr. C. deals with certain false
statements or declarations ""which would amount to perjury if made on oath
in a judicial proceeding,"" and the penalty is two years' imprisonment. Mr.
Justice Taschereau has set out in his judgment all the relevant sections of the
Code and has very carefully considered their origin and scope.

In considering the question
whether or not a conviction could and should have been made under sec. 176 Cr.
C. (sec. 175 Cr. C. may have had some application but is not relied on in the
dissents), much confusion of thought is likely to be avoided if we keep to the
exact words of the statute instead of adopting other words such as ""lesser
offences"" and ""cognate offences"" which have not infrequently
been used in many of the decisions. Under sec. 951 Cr. C. the offence charged
must ""include"" the commission of the ""other offence."" It is
contended that by virtue of sec. 951 Cr. C. the Court of Appeal could and
should have substituted a conviction under sec. 176 Cr. C. for making a false declaration
under the Bulk Sales Act of British
 Columbia. But in my opinion perjury as
defined in the statute does not ""include"" the commission of the
offence defined in sec. 176 Cr. C. Nor could sec. 1016 (2) Cr. C. empower the
Court of Appeal on the facts of this case to substitute a conviction under sec.
176 Cr. C. Sec. 1016 (2) Cr. C. applies only where an appellant has been
convicted of an offence and the jury or, as the case may be, the judge or
magistrate, could ""on the indictment"" have found him guilty of some
other offence. Perjury was here the only offence charged. See Rex v. Leroux
[4].

I should dismiss the appeal.

[Page 113]

KERWIN J. (dissenting).—This is
an appeal by the Attorney General for British Columbia from an order of the
Court of Appeal for that province quashing the conviction for perjury of the
respondent Charles T. Orford. The appeal is based upon the dissents on
questions of law of the Chief Justice of British Columbia and Mr. Justice
O'Halloran.

The conviction was made after the
trial of the respondent on a charge:—

1. For that he, the said
Charles T. Orford, at the said City of Vancouver, on the 11th day of August,
A.D. 1941, being permitted by the Canada Evidence Act to verify certain
facts relating to his financial obligations by solemn declaration, unlawfully
did commit perjury by knowingly, wilfully and corruptly by solemn declaration,
declaring that he did not owe any debts, in respect of Good Eats Cafe and
Station View Apartments such declaration being false, contrary to the form of
the Statute in such case made and provided.

Orford had carried on businesses
under the name of ""Good Eats Café” and ""Station View Apartments""
and on August 11th, 1941, contracted to sell his stock of goods and chattels
in bulk. The Bulk Sales Act of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1936, chapter
29, provides that in such circumstances it shall be the duty of the vendor to
furnish to the purchaser a written statement verified by statutory declaration,
which statement shall contain the names and addresses of all his creditors,
together with the amount of the indebtedness, and that such statement and
declaration may be in the form set forth in schedule A. This form concludes

and I make this solemn
declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true and knowing that it
is of the same force and effect as if made under oath and by virtue of the Canada
Evidence Act.

Orford made a statement and
statutory declaration substantially in the form prescribed but the declaration
was false in that Orford did not disclose all his creditors and the charge for
perjury followed. The majority of the Court of Appeal decided that Orford was
not guilty of perjury or of any lesser offence within the meaning of section
951 of the Criminal Code or of ""any other offence"" within the meaning
of subsection 2 of section 1016 Cr. C, and that the conviction should be
quashed.

The determination of this appeal
depends upon a consideration of several sections of the Criminal Code. Section
170 Cr. C. defines ""perjury"" and section 171 Cr. C. 

[Page 114]

defines ""witness"" and
""judicial proceeding"" as those expressions are used in section 170
Cr. C. Then comes the section principally relied on by the appellant, section
172 Cr. C, which reads as follows:—

172. Every one is guilty of
perjury who,

(a) having taken or
made any oath, affirmation, solemn declaration or affidavit where, by any Act
or law in force in Canada, or in any province of Canada, it is required or
permitted that facts, matters or things be verified, or otherwise assured or
ascertained by or upon the oath, affirmation, declaration or affidavit of any
person, wilfully and corruptly, upon such oath, affirmation, declaration or
affidavit, deposes, swears to or makes any false statement as to any such fact,
matter or thing; or

(b) knowingly,
wilfully and corruptly, upon oath, affirmation or solemn declaration, affirms,
declares or deposes to the truth of any statement for so verifying, assuring or
ascertaining any such fact, matter or thing, or purporting so to do, or
knowingly, wilfully, and corruptly takes, makes, signs or subscribes any such
affirmation, declaration or affidavit as to any such fact, matter or thing, if
such statement, affidavit, affirmation or declaration is untrue in whole or in
part.

Section 174 Cr. C. enacts that
every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to fourteen years'
imprisonment who commits perjury, with provision for an increased penalty in
certain circumstances. Sections 175 and 176 Cr. C. are as follows:—

175. Every one is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to seven years imprisonment who, being
required or authorized by law to make any statement on oath, affirmation or
solemn declaration, thereupon makes a statement which would amount to perjury
if made in a judicial proceeding.

176. Every one is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to two years' imprisonment who, upon any
occasion on which he is permitted by law to make any statement or declaration
before any officer authorized by law to permit it to be made before him, or
before any notary public to be certified by him as such notary, makes a
statement which would amount to perjury if made on oath in a judicial
proceeding.

I find it impossible to say that
Orford's conviction for perjury on the charge as laid against him is bad
because what he did was not done in a judicial proceeding. I agree with Chief
Justice Graham of Nova Scotia when he stated in Rex v. Morrison [5]
that sections 172 and 175 Cr. C. overlap and probably mean the same thing. As
he points out, section 172 Cr. C. is taken from R.S.C. 1886, chapter 154, while
section 175 Cr. C. is taken from the English Draft Code. In Rex v. Rutherford
[6]
Mr. Justice McKay of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal,

[Page 115]

quotes the first of these
statements with approval and his judgment was concurred in by the present Chief
Justice of Saskatchewan.

While sections 172 and 175 Cr. C.
overlap, Parliament has seen fit to insert each in the Criminal Code and I
cannot overlook the words of section 172 Cr. C.: ""Every one is guilty of
perjury who, etc."", and treat them as if they were not there. Section 172
Cr. C. contains no reference to section 170 Cr. C. nor does it state that the
enumerated acts must be done by a witness or in a judicial proceeding. By
section 172 Cr. C, Parliament has enacted that every one who does the things
specified is just as guilty of a crime (perjury) as one who comes within the
provisions of section 170 Cr. C. Upon conviction, each becomes liable to a
penalty in accordance with section 174 Cr. C. whether or not his actions be
those of a witness or in a judicial proceeding. In view of what, with respect,
is to me the plain language of section 172 Cr. C, a person falling within its
terms is just as guilty of what Parliament has chosen to call perjury as one
who falls within the ambit of section 170 Cr. C. No doubt, in view of the
overlapping of sections 172 and 175 Cr. C, the presiding judge would consider
the gravity of a particular offence in imposing sentence.

The solemn declaration taken by
the respondent was required by the British Columbia Bulk Sales Act.
Section 63 of the British Columbia Evidence Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, chapter
90, provides that any declaration made in the form in the schedule to that Act
shall be as valid and effectual as if expressed to be made by virtue of that
Act, notwithstanding that the same is expressed to be made by virtue of the Canada
Evidence Act. The conclusion in the form in the schedule is practically the
same as the conclusion in the form attached as schedule A to the Bulk Sales
Act. In the present case Orford's statutory declaration was taken before
one who testified that he was a commissioner for taking affidavits in the
province and it states that the declaration was of the same force and effect as
if made under oath and by virtue of the Canada Evidence Act. In one
sense, therefore, it might be said that Orford was

""permitted by the Canada
Evidence Act to verify certain facts relating to his financial
obligations""

[Page 116]

by solemn declaration, but, even
if that be not so, the words in quotation marks may be treated as surplusage,
and the charge as drawn is sufficient.

If the conviction were not
sustainable under section 172 Cr. C, Orford could not legally have been
convicted under section 951 of the Criminal Code as for an offence under
section 176 Cr. C, nor could the Court of Appeal proceed under subsection 2 of
section 1016 Cr. C. The offence dealt with in section 176 Cr. C. is not a
lesser offence but a different one, as the declaration mentioned therein
simpliciter is not the same as the statutory declaration referred to in section
172 Cr. C. Counsel for the appellant referred to section 175 Cr. C. but we have
no jurisdiction to consider the applicability of that section as no dissent in
the Court of Appeal was based upon the point.

The appeal should be allowed and
the conviction restored.

HUDSON J. (dissenting).—The only
ground of dissent from the judgment of the court below to which I wish to refer
is the second, namely, that the taking of a statutory declaration falsely is
perjury within the meaning of section 172 of the Criminal Code. There are
differences of opinion in this court and in the court below on this point and,
with respect, I am of the opinion that the dissent on this point is right. As
has been pointed out by other members of the court, this section of the
Criminal Code is of purely Canadian origin and was in force in Canada long
before the Criminal Code was passed.

Looking at the statute, chapter
154, R.S.C. 1886, section 2 is as follows:

2. Every one who,—

(a) Having taken any
oath, affirmation, declaration or affidavit in any case in which by any Act or
law in force in Canada, or in any province of Canada, it is required or
authorized that facts, matters or things be verified, or otherwise assured or
ascertained, by or upon the oath, affirmation, declaration or affidavit of any
person, wilfully and corruptly, upon such oath, affirmation, declaration or
affidavit, deposes, swears to or makes any false statement as to any such fact,
matter or thing—

(b) Knowingly,
wilfully and corruptly, upon oath or affirmation, affirms, declares or deposes
to the truth of any statement for so verifying, assuring or ascertaining any
such fact, matter or thing, or purporting so to do, or knowingly, wilfully and
corruptly takes, makes, 

[Page 117]

signs or subscribes any such
affirmation, declaration or affidavit, as to any such fact, matter or thing,—such
statement, affidavit, affirmation or declaration being untrue, in the whole or
any part thereof, or—

(c) Knowingly,
wilfully and corruptly omits from any such affidavit, affirmation, or
declaration, sworn or made under the provisions of any law, any matter which,
by the provisions of such law, is required to be stated in such affidavit,
affirmation or declaration,—

Is guilty of wilful and
corrupt perjury, and liable to be punished accordingly:

It also contains a proviso as
follows:

(2) Provided, that nothing
herein contained shall affect any case amounting to perjury at common law, or
the case of any offence in respect of which other or special provision is made
by any Act.

The language is quite plain and
it seems to me that there is no justification for reading any qualification in
the section as it thus stands.

When the Criminal Code was
compiled this section was included in almost precisely the same language. The
existence of other sections of the Criminal Code providing for punishment of
other offences of the same character does not seem to be a sufficient
justification for reading into section 172 Cr. C. an intention by Parliament to
attach a new meaning to the language of the old provision.

The section has been so construed
by the Court in Banc in Nova Scotia in Rex v. Morrison [7],
and again by the same court in 1924 in The United States v. Snyder
[8],
and by the Court of Appeal in Saskatchewan in 1923, consisting of Justices Lamont, Mackay and
Martin, in the case of Rex v. Rutherford [9].
The matter had been decided in the same way by the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories in Regina v. Skelton [10].

On the other points I agree with
the other members of the court.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Conspiracy—Charge of offences
under The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929 (Dom. c. 49)—Corroboration—Admission
in evidence of certain written statement—Substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice (Cr. Code, s. 1014 (2))—Insufficiency of explanation to jury—Appellant
convicted, while another accused, charged with him, found not guilty on
subsequent separate trial—Trial Judge expressing his personal opinion to jury
as to character of witnesses—Objection to count because of vagueness and
generality to be taken before plea (Cr. Code, s. 898).

Appellant and B. and C. were charged on an
indictment containing 16 counts: 13 for conspiracy relating to the possession,
distribution and sale of drugs; two for conspiracy relating to, respectively,
the signing of prescriptions and the signing of orders, in respect of a drug;
and one charging them with selling a drug; all within the meaning of and
contrary to the provisions of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act,

[Page 99]

1929 (Dom., c.
49). C. was given a separate trial, which took place subsequent to appellant's
trial, and C. was found not guilty. Appellant, on trial before Major J. and a
jury, was convicted on all counts. His appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed, Robson J.A.
dissenting, [1942] 2 W.W.R. 580; [1942] 3 D.L.R. 500; and he appealed to this
Court.

Held: A new
trial should be directed because (agreeing with certain grounds of dissent in
the Court of Appeal): (1) Certain evidence referred to by the trial Judge as
corroboration could not be considered by the jury as such; it was merely
evidence of opportunity.

(2) A certain written statement obtained by
the police from one E. P. (a, person mentioned in the indictment in connection
with certain charges) was improperly admitted in evidence; s. 10 of the Canada
Evidence Act had no application; the fact that accused's counsel had
referred to the statement in cross-examination was not sufficient to permit it
to be put in evidence; the statement was made when accused was not present,
and, while the majority of the Court of Appeal considered that there was
nothing therein that E. P. did not say in the witness box, there were matters
referred to in the statement which were clearly hearsay; it could not be
confidently stated that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had
occurred, within the meaning of s. 1014 (2), Cr. Code. (3) While the
trial Judge's general statement to the jury of the law of conspiracy might be
unimpeachable, it was of the utmost importance in this case that the
application of the law to the facts should be explained fully to the jury,
particularly so far as the evidence relating to C.'s activities were concerned;
the counts charging conspiracy to have C. unlawfully sign prescriptions and
orders, required a much fuller explanation than was given.

In disagreeing with certain grounds of
dissent in the Court of Appeal, this Court held: (1) The fact that C., on a
separate trial as aforesaid, was found not guilty, was no reason in law that
appellant should be acquitted. (2) On the new trial, it would be for the jury
to say if the conspiracy alleged between C. and accused was proved beyond a
reasonable doubt; evidence of C.'s actions on which, together with any other
relevant evidence, the jury might so find, was admissible.

(3) The trial Judge was within his province
in expressing his personal opinion as to the character of the police witnesses,
as he made it clear throughout his charge that all questions of fact were for
the jury and that the jury was not bound by his opinion. (4) The objection
taken to a count of the indictment because of vagueness and generality, should
have been taken under s. 898, Cr. Code, before the accused pleaded.

APPEAL by Forsythe, one of the accused, from
the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba [1]
dismissing (Robson J.A. dissenting) his appeal from his conviction, on a trial
before Major J. and a jury, for the offences hereinafter mentioned.

The appellant and two others, Bisson and
Carson, were charged on an indictment containing 16 counts—13 for

[Page 100]

conspiracy relating to the possession,
distribution and sale of drugs; two for conspiracy relating to, respectively,
the signing of prescriptions and the signing of orders, in respect of a drug;
and one, the last count, charging them with selling a drug; all within the
meaning of and contrary to the provisions of The Opium and Narcotic Drug
Act, 1929 (Statutes of Canada, 1929, c. 49).

On motion on behalf of Carson, a severance of his trial from the
trial of the other accused was ordered, and the trial proceeded against the
other accused. On the trial of Carson, subsequently, he was found not guilty.

Forsythe was convicted on all counts. He
appealed to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. His appeal was dismissed, Robson J.A. dissenting on a number of
grounds (with some of which this Court agreed, in directing a new trial); he
would have allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction. Forsythe appealed to
this Court.

Wray, Schaf, Lillian Young and Elizabeth
Pitt, referred to in the reasons for judgment of this Court now reported, were
persons mentioned in the indictment in connection with charges therein.

Counts 6 and 7 of the indictment, referred to
in the reasons for judgment of this Court as requiring a much fuller
explanation than was given to the jury, were charges of conspiracy to have the
said Carson, alleged in the charges to be a veterinary surgeon within the
meaning of said Act, unlawfully sign prescriptions and unlawfully sign orders,
respectively, for the filling of which diacetylmorphine, a drug within the
meaning of said Act, was required, said drug not being required for medicinal
purposes in connection with his practice as a veterinary surgeon.

By the judgment of this Court now reported, the
appeal was allowed and a new trial directed.

H. P. Blackwood K.C. for the appellant.

A. M. Shinbane K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Kerwin J.—This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba dismissing an appeal by the accused Forsythe against his conviction on
thirteen counts of conspiracy relating to the possession, distribution and sale
of drugs, one charge or count relating to the

[Page 101]

signing of prescriptions in respect of a drug,
one charge or count relating to the signing of orders respecting a drug and one
charge or count relating to the sale of drugs, all within the meaning of and
contrary to the provisions of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act of Canada. Mr. Justice Robson dissented on twelve
separate grounds set out in the formal order of the Court of Appeal and would
not only have ordered a new trial but would have acquitted the accused. We do
not agree that Forsythe should be acquitted, but, as a new trial is being
directed, as little as possible will be said about the evidence.

The accused was indicted jointly with one Carson; a severance was granted with
respect to Carson who, on his trial subsequent to Forsythe's conviction, was
found not guilty. This circumstance is no reason in law that the appellant
should be acquitted. The trial judge was within his province in expressing his
personal opinion as to the character of the police witnesses, as he made it
clear throughout his charge that all questions of fact were for the jury and that
the latter were not bound by his opinion. On the new trial, it will be for the
jury to say if the conspiracy alleged between Carson and the accused is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Evidence of Carson's actions on which, together with
any other relevant evidence, the jury might so find, is admissible. These
remarks dispose of grounds of dissent 1 to 4 inclusive.

As to ground 5, we agree with Mr. Justice Robson
that what was referred to by the trial Judge as corroboration could not be
considered by the jury as such; that is the evidence by the stenographer in
Forsythe and Bisson's office that she saw Wray and Schaf, at different times,
in the office when apparently they had no business there, and the evidence of a
witness who had seen Lillian Young with Bisson in an auction sales room. All
this would be merely evidence of opportunity and is not corroboration. Burbury
v. Jackson[2];
The King v. Baskerville[3].
On this ground a new trial should be directed.

A new trial should also be directed because the
written statement obtained by the police from Elizabeth Pitt was improperly
admitted (ground 6 of dissent). Section 10 of the Canada Evidence Act, referred
to by the trial Judge, has no application, and counsel for the Crown

[Page 102]

before us so admitted. It was suggested that the
statement was admissible since counsel for the accused had referred to it in
cross-examination. It is true that the latter did ask Mrs. Pitt if she had
signed a statement for the police; that she admitted that she had done so but
stated there was an error in the statement. This, however, is not sufficient to
permit it to be put in evidence. The statement was made when the accused was
not present and, while the majority of the Court of Appeal considered there was
nothing in the statement that Elizabeth Pitt did not say in the witness box,
there are two or three matters referred to in the statement which are clearly
hearsay. We are unable to agree that, within the meaning of subsection 2 of
section 1014 of the Criminal Code, it can be confidently stated that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.

There is nothing in grounds 7 to 9 inclusive
upon which a new trial should be directed because, subject to what is stated
presently, the case for the defence was put to the jury, and the trial Judge
did not exclude or qualify legitimate cross-examination by counsel for the
defence of Crown witnesses. As to grounds 10 to 12, it may be stated that any
objection to count 16 of the indictment because of vagueness and generality should
have been taken under section 898 of the Code before the accused
pleaded. However, while the general statement of the law of conspiracy made by
the trial Judge may be unimpeachable, it was of the utmost importance in this
case that the application of the law to the facts should be explained fully to
the jury, particularly so far as the evidence relating to Carson's activities was concerned. Counts 6
and 7 required a much fuller explanation than was given. For this third reason
a new trial is directed.

In view of the statement before us of counsel
for the respondent, no doubt the Crown authorities will consider whether it is
advisable that the accused should be tried on an indictment containing a less
number of counts, leaving it to him, if so advised, to demand particulars.

Appeal allowed and new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION

Malicious prosecution—Claim for damages for—Issue as to
absence of reasonable and probable cause for prosecution—Questions relevant to
that issue—Trial Judge's charge to jury.

[Page 82]

On a claim for damages for malicious prosecution, plaintiff
recovered judgment at trial, on the findings of a jury. The Supreme Court of
Alberta, Appellate Division, [1942] 1 W.W.R. 646, set aside the judgment and
ordered a new trial, on the ground, as stated by Ford J. A., that the

[Page 83]

trial Judge's charge to the jury ""may have resulted in
confounding the real issue of the absence of reasonable and probable cause for
the prosecution with the question of the guilt or innocence of the plaintiff,
and that the learned Judge failed to keep in mind that it is the facts,
honestly and reasonably believed to exist and to be true, operating upon the
mind of the prosecutor, as distinct from the explanation made at the trial by
the plaintiff, which alone are relevant on the issue of the absence of
reasonable and probable cause.""

Plaintiff appealed to this Court, asking that the judgment at
trial be restored; and defendants cross-appealed, contending that, on the
evidence, and in view of requirements of the law as to facts to be proved, the
action should be dismissed.

Held:(1) Plaintiff's appeal should be dismissed, on the
above ground stated in the Appellate Division.

(2) Defendants' cross-appeal should be dismissed (Davis J. dubitante).

APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta, Appellate Division[1], which,
on appeal by the defendants from the judgment of Ewing J. at trial, on the
findings of a jury, in favour of the plaintiff on a claim for damages for
malicious prosecution, set aside the judgment at trial and ordered a new trial.
The plaintiff asked that the judgment at trial be restored. The defendants
cross-appealed, contending that, on the evidence, and in view of requirements
of the law as to facts to be proved, the action should be dismissed.

N. D. Maclean K.C. and Gerald O'Connor K.C. for
the appellant.

H. H. Parlee K.C. for the respondent companies.

H. W. Riley for the respondent individuals.

The judgment of Rinfret, Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered
by

HUDSON, J.—This action was brought by the appellant
claiming damages for alleged(1) conspiracy to injure him in his business;(2)
libel and slander; and(3) malicious prosecution.

The action was tried before Mr. Justice Ewing and a jury. At the
opening of the trial, counsel for the respondents moved to have the issues
tried separately but, as the issues of fact were closely connected, severance
was refused and the trial proceeded on all three.

[Page 84]

At the conclusion of the evidence, questions were submitted by
the Judge to the jury: four questions in respect of the conspiracy issues, and
four in respect of the charge of libel and slander. These were all answered
favourably to the respondents and no longer require consideration.

Eight questions were submitted in respect of the malicious
prosecution. These were all answered favourably to the appellant, and on such
answers the learned trial Judge directed judgment to be entered for the
appellant for $16,667.90 and costs.

On appeal, this judgment was set aside and a new trial ordered on
the ground of failure by the trial Judge to properly instruct the jury on
questions of fact relating to reasonable and probable cause.

The appellant here asks that the judgment at the trial be
restored and the respondent asks that the appeal be dismissed and, by way of
cross-appeal, asks that the action be dismissed.

The actual prosecution of which the appellant complains was
initiated by a police officer under direct instructions from responsible
officials of the Attorney-General's Department in Alberta. The proceedings
throughout were conducted solely by Crown counsel.

The appellant alleges that the respondents induced such action by
false reports and fraudulent concealment of material facts and without
reasonable and probable cause procured the laying of information, and that one
of the defendants, Nash, had actually committed perjury in giving evidence at
the trial.

On the criminal charge the appellant was committed for trial but,
subsequently, before a jury was acquitted. An appeal by the Crown from this
acquittal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in Alberta, two of the Judges of
that court dissenting.

On the trial of the present action, questions were submitted to
the jury by the trial Judge and answers were given as follows:

(B) MALICIOUS PROSECUTION:

The CLERK (Reading):

1. Q. Did the defendants procure the plaintiff's prosecution
or did the Attorney General act on his own motion in prosecuting the plaintiff?
—A. The defendants procured the prosecution.

2. Q. Did the defendants place the facts fairly before the
Officers of the Attorney General?—A. No.

[Page 85]

3. Q. If the defendants did not place the facts fairly
before the Officers of the Attorney General were the Officers of the Attorney
General misled?—A. Yes.

4. Q. Did the defendants neglect to take reasonable care to
inform themselves of the true facts before procuring the prosecution?—A. No.
(Afterwards corrected to ""Yes"".)

5. Q. Did the defendants have an honest belief in the probable
guilt of the plaintiff?—A. No.

6. Q. Upon the facts in their knowledge were the defendants
justified in such belief?—A. No.

7. Q. Were the defendants, as far as the prosecution is
concerned, actuated by malice as legally defined?—A. Yes.

8. Q. If you find for the plaintiff at what sum do you
assess the plaintiff's damages for malicious prosecution?—A. Special damages,
$6,667.90; General damages, $10,000.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal directing a new trial
proceeded upon the ground as stated by Mr. Justice Ford:

The ground upon which the verdict and judgment cannot be
allowed to stand is that, with great respect, I think it may fairly be said
that the learned Judge's charge to the Jury may have resulted in confounding
the real issue of the absence of reasonable and probable cause for the
prosecution with the question of the guilt or innocence of the plaintiff, and
that the learned Judge failed to keep in mind that it is the facts, honestly
and reasonably believed to exist and to be true, operating upon the mind of the
prosecutor, as distinct from the explanation made at the trial by the
plaintiff, which alone are relevant on the issue of the absence of reasonable
and probable cause.

Careful perusal of the evidence and the charge of the learned
trial Judge to the jury has convinced me that the defendants are at least
entitled to a new trial on the ground thus stated by Mr. Justice Ford.

The respondents, however, go further and press strongly for a
dismissal of the action, and this raises a more difficult question.

The basis of the respondents' contention is that it appears that
three responsible officers of the Crown charged with the administration of
criminal law in the Province of Alberta were witnesses at the trial and stated
in clear and unequivocal language their justification for the prosecution of a
suspected wrongdoer. It is further submitted that the Crown officers say that
there was no pressure brought upon them to prosecute the appellant, nor were
they misled in any way by the reports made by or on behalf of the respondents.

The appellant here answers this by referring to the answers given
by the jury, that the defendants procured

[Page 86]

the plaintiff's prosecution, that they
did not place the facts clearly before the officers of the Attorney General,
that the officers of the Attorney General were misled, that the defendants
neglected to take reasonable care to inform themselves of the true facts before
procuring prosecution, that the defendants did not have an honest belief in the
probable guilt of the plaintiff and were not justified in any such belief by
the facts in their knowledge and were guided by their malice.

It is also contended that there was evidence that, in order to
induce the Attorney-General's Department to prosecute, the respondents had
furnished completely false statements.

These issues were all placed before the jury, perhaps not so
clearly as they should have been but, undoubtedly, the learned trial Judge was
of the opinion that there was evidence to justify submission of the questions.
The learned Judges in appeal were also of that opinion. Mr. Justice Ford says:

There was, in my opinion, some evidence to submit to the
Jury upon whose finding thereon the trial Judge might have found an absence of
reasonable and probable cause, and I think it is improper, in this appeal, to
dismiss the action as asked for by the appellants, there being also some
evidence to support a finding of malice.

There was also evidence upon which it could be found that
the defendants procured the prosecution of the plaintiff on the charge upon
which he was acquitted.

If the jury had understood clearly that in making their answers
they were in effect saying that they did not believe the evidence of Crown
counsel, their answers might have been different. However, these are questions
of fact and, on the state of the record, I am not disposed to interfere with
the course directed by the Court of Appeal and should, therefore, dismiss the
appeal and cross-appeal with costs.

DAVIS, J.—The only claim, amongst several in the action
out of which this appeal arises, with which we are concerned is the claim for
malicious prosecution, in respect of which judgment was given at the trial,
upon the verdict of a jury, for the appellant (plaintiff) against all the
respondents (defendants) in the sum of $16,667.90
and costs fixed at $5,000.
The Court of Appeal for Alberta set aside the judgment and directed a new
trial. Both parties appealed to this Court; the appellant seeking to

[Page 87]

have the trial judgment restored and the
respondents seeking by cross-appeal to have the action dismissed.

The action was brought against eleven defendants (seven fire
insurance companies and four individuals who were employees of a fire insurance
investigation bureau). There were two claims of conspiracy: one of an alleged
conspiracy to injure the plaintiff in his trade and business, and the other an
alleged conspiracy to procure him to be prosecuted for obtaining money by false
pretences; three claims for slander; claims for twelve separate libels; and a
claim for malicious prosecution. Some of the issues were withdrawn before
trial, others were dismissed by the Court during the trial, and others
dismissed on the jury's answers to questions submitted to them. The only claim
that remains is the claim for malicious prosecution.

The criminal charges had been that the plaintiff in this action
did, with intent to defraud by false pretences, obtain from the insurance
companies certain sums of money contrary to the provisions of the Criminal
Code. Each of the charges was laid by a Detective-Corporal of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police at Edmonton upon directions from the Department of the
Attorney General of Alberta. The fire which had destroyed the plaintiff's home
and its contents had occurred in November, 1933; the loss was adjusted and the
companies paid in February, 1934, on the basis of the adjustment; subsequently,
on investigation, the defendants or some of them desired to have the plaintiff
arrested on a charge of receiving the moneys under false pretences. The matter
was brought by them to the attention of the Attorney General's Department but
the law officers of the Crown undertook an investigation of their own into the
matter. Mr. Henwood, the Deputy Attorney General, and two counsel in the
Attorney General's Department, Mr. Frawley and Mr. McClung, all experienced law
officers who have been with the Department for many years, came to the
conclusion that the charges should be laid and they were laid on October 2nd, 1935. Counsel from the Attorney General's Department took the preliminary
inquiry and also prosecuted at the trial. When the plaintiff was acquitted at
the trial, the Attorney General appealed to the Court of Appeal for Alberta-
and by his law officers prosecuted the appeal before that Court. The Court of
Appeal dismissed the

[Page 88]

appeal but two of the Judges dissented
from this judgment. The Attorney General then applied to the Court of Appeal
for written reasons of judgment in order that he might consider a further
appeal in the prosecution to this Court. See [1936] 2 W.W.R. 528. It does not
appear that an appeal was brought to this Court.

The criminal proceedings were initiated and continued throughout
by or on behalf of the Attorney General of Alberta. At the trial of this action
in October, 1940, the law officers of the Crown, Mr. Henwood, Mr. Frawley and
Mr. McClung, all gave evidence and it is plain from their evidence that the
decision to prosecute and the prosecution itself lay entirely in the hands and
under the control of the Attorney General's Department and that they thought
they had had reasonable cause for their belief in the guilt of the accused and
had not been misled (or ""let down"" as the phrase is used in the
evidence) by any of the information or reports that originally had been
furnished to them by the defendants or some of them.

I find it very difficult on the evidence to accept the contention
that a jury might properly come to the conclusion that the defendants were the
prosecutors and equally difficult on the law to conclude that a right of action
for malicious prosecution lay against the defendants, but as the other members
of the Court who sat upon this appeal are not prepared to go farther than the
Court of Appeal did, which directed a new trial, I shall not dissent from that
disposition of the appeal and cross-appeal.

KERWIN, J.—In my view, the respondents are entitled to a
new trial for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Ford. As there is to be a new
trial, I refrain from discussing the evidence. The respondents are not entitled
to a dismissal of the action for malicious prosecution and on this point also I
agree with Mr. Justice Ford. The appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed
with costs.

Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Agreement or arrangement “to unduly prevent or
lessen competition”—Cr. Code, s. 498(1)(d)—What must be shown to establish
the offence—“Unduly”—Intent—Evidence—Admissibility of written opinions of
counsel given before the making of proposed agreements.

This Court dismissed appeals from the affirmance, by the Court
of Appeal for Ontario (Henderson J.A. dissenting on certain questions of law)
([1941] 3 D.L.R. 145), of appellants’ convictions on the charge, laid under s.
498(1)(d) of the Criminal Code, that they did unlawfully
conspire, combine, agree or arrange together and with one another, and with ten
other named companies or individuals not indicted, to unduly prevent or lessen
competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, banter, sale,
transportation or supply in certain named places and other places throughout
Canada, of corrugated and solid fibreboard boxes or shipping containers.

Per the Chief Justice: S. 498(1)(d) is aimed at
protecting the specific public interest in free competition (Stinson-Reeb v.
The King, [1929] S.C.R. 276; Weidman v. Shragge, 46 Can. S.C.R.
1). The lessening or prevention agreed upon will be “undue” within the meaning
of the enactment if, when carried into effect, it will prejudice the public
interest in free competition to a degree that the tribunal of fact finds to be
undue, and an agreement to prevent or lessen competition to such an extent is,
accordingly, an offence under the enactment. In the present case, the aim of
the parties to the agreement was to secure effective control of the market in
Canada; and this fact affords in point of law a sufficient basis for a finding
that the agreement was one which, if carried into effect, would gravely
prejudice the public interest in free competition, and for a conviction under
s. 498(1)(d).

[Page 148]

Per Rinfret, Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.: If it
is shown that the accused entered into an agreement or arrangement, the effect
of which would be unduly to prevent or lessen competition, it need not also be
shown, in order to establish an offence under said enactment, that the
agreement or arrangement must have been intended by the accused to have that
effect. Mens rea is necessary, but that requirement was met when it was
shown that appellants intended to enter and did enter into the very arrangement
found to exist. As to the word “unduly” in the requirement to constitute the
offence: The public is entitled to the benefit of free competition (except in
so far as it may be interfered with by valid legislation), and any panty to an
arrangement, the direct object of which is to impose improper, inordinate,
excessive or oppressive restrictions upon that competition, is guilty of an
offence (Stinson‑Reeb v. The King, [1929] S.C.R. 276). Once an
agreement is arrived at, whether anything be done to carry it out or not, the
matter must be looked at in each case as a question of fact to be determined by
the tribunal of fact upon a common sense view as to the direct object of the
arrangement complained of. The evidence in these cases of what was done is
merely better evidence of that object than would exist where no act in furtherance
of the common design had been committed.

Per curiam: Letters giving opinions of counsel to
appellants or some of them prior to the execution of original agreements in
question, which opinions, it was suggested, would indicate that the matter was
placed before counsel who advised that, on the information before them, it
would not be contrary to law for appellants, or some of them, to enter into the
agreements, were properly rejected as evidence at the trial, because, even if
the letters contained what was suggested, they could have no bearing upon the
point of substance to be determined.

APPEALS from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
in so far as it affirmed (Henderson J.A. dissenting on certain questions of
law) the conviction of the appellants by Hope J. [2],
sitting without a jury, under the count of an indictment which charged that
they did unlawfully conspire, combine, agree or arrange together and with one
another, and with ten other named companies or individuals not indicted, to unduly
prevent or lessen competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter,
sale, transportation or supply in certain named places, and other places
throughout Canada where the articles or commodities hereinafter mentioned are
offered for sale, of articles or commodities which may be the subject of trade
or commerce, to wit, corrugated and solid fibreboard boxes or shipping
containers, and did thereby commit an indictable offence contrary to the
provisions of the Criminal Code, s. 498, subs. 1(d).

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The facts of the case have been fully discussed
in the eleborate judgments at the trial and in the Court of Appeal in those of
the Chief Justice of Ontario and Mr. Justice Masten and need not be restated.

The learned Chief Justice of Ontario, in the course of his
judgment, says:—

In my opinion it is established by evidence properly
admissible, that an agreement or arrangement was made among the manufacturers
who mainly supplied the marked throughout Canada for corrugated and solid
fibreboard boxes and shipping containers that they would place the control of
the marketing, the barter, sale and supply to customers of their output of
these products under the control of Container Materials Limited, a company that
they themselves, through their representatives on the board of directors,
controlled and operated, with the appellant Badden as president and secretary
and virtual manager, and that the measure and extent of that control was such
control as would be in the hands of a single purchaser, to whom alone any of
these manufacturers was at liberty to sell its products, or any part of them,
and for whom the manufacturers themselves in supplying their real customers
were mere agents selling the goods of that purchaser for it and under its
strict supervision and control. While this was not strictly a monopoly it was
to have all the effect of one so far as the public was concerned.

* * *

[Page 150]

If I am right in the conclusion I have reached as to the
real arrangement or scheme of these manufacturers, and of those who worked with
them in its execution, then I think there can be no question that it falls
within the terms of sec. 498, s.s. 1(d). Its purpose was to extinguish
so far as these manufacturers were concerned all competition in the barter and
sale of these products in Canada just as completely as if Container Materials
Limited had a monopoly of them.

Mr. Justice Middleton, after referring to the judgments of this
Court in Weidman v. Shragge[3], and in
Stinson-Reeb v. The King[4], thus
expressed his conclusion:

Unquestionably these cases establish that the agreements
here referred to by the learned trial Judge are a violation of clause (d)
of section 498 and therefore the conviction ought to affirmed.

Mr. Justice Masten says:—

The organization at the time of its creation and during the
period from 1931 to 1939 appears to have included, with certain minor
exceptions, substantially all the Canadian manufacturers of corrugated and
solid fibre board boxes or shipping containers. The allegations of the Crown as
set forth in the particulars delivered by them are as follows:

“At the time of the incorporation of Container Materials
limited, the aforementioned corporations, together with Kitchener Paper Box
Company, were all the producers in Canada of corrugated paper boxes and with
the exception of Building Products Limited were all the manufacturers of fibre
board boxes.

“At the date of the indictment the accused manufacturing
corporations, together with Pacific Mills Limited, were the only producers of
corrugated and fibre board shipping containers in Canada, with the exception of
one other company with a small production.

“Building Products Limited, a corporation mentioned in the
indictment was, up to the year 1935, engaged in the manufacture of shipping
containers at which time it ceased to manufacture the same under circumstances
which will be referred to in greater detail hereafter.

“Pacific Mills Limited was since 1933, and now is, engaged
in the manufacture of shipping containers.”

The finding of the trial Judge is “that Container Materials
Limited represented that it controlled 100% of the industry”. I think it is
established that the organization operating through Container Materials Limited
substantially controlled throughout Canada during the period in question the
manufacture and sale of containers.

It is clear from the foregoing analysis of the organization
created in 1931 that it was an instrument possessing enormous potency, whose
first object was to improve or increase the profits of its members and
adherents by its control of the manufacture and sale throughout Canada of
containers. It is also manifest from the foregoing analysis that the supervision
and restrictions imposed by the organization necessarily lessened competition.
Whether the charter and by-laws of Container Materials Limited, coupled with
the four agreements when taken by themselves, make manifest an agreement to
lessen competition unduly need not be considered, for the organization
manifests a common agreement

[Page 151]

and certain subsequent overt acts done by the organization
in pursuance of the common agreement establish in my opinion that its objective
was to “unduly lessen competition” and hence was unlawful.

Mr. Justice Fisher agreed with the conclusion and reasons of the
Chief Justice.

I think it right to say that, after fully weighing the arguments
presented, I am in agreement with these conclusions of the learned Chief Justice
and Justices of the Court of Appeal in respect of fact as well as in respect of
law. It follows necessarily, of course, that the appellants must fail in their
contention that there was no evidence to support the conviction pronounced by
the learned trial Judge under clause (d) of section 498.

This, however, is by no means the end of the matter, because it
was argued with great ability and force by counsel for the appellants that,
assuming the conclusions of fact of the learned trial Judge and of the majority
of the Court of Appeal to be well-founded, this is not sufficient to sustain
the conviction, since, the appellants contend, both the learned trial Judge and
the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal misconstrued and misapplied the
section of the Code upon which the indictment is based, which is in these
terms:—


 
  
  Lessen competition.
  
  
  498.(d) to unduly prevent
  or lessen competition in the 
  production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, (transportation or supply of
  any such article or commodity, or in the price of insurance upon person or
  property
  
 


Two main points are raised. First, it is not sufficient, it is
argued, to establish an agreement to prevent or lessen competition in such a
manner, or to such an extent, that the tribunal considers to be undue in fact.
It is, it is argued, an essential element of the offence, which, of course,
must be proved, that the intention present in the minds of the accused persons
in entering into their agreement is to do what they conceive will have the
effect and which they intend to have the effect of unduly preventing or
lessening competition, within the meaning of the statute.

The second point arises from the contention of the appellants
that the essence of the offence is an agreement to do something injurious to the
public; that such injury to the public must appear from the evidence and must
be found as a fact in order to establish a legal basis for a conviction.

[Page 152]

These contentions were advanced in the Court of Appeal, as well
as in this Court. They constitute the most important grounds of appeal.

The enactment before us, I have no doubt, was passed for the
protection of the specific public interest in free competition. That, in
effect, I think, is the view expressed in Weidman v. Shragge[5]
in the judgments of the learned Chief Justice, of Mr. Justice Idington and
Mr. Justice Anglin, as well as by myself. This protection is afforded by
stamping with illegality agreements which, when carried into effect, prevent or
lessen competition unduly and making such agreements punishable offences; and,
as the enactment is aimed at protecting the public interest in free
competition, it is from that point of view that the question must be considered
whether or not the prevention or lessening agreed upon will be undue. Speaking
broadly, the legislation is not aimed at protecting one party to the agreement
against stipulations which may be oppressive and unfair as between him and the
others; it is aimed at protecting the public interest in free competition. That
is only another way of putting what was laid down in Stinson-Reeb v. The
King[6] which,
it may be added, was intended to be in conformity with the decision in Weidman
v. Shragge[7], as
indicated in the passages quoted in the judgment.

The lessening or prevention agreed upon will, in my opinion, be
undue, within the meaning of the statute, if, when carried into effect, it will
prejudice the public interest in free competition to a degree that the tribunal
of fact finds to be undue, and an agreement to prevent or lessen competition to
such an extent is, accordingly, an offence against sec. 498 (d).

The learned trial Judge, as well as the learned Justices of the
Court of Appeal, directed their attention to the effect of the agreement from
this point of view. The learned trial Judge observed that the agreement was “to
put free competition into a straight jacket”. Mr. Justice Masten said “free
competition was stifled”. The learned Chief Justice of Ontario says that “the
purpose of the agreement was to extinguish so far as these manufacturers were
concerned all competition in the barter and sale of these products in Canada
just as completely as if Container Materials Limited had a monopoly of them”.

[Page 153]

The majority of the Court of Appeal rightly held, I think, that
the aim of the parties to this agreement was to secure effective control of the
market in Canada; it may be added that in this they were very largely
successful. But the fact that such was the agreement affords in point of law a
sufficient basis for a finding that the agreement was one which, if carried
into effect, would gravely prejudice the public interest in free competition,
and a conviction under section 498(d).

With respect to the other points raised by the appellants, it is
sufficient to say that I have had an opportunity of reading the judgment of my
brother Kerwin and I fully concur with him as regards those points.

The appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Rinfret, Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau, JJ. was
delivered by

KERWIN J.—The appellants, together with Wilson Boxes Limited,
were convicted by Hope J. upon each of four counts in an indictment, count 1
being laid under clause (d) of subsection 1 of section 498 of the Criminal
Code, and counts 2, 3 and 4 under clauses (b), (a) and
(c) respectively. The convictions against all the accused on counts 2, 3
and 4 were quashed by the Court of Appeal; the conviction against Wilson Boxes
Limited under count 1 was set aside and a new trial directed; the convictions
of the appellants under count 1 were affirmed, and the sentences imposed by the
trial Judge were affirmed and imposed with respect to the conviction of each of
the appellants under that count. These appeals are from the affirmance of such
convictions and are based on questions of law on which Henderson J.A. dissented
in the Court of Appeal. Our jurisdiction is limited to those questions of law
and imposes upon this Court a task different from that which confronted the
Court of Appeal.

Subsection 1 of section 498 of the Code provides:—

Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a
penalty not exceeding four thousand dollars and not less than two hundred
dollars, or to two years’ imprisonment, or, if a corporation, is liable to a
penalty not exceeding ten thousand dollars, and not less than one thousand
dollars, who conspires, combines, agrees or arranges with any other person, or
with any railway, steamship, steamboat or transportation company,

(a) to unduly limit the facilities for transporting,
producing, manufacturing, supplying, storing or dealing in any article or
commodity which may be a subject of trade or commerce; or

[Page 154]

(b) to restrain or injure trade or commerce in
relation to any such article or commodity; or

(c) to unduly prevent, limit, or lessen the
manufacture or production of any such article or commodity, or to unreasonably
enhance the price thereof; or

(d) to unduly prevent or lessen competition in
the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply
of any such article or commodity, or in the price of insurance upon person or
property.

By count 1 of the indictment, the accused were charged that they
did unlawfully conspire, combine, agree or arrange together and with one
another and with ten other named companies or individuals not indicted, to
unduly prevent or lessen competition in the production, manufacture, purchase,
barter, sale, transportation or supply, in certain named places and other
places throughout Canada, of corrugated and solid fibreboard boxes or shipping
containers.

The circumstances preceding the incorporation and organization of
Container Materials Limited and the facts in connection with the operation of
that company as affecting the appellants, are set forth in the reasons for
judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario. Having considered the record in
connection with the arguments presented on behalf of the appellants, I find
myself in agreement with the Chief Justice’s statement of facts. Any slight
inaccuracy does not in the least affect the matters to be determined by this
Court. These matters depend upon the questions of law upon which Henderson,
J.A., dissented, and counsel for the appellants have conveniently allocated
what they contend are those questions under six different headings as follows:—

Firstly:

That the learned trial judge erred in accepting the view of the
Crown that the intentions and objects of the accused were beside the question;
and

That mens rea or guilty mind is a necessary ingredient of
the crime here charged and the crime of conspiracy is particularly one which
involves mens rea.

Secondly:

The improper rejection of evidence.

Thirdly:

The accused were prejudiced in their defence by the manner in
which the Crown dealt with the documentary records of the accused; and

That the conviction and sentence both fail and that in order to
convict the accused on appeal the Appellate Court would have to substitute a
conviction by such Court and a sentence by such Court, which is beyond its
province.

Fourthly:

The improper admission of evidence.

Fifthly:

That it is not sufficient for the Crown to make out a prima
facie case and it is not sufficient that the Crown give in evidence
circumstances capable of two interpretations, one consistent with innocence and
the other with guilt; much less is the Court asked to find guilt from
circumstances at least equally consistent with innocence.

Sixthly:

There is no evidence to support any conviction; and

A conviction under section 498, subsection (d),
cannot stand in view of an acquittal under subsection (b); and

That the accused were charged with one conspiracy only and that
the gist of the offence is conspiracy and that the various counts set forth in
the indictment were simply allegations of overt acts in pursuing the objects of
the conspiracy and therefore the conviction cannot be upheld.

I turn first to those identified as secondly, thirdly and
fourthly. I agree with what the learned Chief Justice has said as to the manner
in which the documents seized in the possession of various of the appellants
were subsequently dealt with. I approve of every word that he has said with
reference to this matter but I also agree with his statement “that a case was
made against each of the appellants without the assistance of any documents or
books the admissibility of which was properly objected to”. In the great
majority, if not all, of the cases to which our attention was called, where an
original letter was found in the possession of one of the accused a copy of
that letter was

[Page 156]

found in the possession of another, from whom the original
purported to have come. There was evidence before the Court sufficient to show
that the accused were engaged in accomplishing the same common object, and
evidence of one conspirator was therefore evidence against the other. The
distinction between entries made by a fellow conspirator, contained in various
documents actually used for carrying out the design, and a document not created
in the course of carrying it out but made by one of the conspirators after the
illegal object was completed, is shown in The Queen v. Blake[8],
referred to in Mirza Akbar v. King‑Emperor[9].
The appellants were not tried before a judge and jury but by a judge alone, who
has given his reasons for the conviction on count 1 and, even if any of the
evidence that was admitted before him falls within the second category, it is
quite apparent from those reasons that it had no effect upon the reasons or the
result. It has not been overlooked that the trial judge stated:—

It might also be noted that according to The Companies Act,
cap. 251, R.S.O. 1937, sec. 106, minute books which are required to be
kept by the company shall be prima facie evidence of all facts
purporting to be therein stated in any action or proceeding against the
corporation.

This provision of the Ontario Companies Act could, of
course, have no application to a prosecution under the Code, and the trial
Judge did not so treat it. He had already determined that the books were
otherwise admissible and merely added a reference to the Ontario statute.

The appellants complain that the opinions of counsel, rendered to
the appellants or some of them prior to the execution of the original
agreements, were wrongfully rejected. What these opinions are, we do not know,
but it is suggested that they would indicate that the matter was placed before
counsel who advised that, on the information before them, it would not be
contrary to law for the appellants, or some of them, to enter into the
agreements. In my opinion, the evidence was properly rejected because, even if
the letters contained what has been suggested, they could have no bearing upon
the point of substance to be determined. The only other bit of evidence
rejected by the trial judge that was specifically referred to is a letter
which, according to a statement of counsel appearing in the record, was
addressed, by Wilson Boxes

[Page 157]

Limited, to Messrs. Hardy and Badden and dated January 27th,
1939. This is the letter referred to by Chief Justice Robertson and because of
its non-admission a new trial was directed so far as the conviction of Wilson
Boxes Limited on count 1 was concerned. It is pointed out that the Chief
Justice was in error in stating that this letter was tendered in evidence by
counsel for Wilson Boxes Limited, and apparently this is so. Wilson Boxes Limited
was not represented at the trial. It was counsel for Superior Box Company,
Limited, who tendered the letter in evidence. No doubt the confusion arose
because the same counsel appeared before the Court of Appeal not only for
Superior Box Company, Limited, but also for Wilson Boxes Limited. We are not
concerned with the position of the latter company but it was argued that this
letter should have been admitted in favour of Superior Box Limited. I am unable
to see how a letter from Wilson Boxes Limited to Hardy and Badden could be
evidence on behalf of Superior Box Limited.

Having gone over the record carefully to see what transpired at
the trial with reference to the seized bundles, I am satisfied that the
appellants were not prejudiced in their defence by the manner in which the
Crown dealt with the documentary evidence of the accused. Every facility was
offered by Crown counsel and was refused by counsel for the appellants, or at
least by some.

The second, third and fourth points argued by the appellants being
disposed of, the first, fifth and sixth may be taken together. The ground may
first be cleared by dealing with the objection that the accused were not all
those engaged in the manufacture of corrugated and solid fibreboard boxes or
shipping containers. It was pointed out that the count in the indictment
alleged that the accused conspired together and with one another and with ten
other named companies or individuals not indicted, to unduly prevent or lessen
competition. While counsel for the Crown referred to certain documents as
indicating that the accused were all the manufacturers of the articles
mentioned, a perusal of these documents does not satisfy me that that
contention is correct, but I am satisfied from the evidence that the accused
represented the great bulk of the industry. That was the conclusion of the
trial judge and of the Chief Justice of Ontario, and any difference of

[Page 158]

opinion on that score, in the Court of Appeal, would be on a
question of fact, as to which there is no appeal to this Court. The objection
that the convictions under clause (d) could not stand because of the
acquittals under clause (b) is of no moment, as this Court is not
concerned with anything except the question whether the convictions on the
first count are proper.

It was argued that it was not sufficient for the Crown to show an
agreement or arrangement, the effect of which would be unduly to prevent or
lessen competition, but that the agreement or arrangement must have been
intended by the accused to have that effect. This is not the meaning of the
enactment upon which the count was based. Mens rea is undoubtedly
necessary, but that requirement was met in these prosecutions when it was shown
that the appellants intended to enter, and did enter, into the very arrangement
found to exist. The offences mentioned in the statute in question in Attorney
General of Australia v. Adelaide Steamship Company[10]
were not complete without proof of the intent. As pointed out by Lord Parker at
page 798, an amending Act provided that in any prosecution for an offence
against certain sections of the main enactment,

the averments of the prosecutor contained in the
information, declaration, or claim shall be deemed to be proved in the absence
of proof to the contrary, but so that the averment of intent shall not be
deemed sufficient to prove such intent.

This decision can have no application to a prosecution under
clause (d) of subsection 1 of section 498 of the Code.

The meaning of “unduly” in clause (d) of subsection 1 of
section 498 of the Code was considered in the criminal case of Stinson-Reeb
Builders Supply Company v. The King[11], where
Mr. Justice Mignault, speaking for the Court, quoted the following passage from
the judgment of the present Chief Justice of this Court in the civil case of Weidman
v. Shragge[12]:—

I have no hesitation in holding that as a rule an agreement
having for one of its direct and governing objects the establishment of a
virtual monopoly in the trade in an important article of commerce throughout a
considerable extent of territory by suppressing competition in that trade,
comes under the ban of the enactment.

[Page 159]

Mr. Justice Mignault also quoted the following passage from the
judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin (as he then was), at page 42:—

The prime question certainly must be, does it (the agreement
alleged to be obnoxious to section 498), however advantageous or even necessary
for the protection of the business interests of the parties, impose improper,
inordinate, excessive or oppressive restrictions upon that competition the
benefit of which is the right of every one?

Under the decision in the Stinson-Reeb case[13],
the public is entitled to the benefit of free competition except in so far as
it may be interfered with by valid legislation, and any party to an
arrangement, the direct object of which is to impose improper, inordinate,
excessive or oppressive restrictions upon that competition, is guilty of an
offence. A comparison between section 498 of the Code and section 498A (which
was enacted subsequent to the decision in the Stinson-Reeb case13)
indicates that there has not been any change in the rule. Once an agreement is
arrived at, whether anything be done to carry it out or not, the matter must be
looked at in each case as a question of fact to be determined by the tribunal
of fact upon a common sense view as to the direct object of the arrangement
complained of. The evidence in these cases of what was done is merely better
evidence of that object than would exist where no act in furtherance of the common
design had been committed. So viewing the matter, there can be no question
that, not only was there some evidence upon which the trial judge could
convict, but the evidence was overwhelming that all the appellants at one time
or another conspired, combined, agreed or arranged to prevent or lessen
competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale,
transportation or supply of corrugated and solid fibre boxes or shipping
containers, and that they conspired to do so unduly.

This applies as well to Superior Box Company Limited as to the
other appellants. It is true that this Company, as well as several others, did
not sign any agreement, but the correspondence between it and Container
Materials Limited and other admissible evidence shows that it paid a portion of
the expenses of Container Materials Limited; that it submitted to inspection;
that its representatives were present at various meetings; that it contributed
to the costs of the Acme contract; and that it had a knowledge of

[Page 160]

and contributed to the cost of the Building Products purchase.
Instead of the position of this appellant being, as put in its factum,
“entirely consistent with an intention to make the best of conditions as we
found them and over which we had no control”, the truth of the matter is that
the Company became a member of the conspiracy and actually acted in conjunction
with the others, although, on occasions, it sought to free itself from some of
its fetters and succeeded in securing, from time to time, special advantages
not enjoyed by the others.

The appeals should be dissmised.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Automatic slot
machine—Amusement only provided—Results determined by skill of operator—No
element of chance or mixed elements of chance and skill—Whether service-vending
machine—Common gaming house—Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1927, c. 36, sections 226,
229 and section 986, par. 4, as amended by 2 Geo. VI, 1938, c. 44, s. 46.

The appellant had in his premises an
automatic slot-machine for the amusement of the public known under the name of
""Evans Ten-Strike Miniature Bowling"". Section 986 (4) of the Criminal
Code enacts that, ""if any house, room or place is found fitted or provided
with * * * any automatic or slot machine used or intended to be used for any
purpose other than for vending merchandise or services, * * * there shall be an
irrebuttable presumption that such house, room or place is a common gaming
house"". The appellant was convicted of having kept a common gaming house,
and the appellate court affirmed the conviction, holding that, under that
section, all slot machines, including those vending amusement, were illegal.

Held, reversing
the judgment appealed from (Q.R. [1942] 1 KB. 1), that the machine found in the
appellant's premises was providing a harmless amusement to the operator and
that, for the purpose of determining this appeal, the word ""services""
should be construed as including ""amusement."" If a narrower
interpretation of the word ""services"" was given, it would then be a criminal act, for instance, to
keep in a hotel a music-recording slot machine, and this is not the letter nor
the spirit of the law. Therefore, the conviction of the appellant should be
quashed.

[Page 85]

Rex v. Levine
((1939) 72 Can. Or. Cas.
312) followed.

Roberts v. The
King ([1931] S.C.R. 417), Rex v. Perlick ((1939) 72 Can. Cr. Cas. 365), Rex v. Granda
((1941) 74 Can. Cr. Cas. 344), Rex
v. Collins ((1939) 71 Can. Cr. Cas. 272) discussed.

APPEAL, upon leave to appeal to this Court[1], from the judgment of the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[2], affirming the conviction of the appellant for the offence of
having illegally kept a common gaming house. By the judgment now reported, the
appeal was allowed, the conviction quashed and the slot machine seized was
ordered to be returned to the appellant.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now
reported.

J. Crankshaw K.C. for the appellant.

G. Fauteux K.C., A. Pagé and A.
Macnaughton for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Taschereau J.—The appellant was convicted by the Recorder of the city of
Montreal, of having on the 28th day of March, 1941, illegally kept a common
gaming house at number 2060 Bleury street, Montreal.

The judgment was upheld by the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, and the appellant on application to a
judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, under the provisions of section 1025 of
the Criminal Code, was granted leave to appeal to this Court, the judgment of
the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, being in conflict
with a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario (Rex v. Levine[3]).

The record reveals that the accused had in his
premises an automatic slot machine for the amusement of the public, known under
the name of ""Evans Ten-Strike Miniature Bowling "". It is put in
motion by placing a large five cent piece in a slide, which, under the pressure
of the operator,

[Page 86]

establishes an electrical current in the
machine. A ball is then released, and a mechanical player receives it coming
from a wooden chute and automatically holds it in its hand. The operator places
the player in the desired position, and then pushes a button which releases the
ball that strikes the pins at the other end of the alley. The number of pins
knocked down by the ball is registered after every two plays, and automatically
the pins are placed in front of the player who repeats the same operation five
times, playing with two balls each time. The machine adds the total number of
the pins knocked down during the game and indicates the final score.

The skill of the operator in aiming at the pins
is the determining factor of the success of the operation; and it is clear from
the evidence and the examination of the machine itself produced as an exhibit
in the case, that in the playing of the game there is no element of chance, or
mixed elements of chance and skill. A skilful operator will obtain far better
results.

The relevant sections of the Criminal Code are
the following:—

226. A common gaming house is—

(a) a house, room or place kept by
any person for gain, to which persons resort to for the purpose of playing at
any game of chance, or at any mixed game of chance and skill.

***

229. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to one year's imprisonment who keeps any disorderly house,
that is to say, any common bawdy-house, common gaming-house, or common
betting-house, as hereinbefore defined.

There can be no doubt that under these two
sections, the appellant operating or keeping in his premises this innocent
machine for the amusement of the public could not be convicted, (Roberts v.
The King[4]).
But the respondent relies on section 986, paragraph 4 of the Criminal Code as
amended in 1938, chap. 44, section 46, and which reads as follows:—

4. Slot machines.—In any prosecution under
section two hundred and twenty-nine any automatic or slot machine used or
intended to be used for any purpose other than for vending merchandise or
services shall, and any such machine used or intended to be used for vending
merchandise shall, if the result of one of any number of operations of it is,
as regards the operator, a matter of chance or uncertainty or if as a
consequence of any given number of successive operations it yields different
results to

[Page 87]

the operator or if on any operation it
discharges or emits any slug or token, other than merchandise, be deemed to be
a means or contrivance for playing a game of chance notwithstanding that the
result of some one or more or all of such operations may be known to the
operator in advance and if any house, room or place is found fitted or provided
with any such machine there shall be an irrebuttable presumption that such
house, room or place is a common gaming house.

It is in virtue of this subsection that the
appellant has been convicted.

The Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, had dealt with similar
cases since the amendment of 1938, and relied upon its former decisions to
dismiss the appeal in the present case.

In Rex v. Perlick[5], the court of appeal
had to consider a ""Target Skill"" which was alleged to be useful in
developing revolver shooting. The court reached the conclusion that under
section 986 (4) of the Criminal Code, this apparatus not being used or intended
to be used for the vending either of merchandise or services was illegal, and
that its possession created an irrebuttable presumption that the place where
such a machine was kept was a common gaming house. It also held that the
shooting at a stationary target which affords no return other than amusement,
may not be called a ""service"" within the meaning of section 986,
paragraph 4, Cr. C.

In that case, Mr. Justice Hall said:—

The effect of this new paragraph (986-4) is
that every automatic or slot machine, except those vending merchandise or
services, is presumed to be a gambling device.

In Rex v. Granda[6], the same court dealing
with a Pin Ball Slot Machine expressed identical views.

The Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, in Rex v. Collins[7],
had then already given its decision as to the legality or illegality of this
Pin Ball Slot Machine. Although it dismissed the appeal on the ground that this
machine was a game of chance yielding Collins a gain, it expressed views as to
the interpretation of section 986, paragraph 4, Cr. C, which were adopted by
the court of appeal of Quebec.

The result of the above pronouncements and of
the judgment of the court of appeal of Quebec, now before this Court, is that
section 986, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code declares all slot machines
vending amusements illegal,

[Page 88]

and that there is an irrebuttable presumption
that a room or place where such a machine is found is a common gaming house.

With the greatest respect, I cannot agree with
these judgments, and I believe that the opposite views adopted by the Court of
Appeal of Ontario in Rex v.
Levine[8]
should be upheld.

In the present case, we have to deal with a
machine that provides a harmless amusement to the operator, and I believe that
for the purpose of determining this case the word ""services"" includes
""amusement"". This word must not be given the narrow interpretation
that some courts have attempted to give to it, and its meaning must not be
limited to cover only certain necessaries of life like lavatories and
telephones. If such an interpretation were accepted, it would then be a
criminal act, for instance, to keep in a hotel or a restaurant a gramophone
reproducing music or vocal sounds after a five cent piece has been deposited in
a slot. I am satisfied that this is not the letter nor the spirit of the law.
This recording machine, and the one seized in the present case, do sell
""services"", in the sense that they furnish innocent recreation for
the benefit and advantage of the public.

I fully agree with the interpretation given by
the Chief Justice of Ontario in the Levine case[9]:—

The word ""service"" or
""services"" is properly used as meaning ""help"" or
""benefit"" or ""advantage"" conferred. I do not know why
amusement, which is all that is got by the operation of the machine in
question, may not properly be spoken of as a ""help"" or a
""benefit"" or an ""advantage"". In one way and another many
wise people spend a good deal of time and money in obtaining amusement, and to
a normal person it is almost one of the necessaries of life. In my opinion it
does no violence to the language of the statute in question to say that an
automatic machine that does nothing but amuse is a machine used, or intended to
be used, for vending services.

This machine selling services is excluded from
the application of the Act, and is not the kind of a machine which is the
object of the new enactment, and the possession of which creates the
""irrebuttable presumption"" which is found in the amendment.

It is necessary, however, to add, as the Chief Justice
of Ontario has pointed out, that certain machines vending merchandise and
services may be illegal if for instance

[Page 89]

they have gaming as their purpose. The vending
of merchandise or services does not authorize the use of a slot machine that for
other reasons would violate the dispositions of the Criminal Code. But this is
not the case here. The machine which furnishes only amusement and which has no
other purpose than vending services, does not come within the ban of the Act.

I am, therefore, of opinion that this appeal
should be allowed, the conviction quashed and that the machine seized should be
returned to the accused.

Appeal allowed, and conviction quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Appeal—Jurisdiction—Whether
dissenting judgments in a court of appeal disclosed a dissent on a question of
law within the meaning of section 1023 of the Criminal Code.

The respondent, a divisional registrar
appointed under regulations, enacted by order in council under powers conferred
by a Dominion Act of 1940, concerning National War Services, was found guilty
and convicted on two charges of having committed offences in contravention of
some provisions of these regulations. On an appeal by the respondent, the
appellate court, by a majority of three to two, quashed the verdict and the
conviction. The judgment of the majority of the Court declared the verdict to
be unreasonable for reasons resulting from inter alia an examination of
the relative values of the testimony adduced by the Grown and the testimony
given by the accused. The judgment did not rest upon any view of the majority
upon a question which was a question of law alone. The judgment of one of the
dissenting judges was simply to the effect that he was ""of the opinion
that the appeal should be dismissed"", while the other dissenting judge
held that there should be a new trial, without stating, either expressly or by
implication, that such conclusion was based upon an opinion that the majority
proceeded upon any error in point of law alone. On the appeal to this Court by
the Attorney-General for Quebec, the respondent moved to quash such appeal.

Held that no
jurisdiction lies in this Court to entertain the appeal: neither of the
judgments of the two dissenting judges of the appellate court discloses a
dissent on a question of law within the meaning of section 1023 of the Criminal
Code.

MOTION by the respondent to quash an appeal
to this Court by the Attorney-General of Quebec from a judment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, which had quashed a verdict of
guilty and the conviction of the respondent on charges of having committed
offences in contravention of regulations concerning National War Services.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now
reported.

Aimé Geoffrion K.C. for
the appellant.

G. Fauteux K.C. for the respondent.

[Page 81]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

The Chief
Justice—As is well known, appeals to this Court in
criminal cases are regulated by the Criminal Code. By section 1023 of the Code
it is enacted:—

Any person convicted of any indictable
offence whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten
hundred and thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the
affirmance of such conviction on any question of law on which there has been
dissent in the Court of Appeal.

""The Attorney-General of the province
may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of any court of
appeal setting aside a conviction or dismissing an appeal against a judgment or
verdict of acquittal in respect of an indictable offence on an appeal taken
under section ten hundred and thirteen on any question of law on which there
has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.

Turning to section 1013, that section provides:—

A person convicted on indictment may appeal
to the court of appeal against his conviction,

(a) on any ground of appeal which
involves a question of law alone,

(b) with
leave of the court of appeal, or upon the certificate of the trial court that
it is a fit case for appeal, on any ground of appeal which involves a question
of fact alone or a question of mixed law and fact; and

(c) with leave of the court of
appeal, on any other ground which appears to the court of appeal to be a
sufficient ground of appeal.

The respondent, Pierre Décary, was tried upon a
charge preferred by the Attorney-General of the province of Quebec before the
Hon. Mr. Justice Lazure and a jury on the 10th of June, 1941. The charge
contained three counts, of which it is only necessary to quote the first and
third:—

militaire.

Contre la forme du Statut en tel cas fait et
pourvu, et contre la Paix de Notre Souverain Seigneur le Roi George Six, sa
Couronne et Sa Dignité.

The respondent was found guilty and convicted on
both of these two counts. He appealed from this conviction and the court of
appeal, by a majority of three to two, quashed the verdict and the conviction.

It is convenient, I think, to set forth the
grounds upon which the judgment of the majority of the court of appeal rests,
as they appear in the formal judgment:—

Attendu que l'appelant invoque à l'appui de son appel divers moyens basés
uniquement sur des questions de fait, d'autres sur des questions de fait et de
droit et aussi sur des questions de droit seulement;

Attendu que l'appelant soutient, en
particulier, que le verdict n'est pas raisonnable et n'est pas supporté par le
poids de la preuve; qu'à sa face même, ce verdict, comportant une
recommandation à la clémence de la Cour, est un verdict déraisonnable résultant
d'un compromis illégal entre les jurés qui avaient des doutes sur sa
culpabilité et ne lui en ont pas donné le bénéfice; que le seul témoignage
incriminant rendu contre lui ne pouvait, à raison de l'ensemble de la preuve et
plus particulièrement de son propre témoignage, servir die base à un verdict de
culpabilité, et qu'à raison des circonstances et de la façon dont ce seul
témoignage incriminant a été. donné, il y lieu de l'écarter entièrement et
qu'il ne peut servir de base raisonnable à un verdict de culpabilité;

Attendu que de toute la preuve rapportée par
la Couronne devant le jury, le seul témoignage pouvant incriminer l'appelant
est celui du témoin Jean-Louis Tarte dont les affirmations sont nettement,
catégoriquement et spécifiquement niées par l'appelant;

Attendu qu'il ressort du verdict, tel que
libellé, que le doute que devait nécessairement produire dans l'esprit des
membres du jury ce conflit de témoignages, n'a pu être complètement éliminé et
qu'il y a lieu, en pareil cas, pour la Cour, saisie du présent appel,
d'étudier, peser et apprécier la preuve et de lui donner sa véritable interprétation et son plein
effet;

Attendu que les circonstances qui ont précédé
et entouré le témoignage de Jean-Louis Tarte, telles qu'elles sont dévoilées
par le dossier donnent à ce témoignage un caractère particulier et qui en
affecte la force probante à un point tel, qu'en face des dénégations claires,
explicites et convaincantes de l'appelant, il serait déraisonnable d'asseoir un
verdict de culpabillité contre lui
sur l'un ou l'autre des deux chefs d'accusation qui lui sont reprochés;

As appears from the
enactments of section 1023, quoted above, the Attorney-General's right of
appeal from a judgment of the court of appeal, setting aside the conviction of
an accused, is limited to some ground which raises a question of law on which
there has been a dissent in the court of appeal. It is well settled by the
decisions of this

[Page 83]

Court that such ground must raise a question of
law in the strict sense and that it is not a competent ground of appeal if it
raises only a mixed question of fact and law.

Counsel for the respondent moved to quash the
appeal of the Attorney-General from the judgment of the court of appeal
alleging that there was no dissent in the court of appeal upon any such
question of law and, consequently, that there is no competent ground of appeal
available to the Attorney-General.

After fully considering the able argument
presented by Mr. Fauteux, on behalf of the Attorney-General, our conclusion is
that for the reasons advanced by Mr. Geoffrion the Attorney-General has no
right of appeal in this case.

There were two judgments delivered by learned
justices of the court of appeal which were in disagreement with the conclusion
of the majority, and the point to be considered is whether or not either of
these judgments discloses a dissent on a question of law within the meaning of
section 1023 of the Criminal Code.

It is convenient, first of all, to notice that
the judgment of the majority of the Court does not proceed upon the ground that
there was no evidence in support of the accusations before the jury in the
sense that it was within the power of the trial judge, and, therefore, of
course, his duty, to direct a verdict of not guilty to be entered. The judgment
obviously proceeds under section 1013 (b), or (c), which gives a
right of appeal upon leave to the court of appeal on any ground which involves
a question of fact alone or a question of mixed law and fact, or on any other
ground which appears to the court of appeal to be a sufficient ground of
appeal. The judgment pronounces the verdict to be unreasonable for reasons
resulting from inter alia an examination of the relative values of the
testimony adduced by the Crown and the testimony given by the accused. It is
quite plain that the judgment does not rest upon any view of the majority upon
a question which is a question of law alone.

Turning now to the judgments of the minority,
Mr. Justice Hall simply says:—

I am of the opinion that this appeal should
be dismissed.

Plainly there is here no dissent upon any
question of law.

[Page 84]

Mr. Justice Walsh, in the
reasons delivered by him for his conclusion that there should be a new trial,
does not say, either expressly or by implication, that this conclusion is based
upon an opinion that the majority proceeds upon any error in point of law
alone.

It is plain, therefore, that the record
discloses no material enabling the Attorney-General to bring his appeal within
the conditions prescribed by the enactments of the Criminal Code, and the
appeal must, consequently, be quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Murder—Shooting
during attempted robbery—Four accused engaged in the robbery—Victim shot by one
of the four—Struggle between the latter and the victim—Jury instructed that
accused guilty of murder or nothing—Whether verdict of manslaughter should have
been left open to jury—Definition of murder—Ss. 252 (2), 259 (d) and 260 Cr. C.

The respondent H., with two companions, entered a shop kept by
the father of the victim for the purpose of robbery. The family of the victim
and the victim were sitting in a room, in the rear of the shop, separated by a
half door with curtains. The mother, hearing the store bell, entered the shop,
saw H. carrying a revolver and gave a warning to the family that a hold up was
in progress. H. fired a first shot through the wooden partition of the side of
the doorway and a second one through the curtains. The first of the shots
wounded the victim in the hand and the second in the arm. The victim
immediately came into the shop and grappled with H. in an effort to disarm him.
The accounts of the actual shooting by the mother and a brother of the victim
did not agree. The mother testified that, during the struggle, the victim was
attempting to take the pistol from H. "" but could not reach because he was
quite high"" and that she heard then only one shot, her son falling down;
while the brother stated that H. broke away from the victim, was leaving the
shop and, just as he was opening the door, turned and fired at the victim a
third shot which killed him; but the brother agreed with his mother that the
victim "" had H.'s wrist raising it up in the air "" during the
struggle. A witness for the Crown testified that H., on the evening of the date
of the crime, had made a statement to him ""that the gun accidentally went
off"". The trial judge charged the jury that H. was guilty of murder or of
nothing. All four respondents were convicted of murder, H. for having effected
the act of shooting and the three others as conspirators with H. and, as such,
responsible for the crime. A majority of the Court of Appeal ordered a new
trial, holding that the trial judge erred in not instructing the jury that they
could have returned a verdict of manslaughter, if they believed some of the
evidence that the revolver was accidentally discharged.

Held that the judgment appealed from (78 Can. Cr. C. 1)
should be affirmed. The trial judge properly instructed the jury that it was
their duty to find H. guilty of murder, if they accepted the evidence of the
brother of the victim; and that they could render a similar verdict, if they
accepted the mother's testimony, as they could properly infer that the shot
which occurred during the struggle,

[Page 518]

following at once the tow shots fired into the sitting room,
was intentionally fired by him in a state of mind evincing disregard of the
consequences of his shooting and with the knowledge that his conduct was
endangering the lives of the people whose premises he was invading. But the
trial judge did not deal with the third hypothesis, the possibility that they
might find the pistol was discharged by accident in the sense that it was not
discharged by any act of H. done with the intention of discharging it. The
trial judge ought to have told the jury that they might and ought to find a
verdict of manslaughter if they thought the pistol was not discharged by the
voluntary act of H. and that H. did not anticipate and ought not to have
anticipated that his conduct might bring about a struggle in which somebody's
death might be caused.—Also the trial judge proceeded rightly in instructing
the jury that, in the circumstances of the case, the law to be applied was to
be found in the Criminal Code (S. 252 (2) Cr. C.) Graves v. The King
(47 Can. S.C.R. 568) applied.

APPEAL by the Crown from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia[1], allowing an appeal by the four respondents in this
case, quashing their conviction for murder on a joint trial before Sidney Smith
J. and a jury and ordering a new trial.

The material facts of the case
and the questions at issue are stated in the above head—note and in the
judgment now reported.

R. L. Maitland K.C. and
Alfred Bull K.C. for the appellant.

A. Branca for the respondent
Hughes.

W. A. Schultz for the
respondent Petryk.

J. S. Burton for the

T. F. Hurley for the
respondent Berrigan.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The respondents
were convicted of the murder of Yoshyuki Uno in Vancouver on the 16th of January, 1942. The act of shooting by which it is alleged the murder was effected
was, it is charged, the act of the respondent Hughes; the other respondents
were charged and found guilty as conspirators with Hughes and, as such,
responsible for the crime.

I shall deal first with the case
of Hughes. The evidence shows that on the date mentioned Hughes with two
companions entered the shop kept by the father of the victim

[Page 519]

at 305 West 4th Ave., Vancouver,
for the purpose of robbery. The family, his wife, the mother of the victim, a
daughter, the victim and another son, lived with him in the rear of the shop
which was separated from a sitting room, or living room, by what is called a
half door with curtains on the store side extending to the floor. There is a
bell which rings in the sitting room when the street door of the store opens.

On the occasion with which we are
concerned Mr. and Mrs. Uno were sitting in the sitting room with the deceased
son and the other son and daughter. The store bell having rung, the father left
the room for some reason and the mother entered the shop. She says Hughes was
carrying a revolver and she uttered some expression which gave a warning to the
family in the sitting room that a hold-up was in progress. They had formerly
gone through the same experience and this expression was understood. Mrs. Uno
says that Hughes went immediately toward the curtains of the door leading into
the sitting room and, as he approached, he fired a shot which passed through
the wooden partition at the side of the doorway. When he got to the curtains he
fired another shot through the curtains. The first of these shots wounded
Yoshyuki Uno in the hand and the second in the arm. Yoshyuki immediately came
into the store and grappled with Hughes in an effort to disarm him. The brother
and the mother were in the store at this time together and the brother agrees
with the mother that this struggle took place. Their accounts, however, of the
actual shooting of the victim do not agree. The brother says that Hughes broke
away from Yoshyuki and left the shop and, just as he was opening the door
turned and fired at Yoshyuki a third shot which took effect in his head and
killed him. The mother says that in the struggle Yoshyuki was attempting to
take the pistol from Hughes ""but could not reach because he was quite
high"". She adds:—

* * * Hughes was holding
gun, and my son grabbed his wrist.

Q. Does she mean that Hughes
was holding the gun in his hand?

A. Yes, and my son was doing
his best, and trying to bring it down, but he was quite weakened because he
sustained injury already.

She says that while they were
struggling she heard a shot and afterwards did not hear another, that after the

[Page 520]

shot her son fell down and Hughes
made off. She distinctly remembers one shot fired during the struggle but heard
no later shot. It ought to be observed perhaps that the brother's evidence,
while generally agreeing with his mother's statement that there was a struggle,
is to the effect that Yoshyuki "" had Hughes' wrist raising it up in the
air"". If the jury accepted the brother's account of the shooting they had
before them, of course, a plain case of murder. The controversy turns entirely
upon the alternative hypothesis that the third shot occurred during the
struggle, as the mother says.

The majority of the Court of
Appeal have held that it was open to the jury, if they took a certain view of
the evidence, to find that the pistol went off by accident in the sense that it
was not discharged by any act of Hughes done with the intention of discharging
it, and that if they so found they might properly have brought in a verdict of
manslaughter and that the learned trial judge erred in not leaving that issue
to them. 

The Crown appeals.

The jury would view the acts of
Hughes from the moment Mrs. Uno entered the shop as swiftly succeeding phases
of a single outrage and without doubt as evincing a reckless disregard of the
consequences of his shooting, and they would be quite justified in ascribing to
him a knowledge that his conduct was endangering the lives of the people whose
premises he was invading. They might not improperly infer that the shot which
occurred during the struggle (if they accepted the mother's story), following
at once upon the two shots fired into the sitting room, was intentionally fired
by him in that state of mind. If that was their conclusion, it would be their
duty to find him guilty of murder under section 259 (d) of the Criminal Code. I
think the learned trial judge in effect instructed them in this sense. He also
properly instructed them that they might find the same verdict if they accepted
the evidence of the brother.

Unfortunately, he did not deal
with the third hypothesis, the possibility that they might find the pistol was
discharged by accident in the sense mentioned.

The Crown adduced in evidence
against the accused the testimony of one Ciminelli, who deposed to an account
of

[Page 521]

the shooting given to him by
Hughes in a conversation on the evening of the date of the crime, the 16th of January, 1942. In examination in chief Ciminelli said that Hughes told him on that
occasion that

the Jap came for him and
struggled with him and then * * * and the gun went off.

On cross-examination Ciminelli
said that on the preliminary hearing he had given this version of the
conversation:—

Q. What was the
conversation? A. He told me that he was in a jam.

Q. What kind of a jam? A. He
told me he took some store, and the guy came for him, and struggled with him,
and the gun accidentally went off.

Q. Do you remember giving
that evidence? A. That is right.

Q. Your recollection was
clearer then than it is to-day, I take it? A. That is right.

As Parke J. said in Rex v.
Higgins [2]:—

Now, what a prisoner says is
not evidence, unless the prosecutor chooses to make it so, by using it as a
part of his case against the prisoner; however, if the prosecutor makes the
prisoner's declaration evidence, it then becomes evidence for the prisoner, as
well as against him; but still, like all evidence given in any case, it is for
you to say whether you believe it.

If the jury accepted Ciminelli's
version of Hughes' statement given at the preliminary hearing ("" that the
gun accidentally went off"") as a true account of that statement, then that
statement in its complete form was evidence in favour of the accused. It was,
of course, for the jury to consider whether this statement, having regard to
all the other evidence before them, satisfied them that the pistol in fact went
off by accident and not by the voluntary act of Hughes, or that it was only of
sufficient weight to leave their minds in a state of doubt on the point. If the
jury thought the pistol did not go off by the voluntary act of Hughes, or were
in serious doubt about it, then another question might arise; and here emerges
the real point for decision on this appeal.

Before stating that point, I
quote subsection (2) of section 252 and subsection (d) of section 259 of
the Criminal Code:—

Section 252 (2): Homicide is
culpable when it consists in the killing of any person * * * by causing a
person, by threats or fear of violence, or by deception, to do an act which
causes that person's death * * *

[Page 522]

Section 259: Culpable
homicide is number. 

***

(d) If the offender,
for an unlawful object, does an act which he knows or ought to have known to be
likely to cause death, and thereby kills any person, though he may have desired
that his object should be effected without hurting any one.

I think I ought to say now, in
the clearest terms, that, in my opinion, even if the jury thought the pistol
went off by accident (or were not satisfied that it did not go off in that
manner) they might still have properly found a verdict of murder under these
sections if they were satisfied that the conduct of the accused was such that
he ought to have known it to be likely to induce such a struggle as that which
actually occurred, and that somebody's death was likely to be caused thereby
and that such was the actual effect of his conduct and of the struggle.

At p. 583 of his judgment,
delivered on behalf of the majority of the Court, in Graves v. The
King [3], Anglin
J. (as he then was) says:—

For the purposes of this
appeal I assume that under this provision it was not necessary, in order to
bring the charge of culpable homicide within it, that the jury should have
found that the acts of the defendants were such as they knew or should have
known were likely to cause the very acts to be done or the precise situation to
arise which in fact resulted in the homicide, or to cause the death of the
person who was killed, but that it would suffice if the jury had found that the
accused did an act which they knew or should have known would be likely to
induce the doing of anything or to bring about any situation likely to cause the
death of some person—the person killed or any other person.

I think this passage ought to be
accepted as stating the law as it is, not merely as it is assumed to be. To
repeat, I think the act of Yoshyuki in attempting to disarm Hughes and the
ensuing struggle were so clearly the natural and ordinary consequences of
Hughes' conduct that the jury might well, as reasonable men, have inferred that
Hughes ought to have anticipated some such occurrence and the probable
involuntary discharge of the pistol as a natural incident of the occurrence; it
would then be for them to say whether the conditions of clause (d) of
section 259 when read with subsection (2) of section 252, were fulfilled. The
learned trial judge did not put this to the jury explicitly, but possibly it is
within the scope of his language.

[Page 523]

The learned judge, however, gave
the jury to understand that the accused must be acquitted if they did not find
them guilty of murder. I am forced to the conclusion that this was
misdirection.

The argument on behalf of the
Crown was based upon two decisions, Director of Public Prosecutions v.
Beard [4], and Rex
v. Elnick [5].

The rule laid down in the House
of Lords in Beard's case [6] is that
homicide arising from an act of violence in furtherance or in the course of the
crime of rape constitutes murder. In Beard's case [7]
it was proved that there was a violent struggle in which the accused
overpowered the child and stifled her cries by putting his hand over her mouth
and pressing his thumb upon her throat, the acts which, in her weakened state
resulting from the struggle, killed her. This, the House of Lords held, was
murder, although the accused had no intention of causing death.

I cannot agree that you can bring
within this rule the accidental discharge of the pistol admitted by Hughes. If
the pistol went off accidentally, in the sense mentioned above, it could hardly
be said as matter of law to be an act of violence done by the accused "" in
furtherance of or in the course of"" the crime of robbery in the sense of
the Lord Chancellor's judgment.

No question of accident in the
relevant sense arose in Beard's case [8]. There
was no question that the act which caused the suffocation, the act of the
prisoner in placing his hand on the mouth of the victim, was his voluntary act.
In the report of the case in the Criminal Appeal Reports[9],
there appears this passage in the judgment of the Lord Chief Justice:—

During a discussion on the
law applicable to the case the learned judge said that he should tell the jury
that if a man is engaged in violating the honour of a woman and she does her
best to defend herself and struggles, and the man does something which kills
her, to prevent her from screaming or struggling, it is murder. In summing up
he directed that ""if a man is assaulting a woman or girl, and the woman or
girl, in order to resist him screams and struggles, and the man, in order to
effect his purpose, puts his hand upon her mouth and suffocates her, he is
guilty of murder, and it is no use at all to say, 'I only intended to stop her
screaming. I did not intend to kill her.' That is no defence, in my
judgment.""

[Page 524] 

And at page 116:—

It was proved that there was
a struggle of a horrible description between this man, seeking to consummate
his desire, and this 13 years old girl. No questions were put in cross-examination
by Mr. Artemus Jones for the defence, to minimize the effect of the testimony
about the struggle that must have taken place. The child was straining every
nerve and muscle to escape him, and in order to overpower her and to stop her
struggles and screams he eventually did the act which resulted in her death. By
the law of England that is murder: it is an act of violence done in the
course or in furtherance of a felony involving violence, and beyond all
question and beyond the range of any controversy that is murder.

Again the judgment of the Lord
Chancellor makes it quite clear that the defence founded upon drunkenness was
not that Beard was so drunk as to be incapable of forming the intent to commit
rape, but that he was incapable of measuring or foreseeing the consequences of
his violent act, or that at the time of placing his hand on the child's mouth
he was incapable of knowing that what he was doing was dangerous. At p. 307 he
says:—

There was certainly no
evidence that he was too drunk to form the intent of committing rape. Under
these circumstances, it was proved that death was caused by an act of violence
done in furtherance of the felony of rape. Such a killing is by the law of England murder.

In this country a charge arising
out of circumstances such as those considered in Beard's case [10]
would be disposed of under the law laid down in section 260 of the Criminal
Code.

As regards Rex v.
Elnick [11], Mr.
Justice Cameron says at p. 431:—

The jury should have been
told that on the undisputed and admitted facts the killing of De Forge was
caused by an act of violence done by Elnick in furtherance of a crime of
violence, that the killing was therefore murder and that it was their duty to
return a verdict of guilty.

That is really the basis of the
decision in that case. Such a direction could not properly have been given in
this case, in view of the evidence set forth above as to accidental discharge.

The learned trial judge ought to
have told the jury that they might and ought to find a verdict of manslaughter
if they thought the pistol was not discharged by the voluntary act of Hughes,
and that Hughes did not anticipate

[Page 525]

and ought not to have anticipated
that his conduct might bring about a struggle in which somebody's death might
be caused.

Mr. Justice Fisher thinks that on
the evidence no reasonable jury could find that the discharge of the pistol was
accidental, or that there was sufficient evidence to raise a doubt upon that
point. There is much, very much, to be said for that view; I am not satisfied,
however, that if the issue of manslaughter had been left to the jury, they must
necessarily have found the verdict they did.

I think the learned trial judge
proceeded rightly in instructing the jury that in the circumstances of this
particular case the law to be applied is to be found in the Criminal Code. He
might well have called the attention of the jury to the second subsection of
section 252 and to the judgment of Anglin J. in Graves v.
The King [12]. As
this Court thought in Graves v. The King (1), I am quite
satisfied that the law to be applied to the circumstances of this case is to be
found in the Code and that we need not pass upon the question whether the
definitions in sections 252, 259 and 260 Cr. C. are exhaustive.

The appeal, therefore, from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal, as it affects the conviction of Hughes, should
be dismissed; and it follows necessarily that the appeal in respect of the
other respondents must also be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Companies—False
statement by director—False by implication—Liability of director—Balance sheet
of company—Loan to company treated as cash asset—Particulars—Criminal Code,
sections 413 and 414.

APPEAL by the Attorney-General
for British Columbia from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] which (Macdonald C.J.B.C. and O'Halloran J.A.
dissenting) allowed the respondent's appeal and quashed the conviction of the
accused respondent.

The respondent, who was president
and managing director of the Freehold Oil Corporation Limited, obtained the sum
of $40,336.46 on the 31st of March, 1937, from an associate named Miller
through his secretary (Miller being away at the time) and deposited it to the
credit of the Freehold Company. In repayment thereof he handed the said
secretary six post-dated cheques of the Freehold Company aggregating the above
sum and dated respectively the 8th, 9th, 10th, 12th, 13th and 14th of April,
1937. Three days later the Freehold Company's balance sheet was made up by the
company's chartered accountants, showing current assets as of March 31st, 1937,
to include "" cash in bank $48,789.76."" This amount included the sum
of $40,336.46 obtained by the respondent as aforesaid. Four days later at a
meeting of the directors the balance sheet was approved. The annual meeting of
the company was called for April 14th and a copy of the balance sheet was
directed to be forwarded to the shareholders with the notice calling the meeting.
No disclosure was made to the shareholders of the six post-dated cheques.
Particulars delivered pursuant to order stated that the false statement
consisted in entries in the books of the company showing a sale of shares of
another company for $40,336.46 and a re-purchase of the same number of shares
from a third company for the same amount, and an audited balance sheet showing
as an asset ""Cash in bank"" $48,789.76,

[Page 229]

which did not reflect the true
financial position of the respondent's company. The respondent was convicted
under section 414 of the Criminal Code, for that he, being a director of a
public company, did, with intent to deceive its shareholders, concur in making
a statement of its financial position which he knew to be false in a material
particular, viz., that the assets of the company consisted of $48,789.76 in
cash. The trial judge, Lennox Co.J., found that although on the material date
the company had cash in the bank in said amount, yet the statement was false in
that it did not show that of that amount $46,336.46 represented money borrowed
by the company which was still owing to the lender. The Court of Appeal
reversed that judgment, quashed the conviction and held (Macdonald C.J.B.C. and
O'Halloran J.A. dissenting) that while the respondent might have been charged
with falsifying the balance sheet at large in not showing the true state of the
company's affairs or that it was false in particular in not disclosing the
liability for the loan, nevertheless the respondent ought not to have been
convicted of making a false balance sheet as alleged in the terms of the
conviction, because in truth the company had in the bank to its credit the sum
of $48,789.76 and that sum was an asset of the company no matter what
liabilities there were against it: the Crown elected to complain of only one
item and that item by itself was unquestionably a true and not a false ""
material particular.""

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA EN BANC

Criminal law—Evidence—Accused charged with
arson—Contention that accused arranged that other persons carry out the crime—Evidence
of conversations between such other persons—Admissibility—Questioning of accused,
in cross-examination, as to alleged fire at other premises than those in
question.

The accused appealed from the judgment of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, 15 M.P.R. 459, affirming his
conviction of having unlawfully and wilfully set fire to a store. The appeal
was based on certain objections of law, which were grounds of dissent in the
said Court en banc.

(1) One G. testified that accused hired him
to commit the crime and G. arranged with P. to do it. P. testified that he
secured the assistance of T. P. and T. gave evidence that they set the premises
on fire. It was objected that evidence of P. and T., particularly with
reference to their conversations with each other and with G., was improperly
admitted.

Held, that
this ground of appeal failed.

Per the Chief
Justice and Kerwin J.: The evidence of P. and T. did not implicate accused in
any way, but was admissible to prove the actual setting of the fire. Accused
was not charged with having conspired to commit arson and, as the trial judge explained
to the jury, the actions of P. and T. and the conversations between them were
relevant to the charge upon which accused was being tried only if the jury were
satisfied as to the truth of the evidence given by G. relating to his
conversation with accused.

Per Rinfret,
Crocket and Taschereau JJ.: Any acts done or words spoken in furtherance of the
common design may be given in evidence against all (Paradis v. The
King, [1934] S.C.R. 165). This rule applies to all indictments for crime,
and not only when the indictment is for conspiracy, and it also applies even if
the conspirator whose words or acts are tendered as evidence has not been
indicted (Cloutier v. The King, [1940] S.C.R. 131, at 137). These
principles were properly applied to the present case.

(2) It was objected that the prosecuting
officer, in cross-examining accused, had improperly questioned him as to an
alleged fire at other premises than those in question, which questioning had
greatly prejudiced accused with the jury.

Held: Effect
should be given to this objection; the appeal should be allowed and a new trial
ordered.

Per the Chief
Justice and Kerwin J.: The likely, if not the only, effect upon the jurymen of
said questioning would be that accused was a Person who was very apt to commit
the crime with which he was

[Page 482]

charged. A person charged with having
committed a crime is not only entitled to have placed before the jury only
evidence that is relevant to the issues before the court, but, when testifying
on his own behalf, he may not be asked questions that have no possible bearing
upon such issues and might only tend to prejudice a fair trial. The questioning
complained of could not be justified on the ground that it went to accused's
credibility: credibility cannot arise in connection with questions relating to
an extraneous matter that has not been opened by the examination in chief of
accused or otherwise on his behalf.

Pen Rinfret,
Crocket and Taschereau JJ.: An accused has, to answer the specific charge
mentioned in the indictment for which he is standing on trial, and the evidence
must be limited to matters relating to the transaction which forms the subject
of the indictment (Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935]
A.C. 309); otherwise the real issue may be distracted from the jury's minds,
and an atmosphere of guilt created, prejudicial to the accused. The accused
cannot be cross-examined on other criminal acts supposed to have been committed
by him, unless he has been convicted, or unless these acts are connected with
the offence charged and tend to prove it (Paradis v. The King, [1934]
S.C.R. 165, at 169), or unless they show a system or a particular intention, as
decided in Brunei v. The King, 57 Can. S.C.R. 83. The questioning
of accused complained of may have influenced the verdict of the jury and caused
accused a substantial wrong.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia en banc[1]
affirming (Hall and Archibald JJ. dissenting) the conviction of the appellant,
at trial before Doull J. and a jury, of having ""unlawfully, without legal
justification or excuse, and without colour of right, wilfully set fire""
to a certain store ""and did thereby commit arson.""

The questions before this Court on this
appeal, and the nature of the evidence or proceedings from which such questions
arose, are sufficiently set out in the reasons for judgment in this Court now
reported.

The appeal to this Court was allowed and a
new trial ordered.

J. W. Maddin K.C. and I. G. MacLeod for
the appellant.

Hon. J. H. MacQuarrie K.C. and M. A.
Patterson for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.
was delivered by

[Page 483]

Kerwin J.—The appellant Koufis was convicted on an indictment charging him
with having unlawfully set fire to a store known as Diana Sweets, in Sydney,
Nova Scotia, on or about April 18th, 1940. On an appeal to the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia en banc, the conviction was affirmed. Mr. Justice Hall and
Mr. Justice Archibald dissented and would have ordered a new trial on the
ground that the prosecuting officer, in cross-examining the accused, had
improperly questioned him as to an alleged fire at premises known as the London
Grill, in Sydney, which greatly prejudiced the accused with the jury. Mr.
Justice Hall also dissented on the ground that the evidence of two witnesses
called by the Crown (Pentecost and Thistle), particularly with reference to
their conversations with each other and with one Jerome Gerrior, was improperly
admitted in evidence.

Koufis appealed to this Court against the
affirmance of this conviction on these two questions of law. As to the second
point, we announced at the hearing that we would not require to hear counsel
for the respondent, as we considered the evidence of the two men admissible. As
to the first, we have had the advantage of a complete argument and we have
determined that the questions referred to were improperly asked.

At one time Koufis was a partner in the
restaurant and confectionery business known as Diana Sweets and also in a
similar business operated under the name of the London Grill. He sold his
interest in both and left Sydney. Upon his return to that city, he desired to
become a partner in the Diana Sweets business again but that was not acceptable
to some, if not all, of the then members of the partnership. Thereupon he, with
others, commenced a third business known as the Dome, which was still in
operation on April 18th, 1940.

On that date the store in which the Diana Sweets
business was carried on and which was known by that name was destroyed by fire
and it was in connection with that fire that Koufis was charged with arson. The
basis for the charge was the evidence of Gerrior. He testified that Koufis had
promised to pay him a sum of money to burn Diana Sweets and had said to him:
""If you are scared to do it, get somebody else and give him half the money
"";

[Page 484]

and that he (Gerrior) accordingly arranged with
Pentecost to do the work. The latter testified that he in turn secured the
assistance of Thistle. Both Pentecost and Thistle gave evidence that they set
the premises on fire, and the learned trial judge, therefore, was quite
accurate when he stated in his charge to the jury: ""so, if you give effect
to that evidence, it is clear that somebody is guilty of the crime of arson.""

The trial judge put to the jury as the crux of
the case: ""Did the accused directly or through Gerrior procure Thistle and
Pentecost to set the fire?"" He instructed the jury as to the danger of
convicting upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice and also told
them that there was no corroboration of the stories told by Gerrior, Pentecost
and Thistle. The evidence of the last two did not implicate Koufis in any way
but was admissible to prove the actual setting of the fire. Koufis was not
charged with having conspired to commit arson and, as the trial judge
explained, the actions of Pentecost and Thistle and the conversations between
themselves were relevant to the charge upon which Koufis was being tried only
if the jury were satisfied as to the truth of the evidence given by Gerrior
relating to his conversations with the accused. On this point we are satisfied
that the appeal could not succeed.

Turning now to the first point, we find that
when John Raptis, one of the partners in Diana Sweets and a witness on behalf
of the Crown, was testifying in chief as to the conversation between him and
the accused when the latter wanted to again become a partner in that business,
the following occurred:—

Q. Tell us what he said.

A. Lots of us down on Charlotte street and
we get along very well. I never saw him until he got the Dome down to the
Capital, and I met him one night before the first Dome was burned and he ask me
""You have to raise the price, no money in the meals"" and I say we are
doing all right; and I saw him again after the fire, the first fire in the
Dome.

Q. A year ago?

A. Two years ago in August.

Q. It was before that first fire he
complained to you about the prices?

A. Yes, wanted to increase the prices.
After he was at this Dome I never see him except in Church, just say
""hello.""

Q. You were not talking to him after the
fire?

A. No.

[Page 485]

This was the first mention in the evidence of
any fire other than the one in question.

The following appears in the examination in
chief of Gerrior when he was asked as to whether he had seen Koufis about two
weeks before Christmas of 1939 after an accidental fire had occurred in Diana
Sweets:—

A. Yes, two days after. I told him about it
and he said ""Why did you not leave it burn"" and I said
""Why?"" and he said ""If you had leave it burn I would give you
$50."" I let it go at that. Couple of days after I met him and he asked me
to go down and see him, and I did go down about twelve at night. He told me if
I burn the Diana he would give me $350; he did not like them, they did not come
up to his place and they were no good; he wanted them destroyed. He told me how
it could foe done. He said ""You could burn it and nobody would suspect you
because you are a fireman. When the other Dome burned nobody suspected the fireman
and no questions asked to him.""

Q. Was he at the other Dome when it burned?

A. He was running it.

Later in his testimony in chief, in the course
of an answer to a question, he stated: ""After the Dome Grill burned I went
to see Koufis.""

Testifying on his own behalf, the accused, in
answer to his own counsel and with reference to the Dome business, was asked:—

Q. And you were burned out?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you do then?

A. We have heavy loss in the fire. We lose
$5,000 and another $4,000. Either $9,000 or $10,000 altogether.

In cross-examination he was asked what he
considered the Diana Sweets business was worth at the time he sold his interest
in it.

A. $28,000 or $27,000 besides the good
will.

Q. Was the Diana Sweets worth more then
than at the time of your last fire?

A. I don't know. That is for the time I was
there.

Later in cross-examination he was asked a number
of questions as to the amount of insurance that had been carried on the Dome
business at the time of a fire there. While we are not concerned with the
evidence as to any fire at the Dome restaurant since no dissent is based on the
admission of that evidence, I have referred to it in order to show how those
fires came to be mentioned. Then

[Page 486]

followed the evidence with reference to the
London Grill, upon which the dissent below has been based and which evidence I
transcribe:—

Q. Did you own the London Grill?

A. Yes, four partners.

Q. What four partners?

A. Roy Woodill, Russell Urquhart, myself
and Gus Mandros.

Q. That place burned too?

A. Never.

Q. Never a fire there?

A. Never a fire there in the London Grill?

Q. Do you mean the London Grill situated on
the corner of Charlotte and Wentworth streets was never on fire at any time?

A. Never have any claim for fire insurance.

Q. Was there a fire there?

A. Inside the store?

Q. Yes.

A. The London store never had a fire. The
building next to it. There are two places there, the London Grill on one side
and groceries on the other.

Q. The two are under one roof?

A. Absolutely.

Q. And this fire was in the partition
between the two?

A. No, started at the end of the building.

Q. Was it underneath the building the fire
started?

A. I don't know, the other end.

Q. It was underneath the building, wasn't
it?

A. No, not in our basement.

Q. Wasn't it underneath the building?

A. I don't know.

Q. Anyway, the building that the London
Grill was in caught fire?

A. Yes.

This was the only reference to a fire at or near
the London Grill and the likely effect, if not the only effect, upon the
jurymen of this line of cross-examination, particularly the questions ""Was
it underneath the building the fire started"" and ""It was underneath
the building, wasn't it"" and ""Wasn't it underneath the
building,"" would be that the accused was a person who was very apt to
commit the crime with which he was charged. In fact, the trial judge stated to
the jury: ""The only reason he would be asked about another fire is to show
he was likely to start this."" Again there is no dissent as to the charge
and I mention it merely to indicate that any doubt in the mind of the jury as
to the purpose of these questions would be set at rest by this comment.

By section 4 of the Canada Evidence Act, every
person charged with an offence is a competent witness for the defence, and by
section 12, a witness may be questioned

[Page 487]

as to whether he has been convicted of any
offence and upon being so questioned, if he either denies the fact or refuses
to answer, the opposite party may prove such conviction. We are not concerned
on this appeal with the question as to when the prosecution is entitled to give
evidence of the bad character of an accused because it is not suggested that
Koufis had been convicted of any crime in connection with the fire at the
London Grill, or that he had been even charged with any such crime, or in fact
that any crime had been committed by anyone. A person charged with having
committed a crime is not only entitled to have placed before the jury only
evidence that is relevant to the issues before the Court, but, when testifying
on his own behalf, he may not be asked questions that have no possible bearing
upon such issues and might only tend to prejudice a fair trial. In the opinion
of the majority of the Supreme Court en banc, these questions were
justified on the ground that they went to the credibility of the accused, but
credibility cannot arise in connection with questions relating to an extraneous
matter that has not been opened by the examination in chief of the accused or
otherwise on his behalf. The conviction should be set aside and a new trial
ordered.

The judgment of Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau
JJ. was delivered by

Taschereau J.—The appellant, William Koufis, has been found guilty of the crime
of arson and sentenced to serve five years in Dorchester Penitentiary. The
Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia confirmed this conviction (Hall and Archibald
JJ. dissenting).

There is no suggestion that the accused set fire
himself to the building called the Diana Sweets which was burned, but the
contention of the Crown is that the accused hired one Jerome Gerrior to commit
the crime and that the latter offered Clayton Pentecost one hundred and
seventy-five dollars ($175), who shared this sum with Edward Thistle to burn
the premises. The grounds of appeal are the following:—

1. The evidence of Clayton Pentecost and Edward
Thistle, particularly with reference to their conversations

[Page 488]

with each other and Jerome Gerrior, was
inadmissible in the trial against William Koufis and was improperly-admitted in
evidence.

2. The accused was greatly prejudiced in his
defence by the publication and circulation in the City of Sydney and
surrounding districts of a certain newspaper known as The Steelworker and
Miner, which charged the accused with having committed the offence
hereinbefore recited as well as imputing to him, the said William Koufis, the
crime of arson in connection with fires which have occurred at premises known
as the Dome Grill at Sydney, as well as with an alleged fire at premises known
as the London Grill at Sydney, and an alleged fire in a bowling alley in
Sydney.

3. The learned prosecuting officer for the
County of Cape Breton in cross-examining the accused improperly questioned him
as to fires in the said Dome Grill and the London Grill, which greatly
prejudiced the accused with the jury.

I believe that the first ground of appeal is
unfounded. It is well settled law that any acts done or words spoken in
furtherance of the common design may be given in evidence against all (Paradis
v. The King[2]).
This rule applies to all indictments for crime, and not only when the
indictment is for conspiracy, and it also applies even if the conspirator whose
words or acts are tendered as evidence has not been indicted (Cloutier v.
The King[3]).
These principles were properly applied to the present case, and I believe that
the conversations between Gerrior, Pentecost and Thistle were rightly admitted
in evidence.

The appellant further submits that even if such
an evidence is legal, there must be some independent evidence of conspiracy
before the statements of co-conspirators, become admissible one against the
other. Although the pronouncements on this ground have not always been
unanimous, the matter has been definitely settled in the case of The King v.
Paradis, cited supra, and which was based on a decision rendered
by the Supreme Court of

[Page 489]

British Columbia (The King v. Hutchinson[4]). In the case of Paradis
v. The King[5],
Mr. Justice Rinfret, giving the judgment of the Court, said:—

Nor would it be error for a trial judge to
permit proof of acts of alleged conspiracy to be given in evidence before the
agreement to conspire has been established, if the latter is in fact proved
during the course of the trial.

The second point raised by the appellant is that
the accused has been prejudiced by the publication of certain articles in The
Steelworker and Miner.

The articles complained of were certainly of a
serious character, as they clearly stated that the appellant was the party
responsible for several fires which occurred in Sydney some time before the trial.
These articles, however, were not referred to at the trial and were put in the
record only when the case reached the Court of Appeal. An affidavit was filed
signed by I. J. MacLeod to the effect that The Steelworker and Miner is
widely circulated throughout the County of Cape Breton and the City of Sydney;
but there is nothing in the record or the evidence to show that the members of
the jury had any knowledge of the contents of these articles nor that they did
not give a free unbiased verdict. Under these circumstances, I am of opinion
that the appellant cannot succeed on this point.

The third ground of appeal is much more serious
and is obviously the one on which the appellant practically rests his whole
case. It raises the question of the cross-examination of the accused by the
solicitor for the respondent on previous fires which occurred at the Dome Grill
and at the London Grill at Sydney. The learned judges, however, do not enter a
formal dissent as to the cross-examination on the fire which destroyed the Dome
Grill, but they dissent on the ground that the accused has been improperly
cross-examined as to the alleged fire at the London Grill. The Canada
Evidence Act, section 12, says:—

A witness may be questioned as to whether
he has been convicted of any offence, and upon being so questioned, if he
either denies the fact or refuses to answer, the opposite party may prove such
conviction.

If the accused admits having committed the
offence, the answer, being a collateral one, is obviously final. If he

[Page 490]

denies having committed the offence, then the
conviction may be proved by legal means provided for in subsection 2,
paragraphs (a) and (b), of section 12. The authority given to the
Grown is to cross-examine the accused on previous convictions, but this
section 12 cannot be interpreted as meaning that the accused may be
cross-examined on offences which he is suspected of having committed but for
which he has not been convicted.

When an accused is tried before the Criminal
Courts, he has to answer the specific charge mentioned in the indictment for
which he is standing on trial, ""and the evidence must be limited to
matters relating to the transaction which forms the subject of the indictment""
(Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions[6]). Otherwise, ""the
real issue may be distracted from the minds of the jury,"" and an
atmosphere of guilt may be created which would indeed prejudice the accused.

In the present case, the accused was asked in
cross-examination if he had owned the London Grill? If that place had burned
too? If the fire had started underneath the building? All these questions
were obviously asked in order to convey to the jury the impression that the
accused had set fire previously to another building, and to establish the
possibility that he committed the offence for which he is now charged. The
accused cannot be cross-examined on other criminal acts supposed to have been
committed by him, unless he has been convicted, or unless these acts are
connected with the offence charged and tend to prove it (Paradis v. The
King[7]), or unless they show a
system or a particular intention as decided in Brunei v. The King[8]. It is clear to my mind
that this cross-examination may have influenced the verdict of the jury and
caused the accused a substantial wrong.

I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial.

Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.

The "" court of

the appellant.

respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—I have no
hesitation in expressing my agreement with the conclusion of my brother Rinfret
in Arcadi v. The King[1],
that the courts of appeal, contemplated by section 1025 of the Criminal Code,
do not include any courts other than Canadian courts.

In addition to the reasons of my
brother Rinfret, I may add that the interpretation very ably contended for by
Mr. Newcombe (that conflict with a decision on a criminal appeal in England is
sufficient to give jurisdiction under that section) might open up in any case
the question whether the judgment in which leave to appeal was prayed was
inconsistent with the decisions of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved, of the
Exchequer Chamber, of the House of Lords, or of the Privy Council; in other
words, might open up a field of examination so broad as to trench upon the
limitation in section 1023 to a degree probably not contemplated by section
1025.

Then, the Chief Justice, after
dealing with the merits of the case, dismissed the application.

Application dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—War Measures—Regulation made by
Governor in Council—No sanction provided—Application of section 164 of the
Criminal Code—Regulation to ""have the force of law""—Whether deemed to
be an Act of Parliament—War Measures Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 206, ss. 3(2) and
4—Criminal Code, ss. 2(1) and 164.

An order or regulation made by the Governor
in Council under the War Measures Act, although it is thereby enacted
that such order or regulation ""shall have the force of law,"" is not
an enactment passed by Parliament, i.e., an Act of Parliament, but is merely an
enactment passed by the Government.

When an accused is charged of having
disobeyed such an order or regulation, for the violation of which no penalty or
other mode of punishment has been expressly provided, the disobedience so
complained of is not punishable under section 164 of the Criminal Code, which
relates only to violations of Acts of Parliament or of provincial legislatures.

regulation, restricting the sale of codeine, made by the Governor in Council
under section 3 of the War Measures Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 206, such
violation allegedly constituting wilful disobedience of an Act of the

The judgment of Rinfret and Crocket JJ. was
delivered by

Rinfret J.—The War Measures Act was enacted in 1914. With certain
modifications, it has remained in the statutes and is now found in chapter 206
of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927.

Its object is to confer special powers to the
Governor in Council, which he may, by reason of the existence of real or
apprehended war, invasion or insurrection, deem necessary or advisable for the
security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada.

The Act reads (subs. 2 of s. 3) as follows:

All orders and regulations made under this
section shall have the force of law, and shall be enforced in such manner and
by such courts, officers and authorities as the Governor in Council may
prescribe, and may be varied, extended or revoked by any subsequent order or
regulation.

The Governor in Council is by sec. 4 of the Act
empowered to

prescribe the penalties that may be imposed
for violations of orders and regulations made under this Act, and

(to)

also prescribe whether such penalties shall
be imposed upon summary conviction or upon indictment, but no such penalty
shall exceed a fine of five thousand dollars or imprisonment for any term not
exceeding five years, or both fine and imprisonment.

On the 11th day of September, 1939, purporting
to act under the provisions of the War Measures Act and upon a report of
the Minister of Pensions and National Health, the Governor in Council made an
order to the following effect, amongst others:

2. No retail druggist shall sell or supply
straight Codeine, whether in powder, tablet or liquid form, or preparations
containing any quantity of any of the narcotic drugs mentioned in Parts I and
II of the Schedule to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, mixed with
medicinal or other ingredients, except upon the written order or prescription
therefor signed and dated by a physician, veterinary surgeon or dentist whose
signature is known to the said druggist, or, if unknown, duly verified before
such order or prescription is filled. No such order or prescription shall be
filled upon more than one occasion, and it shall be filed by such retail
druggist and be available for subsequent inspection.

3. Any person found in possession of
Codeine or preparation containing narcotic drugs mentioned in Parts I and II of
the Schedule to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, mixed with other
medicinal ingredients, save and except under the authority of a licence from
the Minister

[Page 113]

of Pensions and National Health first had
and obtained, or other lawful authority, shall be liable to the penalties
provided upon summary conviction under the provisions of Section 4 of the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act.

The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act referred
to in the above quoted paragraphs of the Order is a Dominion statute (R.S.C.,
1927, c. 144) which, as stated, contains a schedule wherein certain narcotic
drugs are enumerated and which, up to the date of the Order, did not include
Codeine.

Under the provisions of that Order, on November
6th, 1939, a charge was laid against the respondent, a retail druggist of the
city of Montreal, for that

he did, without lawful excuse, disobey an
Act of the Parliament of Canada for which no penalty or other mode of
punishment is expressly provided, to wit: Paragraph two of regulations dated
11th day of September, 1939, of the War Measures Act, Chapter 206 of
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, by wilfully selling Codeine, a narcotic drug
mentioned in Part Two of the Schedule to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act without
first having had and obtained a written order or prescription therefor signed
and dated by a physician, the whole contrary to Sec. 164 Criminal Code of
Canada.

As must have been noted, the charge stated that
""no penalty or other mode of punishment is expressly provided""; and
it is a fact that the order or regulation under which the charge was laid does
not contain any provision for a ""penalty or other mode of
punishment.""

On this charge, the trial judge (C. E. Guérin,
Judge of Sessions of the Peace) liberated the accused and dismissed the
complaint on the ground that the order or regulation, as a consequence of which
the charge was laid, was not an ""Act of the Parliament of Canada or of any
legislature of Canada,"" and that, therefore, section 164 of the Criminal
Code did not apply.

Upon appeal, this judgment was affirmed
(Tellier, C.J., St. Germain and Bond, JJ. forming the majority; Barclay and
Francœur, JJ. dissenting). The formal judgment specifies as follows the ground
in law on which the dissent is based:

Sur le motif qu'en loi le règlement en
question doit être considéré comme faisant partie de la Loi des Mesures de
Guerre, et que partant il y a lieu à l’application de l’article 164 C. Cr.

The Attorney-General is now before this Court
under section 1023 of the Criminal Code on the question of law over which there
has been dissent in the court of appeal.

[Page 114]

Section 164 of the Criminal Code enacts
specifically that the offence must consist in wilfully doing any act which is forbidden,
or omitting to do any act which is required to be done by an ""Act of the
Parliament of Canada.""

It is an Act of the Parliament of Canada which
the guilty person must have disobeyed without lawful excuse. And under those
circumstances, if some penalty or other mode of punishment has not been
otherwise expressly provided by law, the person found guilty is declared to be
""liable to one year's imprisonment."" In the present case, although
the respondent was charged of having disobeyed an Act of Parliament for which
no penalty or other mode of punishment was expressly provided, it is stated in
the information and complaint that the disobedience complained of was in
reality a disobedience to paragraph 2 of the regulation already referred to in
this judgment.

The information is, therefore, for having
disobeyed not an Act of Parliament, but a regulation made under an Act of the
Parliament of Canada.

I agree with the trial judge and with the
majority of the court of appeal that, in the premises, section 164 of the
Criminal Code has no application.

Of course, the War Measures Act enacts
that the orders and regulations made under it ""shall have the force of
law."" It cannot be otherwise. They are made to be obeyed and, as a
consequence, they must have the force of law. But that is quite a different
thing from saying that they will be deemed to be an Act of Parliament.

An Act of Parliament is defined in the Criminal
Code (sec. 2-1). It is there declared to include

an Act passed or to be passed by the
Parliament of Canada, or any Act passed by the legislature of the late province
of Canada, or passed or to be passed by the legislature of any province of
Canada, or passed by the legislature of any province now a part of Canada,
before it was included therein.

In terms, therefore, the words: ""Act of the
Parliament of Canada"" do not include regulations made under the provisions
of such Act. It is clearly indicated in section 2 (1)—which is the
Interpretation clause of the Criminal Code—that, in order to come under the appellation
of an Act, the enactment must have been ""passed by the Parliament of
Canada"" or ""by the legislature of any province of Canada,"" etc.

[Page 115]

A regulation made under an Act, and in
particular a regulation under the War Measures Act, is not an enactment
passed by Parliament; it is an enactment made by the Government.

An Act of Parliament, in order to become law and
to form part of the statutes of Canada, must be adopted by the House of
Commons, the Senate and receive the Royal Assent. It is debated publicly, to
the knowledge of the public, and it comes into force on the day of its sanction
by Royal Assent, which is given publicly.

The regulation takes the form of an Order in
Council, debated secretly by the Privy Council and, generally speaking, will
come into force as soon as it is signed by the Governor General, without there
being any essential requirement for its publication.

These circumstances show the great difference
between the Act of Parliament and the Order in Council, in so far as the people
is concerned; and the difference takes even more importance when it is applied
to section 164 of the Criminal Code, which requires for the guilt of an accused
that he should have been doing or omitting any act ""wilfully"" and
""without lawful excuse.""

An additional point in respect of the difference
between an Act of Parliament or a statute and an Order in Council may be found
in the Act respecting the Publication of the Statutes (ch. 2 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927) and in the Canada Evidence Act, with regard to
evidence and to judicial knowledge.

It should be further noted that the delegation
of powers to the Governor in Council, as expressed in the War Measures Act with
regard to orders and regulations, merely enacts that these orders and regulations

shall have the force of law, and shall be
enforced in such manner and by such courts, officers and authorities as the
Governor in Council may prescribe,

with further power given to the Governor in
Council to ""prescribe the penalties that may be imposed for
violation"" etc. These provisions in the Act are far from being as strong,
for the purpose of the appellant's argument, as the similar provision
contained, for example, in the Bankruptcy Act (c. 11, R.S.C., 1927):
""Such rules shall be judicially noticed and shall have effect as if
enacted

[Page 116]

by this Act"" (s. 161, par. 3), or in the Explosives
Act (c. 62, R.S.C., 1927):

All regulations made under this Act * * *
shall have the same for.ce as if they formed part of this Act (s.
5, par. 2),

or in the Fisheries Act (c. 73 of R.S.C.,
1927):

Every offence against any regulation made
under this Act may be stated as in violation of this Act (s. 46).

or in the Meat and Canned Foods Act (c.
77, R.S.C., 1927):

Such orders and regulations shall have the
same force and effect as if embodied in this Act (s. 4, par. 2).

In the statute now under consideration,
provisions equivalent to those just quoted are nowhere to be found; and, on the
contrary, the clear distinction between the Act itself and the regulations made
under the Act is recognized.

One would think that if Parliament intended the
regulations under the War Measures Act to be considered by the courts as
forming part of the Act and, therefore, to be susceptible of the application of
section 164 of the Criminal Code, Parliament would have said so at least in
similar language to that employed in the several Acts just above referred to.

Far from it, in paragraph 3 of the regulation
made on the 11th day of September, 1939, the Governor in Council provides for
penalties, and it is said therein that these penalties will be imposed
""under the provisions of section 4 of the Opium and Narcotics
Act,"" thus relieving any offence against paragraph 3 of the regulation
from the application of section 164 of the Criminal Code.

That indeed would lend colour to the
respondent's argument that the regulations now under discussion, although in
terms passed in virtue of the powers given to the Governor in Council by the War
Measures Act, were, in fact, meant to affect the schedule of the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act, to which both the preamble of the Order in Council
and paragraphs 2 and 3 thereof specifically refer. And it is interesting to
note that, under that Act, the Governor in Council may make such orders and
regulations as are deemed necessary or expedient for the carrying out of the
intention of the Act, or may from time to time add to the schedule of the Act;
but every Order

[Page 117]

in Council in that behalf must be published in
the Canada Gazette and shall take effect only at the expiration of
thirty days from the date of such publication (ss. 21 & 22).

The question is not whether the consent of
Parliament may be expressed by delegated authority and that consequently it is
not necessary that an Act should be complete when it emerges from the debates
in Parliament or at the time it leaves the hands of the legislative body; but
the only question we have to decide in this case is whether the Orders in
Council made by force of the delegated authority are to be deemed equivalent to
an Act of Parliament within the meaning of section 164 of the Criminal Code. It
is not to the purpose to call them ""subordinate legislation"" or the
""complement of the legislation,"" for there is no denying the fact
that the regulations provided for in the War Measures Act are not
declared by Parliament to form part and parcel of the Act itself; and whether
they are as effectual for the purpose of obedience and disobedience of the
subject, they are not assimilable to the Act itself; and so far as concerns the
application of section 164 of the Code, they may not be treated as if they had
been enacted and were incorporated in the War Measures Act.

This view, it seems to me, is further
strengthened by the fact that, by force of the Act itself, Parliament put it in
the hands of the Governor in Council to prescribe the penalties that may be
imposed for violation of the regulations, thus indicating further its intention
that the matter should not be left to the general provisions contained in
section 164 of the Code.

We have not here a statute such as was under
consideration by the House of Lords in the case of Chartered Institute of
Patent Agents v. Lockwood[3], where
the words of the Act were that the rules ""shall be of the same effect as
if they were contained in this Act and shall be judicially noticed."" The
distinction between that Act and the War Measures Act is abundantly
clear.

So, in the case before the House of Lords in Minister
of Health v. The King (on the prosecution of Yaffe) [4], where the language was:

The order of the Minister, when made, shall
have effect as if enacted in this Act.

[Page 118]

It was held there that this enactment did not
preclude the Court from calling in question the order of the Minister, where
the scheme presented to him for confirmation is inconsistent with the
provisions of the Act, although in the particular case the scheme, whatever its
defects, was found to be an improvement scheme within the meaning of the Act.
However, it is evident that the wording of the statute discussed in that case
was far different from the wording of the War Measures Act, in so far as
it concerns the point now submitted to this Court.

We have been referred also to a number of other
decisions rendered in English cases. I have very serious doubt whether, in any
event, these decisions could be allowed to prevail against our Criminal Code
and the plain language of section 164. But, moreover, in those cases, the
English courts were called upon to interpret statutes differing in language and
in aim from the Acts now before this Court (see Lord Davey in Commissioners
of Taxation v. Kirk[5]; and
there is a clear distinction to be made between the present case and those in
which the decisions referred to were rendered. In the latter, the offences
against the regulations were common law misdemeanours before the statutes or
the regulations prohibited them; in the matter now before us, the sale of
Codeine never was in itself a misdemeanour; it was not even prohibited by the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act before the regulation of the 11th of September, 1939,
came into force under the provisions of the War Measures Act, and for
purposes which are there stated as being due to the existence of war. As I read
the decisions, where an act, heretofore a misdemeanour at common law, is
subsequently made an offence under the Criminal Code or under a statute or by
virtue of the regulations made thereunder, if the code or the statute provides
for no penalty as a consequence of the doing of the act which it prohibits, or
of omitting the act which it requires to be done, the law steps in and
establishes the mode of punishment; but if the act is made an offence merely as
a result of the regulations and, I repeat, was not, up to the coming into force
of the regulation, a common law misdemeanour, then the penalty must be found
either in the regulation itself or must have been provided for by the Act of
Parliament

[Page 119]

or the statute under which the regulation is
made, or otherwise the regulation is inoperative for want of any sanction.

For all these reasons, I am of the opinion that
section 164 of the Criminal Code does not apply to a charge such as that
brought against the respondent and that, under the circumstances, the
information and charge was rightly dismissed by the trial judge and by the
Court of King's Bench.

The appeal to this Court should, therefore, be
disallowed.

The judgment of Davis and Hudson JJ.
(dissenting) was delivered by

Hudson J.—The
question for decision in this case is whether or not the breach of a duty
validly created by an Order in Council passed under the War Measures Act is
a breach of that statute itself, within the meaning of article 164 of the
Criminal Code.

The power of Parliament to pass the War
Measures Act is not now open to question; nor is there any doubt about the
power of the Governor in Council under the provisions of this Act to pass the
particular order under consideration: see In Re Gray[6]; Rex v. Halliday[7].

There is, however, in the Order in Council in
question no provision for punishment in case of violation of its orders or
regulations, although by the statute the Governor in Council were given express
powers to impose penalties within prescribed limits.

In view of the absence of such a provision, the
prosecution in this case was based on article 164 of the Criminal Code, which
reads as follows:

Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to one year's imprisonment who, without lawful excuse,
disobeys any Act of the Parliament of Canada or of any legislature in Canada,
by wilfully doing any act which it forbids, or omitting to do any act which it
requires to be done, unless some penalty or other mode of punishment is
expressly provided by law.

The matter was heard in the first instance
before Judge Guérin, Judge of the Sessions of the Peace at Montreal, who gave a
considered judgment, in which he came to the conclusion that article 164 did
not apply on the ground

[Page 120]

that the offence charged was a violation of an
Order in Council and not of a statute. On appeal to the Court of King's Bench,
this was affirmed by a majority of the court, Mr. Justice Barclay and Mr.
Justice Francœur dissenting.

At common law it was well settled that either a
breach of a statute which concerns the public or any part of the public even
where no penalty was prescribed, or a breach of an order or regulation passed
under the authority of such a statute, was indictable: see Hawkins' Pleas of
the Crown, 1824 edition, page 65, and The King v. Harris[8]. The general rule as stated in Stephen's
Digest of the Criminal Law, article 166, is as follows:

Every one commits a misdemeanour who
wilfully disobeys any statute of the realm by doing any act which it forbids,
or by omitting to do any act which it requires to be done, and which concerns
the public or any part of the public, unless it appears from the statute that
it was the intention of the Legislature to provide some other penalty for such
disobedience.

and in support of this article the learned
author refers to the common law authorities above referred to, as well as
others. The article as drawn by him in this Digest appeared in substantially
the same form in the draft Bill attached to the Report of the English Royal
Commission on Criminal Law, 1880.

A similar statement is made by the late Mr.
Justice Burbidge in his Digest of Criminal Law of Canada, 1890, at page 115, in
the following language:

Every one commits a misdemeanour who
wilfully disobeys any statute by doing any act which it forbids or by omitting
to do any act which it requires to be done, and which concerns the public or
any part of the public, unless it appears from the statute that it was the
intention of the Legislature to provide some other penalty for such
disobedience.

The Canadian Criminal Code, as will be seen,
follows very closely the language of this article. Beyond this and the statutes
referred to by Judge Guérin and the Interpretation Act, there seems to
be nothing bearing on the history of the present article 164 of the Code.

Section 2 of the War Measures Act provides
that ""all orders and regulations made under this section shall have the
force of law.""

Parliament has said to residents of Canada: ""You must obey what is
prescribed by the Governor General in Council within the limits of the
authority we here give

[Page 121]

them."" If a person fails to observe the
requirements of an Order in Council legally passed under this Act, he, in my
opinion, disobeys the requirements of the statute itself, and in support of
this, reference might be made to the case of Willingale v. Norris[9]. The head-note is:

Where a statute gives power to an authority
to make regulations, a breach of the regulations so made is an offence against
the provisions of the statute.

A breach of regulations made under s. 4 of
the Hackney Carriages Act, 1850, for enforcing order at standings for
hackney carriages, is subject to the penalty of 40s. provided by s. 19 of the Hackney
Carriage Act, 1853, for offences against that Act; inasmuch as the effect
of s. 21 of the Act of 1853, which provides that the Acts of 1850 and 1853 are
to be construed as one Act, is that s. 4 of the Act of 1850 has the same
operation as if it were in fact contained in the Act of 1853, and therefore an
offence against regulations made under s. 4 of the Act of 1850 is an offence
against the Act of 1853.

Lord Alverstone, C.J. said at page 64:

I am of opinion that the effect of the
provision contained in s. 21 of the Act of 1853 was to make one code or statute
for the regulation of hackney carriages, and that therefore a general penal
clause for breach of the provisions of the Act of 1853 would apply to any
provision contained in the three Acts of 1843, 1850, and 1853. That is the
natural effect of this legislation where there are amending Acts intended to be
read as one statute. If it be said that a regulation is not a provision of an
Act, I am of opinion that R. v. Walker[10]
is an authority against that proposition. I should certainly have been prepared
to hold apart from authority that, where a statute enables an authority to make
regulations, a regulation made under the Act becomes for the purpose of
obedience or disobedience a provision of the Act. The regulation is only the
machinery by which Parliament has determined whether certain things shall or
shall not be done.

and Mr. Justice Bigham at page 66:

In my opinion, to break the regulations
made under the authority of a statute is to break the statute itself.

and Mr. Justice Walton at page 67:

Upon the second question, again not without
some difficulty, I have come to the conclusion that in the present case there
was charged against the respondent an ""offence against the provisions of
this Act"" within the meaning of s. 19 of the Act of 1853. It seems clear
that the Act of 1850 must be read as one—construed as one—with the Act of 1853,
and therefore s. 4 of the Act of 1850 has now exactly the same effect as if it
were in fact a section contained in the Act of 1853, and I have come to the
conclusion that, if the facts should be proved hereafter, there was a breach of
the provisions of s. 4 of the Act of 1850. That section gives power to make
regulations, and I think there is involved in this that regulations so made
must be obeyed, and if so it follows that a breach of such regulations is a
breach of the law contained in that sect-

[Page 122]

ion. Section 4 of the Act of 1850 is made a
provision of the Act of 1853, and therefore I think that the alleged offence
was one ""against the provisions of this Act"" within the
meaning of s. 19 of the Act of 1853. My difficulty has been—and I had
considerable doubt about it at first—as to whether the words ""provisions
of this Act"" can be read as meaning or including ""regulations
made under this Act,"" assuming that the regulations were made under this
Act, i.e., under the Act of 1853; whether there is not a distinction between
provisions of the Act and regulations made under the Act; and whether one can
read s. 19 of the Act of 1853 as if the words were ""for every offence
against the provisions of this Act, or regulations made under this Act.""
The doubt largely arises from the fact that in the Act of 1853 there is a
series of provisions, e.g., in ss. 14, 15 and 16, which are express provisions
of the Act, and to which directly, and naturally, the words of s. 19 apply. My
doubt is whether s. 19 was intended to apply to anything beyond offences
against express provisions contained in the Act of 1853. However, on the whole
I have come to the conclusion that it applies to any breach of what must be
construed as being a provision of the Act of 1853. In my judgment an offence
against s. 4 of the Act of 1850 is an offence within the meaning of s. 19 of
the Act of 1853.

This case was followed in the case of Hart v.
Hudson[11], and is accepted
by all of the text books as stating the law.

Another argument was also put forward, which is
best stated in the language of Mr. Justice St. Germain as follows:

Le Parlement a donc délégué tous ses
pouvoirs au gouverneur en conseil pour la mise en exécution des arrêtés ministériels
passés en vertu de la dite loi, sauf la restriction ci-dessus quant à la peine,
et il appartenait par conséquent au gouverneur en conseil de mentionner dans le
décret en vertu duquel l'intimé a été mis en accusation que quiconque
contreviendrait à ce décret serait sujet à telle peine fixée par le dit décret;
bien plus, il appartenait aussi au gouverneur en conseil de déclarer que les
peines qui seraient imposées pour infractions aux arrêtés et règlements établis
sous la dite loi seraient ainsi imposées, soit après déclaration sommaire de
culpabilité ""upon summary conviction"", ou soit par voie de mise en
accusation ""upon indictment.""

It seems to me, however, that article 164 of the
Criminal Code was passed for the very purpose of providing for cases where
penalties were not otherwise imposed by the law, and applies to violation of
the provisions of such orders as form part of the law authorized by a statute,
as in this case.

With all respect to those who take a different
view, I agree with the views of Mr. Justice Barclay and Mr. Justice Francœur in
the court below, and would allow the appeal.

[Page 123]

Taschereau J.—The respondent, a druggist, was acquitted by Mr. Justice Guérin,
of Montreal, of the charge of having without lawful excuse disobeyed an Act of
Parliament for which no penalty is expressly provided, to wit, paragraph (2) of
Regulations, dated the 11th day of September, 1939, of the War Measures Act,
by wilfully selling codeine, a narcotic drug, without first having obtained
a written order or prescription signed and dated by a physician, thus,
committing an offence against section 164 of the Criminal Code.

The Court of King's Bench of the province of Quebec (Barclay and Francœur
JJ. dissenting) affirmed the judgment of the trial judge and the Crown has
appealed to this Court.

The reason given by the trial judge, and the
Court of King's Bench, is that there is an offence under section 164 of the
Criminal Code, only when the Act complained of is forbidden by an Act of the
Parliament of Canada, or of any legislature of Canada, and that a regulation
passed under the War Measures Act, is not an Act of Parliament. Section
164 of the Code reads as follows:

164. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to one year's imprisonment who, without lawful excuse,
disobeys any Act of the Parliament of Canada or of any legislature in Canada,
by wilfully doing any act which it forbids, or omitting to do any act which it
requires to be done, unless some penalty or other mode of punishment is
expressly provided by law.

Section (3) of the War Measures Act confers
special powers to the Governor General in Council and amongst other things
says:—

The Governor in Council may do and
authorize such Acts and things and make from time to time such orders and
regulations as he may, by reason of real or apprehended war, invasion or
insurrection, deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, order and
welfare of Canada.

The same section has also the following
provisions:—

All orders and regulations made under this
section shall have the force of law and shall be enforced in such manner and by
such courts, officers and authorities as the Governor in Council may prescribe,
and may be varied, extended or revoked by any subsequent order or regulation.

Section 4 of the same Act empowers the Governor
in Council to

[Page 124]

prescribe the penalties that may be imposed
for violations of orders and regulations made under this Act, and (to) also
prescribe whether such penalties shall be imposed upon summary conviction or
upon indictment, but no such penalty shall exceed a fine of five thousand
dollars or imprisonment for any term not exceeding five years, or both fine and
imprisonment.

Pursuant to these powers given by Parliament,
the Governor General in Council passed regulations forbidding the sale of
codeine without a written prescription signed by a physician, but these
regulations do not contain any provisions for a penalty.

It is beyond all dispute that Parliament has
power to authorize the making of such regulations. The only question is whether
the Order in Council can be interpreted as meaning an Act of Parliament. There
is no doubt that all orders and regulations made under section 3 of the War
Measures Act have the force of law, and may be enforced as the Governor
General may prescribe, but, can it be said that a disobedience to the Order in
Council is a disobedience to the statute itself?

It has been submitted by the Crown that an Order
in Council issued in virtue of the War Measures Act becomes an integral
part of the Act and that a violation of the Order in Council is a violation of
the War Measures Act itself, and, therefore, of an Act of Parliament.

The War Measures Act does not, like other
Acts enacted by the Parliament of Canada, provide that the regulations passed
by the Governor General in Council shall form part of the Act nor does it say
that every offence against such regulations shall be considered as a violation
of the Act. Such provisions may be found in the Bankruptcy Act, the Explosives
Act, the Fisheries Act, etc., but nothing of the kind is
incorporated in the War Measures Act, and we find no provisions
analogous to those which are in the Acts above mentioned.

I cannot come to the conclusion that in the
present instance the violation of the Order in Council is tantamount to the
violation of the War Measures Act. An Order in Council is passed by the
Executive Council, and an Act of Parliament is enacted by the House of Commons
and by the Senate of Canada. Both are entirely different, and unless there is a
provision in the law stating that the Orders in Council shall be considered as
forming part of the law itself, or that any offence against the regulations

[Page 125]

shall be a violation of the Act, it cannot be
said that the violation of an Order in Council is a violation of an Act of Parliament
within the meaning of section 164 of the Criminal Code.

Furthermore, the word ""Act"" is defined
in the Criminal Code as follows:—

Section 2, paragraph (1):

""any Act,"" or ""any other
Act,"" includes any Act passed or to be passed by the Parliament of Canada,
or any Act passed by the legislature of the late Province of Canada, or passed
or to be passed by the legislature of any province of Canada, or passed
by the legislature of any province now a part of Canada before it was included
therein.

It is to my judgment impossible to stretch the
meaning of the word ""Act"" to such an extent so as to include an Order
in Council.

I would, therefore, dismiss this appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
  ALBERTA

Criminal law—Appeal—Cr. Code, ss. 951(3), 285(6), 1023(2)—Accused
charged with manslaughter—Charge arising out of operation of motor vehicle—At
trial accused found not guilty of manslaughter but guilty of driving in a
manner dangerous to the public—Appeal by Attorney-General of the province
dismissed by appellate court (with a dissent on questions of law)—Appeal by
Attorney-General to Supreme Court of Canada—Jurisdiction—Whether there was a
""judgment or verdict, of acquittal"" within s. 1028(2)—Merits—Evidence
and findings at trial.

[Page 53]

Accused was charged with manslaughter. The charge arose out of
the operation of a motor vehicle. The trial judge (sitting without a jury, as
permitted by statute applicable to the province) found accused not guilty of
manslaughter but, as provided for by s. 951(3) of the Cr. Code (as
amended in 1938, c. 44, s.. 45), found him guilty of driving in a manner
dangerous to the public, under s. 285(6) of the Cr. Code (as amended ibid,
s. 16). The Attorney-General for Alberta appealed, asking that the
""judgment or verdict of acquittal"" at trial on the charge of
manslaughter ""be set aside and a conviction made in lieu thereof"" or
that, in the alternative, there be a new trial of accused upon said charge. The
appeal was dismissed by the Appellate Division, Alta., (Harvey, C.J.,
dissenting on questions of law), [1940] 2 W.W.R. 401. The Attorney-General
appealed to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Rinfret, Crocket, Kerwin and Taschereau JJ.: The
appeal should be quashed for want of jurisdiction.

Rinfret J.: Neither of the conditions of a right of appeal to
this Court under s. 1023(2) of the Cr. Code (as amended in 1935, c. 56,
s. 16) exists; the Appellate Division did not ""set aside a
conviction"" nor ""dismiss an appeal against a judgment or verdict of
acquittal."" The judgment at trial was not an acquittal; it was a
conviction upon the charge as laid, in accordance with s. 951(3) which indicates
that a conviction under s. 285(6) may be the result of a charge of manslaughter
arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. Further, (the right of appeal
of an Attorney General of a province under s. 1023(2), as it was only recently
given and as criminal statutes should always be construed favourably to the
accused, should not be extended beyond the strict terms of the Code.

Per Crocket J.: The judgment of the Appellate Division
did not fall within the terms of s. 1023(2). The clear intendment of s. 951(3)
is that a charge of manslaughter which arises out of the operation of a motor
vehicle must be taken to include the offence described

[Page 54]

in s. 285(6) and that the trial tribunal shall have the right,
instead of convicting of manslaughter, to find accused guilty, on the
manslaughter charge, of the lesser offence. This having been done, it cannot be
said that there was ""a judgment or verdict of acquittal"" in respect
of the charge on which accused was tried.

Per Kerwin J.: Though accused was acquitted of the
charge of manslaughter, yet it cannot be said that the judgment at trial was
""a judgment or verdict of acquittal in respect of an indictable
offence"" within the meaning of s. 1023(2) so as to give this Court
jurisdiction, particularly in view of the results which otherwise might follow
(as set out infra, per Taschereau J.).

Per Taschereau J.: A charge of manslaughter arising out
of the operation of a motor vehicle includes, by operation of s. 951(3), a
charge under s. 285(6), though the offence under 285(6) is not mentioned in the
count. When there is an acquittal on said major offence followed with a
conviction on said minor offence, it cannot be said that accused has been
acquitted on the charge as laid; the degree of his guilt is smaller, but
he has nevertheless been found guilty. For the purpose of the right of appeal
given by s. 1023(2), the word ""acquittal"" therein means a complete
acquittal in respect of all the offences charged directly or otherwise in the
same count. To hold otherwise would have the very extraordinary result that
this Court, entertaining the appeal, would undoubtedly have the power to direct
a new trial, as a result of which the accused, without having appealed, might
be acquitted even of the charge on which he has already been found guilty at
the first trial.

The Chief Justice, but for the above weighty concurrence of
opinion by four Judges of this Court against this Court's jurisdiction, would
have thought that the Appellate Division, Alta., was right in considering the
appeal on the merits. He expressed emphatically his opinion that, on a charge
such as that in the present case, a jury, having satisfied themselves that the
accused, in the language of s. 951(3), ""is not guilty of
manslaughter"" (which is a condition of their jurisdiction to find the
accused guilty of an offence under s. 285(6)), must pronounce a verdict to that
effect and that the accused is entitled to demand such pronouncement; and that
such a pronouncement is an acquittal of the accused upon the charge of
manslaughter under the indictment. Whether an appeal lies or not may, of
course, be another question.

Per Davis J.: The appeal should be dismissed on the
merits. On the evidence and the finding's at trial, it cannot be said that
accused killed the man with whose death he was charged by the indictment.

Per Hudson J.: The appeal should be dismissed on the
ground that the trial judge, on proper interpretation of his statements, found
that there was not sufficient evidence to satisfy him beyond reasonable doubt
that accused caused the death of the deceased and, as a consequence, found
accused not guilty of manslaughter.

APPEAL by the Attorney-General for Alberta from the judgment
of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1]
dismissing (Harvey, C.J., dissenting

[Page 55]

on questions of law) his appeal from
the judgment of Howson J. (sitting without a jury, as permitted by statute
applicable to the province) upon the trial of the accused, respondent, on the
charge that he ""did unlawfully cause the death of one, Charles W. Stout,
and did thereby commit manslaughter."" It appeared from the evidence and
the record that the charge arose out of the operation of a motor vehicle. The
trial judge found the accused not guilty of manslaughter but, as provided for
by s. 951(3) of the Criminal Code (as amended in 1938, c. 44, s. 45),
found him guilty of driving in a manner dangerous to the public under s. 285(6)
of the Criminal Code (as amended in 1938, c. 44, s. 16).

In his appeal to the Appellate Division, the Attorney-General
asked that the ""judgment or verdict of acquittal"" at trial on the
charge of manslaughter ""be set aside and a conviction made in lieu
thereof""; or that, in the alternative, there be a new trial of accused
upon the said charge. In his appeal to this Court the Attorney-General asked
for an order setting aside the judgment of the Appellate Division ""and
directing that a verdict or judgment of guilty of manslaughter be entered
against"" accused""in lieu of said verdict of acquittal and the appropriate
punishment imposed or in the alternative an order directing a new trial or such
other order as may be proper.""

On the hearing before this Court the question was raised
whether there had been a ""judgment or verdict of acquittal"" within
the meaning of s. 1023(2) of the Criminal Code (as amended in 1935, c.
56, s. 16) so as to give jurisdiction to hear the present appeal; and argument
was heard on this point as well as argument on the merits of the appeal.

H. J. Wilson K.C. and W. S. Gray K.C. for the appellant.

E. F. Newcombe K.C. for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The majority of the Court have come to
the conclusion that no appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada in this case
under section 1023(2). But for the weighty concurrence of opinion on this point
by four judges of this Court, I should have thought that the Court of Appeal
for Alberta was right in considering the

[Page 56]

appeal on the merits. I do not further
pursue the discussion of the question whether an appeal to this Court arises under
section 1023(2).

I am concerned to emphasize one point. Before proceeding to that
point it may be as well to note in passing that Mr. Wilson, on behalf of the
Attorney-General for Alberta, contended that the proceedings in the trial did
not disclose a charge of ""manslaughter arising out of the operation of a
motor vehicle"" and, consequently, that the case did not fall within
section 951.

I say nothing about this point. The point I desire to insist upon
is this: The enactment under consideration, section 951, subsection 3, provides
in the most explicit way that it is a condition of the jurisdiction of the jury
to find the accused guilty of an offence under subsection 6 of section 285 that
they shall be ""satisfied that the accused is not guilty of manslaughter.""
In the present case the accused was charged with manslaughter simpliciter. I
can have no doubt that the jury, having satisfied themselves that the accused,
in the language of the section, ""is not guilty of manslaughter,"" must
pronounce a verdict to that effect and that the accused is entitled to demand
such pronouncement. Nor have I any doubt that such a pronouncement is an
acquittal of the accused upon the charge of manslaughter under the indictment.
Whether an appeal lies or not may, of course, be another question.

RINFRET J.—I am of opinion that this appeal must be
quashed for want of jurisdiction in this Court.

The appeal is asserted by the Attorney-General of the province of
Alberta against the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
that province, which affirmed the judgment of Howson, J., finding the respondent guilty ""of driving to the
public danger,"" under sec. 285, subs. 6, of the Criminal Code.

The charge laid against the respondent was that he ""did
unlawfully cause the death of one, Charles W. Stout, and did thereby commit
manslaughter""; and it appears from the evidence and the record that such
charge of manslaughter arose out of the operation of a motor vehicle.

Upon that charge, the trial judge, being satisfied that the accused
was not guilty of manslaughter, but was guilty

[Page 57]

of an offence under subs. 6 of sec. 285
above mentioned, found him (as he could do under subs. 3 of s. 951 of the Criminal
Code) guilty of the lesser offence.

The case was then carried to the Appellate Division of Alberta by
the Attorney-General, apparently taking advantage of subs. 4 of sec. 1013 of
the Code, by force of which

the Attorney-General shall have the
right to appeal to the court of appeal against any judgment or verdict of
acquittal of a trial court in respect of an indictable offence on any ground of
appeal which involves a question of law alone.

The Court of Appeal merely confirmed the judgment condemning the
respondent. It is not necessary to consider whether the right of appeal in this
particular case was competently asserted before that Court.

The Attorney-General then appealed from the two concurrent
judgments to the Supreme Court of Canada.

Now, the right of the Attorney-General of the province to appeal
to this Court, in a case such as this, is regulated by subs. 2 of sec. 1023 of
the Code. Under that subsection, the Attorney-General may appeal to this Court
only

from the judgment of any court of
appeal setting aside a conviction or dismissing an appeal against a judgment or
verdict of acquittal in respect of an indictable offence on an appeal taken
under section ten hundred and thirteen on any question of law on which there
has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.

It is, therefore, apparent that the right of appeal by the Attorney-General
under the above subsection is strictly dependent upon the existence of one of
two conditions: Either a judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside a
conviction; or a judgment of a Court of Appeal dismissing an appeal against a
judgment or verdict of acquittal.

Neither of these conditions exists here.

The conviction against the respondent has not been set aside but,
on the contrary, it was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

Nor was there a dismissal of an appeal against a judgment or
verdict of acquittal.

The respondent was not acquitted either by the trial judge or by
the Court of Appeal.

When the informer laid his charge against the respondent, and
upon the charge as laid, he was praying, no doubt, for a conviction of
manslaughter; but he was also praying, in the alternative, by force of subs. 3
of sec. 951, for a conviction of an offence under subs. 6 of sec. 285.

[Page 58]

And, as a matter of fact, he got the
alternative condemnation, or, in other words, he got one of the two things that
he had been asking for. Upon the charge as laid, and upon that alone, the
respondent was not acquitted, but he was found guilty of having driven his
motor vehicle on a highway in a manner which was dangerous to the public, in
accordance with the provisions of subsection 6 of sec. 285. There has been no
judgment of acquittal, either by the trial judge or by the Court of Appeal,
from which it was open to the Attorney-General to bring an appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada,

Subs. 3 of sec. 951 of the Criminal Code was introduced in
1930 by ch. 11, sec. 25, of the Statutes of Canada of that year, though in a
different form.

The amendment thus introduced stated in terms that

Upon a charge of manslaughter
arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle the jury may find the accused
not guilty of manslaughter but guilty of criminal negligence under section two
hundred and eighty-four, and such conviction shall be a bar to further
prosecution for any offence arising out of the same facts.

Later, in the amendment so made, sec 285(6) was substituted for
sec. 284.

As a result, the situation in the present case, it seems to me,
was as follows:

The accident happened. It was a single occurrence. There was only
one set of facts. The informer laid his charge and therein described the
occurrence as a manslaughter, without more. But I cannot close my eyes to the
fact that, upon the evidence and the record, it was, if at all, a
""manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle."" This,
to my mind, brought the charge within the terms of subs. 3 of s. 951 of the Criminal
Code.

After having heard the witnesses, the trial judge was
""satisfied that the accused was not guilty of manslaughter but was guilty
of an offence under subsection six of section two hundred and eighty-five.""
By force of section 951(3) of the Code, the trial judge could then find the
accused guilty of the lesser offence. And that is what he did. Parliament
itself indicates in that subsection that a conviction under subs. 6 of s. 285
may be the result of a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a
motor vehicle. The trial judge could find the accused guilty of

[Page 59]

the lesser offence upon the charge as
laid, as a consequence of that single occurrence and upon the evidence of the
single set of facts leading to it. By the will of Parliament as expressed in
sec. 951(3), the conviction for the lesser offence was one of the two
convictions which the trial judge had the power to make. The judgment of the
trial judge, therefore, cannot be styled an acquittal within the meaning of s.
1023(2) of the Criminal Code. It was, and it is, a conviction upon the
charge as laid, in accordance with the provisions of sec. 951(3). By the very
terms of that subsection, ""such conviction shall be a bar to further prosecution
for any offence arising out of the same facts."" As a consequence of that
provision of the Code, should the accused be later confronted with a charge of
manslaughter based upon the same occurrence, he could plead autrefois
convict; and that plea would have to be maintained upon the plain terms of
that section of the Code.

The respondent has, therefore, been convicted upon the charge as
laid; and I cannot look upon the judgment now submitted to our Court as being
an acquittal in the sense that it may give the Attorney-General a right of
appeal to this Court under the provisions of subs. 2 of s. 1023.

In connection with the above, one must recall that it is only
recently that the Attorney-General of a province was given the right of appeal
under sec 1023; and, both on that account and because criminal statutes should
always be construed favourably to the accused, I do not think the right of
appeal of the Attorney-General should be extended beyond the strict terms of
the Code.

It follows that the present appeal was not competently asserted
and that this Court is lacking of the jurisdiction required to entertain the
appeal.

Under these circumstances, the appeal must be quashed.

CROCKET J.—The accused was tried on an indictment for the
single offence of manslaughter before Mr. Justice Howson. Such an indictment
may be tried in Alberta without a jury, if the accused so elects, under certain
unrepealed provisions of the old North West Territories Act still in
force in that province.

S. 951, subs. 3, of the Criminal Code provides that:

Upon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation
of a motor vehicle the jury, if they are satisfied that the accused is not
guilty

[Page 60]

of manslaughter but is guilty of an
offence under subsection 6 of section. 285, may find him guilty of that
offence, and such conviction shall be a bar to further prosecution for any
offence arising out of the same facts.

It is not questioned that this enactment applies to a trial
before a Supreme Court Judge in Alberta sitting without a jury, or that the
manslaughter charge in the present case arose out of the operation of a motor
vehicle. The trial judge specifically found the accused guilty of driving an
automobile in a manner dangerous to the public contrary to the provisions of s.
285(6), and not guilty of manslaughter.

The Attorney-General appealed to the Court of Appeal, which
merely confirmed the conviction, the Chief"" Justice dissenting, and this
is the judgment which it is now sought to challenge in this Court under the provisions
of s. 1023(2) of the Criminal Code on the point or points of law raised
in the dissenting opinion of the learned Chief Justice.

It was contended by counsel for the accused that the judgment of
the Court of Appeal does not fall within the terms of subs. 2 of s. 1023 of the
Code and that no appeal therefore lies to this Court.

I think this objection is well taken. This Court is authorized by
the subsection to hear an appeal at the instance of the Attorney-General of a
Province from the judgment of a provincial Court of Appeal only if the judgment
is one which sets aside a conviction or dismisses ""an appeal against a
judgment or verdict of acquittal in: respect of an indictable offence.""
That such conviction, or judgment or verdict of acquittal, as the case may be,
must necessarily be upon the charge or indictment upon which the accused has
been tried by the trial court, is obvious, for assuredly no accused person
could either be convicted or acquitted ""in respect of"" any indictable
offence which was not included in the charge or indictment to which he was
required to plead. The clear intendment of s. 951(3), to my mind, is that a
charge of manslaughter which arises out of the operation of a motor vehicle
must be taken to include the offence of driving a motor vehicle on a street,
road, highway or other public place recklessly or in a manner which is
dangerous to the public, as described in s. 285(6) of the Criminal Code, and
that the trial tribunal shall have the right, instead

[Page 61]

of convicting the accused of the
principal offence of manslaughter, to find him guilty upon that charge of the
lesser offence against s. 285(6). This is what the trial judge did in the
present case, he being satisfied that the accused was not guilty of
manslaughter, but was guilty under the manslaughter indictment of the latter
offence. The learned judge certainly could not have convicted the accused,
under the indictment he was trying, of both manslaughter and an offence against
s. 285(6). He could only find him guilty of one or the other, and having found
him guilty of the lesser offence, it cannot, in my judgment, rightly be said
that there was ""a judgment or verdict of acquittal"" in respect of the
charge upon which the accused was tried; otherwise his conviction for the subordinate
offence would not be a bar to his further prosecution for manslaughter or any
other offence arising out of the same facts, as the last clause of s. 951(3)
explicitly provides it shall be.

For these reasons I am
of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal does not fall within the
ambit of s. 1023(2) and that this appeal therefrom should be quashed for want
of jurisdiction.

DAVIS J.—The question of the jurisdiction of this Court to
entertain the appeal of the Attorney-General of Alberta, turning on the point
of some nicety as to whether or not there was an ""acquittal"" within
the meaning of sec. 1023(2) of the Criminal Code in that while the
accused was found not guilty of the charge of manslaughter laid in the
indictment he was found guilty under sec. 285(6)
of the lesser offence of driving his motor car to the public danger, was
raised by a member of the Court during the argument of the merits of the
appeal. I am not prepared, without
a full and considered argument of a point of such importance and widespread
effect, to dispose of the difficult question involved. Suffice it to say that
at present I have much doubt as to
the objection to jurisdiction but, in my view of the appeal, it becomes
unnecessary to determine the point.

I would dismiss the
appeal on the merits. Too much emphasis has been put in this case, I think, upon the difficulties of
definition of the crime of manslaughter in running-down cases. Andrews v.
Director of Public Prosecutions[2].
The first and fundamental question, not

[Page 62]

touched by such difficulties, is whether
or not the accused killed the unfortunate man with whose death he is charged by
the indictment. That is a question of fact. Upon the evidence it is plain that
the accused was driving his motor car in an easterly direction up a hill on a
public highway in the suburb of Alberta Park, near the city of Calgary. It was about eight o'clock on a clear evening, May 30th, 1939. The trial judge found as a fact that the accused was travelling at a moderate rate of speed.
On going up the hill the accused had run over the centre line but the trial
judge found that the car was only ""a little north"" of the centre
line—""a small amount—"" somewhat but not greatly"" on the north
side of the centre line. The deceased, a man within a few days of his 67th
birthday, was at the same time riding a bicycle along the highway in the
opposite direction. He was carrying empty beer bottles, which it had been his
custom to collect and sell for a living, in a pasteboard box placed in a metal basket
which was fastened to his bicycle in front of the handlebars. The accused said
that when he saw the man on the bicycle come over the hill the bicycle was
swerving along the road and that he, the accused, applied his brakes. Hodges,
an eye witness called by the Crown, testified that the motor car ""was
either actually stopped or practically stopped at the moment of the
impact."" The trial judge found that the man on the bicycle swerved or
wavered on his bicycle into the left-hand front corner of the motor car. The
left front headlight of the motor car was broken and the windshield of the car
was caved in. The unfortunate man died shortly thereafter from hemorrhage of
the brain due to a fractured skull, and the driver of the motor car was charged
with manslaughter.

The accused was tried by a judge of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
without a jury, as permitted by the North West Territories Act of 1886
made applicable by the Alberta Criminal Procedure Act, 1930, Dom., ch.
12. The trial judge found the accused was not guilty of manslaughter and the
Court of Appeal of Alberta affirmed that judgment, Harvey, C.J., dissenting.

There was evidence that the accused was under the influence of
liquor at the time and on that evidence the learned trial judge found him guilty
under sec. 285(6) of the lesser offence of driving his car to ""the public
danger. No appeal was taken from that conviction.

[Page 63]

In my opinion, it cannot be said on the evidence and the findings
that the accused killed the man on the bicycle, and on that ground I should
dismiss the appeal.

KERWIN J.—I thought, and still think, that the accused was
acquitted of the charge of manslaughter. I was at first inclined to the view
that we had jurisdiction. Further consideration, however, and particularly the
results (set out in the judgment of my brother Taschereau) that would follow
from a decision that this Court had jurisdiction have now convinced me that
this was not ""a judgment or verdict of acquittal in respect of an
indictable offence"" within the meaning of subsection 2 of section 1023 of
the Criminal Code. I would therefore dismiss the appeal for want of
jurisdiction.

HUDSON J.—As I interpret the remarks of the learned
trial judge, he found that there was not sufficient evidence to satisfy him
beyond reasonable doubt that the accused caused the death of the deceased and,
as a consequence, found the accused not guilty of manslaughter.

On this ground, I would dismiss the appeal.

I am inclined to agree that this Court has no jurisdiction, but
as the question was raised only by a member of the Court during the argument, I
would prefer to leave it open for further discussion.

TASCHEREAU J.—On the 27th of November, 1939, the respondent, Harry Wilmot, was charged before Mr. Justice Howson of the Supreme Court of
Alberta of having unlawfully caused by the operation of a motor vehicle the
death of Charles W. Stout, thereby committing the crime of manslaughter. In a
very elaborate judgment, the trial judge found the accused not guilty of
manslaughter, but found him guilty of driving in a manner dangerous to the
public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

The section of the Criminal Code which authorizes the jury
to find the accused guilty of the lesser offence reads as follows:—

951.(3) Upon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the
operation of a motor vehicle the jury, if they are satisfied that the accused
is not guilty of manslaughter but is guilty of an offence under subsection six
of section two hundred and eighty-five may find him guilty of that offence, and
such conviction shall be a bar to further prosecution for any offence arising
out of the same facts.

[Page 64]

Section 285(6) says:—

Every one who drives a motor vehicle on a street, road,
highway or other public place recklessly, or in a manner which is dangerous to
the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the
nature, condition, and use of the street, road, highway or place, and the
amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be
expected to be, on such street, road, highway or place, shall be guilty of an
offence and liable * * *

The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal for Alberta and the
judgment was affirmed, Chief Justice Harvey dissenting on a question of law.
The Attorney-General of Alberta now appeals to this Court and submits that in
law, the respondent should not have been convicted of the lesser offence
mentioned in section 285(6) but of manslaughter.

During the argument the question of jurisdiction of the Court was
raised. The right given to the Attorney-General of a province to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada is found in section 1023(2) of the Criminal Code which
is in the following terms:—

(2) The Attorney-General of the province may appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of any court of appeal setting aside
a conviction or dismissing an appeal against a judgment or verdict of acquittal
in respect of an indictable offence on an appeal taken under section ten
hundred and thirteen on any question of law on which there has been dissent in
the Court of Appeal.

The law strictly limits the rights of the Attorney-General to
appeal and they can be summarized as follows:

The Attorney-General may appeal:

1. From the judgment of a court of appeal setting aside a
conviction;

2. From the judgment of a court of appeal dismissing an appeal
against a verdict of acquittal.

It is, therefore, only when the accused has been acquitted that
the Crown may appeal to this Court. In the present case, the accused has been
acquitted of the charge of manslaughter, but he has been found guilty under
section 285(6) of the offence of driving an automobile in a manner dangerous to
the public, and this conviction has been affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

Upon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a
motor vehicle, three verdicts may be rendered: 10. guilty of manslaughter, 20.
guilty under section 285(6), and
30. not guilty.

[Page 65]

The power of the Court to convict of a lesser offence upon a
charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle, was
originally given in 1930, when it was said that the accused could be found
guilty of, criminal negligence under section 284, Cr. C. In 1938 (Chap.
44, section 45) the law was amended, and we now have section 951(3), Cr. C.,
which clearly says that the lesser offence on a charge of manslaughter
arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle is the offence found in section
285(6).

By the operation of the law, the lesser offence is included in
the count, and a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor
vehicle, therefore, includes a charge under section 285(6), although this last
offence is not mentioned in the count. When there is an acquittal on the major
offence followed with a conviction on the minor offence, it cannot be said that
the accused has been acquitted on the charge as laid. The degree of his
guilt is smaller, but he has nevertheless been found guilty.

To my mind, the law requires a complete acquittal in respect of
all the offences charged directly or otherwise in the same count, in order to
allow the Attorney-General to appeal to this Court.

To hold different views would, in my opinion, lead us to a very
extraordinary result. This Court, if it did come to the conclusion that it has
jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, would undoubtedly have the power to
direct a new trial, and as a result of which the accused, without having
appealed, might be acquitted, even of the charge on which he has already been
found guilty at the first trial.

I, therefore, have to come to the conclusion that the respondent
has not been acquitted within the meaning of section 1023(2), that this Court
has no jurisdiction to hear this appeal, and that it should be quashed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Evidence—Charge of receiving
stolen goods—Explanation by accused—Good faith—Lack of knowledge of goods being
stolen— Whether explanation by accused is a reasonable one—Discharge by the Crown
as to onus of proving accused’s guilt—Duty of trial judge.

The appellant was charged with the offence of
receiving stolen goods and was found guilty. At the trial, the appellant and
some other witnesses were heard in support of appellant’s explanation that he
had bought these goods in good faith and without any knowledge that

 [Page 102]

they were stolen effects. The appellant
appealed to the appellate court on the ground that his explanation was a
reasonable one, that the Crown had failed to discharge the onus of proving
beyond a reasonable doubt the accused’s guilt and that the explanation was
equally plausible as to his innocence or to guilt. The majority of the
appellate court affirmed the conviction, one judge dissenting on the ground
that there was no evidence upon which the appellant could be convicted.

Held, that the
appeal should be dismissed. The question to which it was the duty of the trial
judge to apply his mind was not whether he was convinced that the explanation
given was the true explanation, but whether the explanation might reasonably be
true; or, in other words, whether the Crown had discharged the onus of
satisfying the trial judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the explanation of
the appellant could not be accepted as a reasonable one and that he was
guilty.—Rex v. Schama (11 C.A.R. 45); Rex v. Searle (51
C.C.C. 128) and Re Ketteringham (19 C.C.C. 159) ref. and app.— Under all
the circumstances of the case, it cannot be held that there was no evidence
that the explanation offered by the appellant was one that the trial judge
might not find could not reasonably be accepted as true.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming (Pratte
(ad hoc) J. dissenting) the conviction of
the appellant for the offence, under section 399 of the Criminal Code, of
receiving or retaining in his possession stolen goods knowing them to be
stolen. By the judgment now reported the appeal to this Court was dismissed.

Lucien H. Gendron
K.C. for the appellant.

John Crankshaw K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Rinfret,
Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by

The Chief
Justice.—The proper direction on the trial of an
accused charged under section 399 of the Criminal Code with receiving or
retaining in his possession stolen goods, knowing them to be stolen, is
explained in three judgments to which our attention was called by Mr. Gendron.

In the Schama case[1], the Lord Chief Justice explained the rule
as follows:—

Where the prisoner is charged with
receiving recently stolen property, when the prosecution has proved the
possession by the prisoner, and that

[Page 103]

the goods had been recently stolen, the
jury should be told that they may, not that they must, in the absence of any
reasonable explanation, find the prisoner guilty. But if an explanation is
given which may be true, it is for the jury to say on the whole evidence whether the accused is guilty or not; that is
to say, if the jury think that the explanation may reasonably be true, though
they are not convinced that it is true, the prisoner is entitled to an
acquittal, because the Crown has not discharged the onus of proof imposed upon
it of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the prisoner’s guilt.

This passage was applied by the Appellate
Division of Alberta in a judgment delivered by Harvey C.J. in Rex v. Searle[2].

In the Ketteringham case[3], Avory J. said:

The question which should have been left to
the jury was simply: “Did the appellant receive the goods in such circumstances
that he must then have known them to have been stolen?” The question, however,
which was left was whether the jury thought that the account given by the
appellant’s son in evidence of the manner in which he became possessed of the
goods could be accepted. The jury should have been told not only that they
could acquit, but that they ought to acquit, the appellant if they were
satisfied that his explanation was consistent with his innocence.

The question, therefore, to which it was the
duty of the learned trial judge to apply his mind was not whether he was
convinced that the explanation given was the true explanation, but whether the
explanation might reasonably be true; or, to put it in other words, whether the
Crown had discharged the onus of satisfying the learned trial judge beyond a
reasonable doubt that the explanation of the accused could not be accepted as a
reasonable one and that he was guilty.

The dissenting judge did not put his dissent on
the ground that the trial judge had misdirected himself on any point of law, or
that he had not applied his mind to the precise question which it was his duty,
as indicated in what has just been said, to determine. He dissented on the
ground that there was no evidence upon which the accused could be convicted and
I assume that to mean that there was in point of law no evidence to support a
verdict of guilty. After considering all the circumstances, I am unable to
agree with this view; in other words, I am not satisfied that there is no
evidence that the explanation

[Page 104]

offered was one that the trial judge might not
find could not reasonably be accepted as true.

The appeal must be dismissed.

Cannon, J.—I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Appeal—Trial on charge of murder—Misdirection to
jury—Provocation—Onus in general—Power of court on appeal—Substitution of
verdict of manslaughter for jury’s verdict of murder—Cr. Code, ss. 1016, 1024;
Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35.

On the occasion of a quarrel between appellant and S.,
appellant killed S., and then killed S.’s wife who had not been present at the
quarrel or the killing of S. but on hearing shouts had appeared at her house
door a few feet away. Appellant was tried on the charge of murder of S. and was
found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 20 years penal servitude. He was
later tried on the charge of murder of Mrs. S. and was convicted of the crime
charged. This conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered on the ground
that the trial Judge had misdirected the jury on the question of provocation
([1937] O.R. 693; [1938] S.C.R. 18). Appellant was then tried again on the
charge of murder of Mrs. S. and convicted of the crime charged. An appeal to
the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed ([1938] O.R. 385), but two Judges
dissented, holding that there was error in certain respects in the trial
Judge’s charge to the jury and there should be a new trial. Appellant appealed
to this Court.

Held (allowing the appeal): There was a mistrial. The
conviction should be set aside.

[Page 342]

The putting before the jury, in the trial Judge’s charge, of a
sentence, taken from the judgment of one of the Judges of the Court of Appeal
on the appeal from the first conviction of appellant of murder of Mrs. S., that
the said Judge in Appeal was “far from suggesting that the conduct of the
accused would not justify a verdict of wilful murder,” constituted, in the
circumstances, error of such gravity as to vitiate the verdict. While the trial
Judge was entitled, if so advised, to express his own opinion as to the effect
of the evidence actually before the jury, it was inadmissible to present to
them the opinion of any one that on the former trial the evidence was
sufficient to justify a conviction for murder. Moreover, the effect of this was
probably accentuated by the record of appellant’s conviction of the murder of
Mrs. S. endorsed on the indictment which was put in the jury’s hands, said
record being “Guilty—Sentenced to be hanged, May 31, 1937.” In the
circumstances of the case, said record should have been withheld from them; a
copy of the indictment with the endorsement omitted would have served every
legitimate purpose.

Another serious objection was that the trial Judge, in
answering a question from the jury with regard to provocation, did not direct
them in the precise and unambiguous terms in which they ought to have been
instructed. Moreover, the terms in which the jury’s question was expressed
manifested an erroneous impression that, in proving the killing, the Crown had
disposed of the presumption of accused’s innocence and that they must find him
guilty of murder unless he affirmatively established to their satisfaction provocation
in the pertinent sense; and their question should have been answered in such a
manner as to remove this error from their minds; it ought to have been made
clear to them that in the last resort the accused could not properly be
convicted of murder if, as the result of the evidence as a whole, they were in
reasonable doubt whether or not he was guilty of that crime.

As to an objection taken by the dissenting Judges in the Court
of Appeal to the effect that the trial Judge erred in instructing the jury that
they were not concerned with the fact that appellant had been acquitted of the
charge of murder of S. and found guilty of the less grave offence of
manslaughter:

Held per Duff C.J., Cannon, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson
JJ.: (1) Plainly, the trial Judge would have committed an error in law if he
had told the jury that a finding of provocation in appellant’s trial for murder
of S. was conclusive upon the issue of provocation then before them; the issue
of provocation was not the same in the two cases. (Opinion expressed that said
dissenting Judges had not meant to suggest otherwise on this point).

2. As to the suggestion that the trial Judge ought to have
told the jury that they must take it as an established fact that the acts of S.
constituted sufficient provocation to reduce the homicide committed upon him to
manslaughter, and, starting from that point, consider the issue of provocation
in its bearing upon the charge against appellant of murder of Mrs. S.: Such a
direction would probably be calculated to confuse and mislead the jury in
respect of the actual issue upon which it was their duty then and there to
pass. Moreover, such a direction would have been wrong; the evidence given at
the earlier trial (for the killing of S.) was not placed fully before the court
nor was the trial Judge’s charge; nor, with such material before him, could the
trial Judge (on the trial for the kill-

[Page 343]

ing of Mrs. S.) have been warranted in directing the jury that
at said earlier trial any issue of provocation had been decided; the jury may
on that (earlier) trial have thought, without passing upon any such issue, that
the evidence raised a sufficient doubt as to accused’s guilt in respect of the
charge of murder to require an acquittal on that charge.

Crocket J., in view of the principle as to the question of
provocation which he took to be clearly deducible from this Court’s decision in
The King v. Manchuk, [1938] S.C.R. 18, in view of the established fact
that appellant, on his trial for murder of S., had been found guilty of
manslaughter only, and in view of the circumstances attending the killing of S.
and Mrs. S., and it being quite apparent (as he held) that appellant in
attacking Mrs. S. was acting upon the same impulse as that which caused him to
attack S., was strongly inclined to agree with the reasoning of the dissenting
Judges in the Court of Appeal on the applicability of the principles of res
judicata.

As to the order that ought to be made by this Court:

Per Duff C.J., Cannon, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.: It
was clear that the jury must have been satisfied of the facts necessary to
constitute manslaughter; and the Court of Appeal would have authority under s.
1016, Cr. Code, to substitute a verdict of manslaughter for the verdict
of the jury and to pronounce sentence upon appellant (Rex v. Hopper,
[1915] 2 K.B. 431). By force of s. 1024 Cr. Code, coupled with the
enactments of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 35), this Court
has authority, not only to order a new trial, or to quash the conviction and
direct the prisoner’s discharge, but also to give the judgment which the Court
of Appeal was empowered to give in virtue of s. 1016 (2), Cr. Code.
Under the exceptional circumstances of the case the last mentioned course is
the proper one. The conviction should be set aside, a verdict of manslaughter
substituted for the jury’s verdict and appellant sentenced to imprisonment for
life.

Per Crocket J. (dissenting on this point): Considering
the proceedings already undergone and in the anomalous circumstances of the
case, justice would best be served by quashing the present conviction
absolutely. Further, there is no doubt as to this Court’s right to quash the
conviction; there may be some doubt as to its right to enter a judgment which
necessarily involves its rendering a verdict in a criminal case and itself
passing sentence upon it; the wisdom of the latter course is very doubtful; it
would signalize an entirely new departure in the exercise of the jurisdiction
of this Court in criminal cases.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1]
sustaining (Middleton and Gillanders JJ.A. dissenting) his conviction, on trial
before Hope J. and a jury, of the murder of Amy Seabright at St. Catharines,
Ontario, on June 8, 1936.

Just before the accused killed Amy Seabright, he had killed her
husband, John Seabright, in a quarrel. Accused was tried on the charge of
murder of John Seabright and was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to
20 years

[Page 344]

penal servitude. He was later tried on the charge of murder of
Amy Seabright and was convicted of the crime charged. This conviction was set
aside and a new trial ordered on the ground that the trial judge had
misdirected the jury on the question of provocation[2].
Accused was tried again on the charge of murder of Amy Seabright and convicted
of the crime charged. An appeal by the accused to the Court of Appeal for
Ontario was dismissed (Middleton and Gillanders JJ.A. dissenting)[3].
From that dismissal the present appeal to this Court was brought. The dissent
in the Court of Appeal was, as expressed in the formal judgment of that Court,
on the question as to whether there was error in the charge of the learned
trial judge, and whether such error amounted to a substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice. The dissenting judges held that there should be a new trial.

By the judgment now reported, the appeal to this Court was
allowed; the judgment of the Court of Appeal was set aside; the Court directed
that the verdict of murder be quashed and a verdict of manslaughter be entered.
Crocket J., dissenting, would quash the conviction absolutely. The appellant
was sentenced to imprisonment for life.

J.C. McRuer K.C. and J.J. Bench K.C. for the appellant.

W.B. Common K.C. and C.P. Hope K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the majority of the Court (The Chief Justice and
Cannon, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.) was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—On the 8th of June, 1936, the appellant
William Manchuk killed, first, John Seabright, and, shortly afterwards, his
wife, Amy Seabright. Evidence was given by Mrs. Lewis, the daughter of
John and Amy Seabright, that, after killing her father, and before the attack
upon her mother, Manchuk attempted an attack upon her with the axe with which
he killed her parents, but she succeeded in escaping.

[Page 345]

These tragic events were the culmination of a dispute about the
location of a line fence between the properties respectively occupied by the
Seabrights and the Manchuks. On the day on which the homicides occurred, John
Seabright was engaged in excavating post holes and setting up posts for a fence
which would encroach upon property that Manchuk believed to be exclusively his.
Manchuk and his wife protested against these proceedings in violent and
threatening language and, eventually, Manchuk who, as the evidence shows,
notwithstanding his wife’s incitements to violence, had for a time succeeded in
keeping himself under control, yielded to a passion of rage and committed the
fatal assault on John Seabright, killing him by blows delivered with an axe.

The scene of the killing of John Seabright is only a few feet
from the porch of the Seabrights’ house. Mrs. Seabright had been within the
house during the occurrences just described and had no visible connection with
them. She appeared at the door on hearing the shouts of her daughter and was
immediately attacked by Manchuk who, with the same weapon, inflicted upon her
wounds from which she died shortly afterwards.

Manchuk was tried for the murder of John Seabright, and John
Seabright’s acts, already mentioned, were relied upon as constituting
provocation. The jury found Manchuk guilty of manslaughter and he was
accordingly sentenced to twenty years penal servitude. Manchuk was then tried
under an indictment charging him with the murder of Amy Seabright and was
convicted of the crime charged. This conviction was set aside and a new trial
ordered[4]. The
learned trial judge had (it was held by this Court[5],
confirming a judgment of the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal) erroneously
directed the jury that there was no evidence upon which they could properly
find the attack upon Amy Seabright to have been delivered under such
provocation as to justify a finding of manslaughter.

In the judgment of this Court, the law concerning the nature of
provocation in the relevant sense and its effect in justifying a verdict of
manslaughter, when in its absence

[Page 346]

the proper verdict would be one of murder, was in its application
to the circumstances of this case explained for the guidance of the trial judge
at the new trial. In effect it was stated that, on the issue of provocation,
the jury ought to be directed to consider, first, whether the acts of
provocation, which proceeded immediately from John Seabright, were of such a character
as to deprive a normal person of his self-control to such a degree as might
lead such a person to commit an attack upon Mrs. Seabright of the character of
that of which Manchuk was guilty; and, second, whether Manchuk in fact did act
under such provocation while still under the dominion of the passion excited
thereby and under the belief that she was concerned in the acts of provocation
relied upon. But the judgment proceeded to say that the learned trial judge
would, of course, warn the jury that, on the ultimate issue (raised by the
charge of murder), unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that
Manchuk was guilty of the more heinous crime, it would be their duty not to
convict him upon that charge.

At the new trial, the accused was found guilty of the murder of
Amy Seabright and convicted and sentenced accordingly. An appeal to the Ontario
Court of Appeal was dismissed (Mr. Justice Middleton and Mr. Justice
Gillanders dissenting)[6] and the
case now comes before this Court on appeal from that judgment.

The appeal is by law necessarily limited to the grounds upon
which those learned judges dissented. Those grounds are three in number. First,
the learned judge erred (the learned dissenting judges held) in instructing the
jury that they were not concerned with the fact that Manchuk had been acquitted
of the charge of murder of John Seabright and had found him guilty of the less
grave offence of manslaughter. If we read the judgment of the learned judges
rightly, it seems to say that the learned trial judge ought to have told the
jury that they must take it as an established fact that the acts of John
Seabright constituted sufficient provocation to reduce the homicide committed
upon him to manslaughter; and, starting from that point, consider the issue of
provocation in its bearing upon the charge against the accused of the murder of
Amy Seabright. It sufficiently appears from what has already been said that

[Page 347]

the issue of provocation was not the same in the two cases, and,
plainly, the trial judge would have committed an error in law if he had told
them that a finding of provocation in the trial of Manchuk for the murder of
John Seabright was conclusive upon the issue of provocation then before them,
and we do not think the learned dissenting judges meant to suggest this.

Putting other considerations aside for the moment, we should have
been disposed to think that such a direction as that suggested would foe
calculated to confuse and mislead the jury in respect of the actual issue upon
which it was their duty then and there to pass; it would, as we are inclined to
think, demand from the jury the application of a degree of critical acumen
which they could hardly be expected to exercise; and would probably have
nullified the judgment of this Court as applicable to this case.

Moreover, such a direction would, in our opinion, have been
wrong. The evidence given at the earlier trial was not placed fully before the
court nor was the charge of the learned trial judge. Nor, with such material
before him could Mr. Justice Hope have been warranted in directing the jury
that at the first trial any issue of provocation had been decided. The jury may
on that trial have thought, without passing upon any such issue, that the
evidence raised a sufficient doubt as to the guilt of the prisoner in respect
of the charge of murder to require an acquittal on that charge.

We think, however, that the two other grounds of dissent are well
taken and, accordingly, that there was a mistrial.

The first of these arises in this way: The learned trial judge
put before the jury the following sentence taken from the judgment delivered by
Mr. Justice Middleton on the last occasion when the case was before the Court
of Appeal for Ontario:—

In the case in hand I am far from suggesting that the
conduct of the accused would not justify a verdict of wilful murder.

This, we think, constituted in the circumstances error of such
gravity as to vitiate the verdict.

While the learned trial judge was entitled, if he had been so
advised, to express his own opinion as to the effect of the evidence actually
before the jury, we can have no doubt that it was inadmissible to present to
the jury the

[Page 348]

opinion of any one that on the former trial the evidence was
sufficient to justify a conviction of the accused of the murder of Amy
Seabright. The mischief was enhanced by the circumstance that this opinion was
ascribed to an eminent judge whose authority would naturally carry great weight
with the jury. We think nothing said in the charge, either before or later, had
or could have the effect of neutralizing this statement of the learned trial
judge and rendering it innocuous.

We think, moreover, that the effect of it was probably
accentuated by the record of the conviction of Manchuk of the murder of Amy
Seabright endorsed on the indictment which was put in the hands of the jury.
The record was in these words, “Guilty—Sentenced to be hanged, May 31, 1937.”
We agree with the dissenting judges that, in the circumstances of the case,
this record should have been withheld from them. A copy of the indictment with
the endorsement omitted would have served every legitimate purpose.

We attach even greater importance to another ground upon which
the learned dissenting judges proceeded. The jury, having had the case under
consideration for some time, requested the assistance of the learned trial
judge upon a difficulty which they explained in the following question:—

In order to reduce a murder charge to a manslaughter charge,
is it necessary to establish the fact that the person killed committed the act
of provocation?

In the opinion of the dissenting judges, the jury were not given
a direction in the precise and unambiguous terms in which they ought have been
instructed in answer to their request; and we find ourselves in agreement with
them. The learned trial judge appears to have read, interlarded with comments
of his own, nearly the whole of the judgment of this Court, but with the
significant exception presently to be noted, on the appeal already mentioned.
The judgment contained a considerable amount of discussion of principle and
authority as touching the point on which we found ourselves unable to accept
the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. In the earlier
part of his charge the learned trial judge had discussed the subject of
provocation in a manner calculated to convey an impression that there were
differences of

[Page 349]

opinion among Canadian judges upon the very question which the
jury had addressed to him. We are not satisfied that the lengthy answer of the
learned trial judge, expressed as it was in general terms, was calculated to
convey to the jury a right conception of what might constitute provocation
under the law.

The dissent of the learned dissenting judges, moreover, embraces
another objection to this part of the charge, which, in our opinion, is,
perhaps, still more serious. The terms in which the question is expressed
manifest plainly that (notwithstanding some observations in the earlier part of
the charge as to the burden resting upon the Crown up to the end of the case of
establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt) they had fallen into the very
natural error of thinking that, in proving the killing, the Crown had disposed
of the presumption of the prisoner’s innocence and that they must find the
prisoner guilty of murder unless he affirmatively established to their
satisfaction provocation in the pertinent sense. The interrogatory of the jury
ought to have been answered in such a manner as to remove this error from their
minds. It ought to have been made clear to them that in the last resort the
prisoner could not properly be convicted of murder if, as the result of the
evidence as a whole, they were in reasonable doubt whether or not he was guilty
of that crime. The last sentence of the judgment of this Court which was put
before the jury almost in its entirety, deals with this point and that sentence
was not even read to them (Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions[7]).

There remains for consideration the grave question as to the
order that ought to be made by this Court. We have concluded, after full
consideration, that, by force of section 1024, coupled with the enactments of
the Supreme Court Act, this Court has authority, not only to order a new
trial, or to quash the conviction and direct the discharge of the prisoner, but
also to give the judgment which the Court of Appeal for Ontario was empowered
to give in virtue of s. 1016 (2); and we have no doubt that this last
mentioned course is the proper one in the very exceptional circumstances of
this case.

[Page 350]

The accused has been tried three times under charges of murder
arising out of a succession of occurrences which occupied in time not more than
a few minutes. The last two convictions have both been set aside by reason of
the irregular conduct of the trials leading to those convictions; the first by
a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmed by this Court; and, now,
the second, by the judgment of this Court. We cannot think that to order a
fourth trial would be entirely consonant with the spirit of our criminal
procedure; and we think the ends of justice will be met by the judgment we now
pronounce.

The finding makes it clear that the jury must have been satisfied
of the facts necessary to constitute manslaughter, and we are, consequently, of
opinion that the Court of Appeal would have authority under s. 1016 to
substitute a verdict of manslaughter for the verdict of the jury and to
pronounce sentence upon the prisoner (Rex v. Hopper[8]).

The conviction should be set aside, a verdict of manslaughter
should be substituted for the verdict of the jury and the accused sentenced to
imprisonment for life.

CROCKET J. (dissenting as to the order to be made)—In December
last this Court on an appeal by the Crown affirmed a judgment of the Ontario
Court of Appeal setting aside a conviction of Manchuk for the murder of one,
Amy Seabright, and ordering a new trial on the ground that the trial judge by
instructing the jury that there must be provocation by the victim had withdrawn
from their consideration the question of provocation[9].
The clear implication of this decision, as I view it, is that, notwithstanding
there was no evidence of any provocation whatever on the part of the victim
herself, there nevertheless was evidence upon which the jury might reasonably
have found that in attacking her as he did he did so in the heat of passion
caused by sudden provocation within the meaning of s. 261 of the Criminal
Code, that is to say, caused by any wrongful act or insult of such a nature
as to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, if the offender
acts upon it on the sudden and before there has been time for his passion to
cool. No other principle, to

[Page 351]

my mind, is fairly deducible from that decision as regards the
question of provocation than that it is not always necessary to constitute
provocation under s. 261 of the Criminal Code that it should proceed
immediately and directly from the victim herself, but that, on the contrary, a
wrongful act or insult, committed or given by a third person under such
circumstances as the evidence in this case disclosed, may constitute such
provocation if the offender in his attack upon the victim acted upon it on a
sudden and before his passion had time to cool and under the belief that the
victim was a party to any such act, although not implicated in it in fact.

It was admitted by counsel for the Crown and for the appellant
that the evidence on the second trial, bearing on the crucial issue of provocation,
was to all intents and purposes the same as that on the first trial.

This shews that Manchuk had been previously tried on an
indictment charging him and his wife jointly with the murder of John Seabright
on June 8th, 1936, upon which he was found guilty of manslaughter only; that
during the forenoon of that day, while John Seabright was attempting against
the protests of both Mr. and Mrs. Manchuk to replace a post of a board fence,
which a sworn surveyor had found to encroach between one and two feet on
Manchuk’s home property and which as a consequence had recently been removed,
the accused, after having succeeded in restraining his wife from attacking
Seabright with a stone and later with an axe which he took away from her, and
after having himself requested Seabright to desist and go home, finally became
so enraged at Seabright’s determined defiance of his property rights, that,
while the latter’s daughter (Mrs. Lewis) was standing by the post hole with a
hammer in her hand, he struck him three times in rapid succession with the axe
he still had in his hand, and killed him; and that within the course of a
moment or two at the most, after first attempting an attack upon Mrs. Lewis,
who yelled and ran away, he rushed across the driveway to the back porch of the
Seabright house, in which Mrs. Seabright had suddenly appeared, and there on or
in front of the steps at a distance of but 11 feet from the spot where he had
killed her husband, struck her with the same axe and caused her death.

[Page 352]

There is absolutely nothing to shew that Mrs. Seabright said or
did anything before Manchuk saw her that morning, and it is quite apparent that
in attacking her he was acting upon the same impulse as that which caused him
to attack her husband at the post hole. This obviously is the view of Mr.
Justice Middleton, and the basis on which he has so interestingly dealt with
the question of the applicability of the principles of res judicata.
While I am strongly inclined to agree with his reasoning in this regard, it
does not seem to be necessary to consider it beyond its possible bearing on the
question of the final disposition of this appeal. If it were recognized in this
case that the rule that a question of fact distinctly put in issue and directly
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction cannot be disputed in a
subsequent proceeding between the same parties or their privies was as
applicable to criminal as well as to civil proceedings, it would have the
merit, at least, of rendering impossible the repetition of such an
extraordinary and anomalous development as that which this unfortunate and
tragic case illustrates.

With great respect, I should be disposed to think that a person
who has been tried on an indictment charging him with murder in the killing of
S. and found guilty, not of murder but of manslaughter only—clearly on the
ground of provocation—and sentenced therefor to 20 years penal servitude;
has subsequently undergone a trial on another murder indictment for the killing
of S.’s wife practically at the same time and within but a few feet of the spot
where he slew her husband, and apparently acting upon the same provocation, and
nevertheless been convicted on that indictment for murder and undergone the
ordeal of waiting for the infliction of the necessary death penalty; and then,
in consequence of this conviction having been set aside on the ground that the
all important question of provocation was improperly withdrawn from the jury,
having undergone a second trial on the same indictment, and been again
erroneously convicted and sentenced to death while still serving a sentence of
20 years imprisonment for killing Seabright in the heat of passion caused by
sudden provocation—has surely suffered adequate punishment for the crime to
which he was provoked under such circumstances and which in those circumstances
can be

[Page 353]

treated as two separate and distinct offences only by the
application of the strictest rules of law.

In my opinion, as this Court has unanimously decided that there
was such error in the conduct of the second trial as to vitiate the verdict for
the reasons stated in the judgment of my Lord the Chief Justice, justice will
best be served in the anomalous circumstances of this case by quashing the
present conviction. To send the accused back on what will really be his fourth
trial for murder is so repellent that it ought to be avoided, if at all
possible. I confess that I have great doubt as to the wisdom of this Court
entering a judgment which necessarily involves our rendering a verdict in a
criminal case and ourselves passing sentence upon it. There may possibly be
some doubt as to our right to do so. There can be none as to our right to quash
the conviction.

If a new conviction is now found by us, it can only be for
manslaughter in causing the death of Mrs. Seabright by reason of the accused
having attacked her while still in the heat of passion caused by the same
provocation under which he slew her husband. The infliction upon him now of any
further term of imprisonment to run concurrently with that of the 20-year
sentence he is now serving would really add nothing to his punishment, while it
would signalize an entirely new departure in the exercise of the jurisdiction
of this court in criminal cases.

Appeal allowed; the judgment of the Court of Appeal set
aside; direction that the verdict of murder be quashed and a verdict of
manslaughter entered; appellant sentenced to imprisonment for life.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA IN BANCO

Criminal law—Indictment attacked as bad for
multiplicity—Several matters stated in alternative—Cr. Code, s. 854—Charge
under s. 193 (3) of Customs Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42, and amendments—Form of
verdict.

Appellants were charged and convicted on an
indictment that they “did * * * assist or were otherwise concerned in the
importing, unshipping, landing or removing or subsequent transporting or in the
harbouring of goods liable to forfeiture under the Customs Act, to wit:
spirituous liquors of a value for duty of over” $200, contrary to s. 193 (3) of
said Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42, and amendments. The indictment was attacked on
the ground that it was bad for multiplicity, in that appellants were charged
with several offences in the alternative in the one count.

Held: The
attack on the indictment failed. Appellants were not charged with any one of
the offences of “importing,” “unshipping.” etc. They were charged with an
offence created by s. 193 of the Customs Act, which creates a
substantive offence, and the guilt of a person charged thereunder depends in no
degree whatever upon the fact or otherwise that the acts in which such person
is concerned are themselves offences. S. 854 of the Cr. Code applies.

Held, also,
that the form of the jury’s verdict, finding accused “guilty of harbouring
only,” was unobjectionable when read in connection with the indictment and the
trial Judge’s charge.

Judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in
banco, 12 M.P.R. 483, sustaining, on equal division, the conviction of
accused, affirmed.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1], which, on equal division, dismissed
their appeal from their conviction, at trial before Graham J. and a jury, on an
indictment that they

did * * * assist or were otherwise concerned
in the importing, unshipping, landing or removing or subsequent transporting or
in the harbouring of goods liable to forfeiture under the Customs Act, to wit:
spirituous liquors of a value for duty of over Two Hundred Dollars,

contrary to s. 193 (3) of the Customs Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42, and
amendments thereto.

At trial, before plea by the accused, their
counsel objected to the indictment, claiming that it was bad for a

[Page 424]

multiplicity of charges. The trial Judge
over-ruled the objection.

After the jury had been charged and had
retired, they returned and asked for instruction with regard to the form of
verdict. The trial Judge instructed them as follows:—

I understand you want to know whether or not
you can specify on which of the matters you find the accused guilty. There are
a number in the indictment—did: assist or were otherwise concerned in the
importing, unshipping, landing, removing, subsequent transportation of or in
the harbouring—and I say to you that if you find them guilty of any of these
things you may find them “guilty” and leave it at that. It is not necessary for
you to pick out one of them. If you find they assisted or were otherwise
concerned in the importing you may find them “guilty.” If you find they
assisted or were otherwise concerned in the unshipping or the landing or the
removing or the, subsequent transportation of the liquor, a verdict of,
“guilty” will cover it. I don’t think it would be an error if you designated
the particular thing of which you found them guilty, but it seems to me there
is less likelihood of an error if you enter the general verdict of guilty.

Bring in whatever verdict you think proper,
and if for any reason I think it is incomplete or not satisfactory I will tell
you or send you back.

The jury found the accused “guilty of
harbouring only.”

The grounds of appeal specified by the
accused in their notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in
banco were:—

1. Because the indictment charged six
offences and thereby prejudiced us in our defence;

2. Because the indictment is bad for
multiplicity and should have been quashed when the motion was made to quash
same before we pleaded;

3. Because the special verdict found by the
jury does not constitute an indictable offence;

4. Because the learned trial Judge erred in
instructing the jury that they could bring in a verdict of guilty of any one of
the particular offences mentioned in the indictment.

The appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova
Scotia in banco was dismissed on equal division; the judgment for
dismissal of the appeal being written by Doull J., concurred in by Hall J.; and
the judgment contra (in favour of directing a new trial) was written by
Carroll J., concurred in by Archibald J.[2]

The accused appealed to this Court. By the
judgment now reported, the appeal was dismissed.

[Page 425]

The judgment of the court was delivered by

The Chief
Justice.—This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia dismissing by an equal division an appeal from the judgment of Mr.
Justice Graham who, at the trial, had rejected a motion to quash the
indictment. The indictment is as follows:—

Louis Gatto and Alphonse Tonellatto, of the
Town of New Water-ford, in the.
County of Cape Breton, Province of Nova Scotia, did on or about the
twenty-fourth day of December, in the year of Our Lord, One Thousand Nine
Hundred and Thirty-six, at or near Gabarus, in the said county and province,
assist or were otherwise concerned in the importing, unshipping, landing or
removing or subsequent transporting or in the harbouring of goods liable to
forfeiture under the Customs Act, to wit:

spirituous liquors of a value for duty of
over Two Hundred Dollars, contrary to subsection 3 of section 193 of the
Customs Act, being chapter 42 of the Revised States of Canada, 1927, and
amendments thereto, being the form of Statute in that behalf made and provided.

The application to quash proceeded on the ground
that the indictment is bad for multiplicity, that is to say, that several
offences are charged in one count.

We have carefully considered the able judgment
of Mr. Justice Carroll (with whom Mr. Justice Archibald concurred) who thought
the appeal should be allowed and the indictment quashed; but have come to the
conclusion that the weight of argument is definitely in favour of the view
expressed in the judgment of Mr. Justice Doull, who agreed with the view of the
learned trial judge.

The charge is laid under subsection 3 of section
193 of the Customs Act. Section 193 is in these words:—

193. (1) All vessels, with the guns,
tackle, apparel and furniture thereof, and all vehicles, harness, tackle,
horses and cattle made use of in the importation or unshipping or landing or
removal or subsequent transportation of any goods liable to forfeiture under
this Act, shall be seized and forfeited.

(2) Every person who assists or is
otherwise concerned in the importing, unshipping, landing or removing or
subsequent transporting, or in the harbouring of such goods, or into whose
control or possession the same come without lawful excuse, the proof of which
shall be on the person accused, shall, in addition to any other penalty,
forfeit a sum equal to the value of such goods, which may be recovered in any
court of competent jurisdiction, and, where the value for duty of such goods is
under two hundred dollars, shall further be liable on summary conviction before
two justices of the peace to a penalty not exceeding two hundred dollars and
not less than fifty dollars, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one
month, or to both fine and imprisonment.

(3) Where the value for duty of the goods
so imported, unshipped, landed, removed, subsequently transported, or harboured
or found, is two hundred dollars or over, such person shall be guilty of an
indictable

[Page 426]

offence and liable on conviction, in
addition to other penalties to which he is subject for any such offence, to a
penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars and not less than two hundred
dollars, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding four years and not less
than one year, or to both fine and imprisonment.

The argument on behalf of the appellant is that
under this section “importing” goods of the character to which it relates is
one offence, “unshipping” another offence, “landing” another offence,
“removing” another offence, “transporting” another and “harbouring” still
another, and, accordingly, that the appellants were charged with six offences
in the alternative in the one count.

Mr. Justice Doull, with whom Mr. Justice Hall
concurred, says:—

The fallacy in this argument is that the
appellants were not charged with any one of the offences mentioned. They were
charged with an offence created by section 193 of the Customs Act, which,
leaving out irrelevant matter for the moment, provides that “Every person who
assists or is otherwise concerned in the importing, unshipping, landing or
removing or subsequent transportation or in the harbouring of such goods (i.e.,
goods liable to forfeiture under this Act), where the value of the goods so
imported, &c., is Two Hundred Dollars or over, shall be guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to a penalty not exceeding One Thousand
Dollars and not less than Two Hundred Dollars or to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding four years and not less than one year or to both fine and
imprisonment.

Section 193 creates a substantive offence,
and the guilt of a person charged thereunder depends in no degree whatever upon
the fact or otherwise that the acts in which such person is concerned are
themselves offences.

We agree with this view and we think it is
conclusive of the controversy. Section 854 of the Code applies. We agree
also with Mr. Justice Doull and Mr. Justice Hall that the form of the verdict
is unobjectionable when it is read in connection with the indictment and the
charge of the learned trial judge.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Charge of keeping common gaming house—Article
found on premises as constituting prima facie evidence of guilt—Cr. Code, ss.
985, 986 (2)—Nature of article—Prizes for punching in a board holes containing
“winning letters” contained in correct answers to printed questions—Possibility
of use of knowledge to punch with certainty correct holes—Difficult nature of
questions—Probable and contemplated manner of using the board—Sufficiency of
evidence to support magistrate’s finding against accused.

Appellant was convicted of keeping a common gaming house
contrary to s. 229 of the Cr. Code. Under a search warrant there was
seized in appellant’s drug store what was described as a “skill puzzle board”
containing (inter alia) a list of prizes, lists of numbered questions,
and rows (numbered correspondingly to the questions) of holes, the operator to
win a prize if he punched a hole containing a “winning letter” (which letter
would be in its proper place in the spelling of the answer, concealed under the
row of holes, to the correspondingly numbered question). It was stated that if
the operator knew the answer to a question he could make with certainty a
winning punch. It was apparent (as found by the court) that very few persons
who had not previously examined the questions and undertaken to search in books
of reference, etc., would know the answers. Appellant contended that, there
being only one correct answer to each question, there was no gaming or chance
connected with the operation of the board. The question on this appeal was
whether or not there was before the magistrate evidence sufficient in point of
law to support a finding that the article was a “means or contrivance for
playing any game of chance or any mixed game of chance and skill, gaming or
betting” within s. 986 (2) of the Cr. Code.

Held: The conviction should be sustained. As applicable
to this appeal, the effect of ss. 985 and 986 (2), Cr. Code, was to
render it unnecessary for the prosecution to adduce evidence that persons had
resorted to appellant’s drug store for the purpose of using the board. As to
its manner of use: The court must apply its knowledge of the usual everyday
custom of mankind and hold that the ordinary person entering the store would
pay the sum required (10 cents) for the chance of winning a prize, without
critically examining the questions and returning later with a correct answer or
answers. It was quite apparent that it was never intended that the board would
be so used, but, on the contrary, it was expected that some persons entering
the store would be inveigled to pay for punching a hole and the chance of
winning a prize. This consideration sufficed to demonstrate that the board was
a means or contrivance for playing a game of chance or, at any rate, a mixed
game of chance and skill.

Per Duff C.J.: The magistrate was entitled to look at
the character of the questions and to consider the probability that people
participating in the game would seriously undergo the labour of ascertaining
the

[Page 428]

correct answers, as well as the probability that anybody
offering the game to people entering a public shop would expect that any such
thing would be done. The magistrate evidently concluded that, while the game
could be played as one involving research and with certain results, it would in
actual practice be operated in such a manner that the result, favourable or
unfavourable, would depend entirely upon luck, and that such was the
shopkeeper’s expectation. It could not be said that there was no evidence upon
which the magistrate, employing his knowledge as a man of the world, as it was
his duty to do, could take this view. It was an admissible conclusion, if the
magistrate was so satisfied, that there was no other reasonable explanation of
the proved facts. There was, therefore, evidence to support his finding that
the article was a means or contrivance for playing a game of chance and was
operated for gain by appellant.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] which
(Masten J.A. dissenting) dismissed his appeal from his conviction by a
magistrate of keeping a common gaming house, contrary to s. 229 of the Criminal
Code. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the
judgments now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed.

L.M. Singer K.C. for the appellant.

C.L. Snyder K.C. and C.P. Hope K.C. for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—I have had the opportunity of reading the
judgment of Mr. Justice Kerwin in which I agree. I merely add that the controversy
turns upon the application of sections 985 and 986, Cr. C. Subsection 2
of section 986 is in the following terms:—

If any house, room or place is found fitted or provided with
any means or contrivance for playing any game of chance or any mixed game of
chance and skill, gaming or betting, or with any device for concealing,
removing or destroying such means or contrivance it shall be prima facie
evidence that such house, room or place is a common gaming house or common
betting house as the means or contrivance may indicate;

and the question we have to determine is whether or not there was
before the magistrate evidence sufficient in point of law to support a finding
that the article produced is a “means or contrivance for playing any game of
chance or any mixed game of chance and skill, gaming or betting.”

It is not disputed that the article was not in the shop for sale.
It is equally clear that it is a “means or contrivance for playing a game.” On
the payment of ten

[Page 429]

cents, the person desiring to participate in the game is
entitled, if he succeeds in punching a hole containing one of the winning
letters, to receive a prize specified as appertaining to that letter.

Mr. Singer argues that the game is not a “game of chance or a
mixed game of chance and skill, gaming or betting” because each of the
questions in the six columns has one and only one correct answer—which can be
ascertained; and if such correct answers are ascertained each one of the
winning letters will appear in one or more of them.

The magistrate was entitled to look at the character of the
questions and to consider the probability that people participating in this
game would seriously undergo the labour of ascertaining the correct answers to
these questions, as well as the probability that anybody offering this game to
people entering a public shop would expect that any such thing would be done.
The magistrate evidently came to the conclusion that, while the game could be
played as a game involving research and with certain results, it would,
nevertheless, in actual practice, be operated in such a manner that the result,
favourable or unfavourable, would depend entirely upon luck, and that such was
the expectation of the shopkeeper.

I find myself unable to hold that there was no evidence upon
which the magistrate, employing his knowledge as a man of the world, as it was
his duty to do, could take this view. It was an admissible conclusion, if the
magistrate was so satisfied, that there was no other reasonable explanation of
the proved facts. There was, therefore, evidence to support his finding that
the article produced was a means or contrivance for playing a game of chance
and was operated for gain by the appellant.

The judgment of Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was
delivered by

KERWIN, J.—The appellant was convicted of keeping a common gaming
house contrary to section 229 of the Criminal Code, and his conviction
was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario with Mr. Justice Masten
dissenting in the following words:—

My opinion in this case rests on the simple ground that
there is no evidence that this game has ever been played as a game of chance.
The

[Page 430]

accused is presumed innocent until proved guilty. So far as
appeared on the presentation of this case to this Court the evidence is, that
the device can be used and a successful result obtained with certainty
as a result of research and skill, but no evidence is afforded that it was ever
operated by any person as a game of chance.

For that reason I am of opinion that the prosecution fails.
I think the appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.

By section 226 of the Code, a common gaming house is defined as

(a) a house, room or place kept by any person for
gain, to which persons resort for the purpose of playing at any game of chance,
or at any mixed game of chance and skill.

Section 985 provides as follows:—

When any cards, dice, balls, counters, tables or other
instruments of gaming used in playing any game of chance or any mixed game of
chance and skill are found in any house, room or place suspected to be used as
a common gaming house, and entered under a warrant or order issued under this
Act, or about the person of any of those who are found therein, it shall be prima
facie evidence, on the trial of a prosecution under section two hundred and
twenty-eight or section two hundred and twenty-nine, that such house, room or
place is used as a common gaming house, and that the persons found in the room
or place where such instruments of gaming are found were playing therein,
although no play was actually going on in the presence of the officer entering
the same under such warrant or order, or in the presence of the persons by whom
he is accompanied.

Subsection 2 of section 986 is important but in order to
understand the reference therein of the words “any house, room or place,” it is
necessary to quote also what is really subsection 1 although not so numbered.
These two subsections are as follows:—

In any prosecution under section two hundred and
twenty-eight or under section two hundred and twenty-nine it shall be prima
facie evidence that a house, room or place is a disorderly house if any
constable or officer authorized to enter any house, room or place is wilfully
prevented from or obstructed or delayed in entering the same, or any part
thereof.

2. If any house, room or place is found fitted or provided
with any means or contrivance for playing any game of chance or any mixed game
of chance and skill, gaming or betting, or with any device for concealing,
removing or destroying such means or contrivance, it shall be prima facie
evidence that such house, room or place is a common gaming house or common
betting house as the means or contrivance may indicate.

In this case a search warrant was obtained under section 641 of the
Code and in pursuance thereof a constable seized in the drug store
occupied by the accused what is described as a skill puzzle board. A list of
the prizes that might be won is given in large type on a piece of cardboard
attached

[Page 431]

at the top of the board itself, and on the latter appears the
following:—

Read explanation on
other side before punching.

WINNING LETTERS

The letter “J” wins a “Miracle Dry Shaver.”

The letters W, Z and F win a Genuine Ronson Lighter.

The following letters: QKMV win a Package (5’s) of Eastman
Thin Blades.

Last punch on board receives a “Miracle Dry Shaver.”

The words “Read explanation on other side before punching” are in
smaller type than any of the other printing. It is true that immediately above
what has been extracted the same words appear in heavy blue type on the
representation of the face of the board appearing in the case submitted to us,
but an examination of the board itself, filed as an exhibit, shows that the
list of prizes on the cardboard sheet is attached so as to cover this heavy
blue type. This is really of no importance in the view I take of the matter but
I think should be mentioned.

From a perusal of the explanation referred to, it appears that
the operator of the board would first be required to know the answer to one of
the questions contained in six columns. The answer consists of either a seven
or nine letter word, according to the column in which the question appears.
Below the lists of questions numbered from 1 to 12 is a series of holes similarly
numbered and the object of the operator would be to punch, with the instrument
attached to the board by a string, the particular hole which contains a strip
of paper upon which is printed one of the letters of the alphabet described as
“Winning Letters.” It is stated that the answer to each question is the only
correct, complete and precise answer to the correspondingly numbered and
situated question in the question portion of the board. I do not attach any
importance to the fact that the questions are printed on either a yellow or red
background and are somewhat difficult to read, but it is apparent, upon reading
the questions, that very few persons who had not previously examined them and
undertaken to search for the answers in books of reference, etc., would know
the correct response except perhaps in an isolated instance. Taking three
questions at random as examples, we find the following:—

7. Column 1. Wife of King Valentinian in Fletcher’s tragedy
of 1612.

8. Column 5. Speaker of the House of Commons who promoted
death of Mary, Queen of Scots.

[Page 432]

11. Column 5. Professor of comparative philology, 1868-1875,
at Oxford (Full name).

As applicable to this appeal, the effect of section 985 and
subsection 2 of 986 was to render it unnecessary for the prosecution to adduce
evidence that persons had resorted to the appellant’s drug store for the
purpose of using the board. The contention of the appellant is that, there
being only one correct answer to each question, there is no gaming or no chance
connected with the operation of the board. I think, however, we must apply our
knowledge of the usual everyday custom of mankind and hold that the ordinary
person entering the drug store would pay ten cents for the chance of winning a
prize, without critically examining the questions and returning later with the
correct answers to one or more of them. It is quite apparent that it was never
intended that the board would be so used but, on the contrary, it was expected
that some members of the public entering the drug store would be inveigled to
pay ten cents for the opportunity of punching a hole, and the chance of winning
a prize. This consideration is sufficient, in my opinion, to demonstrate that
the board is a means or contrivance for playing a game of chance or, at any
rate, a mixed game of chance and skill.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN

Conspiracy—Duress—Action for alleged
obtaining of property by threat of criminal prosecution—Jury’s findings—Ground
of action—Substance of the claim—Remedy.

Plaintiff, who had been the general manager
and a shareholder of a company, alleged that defendants, one of whom: was the
president and a large shareholder of the company, entered into an unlawful
conspiracy to obtain from him a transfer of his shares in the company by threats
of criminal prosecution; that pursuant to the conspiracy defendants made such
threats and, induced thereby, he delivered to defendants a transfer of the
shares as demanded; and he claimed recovery of their value. Defendants denied
plaintiff’s allegations and they alleged breaches of duty in plaintiff’s
management of the company, resulting in loss to it, and that plaintiff
surrendered his shares in satisfaction of claims on behalf of the company for
such loss. At the trial two totally different stories in the evidence went to
the jury, who, in answers to questions submitted, found in favour of
plaintiff’s allegations. Judgment was given to plaintiff for the amount awarded
as damages by the jury, being the value of the shares plus interest. An appeal
by defendants to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan was dismissed, [1938] 1
W.W.R. 241. Defendants appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per The Chief
Justice, Crocket and Davis JJ.: There was evidence to justify the jury’s
findings. These findings were in effect that there was an intentional design on
defendants’ part to obtain from plaintiff, without any valuable consideration,
a transfer of his shares and that

[Page 236]

the same was demanded and obtained by menaces
and illegal extortion. This was quite sufficient to answer the argument that a
mere threat in itself is not unlawful. A threat to prosecute may not of itself
be illegal where a just debt actually exists and where the transaction between
the parties involves a civil liability as well as, possibly, a criminal act (Flower
v. Sadler, 10 Q.B.D. 572, at 576). Here the findings plainly
negatived defendants’ story that the transaction was merely the legitimate
compromise of a claim for damages for breach of duty. Moreover, no question of
plaintiff’s civil liability to the company set up by defendants was asked of
the jury and defendants had no finding that there was any such liability.

Per Davis J.:
Remarks with regard to conspiracy as a ground of action. Inclination expressed
to the opinion that civil conspiracy is not properly applicable to cases where
physical property is sought to be recovered on the ground of duress and is
really only relevant in cases of general or undefined rights, such as a right
to trade, as distinguished from defined rights, such as the right to property.
Doubt expressed whether the present, case properly lies in conspiracy. But,
whether or not plaintiff’s remedy was properly laid as an action in conspiracy,
the substance of the claim was that plaintiff had been maliciously and
unlawfully deprived of his property by duress and coercion on defendant’s part;
that was the issue that was contested at the trial and that was the issue that
really went to the jury.

Kerwin and Hudson JJ. adopted the reasons of
Mackenzie J.A. in the Court of Appeal, [1938] 1 W.W.R. at 244-260.

APPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1]
dismissing their appeal from the judgment of Taylor J., on the verdict of a
jury, that the plaintiff recover from the defendants the sum of $26,840 and
interest.

The action was brought to recover from the
defendants the value of certain shares of stock in the Reliance Lumber Co. Ltd.
The plaintiff had been the owner of the said shares; and he alleged that
defendants entered into an unlawful conspiracy to obtain from him a transfer of
said shares by threats of criminal prosecution; that pursuant to the conspiracy
the defendants threatened to institute criminal proceedings against him unless
he would transfer the shares to them; that, induced by said threats, he
delivered to defendants a transfer of the shares, defendants obtained
possession of the share certificates and had ever since been in possession of
the same.

The plaintiff had been the general manager,
and the defendant Stoltze was the president, of said company. The other
defendants were employees of Stoltze and as such had made certain
investigations into the affairs of the company.

[Page 237]

In their defence the defendants denied
plaintiff’s allegations, and they alleged breaches of duty in plaintiff’s
management of the company, as a result of which, it was alleged, the company
lost large sums of money and suffered and would suffer loss of profits, which
the plaintiff became liable to repay and make good to the company, and that
plaintiff agreed to surrender his shares to the company in full satisfaction of
all claims of the company against him in respect of the aforesaid matters, and
did so, delivering the share certificates endorsed in blank, and that the shares
were now held by or on behalf of the company.

Defendants’ allegations were denied by
plaintiff.

The delivery of the share certificates
(endorsed in blank), and also the resignation of the plaintiff as general
manager of the company, took place immediately after a certain interview
between the defendants and the plaintiff. Conflicting accounts of what was said
at that interview were given at the trial.

The evidence is discussed at some length in
the judgment of Davis J. in this Court, now reported, and also in the judgment
of Mackenzie J.A. in the Court of Appeal[2].

At the trial the jury found in favour of the
plaintiff. The questions submitted and the jury’s answers thereto were as
follows:

1. Did the plaintiff receive any valuable
consideration for the transfer of his interest in his shares in the Reliance
Lumber Company Limited referred to in the memorandum of agreement dated March
16th, 1936.

Answer: No.

2. Did the defendants, on or about the 16th
day of March, 1936, enter into a conspiracy to obtain a transfer of the
plaintiff’s shares of the capital stock of the Reliance Lumber Company Limited
by threats of criminal prosecution of the plaintiff?

Answer: Yes.

3. If you so find, did the defendants,
pursuant to the said conspiracy, threaten to criminally prosecute the
plaintiff?

Answer: Yes.

4. And if you find in the affirmative in
answering questions 2 and 3 was the plaintiff induced by the said threat to
transfer and deliver his said shares in the said company to the defendants?

Answer: Yes.

[Page 238]

5. Assess the damage sustained by the
plaintiff in consequence of the said conspiracy, if you have so found.

Answer: $26,840, plus interest at legal rate
(from) March 16th, 1936.

6. Did the defendants agree not to prosecute
the plaintiff?

Answer: Yes, by implication.

The trial judge directed that judgment be
entered for the plaintiff for the amount, with interest, as awarded by the
jury. The defendants appealed from the verdict and findings of the jury and
from the said judgment to the Court of Appeal, which dismissed the appeal[3], and defendants appealed to
this Court. By the judgment of this Court, now reported, the appeal was
dismissed with costs.

F. L. Bastedo K.C. for the appellants.

G. H. Yule K.C. and R. L. Winton for the
respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—I do not desire to lay down any rule of
general application as to the scope of actions founded on conspiracy. Subject
to that, I concur with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Davis.

Crocket, J.—Subject to the same reservation as that indicated in the
learned Chief Justice’s memorandum, I concur in the judgment of my brother
Davis.

Davis, J.—From some time in the year 1909 until March 16th, 1936, the
respondent Fuller had been the general manager of the Reliance Lumber Company,
Limited, a Dominion company with head office at Saskatoon in the province of
Saskatchewan and with an executive office in St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.A. The
company carried on a retail lumber business in the province of Saskatchewan and
had in March, 1936, about thirty lumber yards, mostly in the northern part of
the province. The respondent resided in Saskatoon. The appellant Stoltze is the
President of the Company and resides in St. Paul, Minnesota. His father, now
deceased, had owned nine-tenths of the capital stock of the company and the
respondent the other one-tenth. On the death of his father in 1928, the
appellant Stoltze and his wife became the owners of, and still hold,
nine-tenths of the stock of the company. The respondent remained the owner of
the other one-tenth of the stock

[Page 239]

of the company. Stoltze’s co-appellants, Kemper
and Hadrath, also reside in St. Paul, Minnesota, and were requested by Stoltze
in February, 1936, to investigate for him certain charges of mismanagement
against the respondent in respect of the company’s affairs that had been
reported to Stoltze by one Davies. Hadrath was in the employ of Stoltze, having
done both clerical and executive work for some years for him in connection with
different companies with which Stoltze was connected. Stoltze described Hadrath
as his “confidential man—what in the United States we call in slang a trouble
shooter. When something goes wrong I send him down to attend to it; if there is
a problem before me, I ask him to look into it.” Stoltze admitted that Hadrath
had no special knowledge of the business of the Reliance Lumber Company. Kemper
was an uncle of Stoltze’s wife and had been assisting Stoltze in his office in
St. Paul. Stoltze said he trusted him entirely but “he had no particular
qualifications for this work.”—that is, of investigating the affairs of the
Reliance Lumber Company. Neither Hadrath nor Kemper appear to have had any
shares in the company.

On March 16th, 1936, the respondent turned over
to the appellant Stoltze all his shares in the company and resigned as
secretary, general manager and a director of the company. His shares were
admitted to be worth $30,000 and there is no question that they were his own
property. The share certificates, immediately prior to their delivery to
Stoltze, were in the Dominion Bank at Saskatoon, collateral to loans to the
respondent of $3,160. This amount the company paid to the Bank in order to
release the security. On April 2nd, 1936, the respondent by his solicitor
demanded from the appellant Stoltze the immediate reassignment and delivery to
the respondent of the share certificates in question, or their value, his
contention being that the transfer of the shares had been obtained by duress,
in the form of threats of prosecution. This action by the respondent against
the appellants Stoltze, Kemper and Hadrath followed the refusal of Stoltze to
return the share certificates.

Two totally different stories were given to the
jury. The evidence on behalf of the appellants (defendants) was that at a
meeting of the four persons, parties to this action, in the company’s office in
Saskatoon on the said

[Page 240]

March 16th, 1936, the affairs of the company
were discussed for about an hour; charges of mismanagement and breach of duty
by the respondent as general manager of the company were made on the basis that
the respondent had caused the company great loss by buying lumber through the
medium of his son, so that his son would get a commission; that after the
respondent had asked what he could do or should do about the “mess” that
Stoltze had told him he had got the company into, Stoltze suggested to the
respondent that he might turn in his stock in reparation; and that the
respondent agreed to do that. Stoltze said at the trial that his understanding
was that the respondent was voluntarily turning over the stock in reparation of
the damage he had permitted to be done to the company and that he, Stoltze,
believed the turning over of the stock would be an equitable solution because
he was satisfied that the losses were much greater than the value of the stock.

The respondent’s story was that on returning
from a western business trip he was summoned to his office at the company’s
head office by telephone on the day in question, March 16th, 1936, and found
the three appellants there; they had Changed the lock on the door of his office
before his arrival; they made charges against him and threatened him with
criminal prosecution and demanded, to avoid his prosecution, that he turn over
to them all his shares in the capital stock of the company. The crucial part of
his evidence as to the interview in the office that morning is this:

Hadrath and Kemper both said, You had
better come clean, come clean. And we have got the goods on you. * * * After
that was gone over, it got to such an extent that I hardly knew what to say.
And then it was Hadrath said, You had better throw yourself into the hands of
Mr. Stoltze. * * * Another question came up that seemed to break the ice, was
this: Why did you give Gerald—which is my son—all of this business? I said, Mr.
Stoltze knows that Gerald got this business. Mr. Stoltze rather flew off in a
huff, and he said, I didn’t know that he got all of the business, or so much of
the business. * * * He (Stoltze) says, You have had no sympathy with others, and
I haven’t sympathy with you; you ought to be in gaol, and that is where we are
going to send you; and your friend Arthur Moxon agrees.

Mr. Moxon was the company’s solicitor in
Saskatoon and a man of very high standing in his profession. The significance of
the words “and your friend Arthur Moxon agrees” would be very apparent to a
local jury.

[Page 241]

I was simply crushed; my mind was nearly a
blank. They asked me a few more questions; and I was mentally—I hardly knew
what they did ask; asked a few more questions. And I says, What do you want me
to do? What do you want me to do? Or what can I do? What do you want me to say?
I didn’t know where I was at. I hadn’t been told. And finally Mr. Stoltze came
on to the scene again—* * * he spoke up. And he says, We want your shares in
the Reliance Lumber Company; we want your resignation; we want you to agree not
to compete with the Reliance Lumber Company anywhere, and to get out of the
country.

The respondent said that he was crushed by all
this; that Hadrath then went out into another room and came back with a paper
which he respondent signed, containing his resignation and authority to the
Dominion Bank to turn over his shares in the company. The respondent said that
when Hadrath presented the document to him he said he thought he had better get
a lawyer but was told by Stoltze, “This has got to be done before you get out
of this room.” Stoltze, on his cross-examination, when asked “Why didn’t you go to him (the respondent)
quietly, it seems the obvious
thing to do, and say, Let us get together and talk about this quietly’?”
answered, “That doesn’t happen to be my way of doing things.”

The respondent was obviously a man who was well
and favourably known in his community, active in the work of the Y.M.C.A. and
of the Rotary Club and was President of the Saskatoon Exhibition Board. He was
a married man and his home was in Saskatoon. He said that he signed the
document, not that he had done anything wrong, but he thought of “all those
different things, different friends, and people, and associations, and I
couldn’t do it—the disgrace of it.” He very positively swore that during his
administration of the company’s affairs he never knowingly did anything or
omitted to do anything to the prejudice of the company; that there was in his
mind no just ground for the complaints and charges that were made; and that he
was not attempting to stifle the prosecution of any just changes against him.
Overcome by the threats of these three men and the situation that confronted
him, he sought escape by acquiescing in their demands that he turn over his
shares.

Now those were the two stories that went to the
jury. There was a mass of evidence directed to show that here and there the
respondent had given advantage to his son in the buying of lumber for the
company and suggestions

[Page 242]

that the company had as a result been getting a
poorer grade of lumber than it otherwise would have obtained. The charges were
of the most general character and the respondent gave his explanation of the
several impeached transactions. There was no suggestion that the respondent was
offered any release by the company of any claims the company might have against
him for any loss that may have occurred as a result of the alleged breaches of
duty. What was said by the appellants was that these losses were in excess of
$30,000 and that it was a fair transaction to take the respondent’s shares in
the company in reparation for the losses.

It is perfectly plain that the jury accepted the
respondent’s story of what took place and, it being entirely contradictory of
the appellants’ story of what occurred, the jury obviously disbelieved the
appellants. The jury’s verdict was that the appellants should pay the
respondent $26,840 (being the value of the stock, $30,000, less the amount of
the loans paid to the Bank, $3,160) together with interest on that sum at the
legal rate from March 16, 1936.

Without for the moment giving consideration to
the form of the action or to certain objections taken by the appellants as to the
rejection of evidence, no one could fairly disagree with the jury, upon the
contradictory evidence, having arrived at the conclusion they did. If it had
not been for the exhaustive review of the evidence and the very able argument
presented to us by Mr. Bastedo, counsel for the appellants, I should not have
thought that there was the slightest hope for any interference with the jury’s
verdict.

Mr. Bastedo, however, contended with great force
that, the action being laid in conspiracy and there being no express plea of
malice and nothing in the charge to the jury on malice, malice cannot
reasonably be read into the questions to and the answers by the jury. If the
action was properly framed in conspiracy, I should not find any difficulty in
implying not only a charge but proof of malice. I have very considerable doubt
myself that a case of this kind properly lies in conspiracy. Where, for
instance, the charge is a charge of defrauding a man of his money, the
allegation of conspiracy may add nothing to the charge and be mere surplusage.
Conspiracy may be

[Page 243]

important where the act complained of is prima
facie not a violation of a right, but may become so by reason of malice or
spite. I am inclined to think that civil conspiracy is not properly applicable
to cases where physical property is sought to be recovered on the ground of
duress, and is really only relevant in cases of general or undefined rights,
such as the right to trade, as distinguished from defined rights, such as the
right to property. But however that may be, the effect of the jury’s findings
in this case is that there was an intentional design on the part of the three
appellants to obtain from the respondent, without any valuable consideration, a
transfer of the respondent’s shares in the company that were worth $30,000 and
that the same was demanded and obtained from the respondent by menaces and
illegal extortion. That is quite sufficient to answer the argument that a mere
threat in itself is not unlawful. As Lord Justice Cotton said in Flower v.
Sadler[4],
a threat to prosecute is not of itself illegal where a just and bona fide debt
actually exists and where the transaction between the parties involves a civil
liability as well as, possibly, a criminal act. But here the jury’s findings plainly
negative the appellants’ story that the transaction was merely the legitimate
compromise of a claim for damages for breach of duty. Moreover, the appellants
set up a civil liability on the part of the respondent to the company for
alleged loss by reason of the alleged breaches of duty but no such question was
asked of the jury and the appellants have no finding that there was any such
liability. Whether or not the remedy of the respondent was properly laid as an
action in conspiracy, the substance of the claim was that the respondent had
been maliciously and unlawfully deprived of his property by duress and
coercion, on the part of the appellants. That was the issue that was contested
at the trial and that was the issue that really went to the jury.

Objection was taken by Mr. Bastedo to the
refusal of the learned trial judge to admit evidence that was tendered on
behalf of the appellants at the trial as to the details of the report made to
Stoltze by one Davies with charges of the respondent’s misconduct as general
manager of the company, and as to information given by Davies to

[Page 244]

Stoltze as a result of which Stoltze caused the
investigation to be made by Hadrath and Kemper, and of conversations between
these persons, and of information obtained by Hadrath and Kemper on their trip
of investigation through western Canada; also general evidence of the yard
agents of the Reliance Lumber Company as to purchases of lumber being of a poor
and inferior quality and below invoice grade, and evidence of prices paid by
the Reliance Lumber Company to other companies in respect of which the
respondent’s son was alleged to be getting a commission. On the question of the
exclusion of this evidence, the jury had before them the report of Davies upon
which Stoltze acted, and the learned trial judge was quite right in declining
to permit the trial to be dragged out interminably. The report of Davies was
quite sufficient in itself for the purposes of the appellants. In any event the
exclusion of the evidence did not occasion any substantial wrong.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

Kerwin, J.—Notwithstanding Mr. Bastedo’s able argument, I think this
appeal should be dismissed. I cannot usefully add anything to the judgment of
Mr. Justice MacKenzie[5].

Hudson, J.—I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs for reasons
mentioned by Mr. Justice MacKenzie in the court below[6].

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—“Common bawdy house” (Criminal Code, s. 225).

Accused had rented a room and there had intercourse with men
who paid her. Some called at the room and others were accosted by her on the
street. No woman except accused had intercourse with men in the room.

Held: Accused kept “a common bawdy house” within the
definition of that term in s. 225 of the Criminal Code.

APPEAL by the Attorney-General for Ontario from the judgment
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which (Middleton J.A. dissenting) dismissed
the Attorney-General’s appeal against the acquittal of the accused by a
magistrate on the charge against her (under s. 229 of the Criminal Code)
of unlawfully keeping a disorderly house, that is to say, a common bawdy house.

C.R. Magone for the appellant.

G.J. McIlraith for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

KERWIN, J.—The accused was charged under section 229 of the Criminal
Code with keeping a disorderly house, that is to say, a common bawdy house.
This latter expression is defined by section 225 of the Code as follows:

A common bawdy-house is a house, room, set of rooms or place
of any kind kept for purposes of prostitution or for the practice of acts of
indecency, or occupied or resorted to by one or more persons for such purposes.

There is no dispute about the facts, as the accused gave evidence
from which it appears that she had rented a room and there had intercourse with
men who paid her. Some called at the room and others were accosted by her on
the street. Another girl lived with her but nothing turns upon this as this
girl was not a prostitute. No woman had intercourse with men in the room except
the accused.

[Page 213]

The magistrate dismissed the charge, following the judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario in Rex v. Sorvari[1].
That Court, with Middleton J.A. dissenting, affirmed the acquittal and from its
order the Crown now appeals.

Prior to 1907, a common bawdy house was defined by section 225 of
the Code as “a house, room, set of rooms or place of any kind kept for
purposes of prostitution,” but in that year, by 6-7 Edward VII, chapter 8,
section 2, the section was repealed and a new one enacted in the same terms but
with the addition at the end, of the words “or occupied or resorted to by one
or more persons for such purposes.” These added words clearly cover the
circumstances in the present case where there was not an isolated act of
fornication but a habitual occupation of the room for purposes of prostitution.

This same view had been expressed by the Ontario Court of Appeal
in Rex v. Margaret Smith[2], but
this decision was not cited to the court that decided the Sorvari case1
or to the court below in the present appeal. To the same effect is the decision
of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Rex v. Miket[3].

The appeal should be allowed. All the facts are before the Court
but we merely direct a new trial, which we were informed by counsel for the
appellant it is not the Crown’s intention to prosecute.

Appeal allowed.

Solicitor for the appellant: W.B. Common.

Solicitor for the respondent: G.J. McIlraith.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL OF BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Evidence—Charge
of conspiracy to distribute drug—Evidence of accomplice—Corroboration.

The appeal was from the
affirmance by the Court of Appeal of British
 Columbia of appellant's conviction for
conspiracy to distribute morphine contrary to the Opium and Narcotic Drug
Act, 1929, (Dom.). There was a dissent in the Court of Appeal on the ground
of lack of corroborative evidence and misdirection with regard thereto.

The evidence against appellant
was almost wholly that of one F., named as a co-conspirator of appellant but
who had previously been tried and convicted. F.'s story set out conversations
and dealings with appellant as to the sale of morphine and in particular an
occasion when he had met him at a certain house and went with him out of a room
there where others were gathered, and had a private conversation with him as to
delivery of morphine. A police agent gave evidence that he was present on said
occasion, that the place was one where dealings in morphine were being carried
on by some of those

[Page 422]

involved in the conspiracy,
and that he had seen F. and appellant leave the room together. Appellant in
evidence admitted being present at the place at the time, but denied that he
had any private conversation with F.

In the course of charging the
jury the trial judge stated that, while it is open to a jury to convict upon
the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, it is dangerous to do so; that
""corroboration is such evidence as confirms not only the circumstances of
the crime as related by the accomplice, but also the identity of the prisoner;
by that I do not mean that it will not be corroboration unless every
circumstance is confirmed; it will be corroboration if there is confirmation as
to a material circumstance of the crime and of the identity of the prisoner;
evidence to amount to corroboration need not be direct evidence that the
accused committed the crime, it may amount to corroboration if it is
confirmation of a material circumstance and it connects the accused with the
crime."" Referring to the police agent's evidence, he said it ""amounts
to only this: it is a confirmation, if you accept it, of F.'s evidence as to
the conspiracy on the part of the others outside of [accused]; he does appear to
corroborate him on substantial points""; and that ""all that amounts to
is this: it is proof of a fact, if you accept what F. tells you, that it did
occur; if you accept that, then you have [the police agent's] corroboration of
nothing more or less than that the conference which F. says occurred, did
occur; that is all it corroborates, and the inference there is for you,
***."" He further stated: ""If you think that corroboration is
necessary then it is for you to say whether you have corroboration which falls
within the definition I have given you.""

Held (Kerwin J. dissenting): On consideration of the
summing up as a whole and in view of all the circumstances, there was no
material misdirection or non-direction on the point of corroboration. The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin J. (dissenting): As the police agent's
testimony indicated merely an opportunity on accused's part to discuss with F.
the delivery of morphine, the trial judge was wrong in telling the jury that
the police agent's evidence, if believed, was corroboration. There were no
circumstances surrounding the particular episode that would tend to implicate
accused in the commission of the crime charged (the house in question being a
boot-legging establishment where those desiring beer, etc., might be served).
Opportunity by itself is not sufficient (Burbury v. Jackson,
[1917] 1 K.B. 16).

Kerwin J. criticized as
improper the fact that, while F. had pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy
under the same Act, he had not been sentenced at the time he gave evidence at
appellant's trial.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal of British Columbia affirming (Martin J.A. dissenting) the conviction of
the appellant (on trial before Manson J. with a jury) for conspiracy with
others to commit the indictable offence of distributing a drug (morphine)
contrary to s. 4 (f) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929
(Dom.) and amendments thereto. By the judgment now reported the appeal to this
Court was dismissed, Kerwin J. dissenting.

[Page 423]

L. Clare Moyer K.C. for
the appellant.

Gordon S. Wismer K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of the majority of
the Court (Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Davis and Hudson JJ.) was delivered by

HUDSON J.—The appellant Canning
was convicted at the trial before Mr. Justice Manson of the Court of King's
Bench of British Columbia and a jury, of unlawfully conspiring to distribute
morphine contrary to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929. From this
decision he appealed to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia and in that court
the appeal was dismissed by a majority of 2 to 1. In the formal judgment the
reasons for dissent by Mr. Justice Martin are stated to be that

there is no evidence to
corroborate the witnesses for the prosecution; and that there was misdirection
and non-direction amounting to misdirection respecting said corroboration and
also respecting the consequences of the erroneous direction that there was such
evidence.

No written reasons for dissent
appear to have been delivered.

Under section 1023 of the Criminal
Code our jurisdiction in this case is confined to any question of law in
which there has been dissent in the court of appeal. Neither in the language of
the formal judgment nor in the notice of appeal is there a clear statement of
the point or points of law upon which dissent rests, and it is questionable
whether or not there is sufficient to give jurisdiction. However, we have not
thought it necessary in the present instance to decide this question.

The evidence against Canning was
almost wholly that of a man named Furumoto who was named in the indictment as a
co-conspirator of Canning but who had previously been tried separately and
convicted. Furumoto gave a detailed story setting out various conversations and
dealings with Canning in regard to the sale of morphine and, in particular,
that on one occasion in the course of the negotiations he had met him at the
house of one Ferraro and while there went out of the room where others were
gathered and had a private conversation with Canning in regard to the delivery
of a quantity of morphine. A man named Morley Fisher, an agent of the Mounted
Police, was called as a witness on behalf of the Crown and stated that he was
present on the occasion above mentioned, that the place

[Page 424]

was one where dealings in
morphine were being carried on by some of the parties involved in the
conspiracy and that he had seen Furumoto there in conversation with Canning and
that they had gone out together. Canning was called as a witness on his own
behalf and admitted being present at this place on the evening in question but
denied that he had any private conversation with Furumoto.

The learned trial judge in his
charge to the jury correctly stated the law in regard to the danger of
accepting the evidence of an accomplice without corroboration and expressly
gave to the jury the necessary warning as stated in the judgment of this Court
in the case of Vigeant v. The King[1]
. It was contended before us that in this instance the trial judge should not
only have stated the law and given the warning as to the danger of accepting
the evidence of an accomplice, but also should specifically have charged that
the evidence of Fisher put forward on behalf of the Crown did not amount to
corroboration.

The learned trial judge in his
charge stated :

Corroboration is such
evidence as confirms not only the circumstances of the crime as related by the
accomplice, but also the identity of the prisoner. By that, I do not mean that
it will not be corroboration unless every circumstance is confirmed. It will be
corroboration if there is confirmation as to a material circumstance of the
crime and of the identity of the prisoner. Evidence to amount to corroboration
need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime—it is
important to bear that in mind here. Let me repeat it. Evidence to amount to
corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime,
it may amount to corroboration if it is confirmation of a material circumstance
and it connects the accused with the crime. I repeat: while it is open to a
jury to convict upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, it is
dangerous to do so.

He further stated:

Now you will remember what I
said about corroboration. Corroboration is always important, whether the question
of an accomplice arises or not, particularly when you have a flat
contradiction, as you have here. Fisher says he was there on the famous
Saturday night. It is urged upon you, and it is something for you to consider,
that as Fisher said he did want to get Canning—there is no denying that he said
he was the very man he wanted to get—it is suggested to you in the defence that
Fisher is not telling the truth. Now how far does Fisher go, taking his own
statement: ""I knew about this man Canning and wanted to get him.""
What evidence have you that he wanted to get him? The only evidence he gives is
the evidence that on this Saturday night he saw the accused call Furumoto away
from the kitchen for a conference. He says they went to the foot of the stairs in
the front room, and he said at one point that they went upstairs, but obviously
he did not actually see them go

[Page 425]

upstairs. He perhaps, giving
him credit for truthfulness, if you so desire, he probably was giving a
conclusion there from what he saw them do, rather than an actual statement of
fact, because he says in cross-examination he did not see them go upstairs,
although he said so before, and he then said ""the living room and the foot
of the stairs were out of my range of vision."" Furumoto says definitely
they did leave the kitchen at the accused's request and did go upstairs.
Fisher's evidence amounts to only this: it is a confirmation, if you accept it,
of Furumoto's evidence as to the conspiracy on the part of the others outside
of Canning. He does appear to corroborate him on substantial points.

At the conclusion of the charge,
counsel for the prisoner asked this question : 

Did I understand your
lordship's instructions to be the jury might consider Morley Fisher's statement
that he heard Canning ask Furumoto to go upstairs, to be corroborative evidence—that
they might consider it as such?

The Court:

Yes, I think so. The charge
is that this conspiracy was between certain dates, and it is not confined to
the sale of these two particular half pounds, if sale there was, by Furumoto to
Canning. The charge is not confined to these two particular incidents. It says
he did conspire between the 15th day of August, 1934, and the 1st day of March,
1936. Now then if it be that Furumoto and the accused conferred at a time and
place within these dates—Fisher does not say, of course, and you know this
perfectly well, members of the jury, Fisher does not say he overheard the
conversation. He does not know what the conversation was. It might have been as
to the weather. All that amounts to is this: it is proof of a fact, if you
accept what Furumoto tells you, that it did occur. If you accept that, then you
have Fisher's corroboration of nothing more or less than that the conference
which Furumoto says occurred, did occur. That is all it corroborates, and the
inference there is for you, as I pointed out.

Then, after some further
discussion, the learned trial judge said :

I think the best thing I can
do for you is to read again what constitutes corroboration. It may be just as
well that I should read that to you now so that you will have it fresh.
Corroboration is such evidence as confirms not only the circumstances of the
crime as related by the accomplice, but also the identity of the prisoner. By
that I do not mean that it will not be corroboration unless every circumstance
is confirmed. It will be corroboration if there is confirmation as to a
material circumstance of the crime and of the identity of the prisoner.
Evidence to amount to corroboration need not be direct evidence that the
accused committed the crime, it may amount to corroboration if it is
confirmation of a material circumstance and it connects the accused with the
crime. Then you will remember with what I concluded. I told you it is open to a
jury to convict upon the evidence of an accomplice alone if they are so advised—if
that is their opinion—but it is dangerous to do so without corroboration. If
you think that corroboration is necessary then it is for you to say whether you
have corroboration which falls within the definition I have given you.

On consideration of the summing
up as a whole and in view of all the circumstances, we do not think that there

[Page 426]

was material misdirection or non-direction
on the point of corroboration. The appeal should be dismissed.

KERWIN J. (dissenting)—The
appellant was convicted of unlawfully conspiring to distribute morphine
contrary to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929. The only direct
evidence against him was given by one Furumoto, who testified that on a certain
occasion a conversation took place between him and the accused, and that at a
subsequent date, in the house of one Ferraro, another conversation occurred
between them. It is of this latter date that the witness Fisher, a Mounted
Police agent, spoke, and he testified that he saw the two leave Ferraro's
kitchen together. Furumoto's evidence was that they went upstairs and that it
was there a conversation occurred in regard to the delivery of a quantity of
morphine. Fisher, of course, could not, and did not, attempt to speak of what
transpired between Furumoto and the accused.

The learned trial judge told the
jury that Fisher's evidence, if believed, was corroboration within the meaning
of the rule. With this I cannot agree, as Fisher's testimony indicated merely
an opportunity on the part of the accused to discuss with Furumoto the delivery
of morphine. There were no circumstances surrounding the particular episode
that would tend to implicate the accused in the commission of the crime
charged, as Ferraro conducted a boot-legging establishment, according to all
the evidence, where those who desired to obtain beer and other refreshments
might be served.

Opportunity by itself is not sufficient. Burbury v. Jackson[2] . The main judgment in that case was delivered by
Lord Reading, who had delivered the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in
The King v. Baskerville[3]
. At page 18 of the Burbury case[4] , the
Lord Chief Justice states:

The evidence here shows
nothing more than that it was possible to have committed the misconduct at the
material date. That is not enough. The evidence must show that the misconduct
was probable. If the parties were seen in the neighbourhood of a wood or other
dark place where they had no occasion to be, that might possibly be corroborative
evidence. So in the case cited of Harvey v. Anning[5]
the fact of persons of different social positions being seen together in lanes
was held enough.

[Page 427]

Whether there was other evidence
in which the jury could, if properly directed, find corroboration, is
immaterial as the trial judge did not refer to it in his charge but on the
contrary directed the jury that Fisher's evidence, if believed, was
corroboration. Hubin v. The King (1).

While not open on this appeal,
there is a matter that should, I think, be referred to. That is, that while
Furumoto had pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy, under the same Act, he
had not been sentenced at the time he gave evidence at the trial of the present
applicant. This is a practice that should not be tolerated.

In my opinion, the appeal should
be allowed and a new trial directed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA IN BANCO

Criminal law—Constitutional law—Application
of fines—Whether payable to the Province or to the Dominion—Cr. Code, s.
1036—Proceeding instituted at the instance of a Department of the Government of
Canada in which that Government “bears the cost of prosecution” (exception (b)
in s. 1036(1), Cr. Code).

The question was whether certain fines in
question should be paid to the Treasurer of the Province of Nova Scotia or to
the Minister of Finance for Canada.

An information was laid at Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the instance of
the Department of National Revenue of the Government of Canada, against certain
persons as having conspired to commit specified indictable offences against the
Excise Act and the Customs Act, and contrary to s. 573 of the Criminal
Code.

The accused were, on a preliminary inquiry at
Halifax, committed for trial, were subsequently admitted to bail, later they
surrendered to the gaol keeper, they were granted writs of habeas corpus and
recipias corpus to bring them before the stipendiary magistrate in and
for the City of Halifax, before whom they were brought and charged, they
consented to be tried by him under Part XVI of the Criminal Code, pleaded
guilty, were convicted and adjudged to be imprisoned and to pay the fines now
in question, aggregating $16,000, which were paid to the treasurer of the City
of Halifax.

Counsel for the informant, on instructions of
the Department of National Revenue, appeared at the preliminary inquiry, on the
applications for bail and for writs of habeas corpus, etc., and at the
trial. The prosecuting officer for the County of Halifax, or his assistant,
appeared on behalf of the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia on the same
proceedings except the preliminary inquiry.

The Province or the Municipality of the
County of Halifax made no disbursements. The Department of National Revenue
paid direct to the parties concerned the fees of informant’s counsel, costs of
stenographer’s

[Page 404]

notes, and other costs, and fees of witnesses
for the prosecution and fees and allowances of the justice of the peace on the
preliminary inquiry. Witnesses’ fees or the justice’s fees and allowances were
never certified to be correct nor produced or presented to the treasurer of the
municipality in manner prescribed under The Costs and Fees Act, R.S.N.S.
1923, c. 252 (which provides for payment thereof) and no claim for fees by
witnesses or the justice was made to the treasurer of the municipality. The
Dominion Government did not pay for the services of the said prosecuting
officer (or his assistant) or of the stipendiary magistrate (who each receive
remuneration annually from the Government of Nova Scotia or the municipality).

Held: The
fines in question were imposed in a proceeding instituted at the instance of
the Government of Canada or of a department thereof, in which that Government
bore the cost of prosecution, within the meaning of exception (b) in s.
1036 (1) of the Criminal Code, and were payable to the Minister of
Finance for Canada.

Judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in
banco, 11 M.P.R. 335, affirmed on above ground.

Per Duff C.J.,
Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.: The words “in which that Government bears the
cost of prosecution” in said exception (b) in s. 1036 (1) do not relate
to what may take place in a particular prosecution; they connote something
broader than the mere casual occurrence of the payment of the costs in an
individual case; they imply a consistent course of action sanctioned by law or
by custom. The existence of The Costs and Fees Act of Nova Scotia cannot
affect the construction nor preclude the true effect of s. 1036 of the Criminal
Code, which is essentially federal legislation. As to custom or practice,
the Government of Canada had full right to institute the proceedings and to
conduct the prosecution in question; and the costs thereof were such as would
usually and properly be borne by the Dominion of Canada; and, moreover, they in
fact were so borne.

The provinces establish and maintain the
ordinary criminal courts and, for this reason in itself, the “cost of prosecution”
referred to in said exception (b) must be of a character apart from the
ordinary costs of maintenance of those courts.

The said words “cost of prosecution” which
the “Government bears” are necessarily referable to cost specially incurred in
connection with the proceeding it has instituted. The fact that the trial was
presided over by a stipendiary magistrate who is not paid by the Government of
Canada, or the participation by the prosecuting officer, or his assistant, who
are not paid by that Government, does not affect the situation. When acting in
the premises, said magistrate and prosecuting officer (who receive their
remuneration annually as aforesaid) are doing so merely as part of their
regular duties; they were not paid specifically in connection with the
prosecution in question.

Per Davis J.:
Without attempting to define the full scope and extent of the statutory
condition that the Government of Canada “bears the cost of prosecution,” it is
plain that in this case that Government did bear such cost within the meaning
of that condition; and this is sufficient for the purpose of deciding the
present question.

Quaere, as to
the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the appeal (on noting the language
of the relevant provisions—ss. 1 and 6 of c. 226, R.S.N.S. 1923, under which
the Reference was made to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and s. 43 of the Supreme
Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 35)

[Page 405]

APPEAL by the Attorney-General of the
Province of Nova Scotia from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in
banco[1],
holding that the amount of certain fines which the Provincial Treasurer of Nova
Scotia claimed should be paid over to him by the City of Halifax or the
Treasurer of the City of Halifax under s. 1036 of the Criminal Code, and
which claim was referred to that Court by order in council under and by virtue
of R.S.N.S. 1923, c. 226 (Of the Decision of Constitutional and Other
Provincial Questions), was not payable over to the Provincial Treasurer
under s. 1036 of the Criminal Code in the circumstances set forth in the
statement of facts contained in the order in council, but that the same was
payable to the Minister of Finance of Canada.

The material facts are sufficiently stated in
the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. The appeal
to this Court was dismissed.

J. H. MacQuarrie K.C. for the appellant.

H. P. MacKeen K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of Duff C.J., Rinfret, Kerwin and
Hudson JJ. was delivered by

Rinfret J.—By order in council dated the 12th day of June, 1936, the
Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia, by and with the advice of the Executive
Council of Nova Scotia, and acting under chapter 226 of the Revised Statutes of
Nova Scotia 1923 (Entitled: “Of the Decision of Constitutional and other Provincial
Questions”), referred this matter to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for
hearing and consideration.

The Provincial Treasurer claims that the amount
of certain fines hereinafter mentioned should be paid over to him by the City
of Halifax, or the Treasurer of that city, under section 103G of the Criminal
Code; and the question to be decided in this appeal is whether the fines in
question belong to the Province, represented by the Provincial Treasurer, or to
the Dominion of Canada, represented by the Minister of Finance, under the
following circumstances set forth in the order in council:

[Page 406]

On the 10th day of June, 1935, an information
was laid in the city of Halifax, before a justice of the peace in and for the
county of Halifax, by Frank E. McGowran, a corporal of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, on the instructions of the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police at the instance of the Department of National Revenue of the
Government of Canada.

The information and complaint were to the effect
that certain persons therein named and domiciled respectively in the provinces
of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island had, at Halifax and
elsewhere, between the 1st day of January, 1927, and the 8th day of June, 1935,
conspired together and with one another to commit the following offences:

1. The indictable offence of having in
their possession without lawful authority spirits unlawfully imported contrary
to section 181 of the Excise Act 1927, and section 169 of the Excise
Act, 1934, and section 573 of the Criminal Code of Canada.

2. The indictable offences of harbouring,
keeping, concealing, purchasing and selling without lawful excuse alcoholic
liquor unlawfully imported into Canada of a value for duty exceeding two
hundred dollars, to wit, of a value of upwards of one millions dollars, without
paying the duties lawfully payable thereon contrary to section 217 (3) of the Customs
Act, 1927, and section 573 of the Criminal Code of Canada.

3. The indictable offence of smuggling and
clandestinely introducing into Canada alcoholic liquor subject to Customs Duty
of a value for duty of over two hundred dollars, to wit, of a value of upwards
of one million dollars, contrary to section 203 (3) of the Customs Act as
amended, and section 573 of the Criminal Code of Canada.

4. The indictable offence of by deceit or
falsehood or other fraudulent means defrauding His Majesty the King in the
Right of the Dominion of Canada of Customs and Excise duties to the extent of
upwards of one million dollars.

The several persons charged in this information
appeared before the justice of the peace in the city of Halifax to answer the
charge; and a preliminary inquiry was held, as a result of which they were
committed to the common gaol at the city of Halifax for trial on the said
charge.

At the preliminary inquiry, the prosecution was
conducted by counsel for the informant on instructions of the Department of
National Revenue.

The persons charged were subsequently admitted
to bail by a judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. On the application for
bail counsel appeared on behalf of the informant, again on the instructions of
the Department of National Revenue. On that occasion, the assistant to the

[Page 407]

prosecuting officer for the county of Halifax appeared on behalf of the
Attorney-General of Nova Scotia.

Later on, on the 27th day of September, 1935,
the persons charged surrendered to the keeper of the common gaol and applied to
a judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for writs of habeas corpus and
recipias corpus to bring them before the stipendiary magistrate in and
for the city of Halifax. On the application for these writs both the
prosecuting officer for the county of Halifax appeared on behalf of the
Attorney-General of Nova Scotia and counsel appeared on behalf of the informant
on instructions of the Department of National Revenue.

The writs were granted, and by virtue thereof
the accused were brought before the stipendiary magistrate and charged with the
offence set forth in the information (then amended as will be mentioned later).
They consented to be tried before the stipendiary magistrate under Part XVI of
the Criminal Code. The amendment to the information consisted in
striking off paragraphs 2 and 3 the words: “to wit, of a value of upwards of
one million dollars”; thus leaving the “value for duty” of the alcoholic liquor
unlawfully imported, or introduced, into Canada as exceeding two hundred
dollars, without stating any definite amount. The information was further
amended by striking out paragraph 4 thereof.

The accused pleaded guilty and they were
convicted and adjudged to be imprisoned for terms varying in length, and also
to forfeit and pay certain fines to be “applied according to law,” the
aggregate of which amounted to $16,000.

At the trial, the prosecuting officer appeared
on behalf of the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia, and counsel appeared on
behalf of the informant on the instructions of the Department of National
Revenue.

The fines imposed by the stipendiary magistrate
were paid to the Treasurer of the City of Halifax, who has since held the same;
and, in effect, the question submitted to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was:
To whom, of the Provincial Treasurer or of the Minister of Finance of Canada,
the amount of the fines should now be paid over by the Treasurer of the City of
Halifax?

The judges of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia
were unanimous in the opinion that the amount of the fines were

[Page 408]

not payable over to the Provincial Treasurer
under section 1036 of the Criminal Code, in the circumstances set forth
in the statement of facts contained in the order in council; but that the same
were payable to the Minister of Finance. Their reasons, however, for reaching
that conclusion differed in the following respects: The Chief Justice (Mr.
Justice Carroll and Mr. Justice Doull concurring) was of opinion that the fines
should go to the Dominion Government, both because they have been “imposed in
respect of the breach of the revenue laws of Canada” and also because they were
imposed “in a proceeding instituted at the instance of the Government of
Canada, or of a department thereof, in which that Government bore the cost of
prosecution.” Mr. Justice Ross (with whom Mr. Justice Hall concurred), while
sharing the opinion on the second point and, therefore, on the result, stated
that he was “not prepared at the moment to agree that the fines were imposed in
respect of a breach of the revenue laws of Canada.”

The matter is now referred to us under section
43 of the Supreme Court Act, in view of the fact that, by section 6 of
chapter 226 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1923, the opinion of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia upon the reference, although advisory only, is,
for all purposes of appeal to this Court, to “ be treated as a final judgment
of the court between parties.”

The answer to the question put by the
Lieutenant-Governor in Council of Nova Scotia must result from the
interpretation of the first paragraph of section 1036 of the Criminal Code.

That paragraph is as follows:

1036. Whenever no other provision is made
by any law of Canada for the application of any fine, penalty or forfeiture
imposed for the violation of any law or of the proceeds of an estreated
recognizance, the same shall be paid over by the magistrate or officer
receiving the same to the treasurer of the province in which the same is
imposed or recovered, except that

(a) all fines, penalties and
forfeitures imposed in respect of the breach of any of the revenue laws of
Canada, or imposed upon any officer or employee of the Government of Canada in
respect of any breach of duty or malfeasance in his office or employment, and
the proceeds of all recognizances estreated in connection with proceedings for
the prosecution of persons charged with such breaches or malfeasances; and

(b) all fines, penalties and
forfeitures imposed for whatever cause in any proceeding instituted at the
instance of the Government of

[Page 409]

Canada or of any department thereof in
which that Government beans the cost of prosecution, and the proceeds of all
recognizances estreated in connection with such proceedings, shall belong to
His Majesty for the public uses of Canada, and shall be paid by the magistrate
or officer receiving the same to the Minister of Finance and form part of the
Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada.

(N.B.—We omit the last part of the paragraph
which concerns exclusively the province of Ontario.)

By force of the enactment, as will be observed,
the general rule is that fines are payable over to the Treasurer of the
province. They belong to His Majesty for the public use of Canada, they are to be paid to the Minister
of Finance and to form part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada only in
some particular cases which are exceptions to the rule.

The Dominion government claims that the fines
here in question come within either of two of the exceptions prescribed in the
enactment. It is contended by the Attorney-General of Canada that they were “
imposed in respect of the breach of any of the revenue laws of Canada,” and
that they were “imposed * * * in a proceeding instituted at the instance of the
Government of Canada or of a department thereof in which that Government bore
the cost of prosecution.” The Dominion, to succeed, must establish that the
fines came within one of the exceptions mentioned; but, on the other hand, the
Province cannot succeed unless it is able to eliminate both exceptions.

For that reason, we find it sufficient to
examine the question submitted in its relation to the second exception relied
on by the Attorney-General of Canada. Our reason for doing so is obvious: it
was the ground upon which all the learned judges of the Supreme Court of Nova
Scotia agreed in their answers upon the reference; and, moreover, if we should
reach the same conclusion as they have, it becomes unnecessary to deal with the
respective claims of the parties in their relation with the first exception.

It is conceded that the proceeding as a result
of which the fines were imposed was instituted at the instance of a department
of the Government of Canada. It remains only to be seen whether it was a
proceeding in which “that Government bears the cost of prosecution,” within the
meaning of subsection (b) of section 1036.

[Page 410]

The order in council states in terms that “no
disbursements in connection with the said prosecution have been made by the
Province of Nova Scotia or by the municipality of the county of Halifax.” It is
also therein stated that the fees of counsel who appeared on behalf of the
informant on instructions of the Department of National Revenue, the amount of
the account of the stenographer for taking shorthand notes of the evidence on
the preliminary inquiry and for transcribing the same, and any other costs,
fees, charges or expenses there may have been in connection with the said
prosecution, were paid direct to the parties concerned also by the same
Department of National Revenue. This Department likewise paid direct to them
the sums of money required to the witnesses for the prosecution on the preliminary
inquiry, or to the justice of the peace for fees and allowances claimed by him
for his services in respect of the preliminary inquiry. No claim or demand by
or on behalf of the witnesses or of the justice of the peace was ever made to
the Treasurer of the municipality of the County of Halifax.

But, on behalf of the Province, the
Attorney-General of Nova Scotia points out that, of course, the services of the
prosecuting officer and those of the stipendiary magistrate were not paid by
the Dominion Government. It is further asserted that, although the fees and
allowances claimed by the justice of the peace and the witnesses’ fees were
paid by the Dominion, that was on the latter’s part a purely voluntary and
gratuitous payment, because these fees, charges and expenses are already
provided for in a provincial statute, The Costs and Fees Act (ch. 252 of
the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1923); and that such fees and charges were
never certified to be correct, nor produced and presented to the Treasurer of
the municipality of the county of Halifax in the manner prescribed in the
schedule to Part II of that provincial statute; whereas, if the prescriptions
of that statute had been followed by the justice of the peace and the
witnesses, their fees and charges would have been met and paid as provided for
therein.

The respective rights of the parties, however,
must be determined in accordance with the true construction of the section of
the Criminal Code which applies; they cannot be made to depend upon what
may have happened in this

[Page 411]

particular instance. It may not be left to the
option of one party to act in a certain way and later to claim the fines on the
strength of the procedure it has elected to follow. The answer which the court
must give must flow essentially from the language of the statute. And when the
statute enacts that the fines are to belong to the Government of Canada in a
proceeding “in which that Government bears the cost of prosecution,” that
language does not relate to what may take place in a particular prosecution.

The phrase in the enactment: “in which that
Government bears the cost of prosecution” connotes something broader than the
mere casual occurrence of the payment of the costs in an individual case; it
implies a consistent course of action sanctioned by law or by custom.

Moreover, the words “cost of prosecution” which,
so it is enacted, the “Government bears” are necessarily referable to cost
specially incurred in connection with the proceeding it has instituted and
resulting in the imposition of the fines which, under the exception, become
payable to the Minister of Finance.

For that reason, the fact that the trial was
presided over by a stipendiary magistrate, who is not paid by the Government of
Canada; or the participation of the prosecuting officer and his assistant, who
are not paid by that Government, does not affect the situation. The magistrate
and the prosecuting officer are receiving their remuneration annually either
from the municipality or from the Government of Nova Scotia; and, when acting
in the premises, they are doing so merely as part of their regular duties; they
were not paid specifically in connection with the prosecution with which we are
concerned, or with the proceeding herein instituted at the instance of the
Government of Canada.

It cannot be questioned, as stated moreover in
the order in council, that all the “costs, fees, charges or expenses there may
have been in connection with the said prosecution” have been incurred and paid
by the Government of Canada, and the question is whether they were costs which
the Government of Canada bore within the meaning of section 1036.

[Page 412]

Whether the stipendiary magistrate could or
could not have ordered the costs to be paid otherwise, it is sufficient to note
that, in the convictions adjudging the payment of the fines, no order was made
as to costs.

We have said that subs. (b) implied a
consistent course of action sanctioned by law or custom. As to the law, there
are no provisions in the Criminal Code expressly dealing with the matter
in issue. Of The Costs and Fees Act of Nova Scotia, it is sufficient to
say that, in our view, its existence cannot affect the construction, nor
preclude the true effect, of section 1036 of the Criminal Code, which is
essentially federal legislation. As to custom or practice, it cannot be doubted
that the Government of Canada had full right to institute the proceedings and
to conduct the prosecution before the court.

The provinces establish and maintain the
ordinary criminal courts and, for this reason alone, we think that the costs of
prosecution referred to in section 1036 of the Criminal Code must be of
a character apart from the ordinary costs of maintenance of these courts.

As stated by Chief Justice Chisholm in his reasons
for judgment in the present case:

It has always been the practice to permit
counsel for the Government of Canada to act in revenue eases, nominally under
the Attorney-General of the Province. The Attorney-General has the nominal, the
counsel for the Government of Canada has the virtual conduct of such
prosecutions. In no other way can the revenues of Canada be adequately or at
all protected unless the Dominion is represented and given the conduet of the
case.

We have no doubt that this statement of the learned
Chief Justice, concurred in by the other judges of the court, rightly
represents the situation.

In our view, the costs of prosecution in this
case are such as would usually and properly be borne by the Dominion of Canada
and, moreover, they here in fact were borne by the Dominion of Canada. For
these reasons, we think that the amount of the fines in question is not payable
to the Provincial Treasurer but is payable to the Minister of Finance of
Canada.

The appeal should, therefore, be dismissed. There
will be no order as to costs.

[Page 413]

Davis J.—I agree that this appeal should be dismissed, but it is
sufficient, in my opinion, to rest that conclusion upon the sole ground that
the particular facts stated in the Reference satisfy the condition of section
1036 (b) of the Criminal Code that the Government of Canada “bears
the cost of prosecution,” it being admitted that the proceedings were
instituted at the instance of a department of that Government.

The facts are not in dispute. It is stated in
the Reference that the information was laid by a member of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police on the instructions of the Commissioner at the instance of the
Department of National Revenue of the Government of Canada; that the
preliminary inquiry before a Justice of the Peace in the City of Halifax
extended to eleven days during the months of July and August, 1935; that at the
said preliminary inquiry the prosecution was conducted by two counsel for the
informant, on instructions of the said Department of National Revenue; that on
the application before a Judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia of the
several accused for bail, counsel appeared on behalf of the informant, on the
instructions of the said department, and that an assistant to the prosecuting
officer for the County of Halifax (receiving an annual salary from the
Government of Nova Scotia) appeared on behalf of the Attorney-General of Nova
Scotia; that subsequently on the return of writs of habeas corpus, counsel
appeared on behalf of the informant, on instructions of the said department,
and the prosecuting officer for the County of Halifax appeared on behalf of the
Attorney-General of Nova Scotia; that at the trial counsel appeared on behalf
of the informant, on instructions of the said department, and the said
prosecuting officer for the County of Halifax appeared on behalf of the
Attorney-General of Nova Scotia; that no disbursements in connection with the
said prosecution have been made by the Province of Nova Scotia or by the
Municipality of the County of Halifax, but the said prosecuting officer was
receiving an annual salary from the Provincial Government; that the fees of
counsel for the informant in connection with the said prosecution and the
amounts of the account of a stenographer for taking shorthand notes of the
evidence on the said preliminary inquiry and 

[Page 414]

transcribing the same, and any other costs,
fees, charges or expenses there may have been in connection with the said
prosecution (other than those prescribed in the Schedule to Part II of The
Costs and Fees Act, ch. 252 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1923)
were paid direct to the parties concerned by the said Department of National
Revenue; that the said department paid sums of money direct to the witnesses
for the prosecution on the said preliminary inquiry, as fees claimed by them
and prescribed in the said Schedule to said Part II of The Costs and Fees
Act for their travel and actual attendance; that the said Department of
National Revenue paid sums of money direct to the said Justice of the Peace as
the fees and allowances claimed by him and prescribed in the said Schedule to
said Part II of The Costs and Fees Act, for his services in respect of
the said preliminary inquiry.

Without attempting to define the full scope and
extent of the statutory condition that the Government of Canada “bears the cost
of prosecution,” it is plain, I think, in this case that the Government of
Canada bore the cost of the prosecution within the contemplation of the
statutory condition. It would, in my opinion, entirely defeat the object of the
provision of sec. 1036 (b) if the facts of this case were held not to
come within the language of the provision. That being so, there is no necessity
to consider whether or not the Dominion could recover by virtue of the
provision of sec. 1036 (a).

As the appeal is to be dismissed, it is not
necessary to discuss the question of the jurisdiction of this Court to
entertain the appeal, but it may be observed that sec. 43 of the Supreme
Court Act gives a right of appeal to this Court

from an opinion pronounced by the highest
court of final resort in any province on any matter referred to it for hearing
and consideration by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of such province
whenever it has been by the statutes of the said province declared that such
opinion is to be deemed a judgment of the said highest court of final resort
and that an appeal shall lie therefrom as from a judgment in an action.

The provincial statute under which this
Reference was made by the Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia in Council to the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia is chapter 226 of the Revised Statutes of Nova
Scotia, 1923. The relevant sections, 1 and 6, are as follows:

[Page 415]

1. The Governor in Council may refer to the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, for hearing or consideration, any matter which he
thinks fit to refer, and the court shall thereupon hear and consider the same.

6. The opinion of the court upon any such
reference, although advisory only, shall, for all purposes of appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada, or to His Majesty in Council, be treated as a final
judgment of the court between parties.

Had we reached a different conclusion on the
merits of this appeal, the question of the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain
the appeal would have presented some difficulty.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Offence of stealing a “post
letter” from a “post office”— Meaning—Construction—Provincial “parliamentary
post office”— Criminal Code, sections 6 and 324—Post Office Act, R.S.C., 1927,
c. 161, ss. 2 (h, j, l), 4, 7, 35, 39, 101—Criminal Code, section 364.

The appellant was charged, under section 364
of the Criminal Code, with having stolen “une lettre dans le bureau de poste du
Parlement” in the city of Quebec. He was found guilty and the conviction was
affirmed by a majority of the appellate court. The appeal in this Court was as
to the proper construction of section 364 of the Criminal Code.

Held, Duff C
J. and Davis J. dissenting, that the appeal should be allowed and the
conviction quashed.

Per Cannon J.—The control and responsibility
of the Dominion post office authorities over the stolen letter ceased from the
moment that it was delivered in the main post office to the representative of
the provincial authorities.—In law, the letter was abstracted after it
had been delivered to the duly constituted agents of the provincial authorities
and it had passed out of the control of the Dominion post office: the
abstraction took place when it was no more a “post letter” or “lettre confiée à la poste.”

Per Crocket
J.—The parliamentary post office (bureau de poste du Parlement) was not a
“bureau de poste” within the meaning of section 364 of the Criminal Code; and,
also, the stolen letter was not a “lettre confiée à la poste” at the
time of the theft in the sense of that expression as given in section 2 of the Post
Office Act. The letter at that time was neither in a “post office” nor
“being carried through the post,” the Post Office Department’s control and
responsibility of and for it having ceased upon its delivery at the so-called
“bureau de poste” which was officered and operated by appointees of the
Provincial Government entirely at the latter’s expense and over which neither
the Quebec city post office nor the Post Office Department of Canada had any
control.

Per Kerwin
J.—The parliamentary post office was not a “post office” within the meaning of
section 2 (l) of the Post Office Act. A “post office” means any
building * * * where any letter which may be sent by post is received * * *;
and it cannot have been intended that any letter which may be sent by post is in
a post office unless it is in a building * * * which is under the
control of the Postmaster-General as part of the postal service of Canada. Upon
the evidence, the quarters in the Legislative Assembly building in Quebec, set
aside by the provincial authorities cannot be said to be part of the postal
service of Canada, even though what was done was by the consent or authority of
the Postmaster-General.

[Page 33]

Per Duff C.J.
and Davis J. (dissenting).—Upon the evidence and in view of the findings of the
trial judge, the officials of the Parliamentary Post Office, in all their
activities, in undertaking to receive, collect send or deliver letters and in
receiving, collecting sending, delivering letters and having in possession
letters for the purpose of so conveying and delivering them, were acting under
the authority of the Postmaster-General. The Parliamentary Post Office was a
post office established by the Postmaster-General in exercise of his powers
(section 7) under the Post Office Act, and, therefore, a post office
within the contemplation of section 364 of the Criminal Code. Accordingly, the
letter in question in this case had not ceased to be a “post letter” within the
meaning of that section when it was abstracted by the appellant.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, dismissing his
appeal, by a majority of the Court, from his conviction by J. H. Fortier J.
after a summary trial for having stolen a “post letter” from a “post office” contrary to the provisions of section 364 of the
Criminal Code.

F. Choquette K.C. for the appellant.

A. Rivard K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis J.
(dissenting) was delivered by

Duff C.J.—This appeal raises a question as to the scope of section 364 of
the Criminal Code under which it is an offence to steal a “post letter” from a
“post office.” The definition of “post office” in the Post Office Act is
a very broad one and comprises (inter alias) under that term all places
where “mailable matter” is “received or distributed, sorted, put up in packets
or despatched.”

The appellant was charged with having stolen a
“post letter” from the post office, which is generally referred to in the
record under the designation “the Parliamentary Post Office.” He was found
guilty. An appeal was taken to the Court of King’s Bench on various grounds.
Only two of them will require discussion; first, that, “on the evidence,” the
Legislative Post Office is not a “post office” within the meaning of section
364 of the Criminal Code; and, second, that the letter stolen was not a “post
letter” within the meaning of that section.

These questions, in my conception of the
evidence and of the findings of the trial judge, are, I am disposed to think,

[Page 34]

questions of mixed fact and law rather than of
law; and, moreover, I am disposed
to think that in substance the grounds of dissent in the Court of King’s Bench
are matters of mixed law and fact rather than matters of law. Since, however, I am satisfied that the appeal should
be dismissed on the merits, I shall
not further discuss the point of jurisdiction.

By section 6 of the Criminal Code:

In every case in which the offence dealt
with in this Act relates to the subject treated of in any other Act the words
and expressions used herein in respect to such offence shall have the meaning
assigned to them in such other Act.

and before proceeding to the facts, it is
convenient first of all to quote the precise terms of the definition of “post
office” contained in the Post Office Act. That definition is as follows:

2(1) “post office” means any building,
room, post office, railway car, street letter box, street stamp-vending box,
receiving box or other receptacle or place where post letters or other mailable
matter are received or delivered, sorted, made up or despatched.

By section 7
of the Act, the Postmaster-General has authority to,

“(a) establish
and close post offices and post routes.”

Since there is nothing in the context which
“otherwise requires,” it follows that “post office” here has the meaning
ascribed to the phrase in section 2(1); and,
in consequence, the Postmaster-General has authority under section 7 to establish a post office for
providing any one or more of the services mentioned in this definition.

By section 35,

Subject to the provisions and regulations
aforesaid, and the exceptions hereinafter made, the Postmaster-General shall
have the sole and exclusive privilege of conveying, receiving, collecting,
sending and delivering letters within Canada.

Our attention has not been called to anything in
the “provisions and regulations aforesaid” which qualifies the application of
this section in its bearing on this appeal. There is another section which
ought not to be overlooked. Section 101 is
in these words:

Every person who without the authority of
the Postmaster-General, the proof of which authority shall rest on such person,
places or permits or causes to be placed or to remain on his house or premises,
the words Post Office, or any other words or mark which imply or give
reasonable cause to believe that such house or premises is a post office or a
place for the receipt of letters, shall, on summary conviction, incur a penalty
not exceeding ten dollars for each offence.

[Page 35]

2. Any person who, otherwise than in
conformity with this Act, collects, sends, conveys or delivers, or undertakes
to collect, send, convey or deliver any letter within Canada, or receives or
has in his possession within Canada any letter for the purpose of so conveying
or delivering it, shall, for each and every letter so unlawfully collected,
sent, conveyed or delivered, or undertaken so to be, or found in his
possession, incur a penalty not exceeding twenty dollars.

The learned trial judge had before him a letter
addressed by the Deputy Postmaster-General to the Postmaster at Quebec, who
appears to have filled the role of Post Office Inspector for the city of
Quebec, dated the 12th of March, 1919. That letter was written in response to a
request made by the Legislative Assembly of Quebec “for the installation of a
House of Assembly Post Office” and authorized the inauguration of such a post
office, which I shall refer to hereafter as the Parliamentary Post Office. There
were departmental memoranda, apparently, indicating the character of the office
to be established which are not in evidence, but the letter, coupled with the
facts found by the trial judge, determines with sufficient accuracy for our
present purposes the character of it.

As to outgoing mail, the letter states:

Letters and other matter prepaid by postage
stamps would be stamped and “primary” sorted in the Legislative Assembly Post
Office. This mail would be sent in “lock” bags to the Quebec Post Office, where
it would be carefully looked over before being distributed for despatch * * *
All mail for despatch originating with any of the Provincial Departments should
be deposited in the Legislative Assembly Post Office.

As to incoming mail,

A duly authorized messenger representing
all the Legislative Assembly Departments would call at the Quebec Post Office
and sign for all registered mail for all the Departments, which he would
deliver as instructed to the several Departments located in the Legislative Assembly
building. The lock bag containing the ordinary mail would be sent to the
Legislative Assembly Post Office, where it would be distributed and messengers
from the various branches call at that post office for the mail.

* * *

Mails would be conveyed as often as
required by a courier with horse drawn vehicle, whose services would be paid
for by the Legislative Assembly.

Again,

* * * the Legislative Assembly Post Office
would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules and
regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada,

Now, this letter makes it quite clear that this
Parliamentary Post Office was established at the request of the Legislative
Assembly for the convenience of the Legislative Assembly and the Government
departments housed

[Page 36]

in the same building and their employees; and
that the intention of the letter is to give the authority of the
Postmaster-General to the establishment of such an office, where mail would be
received from the Quebec Post Office in one of the Departmental sacks; that
such sacks would be opened at the Parliamentary Post Office and the mail
contained therein distributed in the usual way to be called for and delivered
to persons to whom the mail might be addressed or to messengers of the
Departments. It was also contemplated that mailable matter prepaid by postage
stamps would be received and stamped with an official stamp of the usual
character and provisionally sorted in the Post Office and sent forward in an
official bag to the Quebec Post Office. It was contemplated, there can be no
doubt, that this Parliamentary Post Office would be used by all the members and
employees of the Legislature; as well as by the employees of the Departments.
The effect of the letter beyond doubt is to authorize the use of legends
indicating where mail would be received as such; where letters, for example,
properly stamped, would be collected and dealt with as mail.

The learned trial judge has found as a fact that
letters are registered in this Post Office; and it appears that, for a period
which ended in 1935, Post Office orders were issued.

The Parliamentary Post Office was to be, as the
letter states, under the control of an official designated as Postmaster and
there is evidence to the effect that this official receives from the Postmaster
of Quebec, who acts as inspector of the post offices in the city of Quebec, the
circular communications addressed to postmasters generally and communications
sent to him by the inspector are addressed to him as “The Postmaster of the Parliamentary
Post Office.” The letter of the Deputy Postmaster General, as we have seen,
makes it quite plain that the office is to be governed by the rules and
regulations of the Post Office Department.

It must have been fairly clear to anybody
reading the Post Office Act that a “post office” operated in the manner
contemplated would, in the absence of authority from the Postmaster-General,
infringe the Post Office Act; and, on the evidence, the learned judge
was entitled to start from the premise that the Parliamentary Post Office

[Page 37]

was in fact established and operated under such
authority. He has, indeed, found as a fact that the Postmaster of the central
post office in Quebec gives instructions and governs and directs the
administration of the Parliamentary Post Office and that this is done
conformably to the control of this post office by the Postmaster-General and to
the circumstance that it is subject to the departmental regulations.

I concur with the following observations of Mr.
Justice St. Jacques:

L’établissement des bureaux de poste
nécessaires au service des postes relève entièrement du Ministre, et l’on sait
que les députés ministres sont particulièrement préposés à l’application des
détails de la loi.

C’est dans l’exercice des pouvoirs qui sont
confiés au ministère des Postes par les articles 35 et 39 de la loi que ce
bureau particulier a été établi dans l’édifice du Gouvernement provincial.

Il est évident que le ministre des Postes,
représenté par le sous-ministre, n’a pas voulu que ce bureau ait le caractère
complet et absolu des bureaux de poste ordinaires qui sont établis un peu
partout dans les cités, suivant les besoins du service des Postes. On a voulu
que ce bureau soit simplement un “clearing-house” oui seraient transportées par
un messager dûment autorisé par le Gouvernement provincial toutes les lettres
adressées aux divers services du Gouvernement provincial et qui sont reçues au
bureau de poste principal établi dans la cité de Québec, sur la rue Buade.

Il est prévu à ce document, émis par le
sous-ministre des Postes en 1919, que le sac fermé contenant le courrier
ordinaire serait envoyé au bureau de poste de l’Assemblée Législative où les
lettres seraient distribuées, et les messagers des différents services du
Gouvernement Provincial pourraient recevoir à ce bureau les lettres qui y
parviennent.

Il faut retenir de ce document la phrase
suivante:

“In brief, the Legislative Assembly Post
Office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules
and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada.”

Il est évident que des bureaux semblables
existent dans d’autres parties du pays, puisque le sous-ministre dit:

“The office would not be a postal station,
but a clearing house, similar to that conducted by the Federal Parliament and
applicable to the various Legislative Assemblies.”

Jusqu’à 1935, le ministère des Postes
permettait aux employés de ce bureau d’émettre des mandats et des bons
de poste, tout comme on le fait dans les bureaux de poste réguliers Ce privilège
a été supprimé par le ministère des Postes en 1935.

La recommandation des lettres peut se faire
au “bureau de poste du Parlement” qui perçoit le coût de cette recommandation.

Il importe peu, me semble-t-il, que les
employés qui travaillent dans ce bureau de poste soient engagés et payé par le
Gouvernement provincial. C’est à cette condition que le ministère des Postes a
consenti à l’établissement dans l’édifice du Gouvernement provincial d’un tel
bureau.

Ce bureau est-il régulier ou non, au sens
absolu de la loi? Ce n’en est pas moins un bureau de poste où l’on reçoit des
lettres qui ont été

[Page 38]

confiées à, la poste et où l’on reçoit
également des lettres pour être confiées a la poste.

There was evidence, I repeat, before the trial
judge from which he might not improperly conclude that the officials of the
Parliamentary Post Office, the postmaster and others, in all their activities,
in undertaking to receive, collect, send or deliver letters and in receiving,
collecting, sending, delivering letters and having in possession letters for
the purpose of so conveying and delivering them, were acting under the
authority of the Postmaster-General; and I think Mr. Justice St. Jacques is on
solid ground in holding that, in view of the evidence and of the findings of
the trial judge, the Parliamentary Post Office was a post office established by
the Postmaster-General in exercise of his powers under the Post Office Act and,
therefore, a post office within the contemplation of section 364 of the
Criminal Code. It is a post office within the scope, as I think, of section 7
and constituted as such by the authority of the Postmaster-General. Such being
the case, it follows necessarily in my view that the letter in question had not
ceased to be a “post letter” within the meaning of section 364 when it was
abstracted by the appellant. Admittedly, it was in the Parliamentary Post
Office among a number of other letters in process of being distributed when the
abstraction occurred.

It was contended before us on behalf of the
appellant that the delivery of the post bag to the courier whose duty it was to
take the bag from the Quebec Post Office to the Parliamentary Post Office was a
delivery to the person to whom the letter was addressed. The dissenting judges
in the court below appear to have taken the view that the latter was not
delivered until it reached the Parliamentary Post Office. The trial judge was
entitled to find, however, as a fact, and in effect did so find, that the
courier was acting under the authority of the Post-master-General in carrying
an official bag from one post office to another post office and that there was
no delivery to the addressee.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Cannon J.—In his factum, the respondent states the point to be decided by
us as follows:

The Court of King’s Bench did not come to
the same understanding upon the words “post letter.” Whilst the majority
asserted that the

[Page 39]

letter, at the time of its withdrawal by
the appellant, was still “in transit,” the dissentient minority claimed that at
that time it was already in the hands of he to whom it was addressed, or at
least that it should be considered so.

Thus this is the disputable point, at the
time of the theft, which is not doubted, was the above described letter still,
yes or no, a “post letter” in the meaning of the law?

Under the provisions of the Act respecting the
postal service, R.S.C., c. 161, section 2, par. (j),

“Post letter” means any letter transmitted by the post or delivered through
the post, or deposited in any post office, or in any letter box put up anywhere
under the authority of the Postmaster-General, whether such letter is addressed
to a real or a fictitious person or not, and whether it is intended for
transmission by the post or delivery through the post or not; and a letter
shall be deemed a post letter from the time of its being so deposited to the
time of its being delivered to the person to whom it is addressed, or so
long as it remains in the post office or in any such letter box or is being
carried through the post; and a delivery to any person authorized by the
Postmaster-General to receive letters for the post shall be deemed a delivery
at the post office, and a delivery of any letter or other mailable matter at
the house or office of the person to whom the letter is addressed, or to him,
or to his servant, or agent, or other person considered to be
authorized to receive the letter or other mailable matter, according to the
usual manner of delivering that person’s letters, shall be a delivery to
the person addressed.”

Exhibit P2 concerning the organization of the
post office at the Parliament contains the following about the delivery of the
mail addressed to the Parliament Buildings:

Mails will be conveyed as often as required
by a courier with horse drawn vehicle, whose services would be paid for by the
Legislative Assembly.

* * *

The Legislative Assembly Post Office would
be conducted without any expense whatever to the Post Office Department of
Canada, and there would be no account for the purchase of stamps in view of the
fact that stamps would be purchased as hereinbefore mentioned.

In brief, the Legislative Assembly Post
Office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules
and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada. It would be operated
and officered by clerks appointed by authority of the Legislative Assembly, who
would obtain supplies of postage stamps from the City post office and postal
stations, or from stamp vendors or sub-offices of their own choosing, conveying
the mail bags both ways between the Quebec Post Office and the Legislative
Assembly, without expense to the Post Office Department of Canada in any way.

An office of this nature would not be
recognized as a regular post office, being simply a clearing house, as the
Department could not undertake to establish either a sub-office or a regular
office in a separate institution such as Provincial Government building, as all
post offices have to be for the service of the general public, and under the direct
control of the Department. Letters and other matter prepaid by postage
stamps would be stamped and “primary” sorted in the Legislative

[Page 40]

Assembly Post Office. This mail would be
sent in “lock” bags to the Quebec Post Office, where it would be carefully
looked over before being distributed for despatch.

A fully authorized messenger representing
all the Legislative Assembly Departments would call at the Quebec Post Office
and sign for all registered mail for all the Departments which he would
deliver as instructed to the several departments located in the Legislative
Assembly Building. The lock bag containing the ordinary mail would be sent
to the Legislative Assembly Post Office, where it would be distributed and
messengers from the various branches call at that post office for the mail.

Exhibit D1 contains the regulation as to the
distribution of correspondence:

Art. 246. Distribution des correspondances.

La responsabilité du ministère au sujet
d’un objet quelconque de correspondance cesse lorsquei la distribution en a été
effectuée, soit au destinaire, soit à une personne dûment autorisée à
recevoir sa correspondance, ou à une personne aux soins de qui cet
objet était adressé, et le ministère ne peut entreprendre de faire des
recherches relativement au traitement dudit objet lorsqu’il en a disposé
régulièrement.

Now, as to what happened to the letter addressed
to J. P. Bergeron, we have the evidence of the postmaster, J. B. L. Morin, who
is the Federal official in charge of the main post office and of all the
stations within the city of Quebec. Here is what he
says:

Q. Maintenant, M. Morin, voulez-vous dire
à quel endroit se fait la délivrance des lettres destinées au
Parlement de Québec?

R. Nous livronsi la malle au représentant
officiel du Parlement provincial, qui vient quatre fois par jour chercher la
malle au bureau de poste de Québec.

Q. A quel endroit?

R. A l’intérieur du bureau.

Q. De votre bureau de poste à vous?

R. Au bureau chef, à l’intérieur
du bureau.

Q. A la rue Buade?

R. A la rue Buade, au même endroit que
toutes les autres malles. C’est remis par le département de l’expédition.

Q. C’est là que vous faites votre
délivrance?

R. Oui.

La Cour:

Q. Au bureau central?

R. Au bureau central, M. le Juge.

Me Choquette C.R.

Q. Et une fois que cette délivrance est
faite par votre bureau de poste aux employés du gouvernement provincial,
avez-vous encore un control sur ces lettres, sur cette malle et ces courriers?

R. Non. Nous n’avons aucun contrôle, mais
nous coopérons avec le . . .

Q. Avez-vous des employés qui travaillent
au Parlement, du ministère des postes? R. Aucun.

* * *

[Page 41]

La Cour:

Q. On vous demande si, parce que cela n’est
pas compris dans la liste, vous pensez, vous êtes sous l’impressioni que ce
n’est pas un bureau de poste?

R. Je suis de l’opinion que ce n’est pas un
bureau de poste officiel.

* * *

Q. Où est-ce que cette lettre-là a été
délivrée par les autorités postales?

R. Dans leur paquet de malle destiné
au Parlement Provincial.

Q. A quel endroit l’avez-vous delivrée?

R. On l’a delivrée ici, au bureau de poste

It would, therefore, appear that delivery took
place and was completed, as contemplated by Dr. Coulter’s letter within the
central post office when the duly authorized messenger took out the parcel of
letters addressed to the Parliament Building. The dissenting judges, however,
seem to have reached the opinion that delivery took place only after it reached
Parliament and that it was still under the control of the Dominion authorities
between the main post office and the Parliament Building. This does not agree,
in my opinion, with the facts as they appear by the evidence of Morin, the only
person who really knows about the exact relationship in actual practice between
the Dominion Postal Service and the Parliament distribution office. I would say
that the control and responsibility of the Dominion post office authorities on
this particular letter ceased from the moment that it was delivered in the main
post office to the representative of the provincial authorities. Although my
views do not agree fully with the dissenting judges in appeal, as to the time
and place where delivery took place, I agree with them on the construction of
the statutory definition of “post letter.” For slightly different reasons, the
same conclusion is reached, to wit: in law, the letter was abstracted after it
had been delivered

[Page 42]

to the duly constituted agents of the provincial
authorities and it had passed out of the control of the Dominion Post Office;
the abstraction took place when it was no more a “post letter,” or “lettre
confiée à la poste.”

I am of opinion that the conviction should be
quashed and the appeal allowed.

Crocket J.—This is an appeal under s. 1023 of the Criminal Code from a
majority judgment of the Court of King’s Bench of the province of Quebec
affirming a conviction made against the appellant in the Court of Sessions of
the Peace for the theft of a letter containing money “dans le bureau de poste
du Parlement” in the city of Quebec contrary to the provisions of s. 364 of the
Criminal Code. Dorion and Galipeault JJ. were the dissenting judges.

When the appeal came on for hearing in this
court Mr. Rivard for the Crown in pursuance of notice objected to the court’s
jurisdiction to entertain it on the ground that the dissent in the court below
was not on a question of law as provided by s. 1023 of the Criminal Code, and
moved to quash the appeal for that reason. As this objection appeared to
involve a consideration of the grounds of the appeal itself, the learned Chief
Justice suggested that it would be more convenient to allow the appeal to
proceed and hear counsel on the merits as well as on the jurisdictional
objection. The motion to quash and the appeal itself were, therefore, argued
together.

As to the motion to quash, Mr. Rivard contended
that the record of the dissent appearing in the entry of the formal judgment of
the court, under the provisions of s. 1013 of the Criminal Code, shewed on its
face that it was a dissent on a question of fact or on a question of mixed law
and fact.

This entry stated that Judges Dorion and
Galipeault dissented, holding that the charge of theft of a post letter is not
proven, and that the evidence only discloses theft of a sum of $1.50, entailing
a maximum penalty of six months.

While it may very well be said, if one looks
Only at the statement “that the charge of theft of a post letter is not
proven,” that it may indicate a dissent upon a pure question of fact of a mixed
question of law and fact, the

[Page 43]

words which immediately follow would seem to me
to shew that the real basis of the dissent was that the theft which the
evidence disclosed as having been committed by the defendant was not the theft
of a post letter within the meaning of s. 364 of the Criminal Code, for which he
would be liable to a minimum penalty of three years under the provisions of
that section.

However this may be, there seems to be no doubt
that this court will look at the notes or written reasons of dissenting judges,
and whenever necessary at the notes or reasons of the majority judges or any
other portion of the record to ascertain the real grounds upon which any
dissent is based, if the formal judgment of the court omits to state these
grounds specifically or fails to make them clear.

An examination of the written reasons for both
the majority and the dissenting judgments in the present case makes it quite
clear, as I read them, that the only question considered in the court below was
whether upon the undisputed facts disclosed by the evidence the Bureau de Poste
du Parlement, where the letter was stolen, was a “bureau de poste” or the
letter the appellant was charged with stealing there a “lettre confiée à la
poste” within the meaning of s. 364 of the French version of the Criminal Code
or s. 2 (the interpretation section) of the Canada Post Office Act.

St. Jacques J., who, having been deputed by the
court for the purpose, signed the formal judgment containing the ground of
dissent as above stated, sets out in his own notes four grounds on which the
appeal was heard. All these he describes as “motifs de droit,” and states that
the facts are not in dispute. After pointing out, as to the first two grounds
relied on by the appellant, viz.: (1) The Bureau de Poste du Parlement was not
upon the evidence “un bureau de poste au sens de la loi,” (2) The letter the
appellant was charged with having stolen was not upon the evidence “une lettre’
confiée à la poste’ au sens de la loi,” that they were in effect one and the
same, His Lordship said that there was, therefore, only one point to be decided
on the appeal, i.e., “au sujet du sens qu’il faut donner, au regard de la loi,
aux mots lettre confiée a la poste.” He held, not only that the stolen letter
fell within the definition of a “lettre confiee a la poste” given

[Page 44]

in the interpretation section of the Canada Post
Office Act because it had been posted the previous day in the Quebec City
Post Office and was stolen before it had reached the addressee or other person
authorized to receive it for him, but also that the “Bureau de Poste du
Parlement,” though not a regular post office, fell within the definition of
“Bureau de poste” given in the same section of that Act as a place where
“lettres confiées à la poste” are received.

Létourneau J., in his notes, confirmed the
conviction for the reason that the bureau, where the letter was stolen, was a
“bureau de poste” in the sense which the Canada Post Office Act gives to
these words since that office was undoubtedly a place where “lettres confiées à
la poste” or other mailable matter were distributed, sorted, etc., within the
meaning of that statute.

Walsh J. concurred with the latter and the
accused’s appeal was, therefore, dismissed for the reasons indicated.

Dorion and Galipeault JJ. dissented from these
conclusions of the majority judges on the ground that the accused stole the
letter in a place which was not a “bureau de poste” and the letter not a
“lettre confiée à la poste,” within the meaning of the definition of these
expressions given in s. 2 of the Canada Post Office Act, for the reason
that upon the undisputed facts as disclosed by the evidence, the so-called
Parliament post office was officered and operated entirely by appointees of the
Quebec Provincial Government, over whom the Post Office Department of Canada
had no control, and that the letter in question, at the time it was stolen, had
ceased under the provisions of s. 2 of the Canada Post Office Act to be
a post letter within the meaning of that section.

Dorion J., in his notes, set out the provisions
of the Canada Post Office Act, which define “bureau de poste” and
“lettre confiée à la poste” as well as other provisions of that Act, and also
discussed a letter from the Deputy Postmaster-General under date of March 12,
1919, addressed to the then Postmaster of Quebec city regarding the request of
the Legislative Assembly for the installation of a post office in the
Parliament Building. This letter set forth the conditions under which the
proposed office should be instituted and the mail delivered from the Quebec city

[Page 45]

Post Office. Among the conditions stated were:
the proposed office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by
the rules and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada; that it
would be operated and officered by clerks appointed by authority of the
Legislative Assembly, who would obtain supplies of postage stamps from the city
post office and postal stations, etc., conveying the mail bags both ways
between the Quebec city Post Office and the Legislative Assembly without
expense to the Post Office Department of Canada in any way. The letter stated
that an office of this nature would not be recognized as a regular post office,
being simply a clearing house, as the Department could not undertake to
establish either a sub-office or a regular office in a separate institution
such as a Provincial Government building, as all post offices have to be for
the general service of the public and under the direct control of the
Department. It was also stated that a duly authorized messenger representing
all the Legislative Assembly departments would call at the Quebec city Post
Office and sign for all registered mail for all the departments, which he would
deliver as instructed to the several departments located in the Legislative
Assembly building; that the locked bag containing the ordinary mail would be
sent to the Legislative Assembly post office where it would be distributed and
messengers from the various branches call at that post office for the mail.

It is evident, therefore, that all the judges,
who heard the appeal in the Court of King’s Bench, treated the problem before
them, viz.: whether the accused was properly convicted of the offence with
which he was charged under s. 364 of the Criminal Code, as one which involved a
question or questions of law only inasmuch as all the facts relating thereto
were established by undisputed and undisputable evidence.

In my opinion they were right in doing so. No
question was involved on the appeal as to the weight or appreciation of
evidence by inference or otherwise as in Gauthier v. The King[1], where it was held by this court, assuming
that the question whether there was any evidence to support a conviction should
be deemed a question of law, the

[Page 46]

question whether the proper inference has been
drawn by the trial judge from facts established in evidence is really not a
question of law, but purely a question of fact for consideration. The
conviction of the appellant for the theft with which he was charged under s.
364 of the Criminal Code admittedly could not properly have been made if the
Bureau de Poste du Parlement was not a “bureau de poste” within the meaning of
that section of the Code and of the interpretation section of the Canada Post
Office Act, or if the letter he was charged with stealing, at the time of
the theft, was not a “lettre confiée à la poste” within the meaning of those
statutory provisions, no matter what inferences may have been drawn from
established facts as to the culpability of the appellant in respect of the
commission of the theft of the letter itself. As to whether the place where the
theft was in fact committed was or was not such a bureau de poste or the stolen
letter such a letter depends entirely on the interpretation of the statutory
provisions referred to. The letter of the Deputy Post master-General of March
12, 1919, was produced by the Crown on the trial as evidence of the conditions
under which the Bureau de Poste du Parlement was instituted and was to be
operated. As regards its meaning and effect upon the two vital issues involved
in the appeal that also was for the decision of the trial court as a question
of law. These two questions are manifestly in my judgment questions of law
alone, and two of the judges of the Court of King’s Bench having dissented from
the majority judgment upon them, I am of opinion that the appellant has a right
to a further appeal to this court under the provisions of s. 1023, and that the
motion to quash the appeal should be dismissed.

As to the merits of the appeal it is apparent
that s. 364 of the Criminal Code creates an offence which relates to the
conduct of the postal service of Canada and that in virtue of the provisions of
s. 6 of the Code the words “bureau de poste” and “lettre confiée à la poste”
must be given the meaning assigned to them by s. 2 of the Post Office Act, c.
161, R.S.C., 1927. I am of opinion that the definition of “bureau de poste”
given in par. (1) of that section as embodying “a place where post letters or
other mailable matter are received or delivered, sorted, made up

[Page 47]

or despatched” or, as the French version states
it, “un lieu où les lettres confiées à la poste ou autres objets transmissibles
sont reçus ou délivrés, distribués, triés, formés en paquets ou expédiés,” must
be taken as necessarily implying a bureau or place which is under the control
and supervision of the Post Office Department of Canada. Otherwise any room or
place in any large business establishment which manitains a staff for the
receipt, classification, distribution, delivery or despatch of any letters
brought to the establishment by its own employees or stamped and addressed for
transit through the regular postal service would constitute a post office
within the meaning of the Post Office Act and of s. 364 of the Criminal
Code. I am of opinion also that the definition in the same section of the Post
Office Act of the words “post letter,” or, as it is in the French version,
“lettre confiée à la poste” and the proviso that a letter shall be deemed a
post letter from the time of its being deposited in any post office “to the
time of its being delivered to the person to whom it is addressed, or so long
as it remains in the post office or in any such letter box or is being carried
through the post” shew that the intention was that no letter should be deemed a
post letter within the meaning of the Post Office Act unless it be in
the custody and control of some post office or branch of the postal service,
which is under the direct control of the Post Office Department of Canada.

Although the letter of March 12, 1919, from the
Deputy Postmaster-General to the Postmaster at Quebec regarding the agreement
for the establishment of the “bureau de poste du Parlement” says that that
office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules
and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada, its whole tenor, in my
judgment, shews that it is in no sense a post office in the true sense of the Post
Office Act, but simply a clearing house for the reception and distribution
of outgoing and incoming mail for the convenience of the Legislative Assembly
and the Departments of the Provincial Government situated in the Parliament
Building. Indeed the letter explicitly states that an office of this nature
would not be recognized as a regular post office, “as the Department could
not undertake to establish either a sub-

[Page 48]

office or a regular office in a separate
institution such as a Provincial Government building, as all post offices
have to be for the general service of the public and under the direct control
of the Department.”

If I am right in my construction of the two
material paragraphs of the Canada Post Office Act, it follows that the
“bureau de poste du Parlement” is not a “bureau de poste” within the meaning of
s. 364 of the Criminal Code, and also that the letter which the defendant was
charged with stealing therein was not a “lettre confiée à la poste” at the time
of the theft in the sense of that expression as given in s. 2 of the Canada Post
Office Act. The letter at that time was neither in a “post office” nor
“being carried through the post,” the Post Office Department’s control and
responsibility of and for it having ceased upon its delivery at the so-called
“bureau de poste” which is officered and operated by appointees of the
Provincial Government entirely at the latter’s expense and over which neither
the Quebec city post office nor the Post Office Department had any control.

For these reasons I would allow the appeal and
quash the conviction in so far as it applies to an offence against s. 364.

Kerwin J.—The accused was charged under section 364 of the Criminal Code
that he “a volé une lettre dans la bureau de poste du parlement,” and the
question is what construction is to be placed upon the expression “un bureau de
poste” in clause (6) of section 364, which, for this purpose, by virtue of
section 6 of the Code, is to have the meaning assigned to it by section 2,
paragraph (l) of the Post Office Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 161. That paragraph states:—

(l) “post
office” means any building, room, post office, railway car, street letter box,
street stamp-vending box, receiving box or other receptacle or place where post
letters or other mailable matter are received or delivered, sorted, made up or
despatched.

It is to be noted that not only does it include
a building, etc., where post letters are received, etc., but also a building,
etc, where other mailable matter is received, etc. By section 2 (h):—

“mailable matter” includes any letter,
packet, parcel, newspaper, book or other thing which, by this Act or by any
regulation made in pursuance of it, may be sent by post.

[Page 49]

That is “post office” means any building, etc.,
where any letter which may be sent by post is received, etc. Now it cannot have
been intended that any letter which may be sent by post is in a
post office unless it is in a building, room, etc., which building,
room, etc., is under the control of the Postmaster-General as part of the
postal service of Canada. In my opinion that is the construction to be given to
section 364 of the Code.

Section 4 of the Post Office Act enacts:—

4. There shall be at the seat of government
of Canada a department, known as the Post Office Department, for the
superintendence and management, under the direction of the Postmaster-General,
of the postal service of Canada.

By section 7, the Postmaster-General has
authority to do a number of things. By section 35 he has the sole and exclusive
privilege of conveying, receiving, collecting, sending and delivering letters
within Canada. By section 39 he may establish one or more branch post offices.

It may be assumed that the Postmaster-General
would be justified, under his powers, in permitting certain actions to be done
to accelerate the work of the postal service proper, such as, for instance,
allowing private commercial houses to collect all the mailable matter of its
employees and even such as has been deposited by members of the public in
receptacles provided by the concerns themselves. He might authorize them to use
a machine which would indicate that the postage had been paid. He might permit
the inhabitants of an outlying settlement to deal with mailable matter in
various ways. He might not object to the sign “Post Office” being used under
certain conditions. And it may be assumed that he could from time to time
revoke or alter any directions given, or regulations made, by him with respect
to such matters.

There is no dispute as to what he has done in
the present case. There is in evidence a letter from the Deputy
Postmaster-General to the Postmaster at Quebec, and there is certain oral
testimony bearing on the question which is uncontradicted. To summarize from
such evidence:—

1. Those engaged in what is called the
Parliamentary Post Office are employees of the Provincial Government and not of
the Post Office Department; as are also the couriers who transport the bags
between the Quebec Post Office and the Legislative Assembly Building.

[Page 50]

2. There is a “primary sorting” in the building.

3. Receipts are given for mailable matter which
the senders decide to register.

4. At one time money orders were issued although
the authority for so doing has since been withdrawn.

5. To quote from the letter of the Deputy
Postmaster-General:—

In brief, the Legislative Assembly Post
Office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules
and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada.

But

An office of this nature would not be
recognized as a regular post office, being simply a clearing house, as the
Department could not undertake to establish either a sub-office or a regular
office in a separate institution such as Provincial Government building, as all
post offices have to be for the service of the general public, and under the
direct control of the Department.

The office would not be a postal station,
but a clearing house, similar to that conducted by the Federal Parliament and
applicable to the various Legislative Assemblies. In this case postal note,
money orders and savings bank business could not be put into effect, as the
Assembly Post Office would not be a regular post office, nor published in the
Canada Official Postal Guide.

Bearing in mind all these considerations, the
quarters in the Legislative Assembly Building in Quebec, set aside by the
provincial authorities, cannot be said, in my opinion, to be part of the postal
service of Canada even though what was done was by the consent or authority of
the Postmaster-General.

However, what we are asked to do is to construe
an expression used by Parliament in describing an offence. Parliament indeed
has provided for various offences which may be termed “postal offences” as, for
example, section 365 of the Code; and it has seen fit to differentiate between
the punishments that may be imposed for such offences. We are not concerned
wiht the reason for such distinctions. Unless the courts below are correct in
their interpretation of the section under which the accused was charged, he is
entitled to have the conviction set aside.

A motion was made to dismiss the appeal for want
of jurisdiction but I am of opinion that this appeal is on a question of law on
which there has been dissent in the Court of King’s Bench, as provided by
section 1023 of the Criminal Code. A perusal of the dissenting judgment
satisfies me that the dissent was on the proper construction of section 364 of
the Code. There are no facts in dispute

[Page 51]

and it is not a “question whether the proper
inference has been drawn by the trial judge from facts established in evidence”
as in Gauthier v. The King[2].
This Court had to consider what was a question of law when the proper
construction of a statutory provision was involved in Township of Tisdale v. Hollinger Consolidated Gold Mines[3]. Referring to the finding made by the
Ontario Railway and Municipal Board that the property attempted to be assessed
was situate on “mineral land,” the judgment states at page 323:—

It seems., as found by the Supreme Court of
Ontario, that upon the evidence adduced and the findings of the Board, we would
be precluded from interfering therewith if we agree in law with their view as
to the meaning of the statute. The construction of a statutory enactment is a
question of law, while the question of whether the particular matter or thing
is of such a nature or kind as to fall within the legal definition of its term
is a question of fact.

In Loblaw Groceterias Co. Ltd. v. City
of Toronto[4], the
Court, at page 254, dealt with the argument that

the courts below having reached the
conclusion that the land and building were used as distribution premises, this
is a finding of fact with which we ought not to interfere.

The judgment proceeds:—

But it is a question of law that is made
the subject-matter of the right of appeal from the County Judge upon a stated
case and we are bound to determine upon the proper construction of the
amendment whether or not upon the facts stated the land and building are caught
by the increased rate of assessment.

I have not lost sight of what the Court was
dealing with in the two cases cited and I am not unaware of the danger of
relying upon statements extracted from a judgment without relating them to the
facts of the particular case, but the principles therein declared appeal to me
as affording a criterion which may usefully be followed in arriving at a
conclusion in this case.

It was stated in the dissenting judgment that
while the conviction should be set aside, the accused should be found guilty of
some other offence. The only other offence suggested is one which would carry
with it a sentence which the accused has already served, and under the
circumstances, therefore, I would restrict our judgment to allowing the appeal
and setting aside the conviction.

Appeal allowed and conviction quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Culpable homicide—As to reduction from murder to
manslaughter—Provocation—Cr. Code, s. 261—Acts of third person—Directions to
jury—Questions for jury.

An appeal by the Crown from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario, [1937] O.R. 693, ordering a new trial of accused (who had
been convicted at trial on a charge of murder) on the ground of misdirection or
failure of proper direction by the trial judge in charging the jury on the question
of provocation, was dismissed.

The law with regard to provocation as embodied in s. 261 of
the Cr. Code does not contemplate the extension of the relative lenity
(in reducing culpable homicide from murder to manslaughter) to a case in which
provocation received from a third person becomes the occasion of an act of
homicide against a victim who, as the offender knows and fully realizes, was
not in any way concerned in the provocation. But acts of provocation committed
by a third person, which might be sufficient to reduce the offence to
manslaughter if the victim had in fact participated in them, may have the same
effect where the offence against the victim is committed by the accused under
the belief that the victim was a party to those acts, although the victim was
not implicated in them in fact. (Brown’s case, 1 Leech C.C. 148, and Hall’s
case, 21 Cr. A.R. 48, cited and discussed.)

In the present case, the trial judge ought to have asked the
jury to consider whether, in the blindness of his passion aroused by his
quarrel with the husband of Mrs. S., the accused, suddenly observing Mrs. S.
(the victim of the act now in question) within a few feet of the scene of the
quarrel and of his mortal assault on the husband, attacked her on the
assumption that she was involved in the acts of the husband and daughter. It
was a question for the jury whether (a) the acts relied upon as
constituting provocation were calculated to deprive an ordinary man of
self-control to such an extent as to cause an attack upon Mrs. S. of such a
character as that delivered by the accused, and (b) whether in fact the
accused was by reason of what occurred deprived of his self-control to such a
degree; and in his attack upon Mrs. S. was acting upon such provocation on a
sudden and before his passion had time to cool, and under the assumption that
she was involved therein.

APPEAL by the Attorney-General of Ontario (under s. 1023 (2)
of the Criminal Code, as amended by 25-26 Geo. V (1935), c. 56, s. 16)
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
which (Fisher and Henderson JJ.A. dissenting) allowed the accused’s appeal

[Page 19]

against his conviction of murder at his trial before McFarland
J. with a jury and set aside the conviction and ordered a retrial, on the
ground of misdirection or failure of proper direction by the trial judge in
addressing the jury on the question of provocation.

W.B. Common K.C. and E.H. Lancaster K.C. for the
appellant.

Peter White K.C. and H.M. Rogers for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

DUFF C.J.—We have come to the conclusion that the order directing
a new trial should not be disturbed. As there is to be a new trial, we think it
better to abstain from a discussion of the facts.

The controversy on the appeal concerns the application of section
261 of the Criminal Code, the text of which we quote:

Culpable homicide, which would otherwise be murder, may be
reduced to manslaughter if the person who causes death does so in the heat of
passion caused by sudden provocation.

2. Any wrongful act or insult, of such a nature as to be
sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, may be
provocation if the offender acts upon it on the sudden, and before there has
been time for his passion to cool.

3. Whether or not any particular wrongful act or insult
amounts to provocation, and whether or not the person provoked was actually
deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he received,
shall be questions of fact: Provided that no one shall be held to give
provocation to another by doing that which he had a legal right to do, or by
doing anything which the offender incited him to do in order to provide the
offender with an excuse for killing or doing bodily harm to any person.

We think it right to emphasize that this section deals with the
conditions under which “culpable homicide, which would otherwise be murder, may
be reduced to manslaughter,” because the act of the accused was committed “in
the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.”

The provocation contemplated by the section neither justifies nor
excuses the act of homicide. But the law accounts the act and the violent
feelings which prompted it less blameable because of the passion aroused by the
provocation, leaving the offender in a condition in which he was not at the
critical “moment the master of his own understanding,” to quote the phrase of
Tindal C.J. in

[Page 20]

Hayward’s case[2],
adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeals in Hall’s case[3];
though still sufficiently blame-able to merit punishment—and it may be
punishment of high severity—but not the extreme punishment of death. We do not
think that the law, as embodied in section 261, contemplates the extension of
this relative lenity to a case in which provocation received from one person
becomes the occasion of an act of homicide against another who, as the offender
knows and fully realizes, was not in any way concerned in the provocation. We
do not think section 261 contemplates such a case, for example, as Simpson’s
case[4].

On the other hand, the law has recognized that an offender under
the dominion of a passion provoked by wrong or insult may in some circumstances
attack a person not in any way concerned with the act of provocation, under the
full belief that he has been so; and such circumstances have been held to be
sufficient to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.

Brown’s case[5] would
appear, from the report in 1 East’s Pleas of the Crown, at p. 246, to have
proceeded upon this ground.

Hall’s case[6] may
have been decided upon similar considerations. There is nothing in any of the
reports of the case indicating that there was any direct evidence of the
participation of the victim in the attack on the accused upon which the latter
relied as constituting provocation, or even that the victim was present at the
time. It was held that the jury ought to have been asked to consider the issue
of provocation and, accordingly, the court reduced the verdict of murder to
manslaughter, although, obviously, as Lord Hewart observes, there were grave
difficulties in the way of this defence. There was evidence from which it might
have been inferred, if the story of the accused was accepted, that the offender
acted upon the assumption that the victim had been one of his assailants. We
are disposed to think, after considering the judgment with care, that the Court
of Criminal Appeals did not regard the

[Page 21]

actual participation by the victim in the alleged assault upon
the accused as an essential element in the defence of provocation.

True it is that in these cases there was an affray and, both in Brown’s
case[7] and in Hall’s
case[8],
the alleged provocation consisted in a violent assault upon the accused. We
think, however, that section 261 of the Criminal Code leaves exclusively
to the tribunal of fact, as an issue of fact, the question whether any
particular “wrongful act or insult” is of such a character as to constitute
provocation for the purposes of the section; at least subject to the condition
expressed in the proviso to the third sub-section. And we think, moreover, as
regards the source from which the provocation proceeds, that acts of
provocation committed by a third person, which might be sufficient to reduce
the offence to manslaughter if the victim had in fact participated in them, may
have the same effect where the offence against the victim is committed by the
accused under the belief that the victim was a party to those acts, although
not implicated in them in fact.

We think the trial judge ought to have asked the jury to consider
whether, in the blindness of his passion, aroused by the quarrel with the
husband, the accused, suddenly observing the wife within a few feet of the
scene of the quarrel and of his mortal assault on the husband, attacked her on
the assumption that she was involved in the acts of the husband and daughter.

We think it was a question for the jury whether (a) the
acts relied upon as constituting provocation were calculated to deprive an
ordinary man of self-control to such an extent as to cause an attack upon Mrs.
Seabright of such a character as that delivered by the accused; and (b)
whether in fact the accused was by reason of what occurred deprived of his self‑control
to such a degree; and in his attack upon Mrs. Seabright was acting upon such
provocation on a sudden and before his passion had time to cool, and under the
assumption that she was involved therein.

At the new trial the presiding judge will, no doubt, impress upon
the jury the importance of considering with great care the first of these
questions; but he will, of course, instruct the jury that, on the ultimate
issue, they must be

[Page 22]

satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of
murder before convicting him of that crime. For these reasons, the appeal is
dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA

Fraud—Undue Influence—Agreement for sale—Excessive price
demanded by Purchaser to release Vendor—Unconscionable Bargain—Relationship of
Parties.

Barristers and Solicitors—Solicitor acting for both
parties—Where neither connivance nor negligence shown, not subject to
strictures.

An elderly couple entered into an agreement to sell a property
at a price satisfactory to them at the time. Subsequently to secure a release
therefrom they paid a large amount demanded by the purchaser, to the solicitor,
who in the drawing of the agreement and the release acted for both parties. In
an action to cancel the release, set aside the agreement, and recover damages
from the purchaser and the solicitor jointly.

Held: 1. In the light of the evidence since no
relationship was established to make it the duty of the purchaser to take care
of the vendors, a claim to set aside the release and recover payment failed. Tufton
v. Sperni [1952] 2 T.L.R. 516 at 519.

2. The trial judge rightly held that the solicitor neither by
himself nor by connivance with the purchaser had imposed the bargain on the
vendors.

[Page 208]

3. The release was net an unconscionable, bargain in the sense
in which the term is used in the cases but, if the Court had been able to
arrive at the opposite conclusion, it would agree with the trial judge that the
vendors could not secure any relief so long as they claimed they were entitled
to set aside the original agreement.

Appeal allowed and judgment at trial [1951-52] 4 W.W.R. (N.S.)

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba 1
allowing an appeal from the judgment of Montague J. 2 dismissing
plaintiff's action against both defendants.

W. P. Fillmore, Q.C. for the appellant Brock.

R. D. Guy, Q.C. for the appellant Petty.

L. St. G. Stubbs and H. P. Beahan for
the respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Kerwin J.:—The
respondents Louis Gronbach and his wife, Dinah Elizabeth Gronbach, signed the
document of January 13, 1949, fully understanding its nature and effect, and
there is no doubt that, at the time, the agreement was entirely satisfactory to
them. It was said in the Court of Appeal that the agreement was impossible of
performance by Mrs. Gronbach because she was not the owner of the stock in
trade. An inventory was to be taken of it on the evening of January 31, 1949,
and Petty was to pay for it in cash at wholesale prices. Accepting the position
that Mrs. Gronbach alone was the ""vendor"" under the agreement, there
would have been nothing to prevent the Court ordering specific performance
thereof against her to the extent to which that was possible. She had agreed to
the sale of the lands and premises, which would include any fixtures owned by
her, for $35,000 and the money to be paid for the stock in trade was in
addition to that sum. In our view the evidence discloses that Louis Gronbach,
the owner of the stock in trade, had agreed to its sale, but, in any event,
even if that be not so, the situation as between Mrs. Gronbach and Petty would
not be affected. The agreement could, therefore have been performed by Mrs.
Gronbach in the manner indicated.

[Page 209]

Leaving aside for the moment the question of The Dower
Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 55, there was therefore no reason why Mr. and Mrs.
Gronbach and Petty could not agree to the cancellation of the agreement. The
suggestion that this should be done came from the Gronbachs and, while the sum
of $8,000 demanded by Petty for the release of January 21, 1949, is large, we
cannot find that any relationship existed between Petty, on the one hand, and
the Gronbachs, on the other, to make it the duty of the former to take care of
the latter. As stated by Sir Raymond Evershed M.R. in Tufton v. Sperni
3: ""Extravagant
liberality and immoderate folly do not of themselves provide a passport to
equitable relief."" Therefore, the claim to set aside the release and
recover the $8,000 from Petty fails.

The trial judge has dealt satisfactorily in most respects
with the position of the appellant Brock and we are of opinion that he came to
the right conclusion that the solicitor, neither by himself nor by connivance
with Petty, imposed on the Gronbachs the bargain demanded by Petty. We also
agree that it has not been shown that the solicitor was negligent. For these
reasons we must with respect express our disagreement with any of the
strictures passed by the Court of Appeal upon the solicitor and, therefore, the
decisions referred to in their reasons for judgment on that aspect of the
matter are not applicable.

Under the circumstances as shown in the evidence, the
release cannot be held to be an unconscionable bargain in the sense in which
that term is used in the cases but, if we had been able to arrive at the
opposite conclusion, we would, then agree with the trial judge that the Gronbachs
cannot secure any relief when they persist in their attitude that they are
entitled to set aside the original document of January 13, 1949. The Court has
no jurisdiction to reopen the cancellation agreement and decree what ought to
be paid by the Gronbachs to Petty.

The Dower Act was never referred to in the pleadings
or at the trial and it was only after the hearing before the Court of Appeal
that that Court requested argument upon the point. Mr. Fillmore pointed out
that if it had been raised, evidence might have been led to show of what, if
anything, the homestead consisted. The Manitoba Dower

[Page 210]

Act is not the same as the Alberta Statute considered
recently by this Court in McColl-Frontenac Oil Co. Ltd. v. Hamilton 4, but even if the
proper conclusion would be that the agreement of January 13, 1949, so far as
any homestead of Mrs. Gronbach is concerned, was absolutely null and void for
all purposes, and assuming that the point is open on the pleadings and should
be dealt with by an Appellate Court, the money paid under the release of
January 21, 1949, was paid under a mistake in law.

The option of January 21, 1949, (exhibit 7), was not binding
on Mrs. Gronbach but no order need now be made as the two years from February
1, 1949, referred to in that document have already expired. We also agree that
the agreement of January 13, 1949, was not binding upon the respondent
Frederick Gronbach. The fact that no order as to costs was made by the trial
judge sufficiently takes care of both these matters as the main dispute was as
to the position of Louis and Dinah Elizabeth Gronbach under the agreement of
January 13, 1949, and under the release. The appeals are allowed with costs
here and in the Court of Appeal and the judgment at the trial restored. The
cross-appeal is dismissed without costs.

Appeal allowed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Murder—Extra-judicial admissions—Whether jury need be warned
of danger of convicting solely on confession—Sufficiency of charge—Whether defence theory
adequately put to the jury.

On the strength of his
three self incriminating declarations, the appellant was charged with a murder
which had remained unsolved for more than two years. Two of his admissions were
made verbally to friends of his and the third was contained in a statement to
the police in his own handwriting and accepted by the Courts as having been
given freely and voluntarily. The appellant did not give evidence before the
jury and the theory of the defence was that although he had in fact made the
statements they were untrue. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal
for Ontario. Two questions of law were submitted on appeal to this Court,
namely, whether the jury had been adequately instructed as to the theory of the
defence and whether they should have been warned as to the danger of convicting
when the only evidence connecting the accused with the crime was his unsworn
extra-judicial admissions.

Held (Cartwright J. dissenting),
that the appeal should be dismissed.

Per Rinfret C.J., Rand,
Kellock, Estey, Locke and Fauteux JJ.: There was no legal duty for the trial
judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting the appellant of murder even
if, in their view, the only evidence to connect him with the crime consisted of
his unsworn extrajudicial admissions.

There was in fact
independent evidence tending to support the accused’s admissions of having participated in
the commission of the murder; the jury were adequately instructed as to the
theory of the defence, namely, that the admissions were untrue, and of the
numerous points which, in the appellant’s submission, should have been brought
to their attention, some were actually submitted to them by the trial judge and
those which were not had either no foundation on the

[Page 221]

evidence or if they had,
were denuded of any real significance in the test of the truthfulness of the
material admission. The allotment of any substance to an argument or of any
value to a grievance resting on the omission of the trial judge from mentioning
such argument must be conditioned on the existence in the record of some
evidence or matter apt to convey a sense of reality in the argument and in the
grievance.








Per Cartwright J. (dissenting):
The authorities cited by the appellant do not formulate a rule of law that, in
cases in which the only evidence to connect one accused of murder with the
crime consists of his unsworn extra-judicial admissions, the trial judge must
warn the jury that it is dangerous to convict.

It was however the duty of
the trial judge to impress upon the jury the necessity of testing the truth of
the admissions made by the accused by an examination of the other facts proved,
and to call their attention to the circumstances mainly relied upon by the
defence as tending to cast doubt upon the truth of the admissions, and this
duty he failed to perform.

APPEAL from the oral
judgment delivered by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the appellant’s conviction for murder.

A.E. Maloney for the
appellant.

W.B. Common Q.C. for the
respondent.



The
judgment of the Chief Justice, Rand, Kellock, Estey, Locke and Fauteux, JJ. was
delivered by:—



FAUTEUX
J.—On the 18th of September
1952, a jury of the Supreme Court of Ontario found that the appellant, “on or about the 9th day of
December 1949, at the Township of Thorold, in the County of Welland, did
unlawfully murder Sam Delibasich”.



An
appeal against this verdict was unanimously dismissed; the oral reasons
delivered by the Chief Justice of the Province, at the conclusion of the
argument, being:—



We
see no reason for disturbing the verdict of the jury in this case. We think
that statements of the accused admitted in evidence were voluntary statements
and properly admitted. We consider the charge of the learned trial judge to the
jury was adequate. The appeal must be dismissed.



The
appellant then obtained leave to appeal to this Court on two questions of law,
namely:—



(a)
Did the learned judge err in failing to instruct the jury adequately as to
the theory of the defence?



(b)
Did the learned trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury as to the
danger of convicting the accused of murder where the only evidence to connect
him with the crime consists of his unsworn extra-judicial admissions?

[Page 222]



For a
proper consideration of these questions, the main features of the case may, at
first, be related.










Sam
Delibasich, a taxi operator of the city of Welland, was last seen alive in that
city at 6.30 p.m. on Friday, the 9th of December 1949. In the late afternoon of
the following day, Saturday the 10th, his cab was observed in the west-end of
the city of Toronto, in a parked position in front of a building, number 2111
Bloor Street West, by a resident of these premises, one Mrs. Bell who, a
few days after, reported to the police the fact of its continued presence. A
week later, on Saturday the 17th, the body of Delibasich was discovered, by a
hunter, in the middle of a ploughed field off of the Hurricane East Road, at
some 4 or 5 miles from the city of Welland. The Provincial Police were
immediately alerted; a call went out for the cab which the Toronto police—already apprised of its
presence on Bloor Street—towed into custody.



From
the investigation, particularly of the body, of the place and surroundings
where it was found and of the cab itself, no clues connecting any one with the
murder could be found. However, and as the evidence before the jury indicates,
the following facts were then ascertained. The body of the victim was lying
some 300 feet from the road, face down, with the arms extended and frozen
stiff. The clothing was intact and mud-stained. No footprints and no indication
of a scuffle were found in the field. The autopsy revealed on the front of the
body depressions leading to the opinion that, while warm, it had lain on an
irregular surface, the imprint of which was left during the freezing process.
There were several wounds, the fatal ones having been inflicted on the head by
a blunt instrument and six others—three
before and three after death—caused by a rigid, round
and pointed instrument. Death was attributed to fracture of the skull and
injury of the brain.



The
victim was known to usually carry on his person, in a wallet, substantial sums
of money, but an amount of $13 only, mostly in silver, and loose in his pocket,
was found. The operator’s badge and operating
permits usually attached to the sun-visor of the cab, and any other identification
papers were missing. Whether there was in the cab any indication of a struggle
or any blood is not shown in the evidence.

[Page 223]










This
crime had remained unsolved for more than two years when the Crown acquired
direct evidence, in the form of three self-incriminating declarations made by
the appellant—each of them at different
times and to different persons—on the strength of which
the latter was prosecuted for murder. Two of these admissions were made
verbally by the appellant to friends of his, the first, in September, 1951, to
one Aubrey Leslie Merritt, whom he had known since childhood, and who, after long
hesitation, i.e., in January, 1952, apprised the police of the same; the
second, to Blanche Lucy Benner, of the city of Welland, with whom he had
intimate relations and who reluctantly related these admissions to the police
after his arrest. The third appears in a statement to the police made by the
appellant in his own handwriting and accepted by the two Courts below as having
been given freely and voluntarily.



The
substance of the facts related by the appellant on these three occasions is:—On the night of the
disappearance of Sam Delibasich, the appellant and his brother Lloyd met at the
Reeta Hotel in Welland where they consumed a small quantity of beer. They there
and then agreed “to make some quick money” and to hire Delibasich’s cab, drive out of town, “knock him out” and take his cab to
Toronto to sell it.—Incidentally, it may be
noted that the appellant, his brother and their mother were also of the city of
Welland, and knew the taxi operator very well.—In furtherance of this plot, they
called Delibasich, hired his cab and drove with him to St. Catharines
when, nearing Port Robinson Road, they required him to stop. Their victim was
then struck, at first with a hammer and then with an ice-pick, the latter
instrument being used “to finish him”, according to what the
appellant said to Merritt, or “to make sure”, according to what he
wrote himself in his statement to the police. Having abandoned the body in a
field, they proceeded to Toronto, stopping, en route, at Toronto Bay to throw
into Lake Ontario the hammer, the ice-pick and some of the belongings of the
victim. Attempts to sell the cab at used car lots in Toronto being vain, it was
left on the street. They spent the night in the city and then returned to
Welland.



The
evidence also shows that a few days after having confessed to police officers,
the appellant freely consented to accompany them to Toronto inorder to
indicate, in the

[Page 224]










course
of the journey, the various points having any bearing on the case. He thus
pointed out the road leading to the field where the body had been found, the
route followed to reach the point of the Bay from where he and his brother
threw the hammer, the ice-pick, the operator’s badge and the various papers of the
victim into the lake. Though definitely unfamiliar with the city of Toronto, he
also indicated one of the used car lots at which they vainly attempted to sell
the cab and also the place where the latter had been abandoned on Bloor Street.
The latter point was not more than 200 feet away from the place where the cab
had, more than two years before, been observed by Mrs. Bell the day after
the murder. The appellant was unable to locate, in the same district, the hotel
where they were alleged by him to have registered under fictitious names, nor
did the police subsequently succeed in doing so: it appears however from the
evidence that hotel registration records were rather poorly kept if at all in
the hotels of this particular district of the city.



This,
in substance, was the evidence in the record at the close of the case for the
prosecution.



In
defence, the subject matter of the evidence adduced was limited to the
character of the appellant. In this respect, the record shows the absence of
any previous convictions, that his past conduct rendered unlikely his
connection with the crime of murder and established the particular frankness of
the appellant. Though testifying on the voir dire, in an unsuccessful
attempt to prevent the production of his statement to the police, the appellant
did not however give any evidence before the jury, leaving thus unchallenged by
him the fact and the truth of his various declarations. With the addition that
nothing could be shown or found in the record which would indicate or suggest
any reason or motive prompting the appellant to falsely charge himself and his
own brother with the murder of a person they both very well knew, this summary
relates the main features of the case.



Turning
now to the points of law raised in this appeal and dealing with the first one,
i.e. whether the trial Judge erred in failing to instruct the jury adequately
as to the theory of the defence.

[Page 225]










The
defence did not deny the fact but only the truthfulness of the appellant’s admissions. This was the
theory of the defence at trial and the sole one suggested at the hearing before
this Court. More than once it was stated to the jury by the trial Judge in his
charge. It is contended however that this was not done adequately because the trial
Judge failed to direct the attention of the jury to some 19 or 20 alleged
arguments purported to be related to the theory of the defence. Whether all
these arguments, which a subsequent and minute examination of the record
suggested to counsel for the appellant, were actually formulated or even
thought of before the jury by counsel then acting for the accused, could not be
asserted to us and is very doubtful if one is to rely on the less numerous
objections made at trial immediately after the address of the judge. Be that as
it may and as to the merits of the contention itself, I must say that, after
having carefully considered each of the points on which it rests, I fail, in
the light of the particular features of this case, to see any real substance in
it. In brief, some of these points were actually submitted to the jury by the
trial Judge and those which were not are either without foundation on the
evidence or, if they have, are denuded of any real significance in the test of
the truthfulness of the material admission. This is all, I think, it is
necessary to say on the matter except as to two of these twenty points, which
themselves illustrate the nature of the others. Some comments may be found
expedient in view of the importance given to them by counsel for the appellant.



It is
suggested that the trial Judge should have commented on:—



(e)
The failure of the police and the appellant to locate the hotel at which he and
his brother were supposed to have registered and the inability of the police to
find any such hotel notwithstanding their intensive efforts to do so.



(h)
The lack of any evidence of blood or signs of a struggle in the victim’s taxi which serves
strongly to contradict the appellant’s
statement to the police.



On (e):—As already indicated, the
evidence shows that registration records in hotels located in that particular
district were very poorly if at all kept. Moreover, at least two years had
elapsed since such registration was alleged to have been made and the moment
that verification of

[Page 226]



the
fact was attempted. Under such circumstances, I fail to see what real
significance such evidence could have on the question of the truthfulness of
the appellant’s admissions.



As to (h):—It was conceded that the
presence or absence of blood in the cab was not even dealt with in the evidence
nor was either the absence or presence of signs of a struggle in the victim’s taxi.










The
allotment of any substance to an argument or of any value to a grievance
resting on the omission of the trial Judge from mentioning such argument must
be conditioned on the existence in the record of some evidence or matter apt to
convey a sense of reality in the argument and in the grievance. Had the
autopsy, for instance, revealed poisoning instead of fracture of the skull as
the cause of death, this undoubtedly would have, in this case, been a point of
substance relevant to the theory of the defence. Far from conflicting with the
appellant’s admissions, independent
proof of certain facts in the case tends to support his material admission,
i.e. his participation in the commission of the murder. These facts are:—The indication by the
appellant of the place he and his brother abandoned the cab corresponding to
the one at which it was found; the statement of the appellant that the ice-pick
was used once the victim had been struck with the hammer “to finish him” or “to make sure” tallying with the opinion
of the medicolegal expert that six wounds had been made by a rigid, round and
pointed instrument, three before and three after death; the fact of the
immediate disappearance of his brother from Welland after the murder; the fact
that nothing can be found or was shown on the evidence in the nature of a
reason or a motive moving the appellant to make false admissions charging
himself and his own brother with the murder of a person they both knew very
well.



In law,
the general rule as again stated recently in Azoulay v. The Queen[1], is that the trial Judge
in the course of his charge should review the substantial part of the
evidence and give the jury the theory of the defence so that they may
appreciate the value and effect of that evidence and how the law is to be
applied to the facts as

[Page 227]



they
find them. It is, of course, unnecessary that the jury’s attention be directed to all of the
evidence, and how far a trial Judge should go in discussing it must depend in
each case upon the nature and character of the evidence in relation to the
charge, the issues raised and the conduct of the trial. In the words of
Goddard, L.C.J. in Derek Clayton-Wright[2]:



The
duty of the Judge … is adequately and properly
performed ... if he puts before the jury clearly and fairly the contentions on
either side, omitting nothing from his charge, so far as the defence is
concerned, of the real matters upon which the defence is based. He must
give … a fair picture of the
defence, but that does not mean to say that he is to paint in the details or to
comment on every argument which has been used or to remind them of the whole of
the evidence which has been given by experts or anyone else.



The
rule is simple and implements the fundamental principle that an accused is
entitled to a fair trial, to make a full answer and defence to the charge, and
to these ends, the jury must be adequately instructed as to what his defence is
by the trial Judge. Whether the rule has in any given case been complied with
may at times be difficult to determine. In the present matter and for the
reasons above given, I agree with the members of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario that the charge was sufficient.



The
second ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred “in failing to instruct the jury as to
the danger of convicting the accused of murder where the only evidence to
connect him with the crime consists of his extra-judicial admissions.”










This
ground rests on the assumption of the fact that the record discloses a complete
lack of independent evidence tending to support the truthfulness of the
material admission made by the appellant. That such an assumption does not flow
from a consideration of the evidence and of all the circumstances of this case
I have endeavoured already to demonstrate. However, and on the basis of a
different view being held in the matter, the question of law must be
considered.



That
the appellant could be legally convicted of murder by a jury solely on his
extra-judicial admissions, i.e. without any corroborating evidence, is not
disputed. What is suggested and what for the success of the appeal on this

[Page 228]



point
must be accepted, is that there was in this case a legal duty for the trial
judge to warn the jury of the danger of doing so. No authorities or precedents
in point were quoted on behalf of the appellant, nor was it possible to find
anyone to support this contention.



The
only two cases to which our attention was directed did not state or recognize
such a rule of law. The first one is Rex v. Sykes[3]. The question there
considered by the Court of Appeal was “how
far the jury can rely on these confessions,” i.e. the confessions made in that
particular case. Nothing in what was then stated by Ridley J., on behalf of the
Court, purported to be tantamount to a statement of a rule of law such as the
one here contended for, but was indeed only an approval of the impeached
instructions given to the jury by the Commissioner in that particular case. The
question of warning was not dealt with. In the second case, Rex v. Rubletz[4], the ratio decidendi is
that the trial judge, having determined that the confession made by the accused
was free and voluntary, so instructed the jury, but in a manner confusing the
two issues, i.e. the one related to the free and voluntary character of the
confession and the other in respect to its veracity. On the latter point
Turgeon C.J., speaking for the Court, stated at page 252:—



If
this confession was not free and voluntary, it would not be before the jury at
all. Being there, it is the jury’s
duty to find whether or not it is true. This issue is different from the issue
of admissibility which was before the Judge, and necessitates an inquiry going
much further afield. Unfortunately, the instruction given to the jury on this
all-important subject seems to me to have fallen short of what was required and
to have tended to make the jury think that, if the statement was free and
voluntary, it was true.










Nowhere
in the case does the Court suggest that a warning should have been given to the
jury. Reference may be made to what the Chief Justice said at page 251:—



It
does not follow, because a person comes forward freely and voluntarily and
declares that he has committed a crime, declares, for instance, that another
person supposed to have died a natural death, was in reality murdered by him,
that his declaration must be accepted as true and that he must be convicted of
murder. A jury may convict him: Rex v. Falkner & Bond 168 E.R. 908; R.
v. Tippet 168 E.R. 923; but before doing so they ought to be
instructed by the Judge in such a manner as to call their attention to all the
circumstances surrounding the case and which may affect the truth or falsity of
the confession.

[Page 229]



In my
opinion, the learned trial judge in the present case having complied with the
rule above considered in relation to the first ground of appeal, nothing more,
on the matter, was required in his address to the jury.



The
appeal should be dismissed.



CARTWRIGHT
J. (dissenting):—The facts out of which this
appeal arises are stated in the reasons of my brother Fauteux. I shall not
repeat them but wish to mention the following additional details which appear
to me to be of some importance. The witnesses, Merritt and Mrs. Benner,
each of whom testified that the accused had confessed to taking part in killing
Delibasich also testified that they did not believe his confession. After the
accused had been arrested on a charge of murder his first statement to the
police amounted to an assertion of his innocence. Shortly afterwards, following
a question and an admonition, the accused, in the presence of the police
officers, wrote out the confession which was admitted as Exhibit 8 at the
trial.



The
accused did not give evidence before the jury, but it is not, I think, open to
question that both the fact of the three statements having been made and their
truthfulness, if made, were put in issue by the plea of “not guilty.” The theory of the defence
was that although the accused had in fact made the statements they were untrue
and he had had nothing to do with the killing of Delibasich.



Leave
was granted to appeal to this Court on the following points:—



(a)
Did the learned trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury adequately as
to the theory of the defence?










(b)
Did the learned trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury as to the
danger of convicting the accused of murder where the only evidence to connect
him with the crime consists of his unsworn extra-judicial admissions?



As to
the second of these points counsel for the appellant relied on certain
observations in the unanimous judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R.
v. Walter Sykes[5]. In that case there was
ample evidence, as in the case at bar, that a murder had been committed. The
accused had made statements to two witnesses, one of whom was a police
inspector, to the effect that he was the murderer. Later he had retracted these
statements.

[Page 230]



The
following passages in the judgment at pages 236 and 237 are relevant:—



It
would have been unsatisfactory to convict on the evidence had it not been assisted
by the confession, and probably it would have been unsatisfactory if the
conviction rested on the confessions only, without the circumstances which make
it probable that the confessions were true.



The
main point, however, is one independent of all these details, the question how
far the jury could rely on these confessions. I think the Commissioner put it
correctly; he said:



A
man may be convicted on his own confession alone; there is no law against it.
The law is that if a man makes a free and voluntary confession which is direct
and positive, and is properly proved, a jury may, if they think fit, convict
him of any crime upon it. But seldom, if ever, the necessity arises, because
confessions can always be tested and examined, first by the police, and then by
you and us in Court, and the first question you ask when you are examining the
confession of a man is, is there anything outside it to show that it was true?
is it corroborated? are the statements made in it of fact so far as we can test
them true? was the prisoner a man who had the opportunity of committing the
murder? is his confession possible? is it consistent with other facts which
have been ascertained and which have been, as in this case, proved before us?



It
was said that the murder was the talk of the countryside, and it might well be
that a man under the influence of insanity or a morbid desire for notoriety
would accuse himself of such a crime. I agree that this is so, but it was a
question for the jury, and they ought to see whether it was properly
corroborated by facts, and so they were directed. We think that this part of
the case was quite sufficiently left to the jury, and the Court thinks that
there is no reason for giving leave to appeal.



This
case was cited with approval by Turgeon C.J.S. giving the unanimous judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Rubletz[6], also relied upon by
counsel for the appellant. The learned Chief Justice said in part:—










It
does not follow, because a person comes forward freely and voluntarily and
declares that he has committed a crime, declares, for instance, that another
person supposed to have died a natural death, was in reality murdered by him,
that his declaration must be accepted as true and that he must be convicted of
murder. A jury may convict him: R. v. Falkner & Bond, 168 E.R. 908; R.
v. Tippet, 168 E.R. 923; but before doing so they ought to be instructed by
the Judge in such a manner as to call their attention to all the circumstances
surrounding the case and which may affect the truth or the falsity of the
confession.



The
learned judge decided that the statement was nevertheless a free and voluntary
one, and I think he was right in so deciding. But a free and voluntary
statement may, nevertheless, be false. Men have been known to accuse themselves
falsely of the most heinous offences, fully conscious, sometimes, of the
falsity of their avowal, and imagining at other times, that their souls were in
fact charged with crime. If this confession was not free and voluntary, it
would not be before the jury

[Page 231]



at
all. Being there, it is the jury’s
duty to find whether or not it is true. This issue is different from the issue
of admissibility which was before the judge, and necessitates an inquiry going
much further afield.



I do
not read these judgments as formulating a rule of law that, in cases in which
the only evidence to connect one accused of murder with the crime consists of
his unsworn extra‑judicial admissions, the trial judge must warn the jury
that it is dangerous to convict; but I think that they furnish a guide as to
the way in which, in such cases, the judge should perform the duty which always
rests upon him of laying the theory of the defence adequately and fairly before
the jury.



In such
cases, and especially when the accused has not given evidence, I think it
incumbent upon the trial judge, (i) to impress upon the jury the necessity of
testing the truthfulness of the admissions by an examination of the other facts
and circumstances proved, and (ii) to call their attention, not necessarily to
all the circumstances, but to those mainly relied upon by the defence as
tending to cast doubt upon the truthfulness of the confession. In the case at
bar I have reached the conclusion that neither of these duties was adequately
performed.










In the
argument before us and in his factum, counsel for the appellant referred to
nineteen matters which, in his submission, might well cause the jury to doubt
the truth of the confession, of which only two were specifically mentioned by
the learned trial judge in his charge. I do not propose to examine each of the
items in this list. Several of them appear to me to be unimportant but I wish
to refer to three of them. (i) It is apparent from the evidence of Inspector
Wood that the accused had told him that after abandoning Delibasich’s taxi-cab in Toronto, he
and his brother walked to a hotel at which they registered and spent the night
of December 9, 1949; but a most careful and extensive search by the police had
failed to locate any record of registration or other evidence to substantiate
this. (ii) If the confession was true, the motive for the murder was robbery
but some $13 was found on the person of the deceased. (iii) If the confession
was true, it would seem probable that there would have been some bloodstains in
the taxi-cab but there was no evidence as to whether any such stains were found
by the police. None

[Page 232]



of
these three matters was referred to by the learned trial judge in his charge.
Counsel for the accused specifically requested that the attention of the jury
be called to the item thirdly mentioned. I am respectfully of the opinion that
they should have been put before the jury and further, since the theory of the
defence was that the accused had fabricated the confession, the learned trial
judge should have pointed out that there was no detail in the confession
verified by any evidence extraneous to it which might not have come to the
accused’s knowledge through reading
of the crime in the press. The learned trial judge in another connection
mentioned to the jury that he remembered reading about the occurrence in the
newspapers. No doubt, as in the Sykes case, “the murder was the talk of the
countryside.” I do not intend to suggest
that had any or all of these matters been mentioned to the jury their verdict
would necessarily, or probably, have been different, but I can not satisfy
myself it might not have been.



How
then did the learned trial judge present the theory of the defence to the jury?
The following passages in the charge appear to me to be the only ones which
deal with it:—



While
I am on this subject, I want to say to you that that is the way you may
interpret the evidence of the statement, this very important statement which
has been put in and which was given by the accused. It will be before you in
evidence. It is true that this is not sworn evidence but, gentlemen, it is
evidence in the case. You may interpret that statement like any other evidence.
You may believe all of it; you may think that statement is true. There may be
parts that you may think are not true, or you may think as the defence asks you
to, that it is not true at all.



. . .



But
in this case most of the evidence is direct. It is direct evidence of the
accused himself if you believe it. He has signed a statement telling what
happened. There is the evidence of two witnesses who say he told them what
happened. That, gentlemen, is direct evidence, and it is a question of whether
you believe it or not.










Gentlemen,
in this case I have concluded that I do not need to charge you upon the
question of manslaughter, and for this reason. I have not heard any evidence
upon which a jury could find a verdict of manslaughter. Believe me, if there
was any such evidence it would be my duty to draw it to your attention, and I
would be most happy to do so, but I cannot on this evidence, on the evidence I
have heard, find any evidence that would justiny a verdict of manslaughter.
Indeed, and I ask Mr. Martin, who has so ably defended this young man, to
see if I state it correctly, the whole theory of the defence is that this
accused had nothing to do with this crime; that these stories were not true,
and if that theory is accepted by you, or if you have an honest doubt whether
that is the correct theory or not, the verdict will be a complete acquittal.



. . .

[Page 233]



The
theory of the defence, and you must consider it, gentlemen, because it is
always important, is that that statement which was signed by the accused is not
true at all; that having told the story once, he went right along with the
thing. You must give consideration and thought as to that, gentlemen. But I
suggest to you that you must also consider, and it is entirely for you to say,
would a person sign a statement like that after being warned that he was
charged with murder and was not required to say anything; would he do that if
it were not true? You may think so. You are the judges of the facts, and it is
entirely for you to say.



With
the deepest respect for the learned trial judge, I find myself in agreement
with the submission of counsel for the appellant that the theory of the defence
was mentioned only to be brushed aside. Conceding that the theory was not a
strong one, it was nonetheless necessary that it be adequately presented to the
jury and for the reasons I have set out above I think this was not done.



I would
allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Evidence—Exporting to destination not
authorized by permit—Entry on bill of lading made by customs officer pursuant
to duty under foreign law—Whether admissible—Error and defect in notice of
appeal—Export and Import Permits Act, 1947, c. 17, ss. 5, 13— Criminal Coda, s.
1018(2).

The appellant was charged with having exported tin plate from
Canada to an ultimate destination not authorized by his permit for the export,
issued under the Export and Import Permits Act, 1947, c. 17. The goods
were to be shipped from Montreal to New York for furtherance to a South
American country. The evidence consisted of a customs bill of lading, produced
from the records of the Collector of Customs at New York, on which a signed
entry was endorsed to the effect that the goods had been shipped from the
United States destined to a

[Page 108]

European country. The bill had been prepared for admittance of
the goods to the United States and was required by the law of that country.

Held: As to counts other than 6 and 7, the document was
admissible.

Held further: As to counts 6 and 7, the copies of
documents before the Court were improperly admitted and the appeal as to these
counts was allowed.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench,
appeal side, province of Quebec 1,
reversing the trial judge's decision and convicting the appellant.

A. Tourigny Q.C. and J. Drapeau for
the appellant.

G. W. Hill Q.C. and J. G. Ahearn
Q.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by:—

Rand J. : The
charge against the accused was for exporting tin plate from Canada to an
ultimate destination not authorized by the permit for the export, and the
substantial question in the appeal concerns a rule of evidence.

The goods were shipped from Montreal to New York for
furtherance by water to a country in South America on bills of lading showing
the accused to be the shipper. For admittance to the United States at the
border point, what is called a customs bill of lading is made out by the
railway on behalf of the shipper from the information furnished on the bill of
lading; and since, on such a transit through the United States, the goods must
be in bond, the customs bill of lading, supplemented, undoubtedly, by an
official seal placed on the car, evidenced the receipt of the goods from the
Customs authorities and committed them to the Collector of Customs at New York.
The document was produced in court from the records of the Collector by his
assistant solicitor. Endorsed on it was a signed entry that the goods had been
shipped from the United States destined to a European country.

That control of the goods by the customs department of the
government, effected by the customs bill of lading, was required by the law of
the United States. In order that the transit be cleared, it was necessary that
the goods should be exported and the entry to that effect on the records of the
Customs Collector made in the course of public duty authenticates that fact.
The document accepted in evidence contained such a record, and the question is
whether it was admissible.

[Page 109]

The argument made to us somewhat confused the admissibility
of an entry made strictly in the course of business and one made pursuant to a
public duty. The rule in, relation to the latter does not seem ever to have
been doubted. As early as 1785 in R. v. Aickles 2, it is said:

The law reposes such a confidence in public officers that it
presumes they will discharge their several trusts with accuracy and fidelity;
and therefore whatever acts they do in discharge of their public duty may be
given in evidence and shall be taken to be true, under such a degree of caution
as the nature and circumstances of each case may appear to require.

In Doe v. France 3, Erle J. says:

It depends upon the public duty of the person who keeps the
register to make such entries in it, after satisfying himself of their truth.

In Irish Society v. Bishop of Derry 4, Parke B. says:

The bishop in making the return discharged a public duty,
and faith is given that they would perform their duty correctly; the return is
therefore admissible on the same principle on which other public documents are
received.

In Richardson v. Mellish 5, in admitting a list showing the
names, capacities and descriptions of all persons embarked on a ship, Best
C.J., overruling an objection, said:

For the purpose of proving the damage, the plaintiff put in
a list returned by a captain under the authority of 53 Geo. III, cap. 155. It is
contended that that paper was not evidence against third parties. I am
decidedly of opinion that there is no foundation for that objection. This is a
public paper made out by a public officer under a sanction and responsibility
which impel him to make that paper out accurately; and that being the case, it
is admissible in evidence, on the principle on which sailing instructions, the
list of convoy, and the list of the crew of a ship are admissible.

The grounds for this exception to the hearsay rule are the
inconvenience of the ordinary modes of proof and the trustworthiness of the
entry arising from the duty, and that they apply much more forcefully in the
complex governmental functions of today is beyond controversy. They have equal
force in the case of an entry made pursuant to a duty under a foreign as well
as a domestic law ; People v. Reese 6 (Cardozo C.J.). In the infinite
variety of commercial relations we have with the United States, it would be
virtually impossible in such a case as that before us to establish proof if
this long accepted rule could not

[Page 110]

be invoked; and since the Court retains a discretion in
admitting the document, any special circumstances tending to qualify the
dependability of the entry would be subjected to judicial scrutiny.

It was urged by Mr. Tourigny, however, that for two of the
shipments there was no evidence that the ultimate destination had been other
than that authorized by the permit. The original documents in the office of the
Customs Collector in New York had been mislaid and were not available and
photostat copies tendered were rejected; there is, therefore, no evidence of
the destination of export from New York before the Court. It is necessary,
then, to consider, first, the precise requirement of the permit that is alleged
to have been violated and the extent to which that violation can be said to be
shown by the documents before us.

Sec. 5 of the Export and Import Permits Act reads :

No person shall export or attempt to export from Canada any
goods included in a list established pursuant to section three of this Act
except under the authority of and in accordance with a permit issued under this
Act.

The permit given the accused is headed
""Application for permit to export war materials and other goods"" ;
the name of the consignee is Charles Brauner, New York; the country of ultimate
destination is stated to be Peru ; and the application is granted ""subject
to the conditions entered on the reverse side of this permit."" No such
conditions are shown.

All that can be deduced from this, as the charge laid shows,
is that to be exported in accordance with the permit, the goods must have as
their ultimate destination a point in Peru.

The first of these two counts, No. 6, is supported by bill
of lading for Car No. 29107 stated to have been shipped in bond to New York
City for export ""under T. & E. entry to Callao, Peru."" ; the
second, No. 7, by bill of lading for Car No. 144541, shipped likewise in bond
to New York for export ""under T. & E. entry to Callao, Peru."" The
former is endorsed ""intended for S.S. Copgapo, Chilean Line"" ;
the latter ""intended for S.S. Santa Louisa, Grace Line."" I am
unable to see how it can be contended that these acts of the accused in Canada
contained in the directions and entries on the bill of lading can be taken to
evidence a shipment in violation of the permit.

[Page 111]

A further point was taken that the notice of appeal by the
Crown was insufficient. There was admittedly an error in the description of the
charges from the acquittal on which the appeal was being taken; but the
references to the Court and to the dates of the adjudications made clear to the
accused both the error in the description and the judgments against which the
appeal was being taken. Mr. Tourigny frankly conceded that the accused was in
no way misled.

Under sec. 1018 (2) of the Criminal Code the time
within which notice of appeal may be given may be extended at any time by the
Court of Appeal. The point was considered by that Court in this case, but was rejected,
which can only mean that the notice was dealt with in such a manner as brought
the appeal properly before the Court. There is no question of the jurisdiction
to do that and we would not interfere with a discretion so exercised.

I would, therefore, alow the appeal as to counts 6 and 7 and
dismiss it as to the others.

Appeal dismissed except as to counts 6 and 7.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE
 OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Trial by jury—Refusal of motion made by
accused for trial by an English jury—Accused fluent in both official
languages—What is language habitually spoken by accused—Criminal Code, ss. 923,
924, 937, 1023.

The law does not give to an accused in the Province of Quebec
who moves that he be tried by a jury entirely composed of jurors speaking the
French language or entirely composed of jurors speaking the English language an
unconditional right to be tried accordingly or, at least, tried by a mixed
jury. His right is limited to demanding trial by a jury skilled in whichever of
the two official languages of the Province is the language habitually spoken by
him. (Cartwright J., being of the view that this Court had no jurisdiction,
expressed no opinion upon the question).

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench,
appeal side, province of Quebec 1,
affirming, Bissonnette and Casey JJ.A. dissenting, the appellant's conviction
on a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of an automobile.

Lucien Gagnon for the appellant.

Georges Sylvestre Q.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux JJ.
was delivered by:—

Fauteux J.:—Accusé, dans le district de Joliette, province de Québec, d'y avoir
commis l'offense d'homicide involontaire, l'appelant—dont la langue maternelle
est l'italien et qui parle aussi le français et l'anglais couramment, depuis
plusieurs années,—demanda, lors de la mise en accusation d'être jugé par un
jury de langue anglaise. A cette requête, la Couronne fit objection et à la
suite d'une enquête ordonnée et tenue pour déterminer la langue parlée par
l'accusé, la demande fut rejetée et la cause s'instruisit devant un jury de
langue française. Trouvé coupable, Piperno porta la cause en appel 2, invoquant plusieurs moyens qui
tous, sauf un, furent unanimement rejetés. Seul

[Page 293]

le grief ""qu'il avait droit à un jury
anglais"" donna lieu à une dissidence. La majorité des Juges concluant
qu'en fait, le français était la langue habituellement parlée par l'accusé
depuis plusieurs années, déclara le grief mal fondé et, comme conséquence,
l'appel fut rejeté. Les dissidents adoptèrent sur le point une vue contraire
avec, évidemment, une conclusion différente quant au résultat.

Piperno invoque maintenant cette dissidence et
les dispositions de l'article 1023 du Code Criminel pour en appeler
devant cette Cour.

Assumant que nous ayons juridiction, je
n'hésiterais pas, vu l'opinion majoritaire et finale de la Cour d'Appel sur la
question de fait, à rejeter comme elle ce pourvoi. Car je ne crois pas que la
loi ou l'interprétation qu'on en a fait jusqu'à ce jour dans la province de
Québec, donnent à un accusé qui demande à être jugé par un jury composé
entièrement de jurés parlant la langue française ou par un jury composé
entièrement de jurés parlant la langue anglaise, un droit absolu de réussir sur
cette demande, ou d'obtenir, à tout le moins, d'être jugé par un jury mixte,
i.e., par un jury composé d'au moins six personnes versées dans la langue de
l'accusé.

La loi. Il convient de reproduire les
dispositions des articles 923 et 924 du Code Criminel,—dispositions
d'exception, respectivement applicables dans les provinces de Québec et du
Manitoba,— et aussi celles de l'article 937 lequel, référant à ces deux
dispositions spéciales, les interprète et en donne ainsi la véritable portée:—

923. Dans ceux des districts de la province de
Québec où le shérif est tenu par la loi de dresser une liste de petits jurés
composée moitié de personnes parlant la langue anglaise, et moitié de personnes
parlant la langue française, il doit, dans son rapport, mentionner séparément
les jurés qu'il désigne comme parlant la langue anglaise, et ceux qu'il désigne
comme parlant la langue française, respectivement; et les noms des jurés ainsi
assignés sont appelés alternativement d'après ces listes.

2. Dans tout district, le prisonnier peut,
lorsqu'il est mis en jugement, demander par motion, d'être jugé par un jury
entièrement composé de jurés parlant la langue anglaise, ou entièrement composé
de jurés parlant la langue française.

3. Sur présentation de cette motion, le juge
peut ordonner au shérif d'assigner un nombre suffisant de jurés parlant la
langue anglaise ou la langue française, à moins qu'à sa discrétion il
n'apparaisse que les fins de la justice sont mieux servies par la composition
d'un jury mixte. S.R., c. 146, art. 923; 1925, c. 38, art. 23.

[Page 294]

924. Lorsqu'une personne mise en jugement
devant la Cour du banc du Roi pour le Manitoba demande un jury composé de
moitié au moins de personnes versées dans la langue de la défense, si c'est la
langue anglaise ou la langue française, elle est jugée par un jury composé; de
moitié au moins, des personnes dont les noms se trouvent les premiers à la
suite les uns des autres sur la liste générale des jurés, et qui, comparaissant
et n'étant point légalement récusées, sont, de l'avis de la cour, trouvées
versées dans la langue de la défense.

2. Lorsque par suite du nombre de récusations
ou pour toute autre cause, le nombre des personnes versées dans la langue de la
défense est insuffisant, la cour remet le procès à un autre jour, et le shérif supplée
à l'insuffisance en assignant pour le jour ainsi fixé tel nombre supplémentaire
que la cour ordonne de jurés versés dans la langue de la défense et dont les
noms se trouvent inscrits après les premiers, à la suite les uns des autres,
sur la liste des petits jurés. S.R., c. 146, art. 924.

937. Lorsqu'une personne accusée d'une
infraction qui lui donnerait droit à vingt ou à douze récusations péremptoires
comme susdit, demande à subir son procès devant un jury composé pour moitié de
personnes versées dans la langue de la défense, en vertu des articles neuf cent
vingt-trois ou neuf cent vingt-quatre, le nombre de récusations péremptoires
auquel elle a droit doit être partagé de manière qu'elle n'ait le droit de
récuser péremptoirement que la moitié de ce nombre parmi les jurés de langue
anglaise, et la moitié parmi les jurés de langue française, S.R., c. 146, art.
937.

Notons d'abord, incidemment, que dans ces
trois articles d'exception, il n'est pas question de la nationalité, des
origines, traditions ou mentalité des jurés ou de l'accusé. Seule la question
de langue est considérée.

Disons ensuite que suivant ces articles 923 et
924, il est permis, dans les provinces de Québec et du Manitoba respectivement,
à un accusé de faire un choix de jurés en tenant compte de la langue qu'ils
parlent. Mais alors que l'article 924 indique manifestement que cette faculté
donnée à l'accusé se fonde et se conditionne sur la similitude entre sa langue
et celle familière aux jurés qu'il réclame, au contraire, l'article 923,
considéré isolément, n'indique pas cette raison et ne pose pas cette condition.
Au premier abord, le droit donné à l'accusé par ce dernier article paraît donc
absolu. On ne voit pas le pourquoi de cette différence. Et on s'expliquerait
encore moins les dispositions de l'article 937, où ces deux articles 923 et 924
reçoivent, sur le point, une seule et même interprétation,—interprétation
d'ordre législatif,—n'était-ce la disposition suivante d'une loi d'avant la
Confédération, demeurée en vigueur dans la province de Québec et qui, encore
plus explicitement que

[Page 295]

l'article 937 du Code, manifeste l'inexistence
de cette différence:—

Si le prévenu, lors de sa mise en accusation,
demande un jury composé, pour une moitié au moins, de personnes parlant la
langue de sa défense, si cette langue est le français ou l'anglais, il sera
jugé par un jury composé pour moitié au moins des personnes dont les noms se
trouvent successivement les premiers sur le tableau et qui lors de leur
comparution n'étant pas légalement récusées seront, d'apès l'opinion de la
cour, versées dans la langue du prévenu; (27-28 Viet. cap. 41, art. 7, para.
2).

Ce qui est sanctionné par la loi, c'est une
faculté donnée à un prévenu, dans la province de Québec, de demander à être
jugé par des jurés familiers avec la langue qu'il parle lui-même—pourvu que ce
soit le français ou l'anglais—et le droit d'obtenir alors au moins un jury
mixte si, dans la discrétion du Juge, il apparaît que les fins de la Justice
soient ainsi mieux servies qu'en faisant droit à sa demande. L'objet évident de
ces dispositions assurant à l'accusé, s'il le requiert, l'instruction de son
procès devant douze ou au moins six jurés versés dans sa langue, est qu'il
puisse facilement en suivre le cours et, alors, exercer plus adéquatement ses
droits. En somme, le droit d'un accusé de choisir un jury entièrement composé
de jurés parlant la langue française ou entièrement composé de jurés parlant la
langue anglaise n'est pas, en ce sens, un droit absolu; et le droit d'obtenir
alors un jury mixte—étant lui-même, suivant l'article 923, un droit dépendant
de l'existence du droit de choisir un jury entièrement composé de jurés de
langue française ou un jury entièrement composé de jurés de langue
anglaise—n'est lui-même absolu qu'en tant qu'un choix entre deux tels corps de
jurés soit d'abord autorisé par la loi. Disons, enfin, qu'il va de soi qu'un
accusé qui procède à cette demande peut être appelé à justifier du droit de ce
faire et qu'il appartient alors au tribunal d'adjuger sur la matière. Dans le
cas où l'accusé ne parle qu'une des deux langues officielles et dans le cas où,
parlant les deux, il est plus familier avec l'une qu' avec l'autre, il est dans
les conditions pour exercer la faculté qui lui est reconnue par cet article.
Mais, dans l'hypothèse où ces deux langues lui seraient également familières,
les dispositions de la loi n'ayant plus d'objet ne sauraient s'appliquer car,
alors, qu'un seul, que plusieurs ou que même les douze jurés soient versés dans
la langue française ou dans la langue anglaise, ou dans les deux, dans tous les
cas, le corps du jury est versé dans une langue familière à l'accusé.

[Page 296]

La jurisprudence. Je crois que c'est la
première fois que cette Cour est appelée à rendre un jugement sur le point;
mais les décisions que la Cour d'Appel de la province de Québec a été appelée à
rendre sur la question s'accordent, en substance, avec l'interprétation et les
conclusions résultant de cette analyse de la loi. Il suffit, je crois, d'en
donner la référence. Alexander v. Regem 3; Bureau v. Le Roi 4 ; Gouin v. Regem 5 ; Duval v. Le Roi 6 ; Lacasse v. Le Roi 7.

Pour ces motifs, je renverrais l'appel.

Cartwright J.:—The
appellant was convicted on a charge of manslaughter, arising out of the death
of one Denis Deslongchamps caused, as was charged, by the negligent operation
of an automobile by the appellant. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench
(Appeal Side) 8 the
conviction was affirmed by a majority judgment. Bissonnette and Casey JJ.,
dissenting, would have allowed the appeal and directed a new trial.

Special leave to appeal was not sought and our jurisdiction
is therefore restricted to a consideration of the point or points of law on
which the learned judges mentioned above differed from the majority of the
Court.

On the argument before us questions were touched on as to
the true construction of section 923 of the Criminal Code some of which
appear to me, on further consideration, not to be raised in the dissenting
judgments. In particular I think we are not at liberty to consider whether that
section gives to an accused in the Province of Quebec who moves upon
arraignment that he be tried by a jury entirely composed of jurors speaking the
English language or entirely composed of jurors speaking the French language an
absolute right to be either tried accordingly or tried by a mixed jury, and I
wish to make it clear that I am expressing no opinion upon that question.

As I read the judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench in
this case, all the learned judges are in agreement that the right given to an
accused by subsection (2) of section 923 is limited to demanding trial by a
jury entirely composed of

[Page 297]

jurors speaking whichever of the two official languages of
the Province of Quebec is the language habitually spoken by the accused.

The learned Chief Justice deals with the question as
follows:—

D'après certaines décisions, en particulier
celle de Alexander v. Le Roi (1930) 49 B.R. 215, la demande pour un jury de
medietate linguae est comprise ou incluse dans celle d'un jury entièrement
composé de jurés parlant la même langue (anglaise ou française), et le juge qui
dans sa discrétion peut refuser la requête pour la formation d'un jury
entièrement composé de jurés parlant un seul et même langage (anglais ou
français), devait donner en l'espèce un jury mixte s'il en arrivait à la
conclusion que la langue habituelle de l'accusé était l'anglais.

En autant qu'il s'agit d'un jury mixte, il y a
lieu de retenir que la loi ne se place aucunement au point de vue de l'origine
ou de l'ascendance de l'accusé, de l'endroit de sa naissance, du milieu dans
lequel il a vécu, de la religion à laquelle il appartient. Et il en est de même
en ce qui concerne le jury.

Tout ce que l'accusé, sujet britannique, a
droit d'obtenir, c'est que six des jurés soient versés 'skilled in' dans la
langue française, six dans la langue anglaise; pour l'accusé lui-même, son
droit lui viendra de ce qu'il parle habituellement une des deux langues
reconnues au pays, la langue française ou la langue anglaise.

St. Jacques J. agrees with the Chief Justice and says in
part:—

… L'enquête qui a été faite à ce sujet le
démontre d'une façon satisfaisante, et le juge n'a pas erré en permettant que
l'enquête soit faite devant un jury de langue française, car on peut dire que
c'est la langue habituelle que parle l'inculpé.

Pratte J. who also agrees with the Chief Justice says in
part:—

Si la langue maternelle de Piperno était
l'anglais, je dirais qu'il a droit à un jury mixte, nonobstant le fait que,
depuis plusieurs années, les circonstances ont requis qu'il parlât le français
plutôt que l'anglais. Mais tel n'est pas le cas. La langue maternelle de
Piperno est l'italien. Dès son jeune âge il a appris l'anglais et le français.
A son foyer, il parle les deux langues. Mais en dehors de chez lui il parle
surtout le français depuis plusieurs années, et il ne paraît pas, au témoignage
qu'il a rendu à l'appui de sa demande, que l'anglais lui serait plus facile à
parler ou à comprendre que le français. Dans ces conditions, sa seule
affirmation que sa langue habituelle est l'anglais ne me paraît pas suffisante
pour lui donner le droit d'exiger un jury anglais ou un jury mixte.

Turning then to the dissenting judgments, Bissonette J.
opens his judgment with the words:—

Je partage entièrement l'opinion de monsieur
le juge Casey.

[Page 298]

Casey J. says in part:—

The decisions then subsequent to the Alexander case have no
bearing on the problem presented in the case at Bar, and we are left with the
rule that the accused has the right to demand that he be tried by a jury
composed exclusively of jurors speaking his language, and if this request is
refused by the trial judge, the latter is bound to order the impanelling of a
mixed jury. The next step is to determine what is the language of the defence
and the test is given by Mr. Justice Rivard in the Alexander case. At page 219 he says:—

'Ainsi qu'il a été dit dans la cause de
Yancey, the language of the defence, c'est la langue, anglaise ou
française, habituellement parlée par l'accusé.'

If I have understood their reasons correctly the question to
which all the learned judges directed their minds and on which they differed
was whether on the evidence the learned judge who presided at the trial was
right in holding that French was and English was not ""la langue
habituellement parlée par l'accusé."" It is not questioned that the
appellant's mother-tongue was Italian and that he speaks both French and
English fluently. In such circumstances the question which of the last
mentioned languages is that habitually spoken by the appellant appears to me to
be one of fact or of mixed fact and law and therefore one into which we can not
inquire.

For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Trial—Appeal—Jury’s verdict set aside by
appellate court—Crown appeals—Power of Supreme Court to
restore verdict—The Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1927, c. 36, s. 1024—The Supreme Court Act,
R.S.C. 1927, c. 86, s. 46.

The respondent, on evidence
that was wholly circumstantial, was found guilty by a jury of unlawful assault
with intent to rob. The Ontario Court of Appeal, Hogg J.A. dissenting, set the
conviction aside on the ground that there was no evidence implicating the
accused to go to the jury. The Crown appealed on the ground that the dissenting
judgment was right in law.

Held: (Cartwright J. dissenting),
that the appeal should be allowed and the order of the Court of Appeal set
aside.

Held: also, (Kerwin J.
dissenting), that an order should be made restoring the verdict of the jury.

Per: Taschereau, Kellock and
Fauteux JJ.: The suggestion that a difference as to the person appealing, i.e.
the Crown, or an accused, calls for a distinction in law as to this court’s powers find no support
either in the enactments defining them, (the Criminal Code, s. 1024; the
Supreme Court Act, s. 46), or in the judicial pronouncements
interpreting such enactments, Manchuk v. the King [1938] S.C.R.
341 at 349; Savard and Lizotte v. the King [1946] S.C.R. 20 at
33, 39; Lizotte v. the King [1951] S.C.R. 115. Since it does not
appear that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable and this court being in as
good a position to decide that question as the court below, it should,
consonant with the diligence required in the proper administration of justice,
do so.

Per: Kerwin J. (dissenting in
part). The dissent was on the question of law—whether, there was any evidence to go
to the jury. Hogg J.A. was right in holding there was, but the majority of the
Court having decided the contrary, did not determine the question raised in the
respondent’s notice of appeal, that
even if there was such evidence the verdict should be set aside as
unreasonable. It had the authority to do so whereas the jurisdiction of this
court is strictly limited and the situation on an appeal by the Crown is different
from that when the accused is the appellant and, therefore, the decision in Fraser
v. the King [1936] S.C.R. 296 is not applicable. An order should therefore
go that the case be remitted to the Court of Appeal in order that it may, if
leave be given, pass upon the point, the only one upon which the respondent is
entitled to its decision.








Cartwright J. dissenting,
entertained doubts as to the jurisdiction of this court, as it seemed to him
implicit in the reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal, that they had
held the conviction ought to be set aside under s. 1014(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code, a ground of fact or of mixed fact and law. Dealing with the matter
however on the assumption that the sole ground of the decision of the majority
of the

[Page 4]

Court of Appeal was that
there was no evidence to go to the jury and that the ground of dissent was that
there was, he would have dismissed the appeal.

APPEAL by the Crown
pursuant to the provisions of s. 1023 (3) of the Criminal Code from the
judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal[1], Hogg J.A. dissenting,
which allowed the appeal of the accused from his conviction and directed an
acquittal.

C.P. Hope, Q.C. for the
appellant.

C.F. Scott for the
respondent.



KERWIN
J.: (dissenting in part):—After a joint trial with a
jury, the respondent McKay, and Wood and Quinlan were convicted of having
unlawfully assaulted a person with intent to rob. Wood did not appeal and on
the appeal of McKay and Quinlan, counsel for the Crown admitted that there was
no evidence to connect the latter with the offence charged, and
the Court of Appeal therefore allowed his appeal and set aside his conviction.
Judgment on McKay’s appeal was reserved and
ultimately the Court of Appeal by its judgment set aside his conviction and
directed an acquittal with Hogg J.A. dissenting. From that judgment the Crown
appeals.



Having
considered the reasons for judgment of the majority, delivered by Laidlaw J.A.,
and those of the dissenting judge, I am of opinion that the dissent is on the
question of law whether there was any evidence to go to the jury. I also
conclude that Hogg J.A. was right in holding that there was legal evidence
against the present respondent upon which the jury were entitled to find the
respondent guilty.










In an
appeal by the Crown to this Court an accused may raise the other grounds of law
taken by him before the Court of Appeal. The respondent argued that he was at
least entitled to a new trial because of alleged defects in the trial judge’s charge to the jury but I
think there was no such defect. The trial judge put it to the jury as to
whether the respondent had access to the “hide” or secret closet, and in my opinion
that was sufficient without the necessity of referring to the question of
possession of the “hide”. It was also contended
that the trial judge had charged the jury

[Page 5]



that
the Crown had proven beyond any doubt that the signatures which appear on some
of certain writings were McKay’s signatures. This is based
upon the absence in the transcript of the word “no” but, in any event it is quite clear
from what immediately follows that the trial judge was not saying that to the
jury but in fact something diametrically opposite. Finally, there is no
substance in the argument that the trial judge failed to deal adequately with
the case against the respondent as distinct from the case against Wood. The
appeal should therefore be allowed and the order of the Court of Appeal set
aside.



However,
in his notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal the respondent asked leave to
appeal on questions of fact. After deciding that there was no evidence to go to
the jury, the Court of Appeal did not proceed to determine that, even if there
was evidence, the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it was
unreasonable. They had the authority so to do but our jurisdiction is strictly
limited. In considering the proper order to be made on an appeal by the Crown, the
situation is far different from that when the accused is the appellant and,
therefore, in my opinion the decision in Fraser v. The King[2], is not applicable, even
though, here as there, the evidence against the accused be purely
circumstantial. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the respondent’s application to the Court
of Appeal for leave to appeal on questions of fact was granted, and the proper
judgment appears to me to be to remit the case to that Court in order that it
may, if leave had been given, or will be given, pass upon the question as to
whether the verdict was unreasonable in the light of all the evidence. That is
the only point upon which the respondent will have a right to a decision of the
Court of Appeal.



The
judgment of Taschereau, Kellock and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:—



FAUTEUX
J.:—For the reasons given by my
brother Kerwin, I agree that the appeal of the Attorney General should be
allowed and the order of the Court of Appeal set aside.



With
respect, however, to the order to be then made by this Court, I think that the
verdict of the jury should be restored.








[Page 6]



As to
authority to make such an order, I have no doubt. The relevant terms of s. 1024
of the Criminal Code and of s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act are:—



1024:—The Supreme Court of Canada
shall make such rule or order thereon, either in affirmance of a conviction or
for granting a new trial, or otherwise…
as the justice of the case requires.



46:—The Court may… give the judgment… which the court whose
decision is appealed against, should have given…



In Manchuk
v. The King[3], Sir Lyman Duff,
delivering the judgment of the majority, said at page 349:—



There
remains for consideration the grave question as to the order that ought to be
made by this Court. We have concluded, after full consideration, that, by force
of section 1024, coupled with the enactments of the Supreme Court Act, this
Court has authority, not only to order a new trial, or to quash the conviction
and direct the discharge of the prisoner, but also to give the judgment
which the Court of Appeal for Ontario was empowered to give in virtue of s.
1016(2);



In Savard
and Lizotte v. The King[4], Taschereau J., speaking
for the majority, stated at page 33:—



La
question de droit qui donne juridiction à cette Cour, qui en réalité la saisit
du litige, est formulée par la Cour du Banc du Roi, mais le remède qui doit
être apporté, quand elle est jugée fondée, est du ressort de cette Cour, qui
peut et doit alors rendre l’ordonnance que requiert la
justice. (Manchuk
v. The King3).



The
view of Kellock J., on the point, is thus expressed at page 49:—



While
the existence of a dissent on a question of law, as provided by section 1023,
is a condition precedent for an appeal to this Court, in a case like the
present, this Court, once seized of the appeal is not limited to the remedy
considered appropriate in the dissent, but has complete jurisdiction to direct
the remedy which, in its opinion, the Court appealed from ought to have
granted.



In Lizotte
v. The King[5], Cartwright J., delivering
the judgment of the Court, said at the bottom of page 135:—



In
my opinion, once this court reaches the conclusion, on one or more of the
points properly before it, that there has been error in law below it is
unfettered in deciding what order should be made by the views expressed in the
Court of Appeal.










It is
true that in each of these cases, the appeal, contrary to what is the situation
in the present instance, was entered by the accused and not by the Crown. But
the suggestion that this difference as to the person appealing calls for a
distinction in law as to the powers of this Court finds, in

[Page 7]



my
respectful view, no support, either in the enactments defining them or in the
above judicial pronouncements interpreting such enactments.



As to
the appropriateness of this order in the present case, I am equally satisfied.
The initial question which this Court had affirmatively to answer in order to
reach the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed, was whether, contrary to
the view of the majority in the Court below, there was, in the record, legal
evidence upon which a jury was entitled to find the respondent guilty. The
evidence being wholly circumstantial, the question, in the light of the
classical direction to the jury as laid down by Alderson B., in the Hodge’s case[6], was, more precisely,
whether a jury could be satisfied “not
only that those circumstances were consistent with his having committed the
act, but also that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person.”



In the
consideration of the question, the reasonableness of a verdict of guilty based
upon such evidence is not, to say the least, a foreign matter. On an exhaustive
review of the evidence, it does not appear that the verdict of the jury was
unreasonable.



In this
view, it would not, in my opinion, be consonant with the diligence required in
the proper administration of justice in criminal matters to return this case to
the Court of Appeal in order that it may pass on that question, i.e., whether
the verdict is unreasonable, which this Court is in as good a position as the
former to determine.



The
appeal should be allowed and the verdict of the jury restored.



CARTWRIGHT
J. (dissenting):—The respondent was tried
jointly with one Woods and one Quinlan before Le Bel J. and a jury and all
three were convicted on the charge that “on or about the 12th of November,
1952, being armed with offensive weapons, they did unlawfully assault Gordon
Robinson, an employee of the Canadian Bank of Commerce with intent to rob him
of the property of the Bank then in his charge or custody as such employee;”








[Page 8]



The
respondent and Quinlan appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Counsel for
the Crown stated that in his opinion there was not sufficient evidence to
support the verdict against Quinlan and the Court of Appeal being of the same
opinion thereupon allowed his appeal and directed his acquittal. The Court
later delivered judgment in the case of the respondent allowing his appeal and
directing his acquittal. Hogg J.A., dissenting, would have dismissed the
appeal.



It is
common ground that the evidence against the respondent was wholly
circumstantial. During the argument I entertained doubts as to our
jurisdiction, which have not been completely dispelled, as it seemed to me to
be implicit in the reasons of the majority, delivered by Laidlaw J.A. and
concurred in by Mackay J.A. that in their opinion the conviction ought to be
set aside under s. 1014(1) (a) of the Criminal Code, that this
ground was one of fact or of mixed fact and law, and would not be invalidated
by reason of its being held, as was done by Hogg J.A., that there was
sufficient evidence for the consideration of the jury to justify the refusal of
the learned trial judge to direct a verdict of acquittal.



As,
however, the majority of this Court are of opinion that we have jurisdiction, I
propose to deal with the matter on the assumption that, as was argued by
counsel for the appellant, the sole ground of the decision of the majority of
the Court of Appeal was that there was no evidence to go to the jury and that
the ground of dissent was that there was such evidence. It is too late to
question the rule that whether or not there is any evidence (as distinguished
from sufficient evidence) to support a verdict is a question of law.



On this
assumption, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.



The
learned counsel for the Crown at the trial made it clear in his opening address
that he was proceeding on the theory that there was evidence from which the
jury could properly find that, shortly after the robbery, the respondent was,
jointly with Woods, in possession of certain articles of a highly incriminating
nature (the most important being a key taken from the bank during the robbery)
which were found by the Police in “a
hide” reached through a
concealed

[Page 9]










door in
a closet opening off a room in the flat of which Woods was the tenant. As I
read the reasons of the Court of Appeal the real difference between the view of
the majority and that of Hogg J.A. was as to whether there was evidence from
which the jury could infer that the respondent had joint possession of such
articles.



After
reviewing the relevant evidence Laidlaw J.A. says in part:—



There
was no evidence that he (the respondent) had any rights of access to that hide,
and no evidence from which it could be found that he had possession or the
right of possession, jointly or otherwise, to it.



After a
similar review Hogg J.A. says in part:—



The
question before this Court is whether the circumstances which I have outlined,
furnished any evidence from which the jury could draw an inference that the
appellant had joint possession with Woods of the aforesaid articles.



The
learned Justice of Appeal goes on to decide that there was evidence from which
the jury could draw such inference.



I do
not think that any useful purpose would be served by my again reviewing the
evidence. After a careful consideration of all of it I find myself in agreement
with the conclusions of the majority in the Court of Appeal (i) that there was
no evidence from which the jury could infer that the respondent had possession
of the incriminating articles in “the
hide”, and (ii) that, lacking
the basis for such a finding of possession, the other circumstances relied upon
by the Crown could not be found to be inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion than that the accused was guilty.



I would
dismiss the appeal.

Appeal allowed and verdict
of jury restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE
 OF QUEBEC

Criminal Law―Evidence―Failure to charge jury
of danger of accepting evidence of perjured accomplice on a vital issue.

Where a judge fails to properly instruct a jury on the great
danger of accepting the evidence of an admittedly perjured accomplice on a
vital issue, a conviction cannot stand. The rule in Moreau v. the King [1944]
1 D.L.R. 462; 80 Can. C.C. 290 cited in Rex v. Stack and Pytell [1947]
3 D.L.R. 747 at 762; 88 Can. C.C. 320 at 327, approved.

Per: Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. It
appears from the evidence in the record that a verdict of guilty by a jury
properly instructed and acting judicially would not be open to review as
unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence. Therefore a new trial should be
ordered.

Per: Rand and Oartwright JJ., (dissenting in part). On
the evidence a properly instructed jury should have acquitted the accused and
therefore this court should direct that a judgment of acquittal be entered.

[Page 53]

APPEAL from the judgment of the
Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1
affirming (Barclay and Hyde JJ. dissenting) the conviction of the appellant
before Girouard J. and a jury on a charge of assault with intent to do bodily
harm.

Remi Taschereau for the
appellant.

Antoine Lacourcière, Q.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.
was delivered by:―

Taschereau J.:―I
agree with my brother Cartwright that the learned trial Judge failed to
properly instruct the jury on the great danger of accepting the evidence of an
admittedly perjured accomplice on a vital issue, and that as a result of that
omission, the conviction cannot stand.

However, I would not direct a judgment of acquittal. I am
not satisfied that a verdict of guilty rendered on the evidence in the record,
by a jury properly instructed and acting judicially, would be open to review as
unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence. There is I think some evidence
that must be left for the sole consideration of the jury, and I would therefore
order a new trial.

The judgment of Rand and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:—

Cartwright J.
:―This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal
Side) pronounced on the 13th of February, 1953, affirming by a majority the
conviction of the appellant, before Girouard J. and a jury, on a charge that
he, on the night of the 21st to the 22nd of July, 1951, with intent to maim or
disable Raoul Fortin or to do some other grievous bodily harm to him, did
unlawfully wound and cause grievous bodily harm to the said Raoul Fortin by
striking him on the head with a blunt instrument and causing a fracture of his
skull.

Barclay and Hyde, JJ. dissenting, would have quashed the
conviction and directed a new trial. The appeal is based, pursuant to section
1023(1) of the Criminal Code, on their dissent on the point of law
stated in the following words in the formal judgment:―

the trial judge failed to instruct the jury on the great
danger of accepting the evidence of an admittedly perjured accomplice on a
vital issue …

[Page 54]

Two questions arise for our consideration, first whether the
verdict can stand, and secondly, if it must be set aside, whether we should
order a new trial or direct that a judgment of acquittal be entered.

The learned trial judge warned the jury in terms to which no
exception is taken of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence,
of an accomplice but he failed to give them any direction in regard to the fact
that Giroux had on two previous occasions made statements on oath which were in
direct conflict with the evidence which he had given at the trial on a vital
point.

I respectfully agree with Barclay and Hyde JJ. that, in the
circumstances of this case, the omission to direct the jury in this regard was
an error in law so serious as to require that the conviction be quashed. I do
not find it necessary to refer to all the authorities which were discussed by
counsel. I am in respectful agreement with Hyde J. that the applicable rule is
correctly stated by Errol McDougall J. who gave the judgment of the majority in
Rex v. Stack and Pytell 2 in the following words:―

Where the testimony of a principal Crown witness is in direct
conflict with a prior sworn statement made by him the trial Judge must caution
the jury in the strongest terms with respect to the danger of accepting his
evidence, and the failure to do so will necessitate a new trial,
notwithstanding that the trial Judge properly instructed the jury with respect
to the evidence of such witness in the event that they concluded that he was an
accomplice.

With the greatest respect for the contrary view entertained
by the majority in the Court of Queen's Bench I do not think that the
circumstance that counsel for the defence stressed the fact of the conflicting
statements having been made in any way absolved the learned trial judge from
the duty of dealing with them.

It remains to consider whether or not a new trial should be
directed. After an anxious perusal of the whole record I had prepared somewhat
lengthy reasons dealing with this question, referring to the evidence in
considerable detail and reaching the conclusion that we ought to direct an
acquittal. However, as the majority of the Court are of opinion that a new
trial should be ordered and it is not usual to discuss the details of the
evidence when that course is to be followed, I propose simply to state the
result at

[Page 55]

which I arrived. I am of opinion that on the evidence in
this record a properly instructed jury should have acquitted the appellant and
that therefore we should not direct a new trial.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a
judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered.

Appeal allowed; new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.

Criminal law—Evidence—Conspiracy to sell, etc. narcotic
drugs—Certificates of analysts only evidence of narcotics—Whether certificates
admissible—No objection by defence—Testimony of analysts heard before Court of
Appeal—Whether Court has that power and whether it could then affirm
conviction—Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, S. of C. 1929, c. 49, s.
18—Criminal Code, ss. 1014, 1021.

The appellants were found by a jury to be guilty on three
charges laid under s. 573 of the Criminal Code of conspiracy to possess,
to sell and to transmit narcotic drugs in violation of the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, (S. of C. 1929, c. 49). The only proof tendered at
the trial that the substance was a narcotic drug, consisted of certificates of
two analysts. The analysts were not heard as witnesses, although one of them
was offered for cross-examination. Counsel for the accused did not at any time
object to the admission of the certificates nor to the trial judge's reference
to them in his charge as being ""conclusive evidence"" of the substance
of the narcotic drug. On appeal, the accused contended that this evidence,
although admissible under s. 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, on
a charge under that Act, was not admissible where the charge was one of
conspiracy under the Code. Thereupon, the Crown asked for, and obtained,
leave under s. 1021 of the Code to call the analysts at the hearing of
the appeal; their testimony was heard in the absence of the accused, who
declined to attend but who were represented by counsel who cross-examined the
witnesses on behalf of the accused. The Court of Appeal for Manitoba affirmed
the convictions.

By leave granted by this Court, the accused appealed on two
questions of law: (a) whether the Court of Appeal was empowered under
ss. 1014 and 1021(1) (b) of the Criminal Code to allow the
Crown to produce before that Court the oral evidence given by the analysts, and
(b) whether the Court of Appeal was empowered on such evidence, taken in
conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the convictions.

Held: The appeals should be dismissed and the
convictions affirmed since the Court of Appeal was justified in allowing the
taking of further evidence and in affirming the convictions (Kerwin J.,
dissenting in part, would have ordered a new trial).

Per Kerwin, Estey and Locke JJ.: The certificates were
not admissible in evidence (Desrochers v. The King, 69 C.C.C 322,
overruled). (Taschereau J. expressing no opinion on that question, and Fauteux
J. contra).

[Page 344]

Per Taschereau, Estey and Locke JJ.: In the
circumstances of this case, having considered that it was necessary or
expedient in the interests of justice to admit further evidence on a
non-controversial issue, the Court of Appeal did not infringe any principle of
law governing the exercise of the power to hear further evidence given to it by
s. 1021 (1) (b) of the Code, whose provisions are available to a
respondent as well as to an appellant.

Since there is no restriction as to the effect to be given by
the Court of Appeal to the further evidence in disposing of the appeal under s.
1014 of the Code, and since the evidence heard before the Court of
Appeal was in its nature conclusive and did not reveal new facts that might
influence a jury to come to a different conclusion, the Court of appeal
followed the proper course in confirming the convictions.

Per Fauteux J.: The additional evidence, introduced in
appeal, was not essential to legally support the verdict since the certificates
were admissible evidence of the facts therein stated, as on a true
interpretation of s. 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act the
prosecution in the present case was a prosecution under that Act. (Simcovitch
v. The King [1935] S.C.R. 26 and Robinson v. The King [1951]
S.C.R. 522 referred to). But in any event, although the failure to object to
inadmissible evidence is not always fatal, since the defence manifested a
positive intention to accept the certificates as sufficient evidence of the
facts therein stated or else opted to attempt to preserve a possible ground of
appeal, the accused cannot now raise this point; and, as there was no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, the appeal should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin J. (dissenting in part) : The Court of
Appeal was empowered by s. 1021 (1) (b) of the Code to direct
that further evidence be taken to support the convictions of the appellants,
but it was not empowered on the evidence of the analysts taken before it and on
the evidence at the trial to affirm the convictions because it would thereby be
usurping the functions of the jury; it is impossible to say what view the jury
might have taken if they had heard the analysts and hence it cannot be said
that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred within s.
1014(2) of the Code.

APPEALS from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba 1 affirming the appellants' convictions
by a jury on charges of conspiracy to sell, etc. narcotic drugs in violation of
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929.

Harry Walsh and C. N. Kushner for the appellants. The
certificates of analysis were wholly inadmissible in evidence, they were not
proof of a drug or drugs within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug
Act, 1929, and the jury should not have been directed that these
certificates constituted such proof and that the jury was to take the contents
of the said certificates as conclusive evidence of the facts stated therein,
since s. 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, is not applicable
to a charge of conspiracy

[Page 345]

under s. 573 of the Criminal Code. It is clear from the
wording of s. 18 of the Act, that the departure from the ordinary rules
of evidence requiring oral testimony, is only authorized in a prosecution under
that Act. It became therefore vitally necessary for the prosecution to
prove the existence of narcotic drugs within the meaning of the Act. When
the certificates are eliminated there is no proof anywhere of the existence of
a drug. The jury therefore should have been directed that there was a complete
lack of proof of the existence of any drug within the meaning of the Act.

The Court of Appeal having come to the conclusion that the
jury's verdict was unsupported by proper evidence, and that the certificates
had been improperly admitted in evidence, should have allowed the appeal under
s. 1014(1) (a) of the Code (Govin v. The King
2
and The King v. Drummond 3).

For an interpretation of what is meant by the words
""having regard to the evidence"" in s. 1014(1) (a) of the Code,
the case of R. v. Dashwood 4 is referred to.

The Court of Appeal had no power to order the examination of
the analysts before that Court. S. 1021 (1) (b) of the Code must
be interpreted as referring only to the hearing of ""newly-discovered
evidence"" or ""new evidence"" and not to evidence that was known
and that could have been produced at the trial as was the case here.
Furthermore, s. 1021 (1) (b) applies only to evidence that is brought
forward on behalf of an appellant in order to set aside the verdict of a jury,
but not to the evidence that is tendered by a respondent in order to supply
gaps in a case or to support or bolster up a verdict. All the decisions both in
England and Canada point up the fact that such evidence will not be received
unless it was such that could not have been adduced at the trial and the power
to hear fresh evidence is exercised with great caution. S. 1021 was first
passed in Canada in 1923 and is practically the same as s. 9 of the English
Criminal Appeal Act, 1907. A resume of the English decisions indicates that
the instances in which evidence is admitted before the Court of Appeal are very
limited and that, without exception, so far as can

[Page 346]

be found, it is always at the instance of the appellant in the
case that new evidence is admitted, if at all. (McGrath v. R. 5,
Thorne v. R. 6, Hyman Kurasch v. R. 7,
Warren v. R. 8, Knox v. R. 9,
Hullett v. R. 10, Allaway v. R. 11,
William Ward v. R. 12,
Mason v. R. 13,
Weisz v. R. 14, Starkie v. R. 15,
R. v. Mortimer 16, R. v. Hewitt 17, R. v. Dutt 18, R. v. McGerlymchie 19,
R. v. Livock 20
and R. v. Robinson 21). It
would be usurping the function of the jury altogether, if every time a certain
essential bit of evidence was not proved properly and by evidence properly
admissible, by the prosecution, it was permitted to the Crown respondent to
adduce that evidence before the Court of Appeal in order to have the appeal
dismissed.

A resume of the Canadian decisions also indicates that the application
can only be made by an appellant who is seeking to upset the verdict of the
jury or trial Court and cannot be invoked by a respondent in order to fill a
gap in the evidence presented to the jury. Neither the case of R. v. Feeney
22 nor R. v. Buckle 23
support the course that was adopted by the Court of Appeal in hearing the
analysts. The case of Berret v. Sainsbury 24 is
useful to show what is done in civil matters where the Court has the same power
as given by s. 1021.

Even if the Court of Appeal did have the power to hear the
evidence of the analysts, such evidence could only be used for the purpose of
determining whether there should be a new trial or an acquittal, and could not
be used for the purpose of taking same in conjunction with the evidence given
at the trial, and then used to dismiss the appeal. The Court of Appeal should
have allowed the appeal since there was no proof adduced of any drugs within
the meaning of the Act, and then either quash the convictions or direct a new
trial (R. v. Drummond 25).

[Page 347]

S. 1014(2) of the Code cannot effect the result of a
dismissal of the appeal, since the onus is on the respondent to show that the
balance of the evidence, apart from the impugned certificates, would certainly
or inevitably result in a conviction of the appellants. Without the
certificates there cannot have been any possibility of conviction of any of the
appellants since there was then no proof of the existence of any drugs within
the meaning of the Act. (Northey v. The King 26).

A. M. Shinbane, K.C., for the respondent. The
certificates were admissible in evidence (Jacobs v. R. 27
and Desrochers v. The King 28.

The Court of Appeal was empowered to allow the respondent to
produce before that Court the oral evidence given by the analysts. S. 1021(1) (b)
of the Code gives it that power. This section corresponds substantially
to s. 9 of the English Criminal Appeal Act, 1907. But the Court of
Criminal Appeal has no jurisdiction to direct a new trial and this limitation
of power in some measure at least accounts for the reluctance of that Court to
allow evidence to be called which might have been heard at the trial. (R. v.
Mason 29). Almost all the reported cases deal
with ""fresh"" or ""new"" evidence. Here the evidence was
merely supplementary and confirmatory. Inasmuch as the form in which their
evidence was tendered was to be considered faulty, the analysts were called
merely to confirm the accuracy of their analyses, the introduction of which as
evidence and the reference thereto were not at any time objected to by the
defence at any stage of the trial. But under s. 1021, the evidence may
be of a character other than ""new"" or ""fresh"".

Although the omission by the defence to object does not
prevent the defence from raising the objection in the Court of Appeal,
nevertheless that omission was a circumstance properly to be considered by the
Court. It indicated that the defence either shared in the mistake of the
prosecution and the Court, or believed that the accused was not substantially
prejudiced by the erroneous form in which the proof of drugs was put before the
jury. More so in this case when the notice of appeal arguing that the
certificates were

[Page 348]

not admissible was filed the day after the verdict was
rendered and on the same day that sentence was passed. (R. v. Stirland
30
and R. v. Cutter 31).

The power and the practice of the Court of Appeal in respect
of fresh or new evidence not tendered at the trial may be summarized thus: (a)
The Court has power to admit it; (b) It is a power which must always be
exercised with great care; (c) The Court will not lay down any
definition of what will constitute exceptional or special circumstances; (d)
The Court will allow evidence to be given which might have been given at
the trial, if it is satisfied that the omission was due to a misunderstanding,
inadvertence or mistake. (R. v. Robinson 32, R.
v. Weisz 33, R. v. Hullett 34,
R. v. Warren 35, R. v. Knox 36
and R. v. Collins 37.

Furthermore, that section is a remedial provision and there is
no ambiguity in its language. (R. v. Robinson et al 38
and R. v. McTemple 39.

The Court of Appeal was empowered on the evidence of the
analysts taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to confirm the
convictions, as there was then such overwhelming evidence of guilt that no
reasonable jury on a proper direction could or would have failed to convict the
appellants, and there was therefore no miscarriage of justice. The converse of
the principle in R. v. Gach 40
is applicable to the present case, and the Court of Appeal was authorized to
dismiss the appeal by ss. 1014, 1021 of the Code, and by the provisions
of the Court of Appeal Act of Manitoba. Because fresh evidence or further or
additional evidence is admitted on appeal, it does not follow that the case
must be sent back for a new trial (R. v. Feeney 41 and R.
v. Buckle 42.

The accused had a trial by jury, because, apart from anything
else, there was ample evidence to support the verdict as found out by the Court
of Appeal, and therefore there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice.

[Page 349]

Kerwin J.
(dissenting in part):—The four appellants were found by a jury to be guilty on
three counts of an indictment charging conspiracies to commit indictable
offences, i.e., to unlawfully sell drugs, to unlawfully possess drugs, and to
unlawfully cause drugs to be taken or carried from one place to another in
Canada—all within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, as
amended, without first having obtained a licence. Convictions were entered and
sentences imposed. From these convictions they appealed to the Court of Appeal
for Manitoba (1) and during the hearing of their appeals the Crown applied to
be allowed to produce before the Court of Appeal, in support of the convictions,
the evidence of two analysts who had certified that certain material sold,
possessed, or taken or carried, was a narcotic drug within the meaning of the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act. The certificates had been put in evidence as if the
prosecutions had been under that Act instead, as was the fact, for
conspiracies under section 573 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the
sale, possession, taking or carrying was given as part of the evidence upon
which the charges of conspiracy were based.

The Court of Appeal 43 granted the Crown's
application and the evidence of the analysts was taken. Upon that evidence and
the evidence at the trial, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals of the
accused. By leave granted under subsection 1 of section 1025 of the Code as
enacted by section 42 of chapter 39 of the 1948 Statutes, the accused appeal to
this Court on the following questions of law:

(1) On the appellants' appeal from their conviction was
the Court of Appeal for Manitoba empowered under sections 1014 and 1021 (1) (b)
of the Criminal Code or otherwise to allow the respondent to produce
before that Court the oral evidence actually given?

(2) If so, was that Court empowered, on such evidence
taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the conviction, or
was it authorized merely to order a new trial?

[Page 350]

As to the first point, section 1021 (1) (b) of the Code
is in the following terms:

1021. For the purposes of an appeal under this Part, the
court of appeal may if it thinks it necessary or expedient in the interest of
justice

. . .

(b) if it thinks fit, order any witnesses who would
have been compellable witnesses at the trial to attend and be examined before
the court of appeal, whether they were or were not called at the trial, or
order the examination of any such witnesses to be conducted in manner provided
by rules of court before any judge of the court of appeal, or before any
officer of the court of appeal or justice of the peace or other person
appointed by the court of appeal for the purpose, and allow the admission of
any deposition so taken as evidence before the court of appeal; and

exercise in relation to the proceedings of the court of
appeal any other powers which may for the time being be exercised by the court
of appeal on appeals in civil matters, and issue any warrants necessary for
enforcing the orders or sentences of the court of appeal.

It is contended that by the words ""For the purposes of
an appeal under this Part"", Parliament never intended to give the Crown,
on an accused's appeal, the right to ask, or to give the Court the right to
permit, that evidence be heard in support of the conviction of the appellant,
particularly when the trial had been with a jury. Emphasis is placed upon
section 1014 of the Code which provides that on the hearing of an appeal
against conviction the Court of Appeal shall allow the appeal if it is of
opinion

(a) that the verdict of the jury should be set aside
on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to
the evidence; or

(b) that the judgment of the trial court should be
set aside on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of law;

It is said that the convictions cannot be supported on the
evidence because without the certificates there was no evidence that the material
in question was a drug within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug
Act. Testimony was given at the trial by which, the Crown contends, the
jury would have been entitled to find that it was such a drug. The Court of
Appeal evidently felt that proposition to be doubtful because, if it were
sound, there would have been no occasion to order the taking of the evidence of
the analysts. Presuming in the meantime that this is so, the question is
squarely raised as to the power of the Court of Appeal to make the order.

[Page 351]

We are told that no Canadian case can be found where
evidence was taken before the Court of Appeal to support a conviction. Reliance
is placed upon the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Rex v. Drummond 44, where it was
held that on a charge of perjury committed at the trial of an indictment, such
trial and the indictment, verdict and judgment therein must be proved as
matters of record and this not having been done, the conviction was set aside.
It is to be noted that that part of section 1021 quoted above was first enacted
by section 9 of chapter 41 of the Statutes of 1923, so that at the time of the Drummond decision there was no power in the Court of Appeal
to receive further evidence. In another case, which was not referred to, Rex
v. Ivall 45, the Ontario Court of Appeal ordered a
new trial on a charge that the accused removed a child under the age of
fourteen years from the custody of the Children's Aid Society where, on the
first trial, the child's age had not been proved. No application was made for
leave to produce the evidence before the Court of Appeal.

The 1923 Act was taken from the Criminal Appeal Act of
England, 1907, and no decisions have been found in England in which the
Crown was given leave to do as was done here. In Rex v. Robinson 46,
an application was made by the Crown to introduce evidence that arose after the
conviction and therefore could not have been called at the trial, but this was
on the basis that such evidence would have a material bearing on the accused's
application for leave to appeal from a conviction in view of the fact that one
of the grounds stated in the application for leave was that the verdict was
against the weight of the evidence and in those circumstances one question that
would have to be considered was whether there had been any substantial
miscarriage of justice. The evidence admitted was a letter written by the
accused in which he admitted the act which it was alleged constituted murder.

The case does show that further evidence will be admitted
although there it was of something that occurred after the trial. However, the
ground of the decision was the provision in the Criminal Appeal Act that
the Court of Criminal Appeal may exercise in relation to the proceedings in

[Page 352]

the Court any other powers which might for the time being be
exercised by the Court of Appeal in appeals on civil matters. Considering the
similar provisions of section 1021, it appears to me that they are sufficient
to empower the Court of Appeal to direct that further evidence be taken.

On the argument, the attention of counsel was directed to
the decision of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of
Quebec in Desrochers v. The King 47. That
decision was not referred to before the Manitoba Court of Appeal 48
or on the application for leave to appeal to this Court. There, the accused
were charged under section 573 of the Criminal Code with having
conspired to commit an indictable offence under The Excise Act, 1934 By
section 113 of that Act: ""In every prosecution under this Act, the
certificate of analysis … shall be accepted as prima facie evidence"";
and in the French version: Dans toute poursuite en vertu de la présente loi, le
certificat d'analyse … est accepté comme prima facie. It was held that a
certificate was admissible by virtue of that section in the prosecution of the
charge of conspiracy under the Code.

Section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, enacts:
""In any prosecution under this Act a certificate as to the analysis of any
drug or drugs … shall be prima facie evidence."" The
French version reads: ""Dans toute poursuite instituée sous le régime de la
présente loi, un certificat relatif à l'analyse d'une drogue ou de drogues, …
constitue une preuve prima facie"". For present purposes,
this section, in either version, may be taken to bear the same meaning as
section 113 of The Excise Act, 1934, in either version. The present
proceeding not being a prosecution under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, section
18 thereof is inapplicable and the decision in Desrochers on that point
should be overruled.

Section 28 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1927,
chapter 1, reads as follows:

28. Every Act shall be read and construed as if any offence
for which the offender may be

(a) prosecuted by indictment, howsoever such offence
may be therein described or referred to, were described or referred to as an
indictable offence;

[Page 353]

(b) punishable on summary conviction, were described
or referred to as an offence ; and all provisions of the Criminal Code relating
to indictable offences, or offences, as the case may be, shall apply to every
such offence.

That section was considered by this Court in Simcovitch v.
The King 49 in conjunction with section 69 of the Criminal
Code by which anyone is a party to and guilty of an offence who ""(d)
counsels or procures any person to commit the offence."" It was held
that one who counselled a bankrupt to commit an offence specified in section
191 of the Bankruptcy Act was by the combined operation of section 28 of
the Interpretation Act and section 69 of the Code guilty of an
offence under section 191 of the Bankruptcy Act although that section,
by its terms, referred only to a person having been a bankrupt or in respect of
whose estate a receiving order has been made, or who had made an authorized
assignment under the Bankruptcy Act. That decision can have no
application here because, within the terms of section 28 of the Interpretation
Act, there is no provision of the Criminal Code which it is suggested
might be made applicable. On the contrary, the suggestion is that on a
prosecution under the Code a certificate of analysis is to be taken as prima
facie evidence merely because section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug
Act states that in any prosecution under that Act a certificate is
to be so treated. With respect I can find no justification for reading the
enactment in that manner.

It was argued that there was sufficient evidence without the
certificates but it must be borne in mind that having admitted them, the trial
judge instructed the jury that they were conclusive. I am not now dealing with
a situation where, on a charge of conspiring to commit an indictable offence
under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, the evidence of such conspiracy
is based upon something other than the actual commission of an offence itself.
What is relied upon in the present case to prove the conspiracy are specific
acts, and the circumstances that witnesses testified at the trial that the
article dealt with was heroin and that the accused, or some of them, so
designated it to those witnesses, are not sufficient. If articles be sold which
were mere substitutes for a narcotic and not within the class of specified
drugs, there would be no offence. On the other

[Page 354]

hand, the gist of an offence under section 573 of the Code
is the conspiracy itself, and in a proper case a jury might find that a
conspiracy existed to sell a specified narcotic without first having obtained a
licence.

In my opinion the second question raises a question of law
and the Court of Appeal was not empowered on the evidence of the analysts taken
before it and on the evidence at the trial to affirm the conviction because it
would thereby usurp the functions of the jury. It is not a matter of interfering
with a discretion exercised by the Court of Appeal since it is impossible to
say what view a jury might take if they had the analysts before them and hence
it cannot be said that no substantial wrong or miscarriage had occurred within
section 1014(2) of the Code.

The appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.

Taschereau J.:—The
appellants were jointly charged on four counts of conspiracy to violate the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act, and were found guilty on three.

At trial, the respondent filed certificates of analysis to
establish that the drugs which were possessed and sold by the appellants, were
heroine, a drug within the meaning of the Act, but the analysts
themselves were not heard. Section 18 of the Act is to the effect that
""in any prosecution under the Act"", such certificates signed by a
Dominion analyst, constitute prima facie evidence of the facts therein
stated.

Before the Court of Appeal 50, the appellants
submitted that, not having been prosecuted under the Act, but for
conspiracy under the Criminal Code, the certificates were illegal
evidence, and that the analysts should have been called. The Court of Appeal 51
obviously agreed with this contention, for at the request of the respondent, it
received the evidence of the analysts and unanimously confirmed the conviction.
Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by Mr. Justice Kerwin on the two
following questions of law:

(1) Was the Court of Appeal empowered under section
1014 and 1021 (1) and (b) of the Code or otherwise, to allow the respondent
to produce before that Court the oral evidence actually given?

[Page 355]

(2) If so, was the Court empowered on such evidence
taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the conviction or
was it authorized merely to order a new trial?

If a prosecution for conspiracy to possess and sell
heroine, is a prosecution under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, the
conviction was valid, and the Court of Appeal did not need to hear new
evidence; but in view of the conclusion which I have reached, I do not think it
necessary to determine this question.

Section 1021 (b) of the Criminal Code is as follows:

1021. For the purposes of an appeal under this Part, the
court of appeal may if it thinks it necessary or expedient in the interest of
justice.

(b) if it thinks fit, order any witnesses who
would have been compellable witnesses at the trial to attend and be examined
before the court of appeal, whether they were or were not called at the
trial, or order the examination of any such witnesses to be conducted in manner
provided by rules of court before any judge of the court of appeal, or before
any officer of the court of appeal or justice of the peace or other person
appointed by the court of appeal for the purpose, and allow the admission of
any deposition so taken as evidence before the court of appeal;

As to the power of the Court of Appeal to hear fresh
evidence, I have no doubt, if any meaning is to be given to section 1021(b),
which states that ""for the purposes of the appeal"", witnesses may be
examined before the court. It is obviously in order to enable the court to
properly determine the case, that such a power is conferred, and these plain
words used by the legislator must be given effect to. Otherwise, the section
would be nugatory, and Parliament's expressed intentions would be defeated.

This section corresponds substantially to section 9(b)
of the English Criminal Appeal Act 1907. It has been held in England that this
authority to hear new evidence must be used with ""great care"" and in
""exceptional circumstances"" only, and I think that the rule here is
the same. (Rex v. Mason) 52 ; (Rex v. Rowland)
53.
A too liberal exercise of this power would undoubtedly conflict with the
economy of our criminal law, would in certain instances give the Crown a second
chance to make a case which it has failed to make at trial, and could possibly
also invest a court of appeal with powers exclusively within the province of
the jury.

[Page 356]

But in the case at bar, in view of the special
circumstances, I think that the Court of Appeal was right in granting the
application made by the Crown to hear the analysts. The accuracy of the facts
contained in the certificates were not an issue before the jury, and all
parties seemed to agree that the drug had been properly proved. Although the
failure of counsel for the defence to object to illegal evidence, cannot as a
rule be considered as fatal, it is important to note in the present case, that
he declined to cross-examine one of the analysts who was present at the trial,
and offered by the Crown. The Court of Appeal merely corrected an error upon
which the jury acted, and as Dysart J. said, it has put the case in exactly the
position in which the jury believed it to be, when they convicted the accused.

Under section 1014, Cr. Code, the Court
of Appeal could confirm or order a new trial, and I think that it followed the
proper course in adopting the former. The fresh evidence was in its nature
conclusive and did not reveal new facts that might influence a jury in coming
to a conclusion.

I would dismiss the appeals.

Estey J.:—The
appellants, whose conviction for conspiracy contrary to s. 573 of the Criminal
Code was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 54, have,
by way of a further appeal, been granted leave, under s. 1025 of the Criminal
Code as amended in 1948 (S. of C. 1948, c. 39, s. 42), to submit two
questions of law to this Court:

""(1) On the Appellants' appeal from their
conviction was the Court of Appeal for Manitoba empowered under sections 1014
and 1021 (1) (b) of the Criminal Code or otherwise to allow the
Respondent to produce before that Court the oral evidence actually given?

(2) If so, was that Court empowered, on such evidence
taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the conviction, or
was it authorized merely to order a new trial?""

These appellants were charged upon four counts of conspiracy
to unlawfully (a) sell, (b) possess, (c) cause to be taken
and (d) distribute, drugs within the meaning of

[Page 357]

The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, and thereby to
have committed an offence contrary to the provisions of s. 573 of the Criminal
Code. At their trial before a judge and jury they were found guilty of (a),
(b) and (c).

The Crown established the conspiracy by adducing evidence of
specific instances of selling, possessing and causing to be taken, drugs
contrary to The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. As proof of the fact that
the commodity dealt with in each instance was a narcotic drug, ten certificates
of analysis were placed in evidence without objection. Counsel for the Crown,
in tendering these certificates, was under the impression that they were
admissible by virtue of the provisions of s. 18 of The Opium and Narcotic
Drug Act. This impression was concurred in by the learned trial judge. S.
18 reads as follows:

18. In any prosecution under this Act a certificate as to
the analysis of any drug or drugs signed or purporting to be signed by a
Dominion or provincial analyst shall be prima facie evidence of the
facts stated in such certificate and conclusive evidence of the authority of
the person giving or making the same without any proof of appointment or
signature.

The learned judges in the Court of Appeal held that the
provisions of s. 18 had no application to a trial for conspiracy under s. 573
of the Criminal Code and that the ten certificates prepared by the
analysts were improperly received. The learned judges, however, were of the
opinion that this was an appropriate case in which to hear viva voce evidence
of the analysts under the authority of s. 1021 (1) (b) of the Criminal
Code:

1021. For the purposes of an appeal under this Part, the
court of appeal may if it thinks it necessary or expedient in the interest of
justice.

. . .

(b) if it thinks fit,
order any witnesses who would have been compellable witnesses at the trial to
attend and be examined before the court of appeal, whether they were or were
not called at the trial, or order the examination of any such witnesses to be
conducted in manner provided by rules of court before any judge of the court of
appeal, or before any officer of the court of appeal or justice of the peace or
other person appointed by the court of appeal for the purpose, and allow the
admission of any deposition so taken as evidence before the court of appeal; …

and exercise in relation to the proceedings of the court of
appeal any other powers which may for the time being be exercised by the court
of appeal on appeals in civil matters, and issue any warrants necessary for
enforcing the orders or sentences of the court of appeal.

[Page 358]

Messrs. Jones and Blanchard, who had prepared these
certificates, were accordingly called as witnesses before the Court of Appeal
and there gave evidence to the same effect as set out in their respective
certificates.

S. 1021 (1) (b) was enacted by Parliament in 1923 and
is to the same effect as s. 9(b) of the Court of Criminal Appeal Act in
Great Britain (1907, 7 Edw. VII, c. 23). In the Court of Criminal Appeal the
corresponding English s. 9(b) was commented upon as follows:

Undoubtedly the Legislature has armed this Court with the
widest possible powers for the purposes of investigation, and in a proper case
this Court would not refuse to make use of the powers which are contained in
these paragraphs of s. 9.

Rex v. Thorne 55.

Parliament has indicated what is ""a proper case""
by expressly providing that the wide powers under s. 1021 (1) (b) shall
be exercised only where the court of appeal ""thinks it necessary or
expedient in the interest of justice."" Under this provision it has been
repeatedly held, as stated by the learned author of Archibald's Cr.
Pl., Ev. & P., 32nd Ed., p. 309, that

The Court will only act upon this power in very special
circumstances.

which, as pointed out by the Lord Chief Justice in Rex
v. Weisz 56, ""they had been careful not to
define."" A similar view is expressed in Rex v. MacTemple 57.
It, therefore, appears that if a court of appeal has concluded that the
circumstances are exceptional and directed the reception of the evidence its
decision should not be disturbed, unless, in arriving at its conclusion, it has
acted contrary to principle.

The learned judges of the Court of Appeal deemed the
circumstances here sufficiently special that, in the interest of justice, the
evidence of the analysts should be heard. It is an unusual case. Apart from a
statutory provision, such evidence as we are here concerned with can only be
received viva voce. S. 18 is enacted as part of, and is applicable only
""in any prosecution under,"" The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. Such
a provision has no application to a prosecution for an offence under s. 573 of
the Criminal Code. In so far as Desrochers v. The King 58,

[Page 359]

may be contrary to this view, it must be overruled. S. 28 of
the Interpretation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 1), which makes certain
provisions of the Criminal Code applicable to other statutes, does not
make the provisions of those other statutes applicable to prosecutions under
the Criminal Code and, therefore, does not assist the prosecution upon
this appeal.

We were informed that these certificates were placed in
evidence at the preliminary without objection. Then, when counsel for the
Crown, prior to the trial, decided that it was unnecessary for him to call all
the witnesses who could depose to the relevant facts, he prepared a list of
these, together with a summary of their evidence, and submitted it to counsel
for the appellant, with a request that if he desired any of these witnesses to
be called for the purpose of cross-examination that he so advise him. This list
included Jones, one of the analysts, who had prepared some of these
certificates. Counsel for the appellant replied that he desired that only one
Porter, whose evidence was not upon any question relative to the analysis of
the commodities, be alone produced for cross-examination. All of this was
explained before the presiding judge and appears in the record of the trial, in
part, as follows:

THE COURT: Your answer is, you don't wish him to call any
except Porter?

Mr. KUSHNER: I don't wish any witness called for the purpose
of cross-examination, other than Inspector Porter.

The failure of counsel for the defence to object to the
reception of inadmissible evidence does not, in general, constitute a bar to
the objection thereto in an appellate court, nor would it alone justify a court
of appeal in exercising its powers under s. 1021 (1) (b). It is,
however, an important circumstance in this case because it corroborates what
was evidenced throughout the trial that the main contentions of the defence
were not directed to whether the substances were narcotic drugs within the
meaning of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. In Stirland v. Director
of Public Prosecutions 59, Viscount Simon stated:

… the court must be careful in allowing an appeal on the ground
of reception of inadmissible evidence when no objection has been made at the
trial by the prisoner's counsel. The failure of counsel to object may have a
bearing on the question whether the accused was really prejudiced.

[Page 360]

Even if the certificates had been admissible under s. 18,
they were only prima facie evidence of their contents and if counsel for
the appellant had intended to raise any question as to their correctness or the
weight of the statements contained therein he would have, upon receipt of the
request from counsel for the Crown, asked that at least Jones be called for
cross-examination.

The certificates, though inadmissible, were received at and
accepted throughout the trial as evidence of the facts therein set out. The
Court of Appeal, under s. 1021 (1) (b), permitted these facts to be
placed in evidence by the calling of the witnesses Jones and Blanchard, who had
made the analyses and prepared the certificates and who deposed to the same
facts as set out in the certificates. In effect, the same facts are now
repeated in the record, but in a form admissible in law. Under these
circumstances the Court of Appeal, in concluding, in the interests of justice,
that the additional evidence should be received, has violated no principle and
has acted within its power under s. 1021 (1)

The contention of counsel for the appellant that the Court
of Appeal had no power to receive the evidence of Jones and Blanchard, because
in neither case was the evidence ""newly discovered"" or ""new
evidence"" unknown to the Crown at the time of the trial, is not tenable.
In support of his contention he cited a statement of Lord Chief Justice Goddard
in Rex v. McGrath 60, which had reference to the
disposition of the case when previously before the court and was not essential
to the decision of the case which was now before the court upon a reference by
the Secretary of State under s. 19(a), where, as pointed out in Rex v.
Collins 61, different considerations obtain.
Moreover, counsel, in his submission, would construe s. 1021 (1) (b) as
equivalent to the rule in civil cases for the granting of a new trial and the
reception of further evidence. The language of s. 1021 (1) (b) does not
support this submission. The incorporation of the reference to ""appeals in
civil matters"" follows and is in addition, or supplementary, to the powers
set out in subpara. (b) of

[Page 361]

1021(1). Moreover, neither in England nor in Canada has this
provision been so construed. Rex v. Dutt 62; Rex
v. Warren 63 ; Rex v. Hullett 64
; Rex v. Allaway 65; Rex v. Ward 66;
Rex v. Mason 67; Rex v. Knox 68 ; Rex
v. MacTemple 69 ; Rex v. Buckle 70.

The further submission of counsel for the appellant, that
the provisions of s. 1021 (1) (b) are applicable only in support of an
appellant who seeks to set aside a verdict of guilty, is not tenable. The
comprehensive language of the section is such as to make it applicable to both
the defence and the Crown and had Parliament intended any such limitation as
here suggested it would have adopted apt language to give expression thereto.
Moreover, in Rex v. Robinson 71, where the accused
appealed, the Crown was granted leave to call further evidence. The facts of
the case are quite different, but it does support the view that the provisions
of the section are available to the Crown as well as the defence. The section,
as already stated, gives wide powers to a court of appeal, to be exercised only
where that court properly concludes that the evidence should be received in the
interest of justice.

The second question assumes the power of the court of appeal
to hear the evidence, but suggests that, having done so, it is authorized
merely to order a new trial. There does not appear to be, nor was our attention
directed to, any provision in s. 1021 (1) (b), or elsewhere, to
the effect that the reception of evidence under that section by a court of
appeal limits or restricts that court in its disposition of the appeal under s.
1014. On the contrary, the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code rather
contemplate that the evidence so received shall form a part of the record and
be considered along with the evidence taken at the trial. If the court of
appeal finds that there are reasons within s. 1014(1) (a), (b)
and (c) to allow the appeal, it will do so, but, if not, then under
s. 1014(1) (d) it will dismiss the appeal. The Court of Appeal
was of the opinion that this case did not come under s. 1014(1) (a),

[Page 362]

(b) or (c), but under s. 1014(1) (d),
and, therefore, dismissed the appeal. Dysart J.A., speaking on behalf of
the Court, stated:

In the present case the fresh evidence is as nearly
conclusive as oral testimony can be. It is directed to only one point—the
scientific analysis of the material which the prosecution charges was a
narcotic drug; and it proves beyond any doubt that the material was a narcotic
within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. The evidence is of
highly competent analysts; it has no internal weakness or defect, and is not
contradicted nor challenged by any other evidence in the case.

This evidence was to precisely the same effect as the facts
set forth in the certificates. In cross-examination the witnesses were asked as
to the possibility of mistake or error, but their answers were such that this
contention was not pressed. What was attained by the calling of these witnesses
was the placing in the record, in a form admissible as evidence, facts which
erroneously had been treated as properly before the court at the trial. As
such, they were passed upon by the jury. In effect, it was, therefore, a change
in form rather than substance upon an issue in respect of which contentions
were not raised at the trial. No reason is suggested why a jury, acting
judicially, would not have come to the same conclusion.

In my opinion the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be
affirmed and the appeal dismissed.

Locke J.:—The
charge against the appellants in respect to the offence of conspiring to sell
narcotic drugs was:

That they, the said John Kissick, Peter Kissick, William
Kissick and Stella (Sally) Smallwood … conspired with each other and with other
persons unknown to commit an indictable offence, to wit: to unlawfully sell
drugs, within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, and
amendments thereto, without first having obtained a licence from the Minister
of National Health and Welfare or other lawful authority.

The charges as to the offences of possessing, carrying and
distributing narcotic drugs were expressed in similar terms.

The offences created by section 4 of the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act 1929 are indictable. Section 573 of the Criminal Code provides
that:

Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to
seven years' imprisonment who, in any case not hereinbefore provided for,
conspires with any person to commit any indictable offence.

[Page 363]

and it was under this section of the Code that
these proceedings were taken.

Section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act provides
that:

In any prosecution under this Act a certificate as to the
analysis of any drug or drugs signed or purporting to be signed by a Dominion
or provincial analyst shall be prim facie evidence of the facts stated
in such certificate and conclusive evidence of the authority of the person
giving or making the same without any proof of appointment or signature.

On the assumption that this section might be invoked in a
prosecution for conspiracy, ten certificates, certain of which were signed by
J. B. Jones and others by J. F. Blanchard, both Dominion analysts, were
tendered and received in evidence at the trial as proof of the fact that the
drugs said to have been sold by certain of the appellants were substances
mentioned in the schedule to the Act. Neither of the analysts gave oral
evidence. In advance of the hearing, however, counsel for the Crown had advised
counsel for the accused that there were eleven witnesses whose evidence would
be merely corroborative, these including the name of the analyst Jones, whom
the Crown did not propose to call, unless the defence wished any of them to be
called for the purpose of cross-examination, and was advised that they did not
wish Jones and others to be called for this purpose. The name of Blanchard was
not included in the list. In charging the jury Mr. Justice Montague instructed
them that they were to give full credence to the certificates and that the
facts stated in them were to be taken as ""proven conclusively"" and no
objection was made by counsel for any of the prisoners to this or any other
portion of the charge. The learned trial judge directed the jury to acquit the
appellants of the fourth of the charges, namely, that of conspiring to
distribute narcotic drugs, and of the three other charges they were all found
guilty and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment.

The present appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba 72, serving their notice on the day they
were sentenced and raising amongst other grounds the contention that the
certificates were inadmissible, since the prosecution was not under the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act. During the hearing of the appeal counsel for the

[Page 364]

Crown applied for leave to adduce oral evidence in support
of the conviction and orders were made that the evidence of the analyst Jones
be taken before the Court of Appeal, and that of the analyst Blanchard, who was
ill at the time, before Mr. Justice Adamson. The accused disclaimed any wish to
be present during these proceedings but they were represented by counsel who
cross-examined the witnesses on their behalf. In the result the convictions
were affirmed and the appeals dismissed.

The present appeal has been taken pursuant to special leave
granted by Kerwin J. and by whose order the questions of law to be determined
are thus stated:

""1. On the appellants' appeal from their
conviction was the Court of Appeal for Manitoba empowered under sections 1014
and 1021(1) (b) of the Criminal Code, or otherwise, to allow the
respondent to produce before that Court the oral evidence actually given?

2. If so, was that Court empowered on such evidence,
taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the conviction, or
was it authorized merely to order a new trial?""

Section 1013 of the Criminal Code grants a right of
appeal to the Court of Appeal to a person convicted on indictment in certain
defined circumstances, and subsection 4 of that section, introduced into the Act
in 1930, allows an appeal by the Crown from a verdict of acqittal on any
ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone. The powers of the
Court for disposing of such appeals are defined by section 1014. Section 1021
provides in part as follows:

For the purposes of an appeal under this Part, the court of
appeal may if it thinks it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice,

. . .

(b) if it thinks fit,
order any witnesses who would have been compellable witnesses at the trial to
attend and be examined before the court of appeal, whether they were or were
not called at the trial, or order the examination of any such witnesses to be
conducted in manner provided by rules of court before any judge of the court of
appeal or justice of the peace or other person appointed by the court of appeal
for the purpose, and allow the admission of any deposition so taken as evidence
before the court of appeal;

and exercise in relation to the proceedings of the court of
appeal any other powers which may for the time being be exercised by the court
of appeal on appeals in civil matters, …

[Page 365]

By the Court of Appeal Act, c. 40, R.S.M. 1940,
section 27, it is provided that the court upon any appeal, may give any
judgment which ought to have been pronounced and make such further or other
order as is deemed just, and by subsection 3 that:

the Court shall have full discretionary power to receive
further evidence upon questions of fact by oral examination in court, by
affidavit, or by declaration taken before an examiner or a commissioner.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal proceeded on the basis
that the certificates of the analysts were not admissible in evidence and the
application made on behalf of the Crown would indicate that this position was
accepted by counsel on its behalf. On the argument before us, however, counsel
for the Crown contended that section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act,
1929, applied to a prosecution such as this and that accordingly the facts
disclosed in the certificates of analysis were proven. If this contention could
be sustained, it would, of course, be unnecessary to deal with either of the
questions submitted. In my opinion, the certificates were not admissible and
the fact that the substances dealt in by the appellants were narcotic drugs,
within the meaning of the Act, was not proven. The offence for which the
accused were indicted was not that of committing any of the offences enumerated
in the Act of which section 18 forms a part, but rather the offence of
conspiring with others to commit such an offence, a conspiracy declared to be
indictable by section 573 of the Criminal Code. The opening words of
section 18 are ""in any prosecution under this Act"" and there could be
no prosecution under that Act for acts declared to be an offence by a
section of the Criminal Code and not elsewhere in any statute relating
to the criminal law. To invoke section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act
in a prosecution such as this would be to import a section of that Act into
the Criminal Code, and for this I find no warrant anywhere.

In ordering the taking of further evidence the Court of
Appeal has acted in the exercise of the discretion vested in it by section 1021
and the determination of the first question requires us to decide whether, in
so doing, it has acted upon the proper principle (Brown v. Dean) 73.
The relevant portions of section 1021, while not verbatim, are

[Page 366]

indistinguishable from the corresponding portions
of section 9 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1907 of England. There it
may be noted the court is not empowered to order a new trial. In Rex v. Mason
74
17 C.A.R. 161, Darling J., in delivering the judgment of the court on an
application to adduce further evidence, said in part:

It is now really asked that there should be a new trial,
which this Court is not empowered to order, and that we should hear certain
witnesses whose names have been mentioned, and then consider the whole of the
trial in the light of that new evidence. This Court exercises with very great
caution the power given it to hear fresh evidence because to do so is opposed
to the old established, trusted and cherished institution of trial by jury.
This Court has to be convinced of very exceptional circumstances before it will
reconsider the verdict of a jury in the light of fresh evidence which has not
been laid before the jury, and which, in some cases, might have been put before
the jury at the trial.

As to the evidence of proposed witnesses who were available
but not called at the trial, to the same effect is the judgment of that court
in Rex v. Hatch 75. In some cases such as Rex v. Warren
76,
where the witness was not called at the trial, due to a misunderstanding,
evidence has been received in the Court of Appeal but where, as in Rex v.
Weisz 77, on the appeal of the prisoner an
application was made to give the evidence of a woman who had been absent from
England at the time of the trial, Reading C.J., in refusing the application,
said that the appellant's legal advisers knew the case they would have to meet
and no application was made to adjourn the trial, that there was no surprise
and that the policy was deliberate of resting the defence upon the available
evidence. These were all cases where the appellant was the prisoner but in Rex
v. Robinson 78, where a prisoner applied for leave to
appeal, the Crown asked leave to put in further evidence, being a letter
written by the prisoner since his conviction in which he admitted committing the
offence, and this was permitted under the provisions of section 9 of the Act.

In Rex v. Collins 79,
further evidence was received on the appeal because the reference had been made
to the court by the Home Secretary who wanted the court to deal with it, but
Goddard L.C.J. pointed out the risk of allowing

[Page 367]

such evidence after conviction and the reason why it is not
done, save in exceptional circumstances, in these terms:

The danger of allowing further evidence to be called after
conviction, and the reason why the Court does not allow it save in exceptional
circumstances, is clear enough. It is very easy after a person has been
convicted to find witnesses who are willing to come forward and say this, that,
or the other thing. If further evidence were allowed in such circumstances, it
could always be said: ""If this evidence had been given at the trial, it
does not follow that the jury would have convicted, or they might not have
convicted."" That is especially true in cases where the defence is an alibi.
Two or three witnesses perhaps are called to establish an alibi, which the jury
reject. It is very often not difficult after conviction to find another witness
or perhaps two more witnesses who would be willing to come and support the
alibi, and it can always be said: ""If only the prisoner had had the
evidence of A or B which is now tendered, the jury might have come to a
different decision, and the prisoner should have the benefit of that
possibility."" That is one of the reasons why this Court is necessarily
reluctant to allow further evidence to be called after conviction.

Some further light on the construction which has been placed
upon the English Statute by the court is afforded by the judgment in Rex v.
Rowland 80, where, on an appeal against a conviction
on a charge of murder, an application was made on behalf of the appellant for
leave to call as a witness a man who, since the trial of the appellant,
confessed that he himself had committed the murder of which the appellant had
been convicted. Humphreys J., delivering the judgment of the court, after
pointing out that to permit this would involve an inquiry of a totally
different character from the simple issue involved in the calling of a fresh
witness to speak to some fact connected with the defence put forward at the
trial and in effect engage the court in trying not only the accused but also
the man who wished to confess to committing the crime, said in part (p. 462):

Now the court has in truth no power to try anyone upon any
charge. It is not a tribunal of fact but a court of appeal constituted by
statute to examine into the proceedings of inferior courts in certain cases of
conviction or indictment. We have no power even to direct a new trial by a
jury; much less have we the right to conduct one ourselves.

These general statements of the principles to be followed in
hearing such appeals in England, while indicating generally the reluctance of
the court to hear further evidence except under exceptional circumstances, do
not touch the exact point to be determined here where there was, in my opinion,
no sufficient evidence of a matter essential to the

[Page 368]

validity of the convictions, and counsel for the Crown seeks
to remedy the defect on the prisoners' appeal to the Court of Appeal. If the
application had been to give further evidence on the ground that its existence
had been discovered since the trial and the issue upon which the evidence was
tendered was controversial, the principles stated in the judgment of the
Judicial Committee in Hosking v. Terry 81 and in
the judgment of this Court in Varette v. Sainsbury 82,
would apply. In the view I take of the matter, however, these principles are
inapplicable in the circumstances of the present case.

Section 1021 does not restrict the power of the Court of
Appeal to permit further evidence to be given before it to cases where the
applicant is the appellant, but permits its admission also at the instance of
the respondent if, in the circumstances of the case, it is considered that to
do so is necessary or expedient in the interests of justice. If the evidence
sought to be introduced on the hearing of the appeal touch upon an issue which
is controversial, involving a consideration of the weight to be given to the
evidence, the court of appeal would be involved, as pointed out by Humphreys J.
in Rowland's case, in conducting a trial, and to do this, in my opinion,
is outside of anything contemplated by section 1021.

The reasons for judgment delivered on the application to
take the further evidence direct attention to the fact that, while all of the
accused were represented by counsel, no objection was made to the admission of
the certificates at the time they were offered in evidence, nor was the
objection raised on the argument of the motion made on behalf of the accused at
the conclusion of the Crown's case for a directed verdict of not guilty, nor
after the judge's charge in which he had instructed the jury that the
certificates were to be accepted as proof of the facts stated in them. From the
fact that the appellants were found guilty on October 25, 1950, and were
sentenced on the following morning, and that the notices of appeal were given on
the same day raising the objection to the admissibility of the certificates, an
inference might be drawn that the failure

[Page 369]

to object at the trial was deliberate. In Rex v. Sanders
83,
where copies of letters were introduced into the evidence by the Crown without
objection and where the prisoners were represented by counsel, Bray J. said
that the objection ought to have been taken at the time and, as it was not then
taken, it could not be entertained by the court. That this statement cannot be
taken without qualification appears from the judgment in Stirland v. Director
of Public Prosecutions 84, where Viscount Simon, L.C. said in
part:

No doubt, as was said in the same case (Rex v. Ellis
(1910) 2 K.B. 746,764), the court must be careful in allowing an appeal on
the ground of reception of inadmissible evidence when no objection has been
made at the trial by the prisoner's counsel. The failure of counsel to object
may have a bearing on the question whether the accused was really prejudiced.
It is not a proper use of counsel's discretion to raise no objection at the
time in order to preserve a ground of objection for a possible appeal, but
where, as here, the reception or rejection of a question involves a principle
of exceptional public importance, it would be unfortunate if the failure of
counsel to object at the trial should lead to a possible miscarriage of justice.

It is not the law, in my opinion, that the failure of
counsel for a prisoner to object to the admission of evidence is in all
circumstances fatal to an appeal taken on the ground that the evidence has been
improperly admitted. If it be assumed that in these circumstances the objection
may still properly be raised, the course adopted by counsel on behalf of the
appellants has made manifest that they did not consider the fact that the drugs
were of the nature referred to in the schedule to the Opium and Narcotic
Drug Act was open to dispute and did not intend to tender evidence to
dispute it. The accuracy of the evidence given in the Court of Appeal was not
open to question and where it is clear that there had been no intention on the
part of the accused persons to dispute the facts shown, I am unable to perceive
any principle of law governing the exercise of the discretion vested in the
court which has been infringed by receiving it. In my opinion, the answer to
the first question should be in the affirmative.

Section 1021 permits the taking of further evidence
""for the purposes of an appeal under this part."" I see no ambiguity
in this language nor anything in the section or elsewhere in the sections
relating to criminal appeals restricting, or indicating any intention of
restricting the

[Page 370]

effect to be given by the court to the further evidence in
exercising its powers under section 1014. I respectfully agree with Mr. Justice
Dysart that the evidence given before the Court of Appeal in this matter is as
nearly conclusive as oral testimony can be and that it was within the powers of
the Court to affirm the conviction and dismiss the appeals.

I would dismiss these appeals.

Fauteux J.:—At
the Summer Assizes of the Court of King's Bench, held in the Eastern Judicial
District, Province of Manitoba, the appellants were jointly tried, and on the
25th of October 1950, found guilty on three counts of conspiracy, i.e.,
conspiracy (a) to possess, (b) to sell, and (c) to
cause to be carried in Canada, without first having obtained a licence from the
Minister of National Health and Welfare, or other lawful authority, drugs
within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act.

Each of the appellants entered an appeal 85
against these convictions, raising inter alia, the following points:
beyond the prima facie proof, resulting from the production of several
certificates of analysis, it was argued that there was no evidence establishing
that the drugs referred to therein were drugs within the meaning of the Act,
and that such certificates, admissible as such proof on a charge of actual
possession, sale or transport, were inadmissible on a charge of conspiracy to
possess, sell or transport. These contentions eventually turned out to be those
on which the appeal fell to be determined. During the hearing, without acceding
to the appellants' views, the respondent, nonetheless, applied for and obtained
permission of the Court of Appeal—under section 1021 of the Criminal Code—to
take and introduce in the record, the oral evidence of the two Dominion
analysts who had issued these certificates filed at trial. The new evidence
having been taken and considered, the appeals were dismissed.

Thereupon and pursuant to an application made under section
1025 (1) of the Code, the appellants applied for and

[Page 371]

obtained leave to appeal to this Court on the following
questions of law:

(1) Was the Court of Appeal empowered under section
1014 and 1021 (1) and (b) of the Code or otherwise, to
allow the respondent to produce before that Court the oral evidence actually
given?

(2) If so, was the Court empowered on such evidence
taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the conviction or
was it authorized merely to order a new trial?

In my view, it does not appear necessary, for the proper
determination of this appeal, to deal with these two questions. For, while the
additional evidence, introduced in appeal, might serve to confirm the
conviction that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in the
premises, I have reached the conclusion that such evidence was not essential to
legally support the verdict rendered. In my view, as I propose to show, the
certificates of analysis were, in this prosecution, admissible evidence of the
facts therein stated and, in any event, the record discloses that the defence,
at trial, either chose—as it was, by law, entitled—not to hold the Crown to
strict proof with respect to this particular issue, or else, opted to attempt
to preserve a ground of objection for a possible appeal.

As to the admissibility of the certificates of analysis,
Section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act—hereinafter referred to as
the Act—is the relevant section. The opening words of the English and French
versions governing its operation must be quoted:

In any prosecution under this Act … Dans toute
poursuite sous le régime de la présente loi …

The adequate interpretation of these opening words cannot
legally be gained by merely considering them only within the narrow compass of
the section, or even of the Act in which they are found. It must rather
be gathered in the full light of the relevant provisions of the Interpretation
Act, particularly sections 15 and 28. The true import of section 15 was
recently considered in Robinson or Robertson v. The King 86,
particularly at pages 529, 530. Section 28 was equally considered by this Court
in Simcovitch v. The King 87. In that case, Sir
Lyman Duff, applying

[Page 372]

the provisions of the latter section to section 191 of the Bankruptcy
Act, under which the appellants were prosecuted, said that section 191 must
be read and construed on the footing that the provisions of the Criminal
Code apply-to the offences created by it. The same principle must prevail
as to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act and so must its provisions,
creating offences, be read and construed.

In this broader view, the following may be said. The opening
words of section 18 are, on one hand, quite adequate to prevent the application
of the section in the case of a prosecution entirely foreign to the Act, e.g.
one exclusively under the Code. Thus, if a person sells a quantity of
drugs, falsely representing them to be heroin, and obtains thereby a sum of
money, the Crown could not, on a prosecution under section 405 of the Criminal
Code, prove by means of a certificate of a Dominion analyst, the nature of
the drugs sold, for this would not be a prosecution authorized under the Act.
I cannot, however, convince myself that the all-embracing meaning of the
language ""In any prosecution under this Act"", would be apt to include
within the operation of section 18, prosecutions of offences nominally
mentioned in the Act—such as the sale of drugs—and at the same time, be apt to
exclude from its operation prosecutions of the other offences—such as counselling
or conspiring to sell drugs—which Parliament by, and only by, the very same
provision in the Act, virtually created and, therefore, rendered subject
to prosecution. By force of section 28, in making the sale of drugs an offence,
Parliament effectively thereby made the counselling of a sale, or the
conspiracy to sell drugs, offences, and authorized by the Act itself, in
each case, a prosecution. The prosecution of any of these offences is, in my
view, a prosecution under the Act. The opening words of section 18 are
not ""In any prosecution for an offence under the Act"", but ""In
any prosecution under the Act"".

In Desrochers v. The King 88, a
case which was not quoted before the Manitoba Court of Appeal nor on the
application for leave to appeal to this Court, the Court of Appeal of the
Province of Quebec has, on a charge of conspiracy to commit an offence under
the Excise Act, admitted as evidence the certificate of analysis
authorized under the

[Page 373]

latter Act in terms similar to those of section 18.
This decision, rendered in 1937, was always followed in the Province of Quebec.

I do not find it necessary, however, to discuss this point
any further, for the following reason, which led me to the conclusion that the
additional evidence, introduced in appeal, was unessential to legally support
the verdict rendered by the jury, is by itself sufficient.

As indicated above, the record in this case discloses the
following facts: Defence counsel at trial entirely and consistently refrained
from making any objection when these certificates—twelve in number—were filed
by the Crown; properly notified, pursuant to a local practice, of the actual
presence in Court of one of the Dominion analysts, who had issued some of them,
and that, if heard, his testimony would bear on the facts therein appearing,
counsel for the defence not only refrained from taking advantage of the
opportunity to cross-examine him but positively indicated the intention not to
do so; at the close of the evidence for the prosecution, a motion for non suit
was made on behalf of the appellants, but the point as to the admissibility of
the certificates was not even mentioned; the appellants were not heard at
trial, nor was there any evidence adduced by the defence, nor was there any
attempt to assail the facts mentioned in the certificates.

At the close of the judge's address, several objections were
made by counsel for the defence; but, again, and though the judge had, in plain
terms, instructed the jury that the certificates were positive evidence of the
facts they mentioned, nothing was said, in this respect, by the defence. The
verdict was rendered late on the afternoon of the 25th and the sentence imposed
in the forenoon of the 26th and, on the same day, the notice of appeal which
was served revealed, for the first time, this ground for complaint.

A large discretion is given to counsel in the conduct of the
defence. Particularly, and under section 978 of the Criminal Code, it
was open to counsel to make any admission as to any of the issues which the
Crown had to prove as part of its case. Likewise, and in respect to the
relevant issue, the defence had the discretion not to hold the Crown to strict
legal proof. In my view, the whole conduct of

[Page 374]

the defence, in this case, manifested at trial a positive
intention to accept the certificates as sufficient evidence of the facts
therein stated, and to disregard them as one of the issues on which the case
was fought, by the accused, represented by counsel.

In Davis and Ridley 89, Darling J., as he then
was, said at page 139:

It is stated that in opening the case, counsel for the
prosecution stated matters which were not evidence against the appellant Davis
on his trial, but we have been unable to find the admission of any evidence
that could be objected to; but if it were so, if counsel on the other side do
not object, it is not obligatory on the judge to do so. When a prisoner is
defended by counsel and he chooses, for reasons of his own, to allow
such evidence to be let in without objection, he cannot come here and ask to
have the verdict revised on that ground.

In The King v. Sanders 90, the
accused was charged with obtaining money by false pretences. During his opening
speech, counsel for the prosecution proposed to read copies of letters alleged
to have been written to the appellant by the prosecutor's wife and solicitor.
As no notice to produce the original letters had been given to the defence,
objection was taken and maintained äs to the reading of
such copies. However and in the course of the examination of the complainant by
the Crown, these copies were admitted in evidence without any objection from
counsel for the defence. The accused having been convicted, appealed on the
ground that the copies of the letters were wrongly admitted. The judgment of
the Court (Bray, Avory and Sankey, JJ.) was delivered by Bray J. At page 553,
Bray J. said:

In our opinion, if it was intended to rely on this point,
the objection should have been repeated at the time the evidence was tendered,
and not having been taken then, it cannot now be taken in this Court, at all
events, when the prisoner was represented by counsel.

Said Viscount Simon in Stirland v. The Director of
Public Prosecutions 91.

There is no universal rule that a conviction cannot be
quashed on the ground of the improper admission of evidence prejudicial to the
prisoner unless an application is made at the time by counsel for the prisoner
for the trial to begin again before another jury. It has been said more than
once that a judge when trying a case should not wait for objection to be taken
to the admissibility of the evidence but should stop such questions himself. If
that be the judge's duty it can hardly be fatal

[Page 375]

to an appeal founded on the admission of an improper
question that counsel failed at the time to raise the matter. No doubt the
Court must be careful in allowing an appeal on the ground of reception of
inadmissible evidence when no objection has been made at the trial by the
prisoner's counsel. The failure of counsel to object may have a bearing on the
question whether the accused was really ""prejudiced."" It is not a
proper use of counsel's discretion to raise no objection at the time in order
to preserve a ground of objection for a possible appeal.

These authorities are sufficient to support the proposition
that, as to the consequences of the failure to object, there is no steadfast
rule, and that, while the failure to object to inadmissible evidence is not
always fatal, it cannot be said that it is never so.

Indeed, as stated by Lord Sankey in Maxwell v. Director
of Public Prosecutions 92:

… the whole policy of English criminal law has been to see
that as against the prisoner every rule in his favour is observed and that no
rule is broken so as to prejudice the chance of the jury fairly trying the true
issues. The sanction for the observance of the rules of evidence in criminal
cases is that, if they are broken in any case, the conviction may be
quashed.

In the present case, however, the record, as indicated
above, discloses more than a mere omission to object, as it shows a consistent
conduct in this respect and a clear and positive intention not to deal with
this particular point as being one in controversy in the case.

It might be, as it was intimated, that the defence acted in
this way to preserve a possible ground of appeal; if so, the open conduct of
the defence sufficiently defeats such a purpose, to which I would not find it
consonant with the due administration of justice, to give effect.

With all these circumstances, there was, in the premises, no
principle involved, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

The appeal, in each case, should be dismissed.

Appeals dismissed.

LEON AZOULAY APPELLANT

AND

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN RESPONDENT.

PRESENT: Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau, Rand, Estey
and Fauteux JJ. 

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL
SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law-Abortion-Jury trial-No review
of evidence by trial judge.

The appellant, charged with having
unlawfully used instruments or other means on the deceased woman with intent to
procure her miscarriage, was found guilty of manslaughter. His conviction was
affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal for Quebec, the dissenting
judgment holding that the evidence did not warrant a conviction and that the
trial judge failed to instruct properly the jury, by omitting to review the
evidence.

Held (Rand and Fauteux JJ. dissenting), that the appeal should be allowed
and a new trial directed.

Per Rinfret
C.J., Taschereau and Estey JJ.: As a general rule, in the course of his charge
a trial judge should review the substantial parts of the evidence and give the
jury the theory of the defence, so that they may appreciate the value and
effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be applied to the facts as they
find them. Where, as here, the evidence was technical and somewhat involved, it
was particularly important to strip it of the non-essentials, and to present to
the jury the evidence in its proper relation to the matters requiring factual
decision, and direct it also to the case put forward by the prosecution and by
the defence. Unfortunately, this was not done here, and the explanations and
grounds of defence were not adequately put before the jury. There was evidence
upon which a jury, properly instructed, could have found the accused guilty,
but since it cannot be said that the verdict would necessarily have been the
said if the proper instructions had been given, this was, therefore, not a case
for the application of s. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code.

Per Rand
J. (dissenting) : In a case such as here, where the defence was plain and
uncomplicated, the absence of a repetition of the few salient facts had not and
could not have had the slightest influence on the minds of the jury in reaching
their verdict; there was, therefore, no ground for appeal and a fortiori no
substantial wrong had been done.

Per Fauteux
J. (dissenting) : The practical significance which could be attached to the
opinions of the experts called for the defence was more dependent upon than
promoting the credibility of the appellant's testimony. The jury disbelieved
him. The case for the appellant would have been weakened rather than
strengthened if the trial judge had dealt exhaustively with the expert
opinions.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1],
affirming, Galipeault C.J.A. dissenting, the jury's verdict of man-slaughter.

[Page 496]

J. J. Robinette Q.C. and P. B. C.
Pepper for the appellant. The issue narrowed down
to the proper inference to be drawn from the medical testimony. There is no
doubt that the dissent was on a question of law, but should there be, it should
be resolved in favour of the accused.

The trial judge having failed to
review the evidence for the jury in such a way that they could clearly
appreciate the issues involved and the evidence bearing upon each issue, this
was a serious non direction amounting to misdirection. Rex v. Boak [2], Rex v. Hughes [3], Rex v. Hill [4]), Rex v. Stephen[5]) and Rex v. Arnold[6].

The trial judge's charge did not,
as it should have, adequately put before the jury the accused's explanations
and grounds of defence and the evidence in support there-of. Moreover, he
should also show the weakness in the Crown's case. Rex v. Kirk [7], Brooks v. Rex[8], Rex v. Scott[9], Markadonis v. Rex[10], Wu v. Rex[11], Rex v. West[12], Rex v. Harms[13] and Rex v. Gouin [14]

The circumstantial evidence was far
from being incon­sistent with any other rational conclusion than that the
accused was the guilty person within the rule in Odge's case. Lizotte
v. The King[15],
Rienblatt v. The King [16]and
Fraser v. The King[17].

The trial judge erred in admitting gynecological
instru­ments not pertaining to the issues in the case, to the preju­dice of the
accused. Rex v. Picken[18].

Henri Masson-Loranger Q.C. for the respondent. In view of the very simple issue involved in
this case, namely, was the haemorrhage spontaneous or caused by the appel­lant,
there was no need for the trial judge to review the evidence. The doctors on
both sides were' in accord. No objection to the charge was made. It would have
weakened the appellant's case rather than strengthened it had he

[Page 497]

done so. There was therefore no
prejudice. The jurisprudence cited by the appellant must be distinguished as
those were all cases where it was essential to relate the facts to a principle
of law i.e., conspiracy. But the review is not necessary in a case of simple
denial.

There is here no analogy with the
case of Picken, since here we have a doctor's office regularly
organized.

The circumstantial evidence leads
indubitably to the guilt of the accused and to no other conclusion, and this
beyond any reasonable doubt.

There was ample evidence to support
the verdict and the medical evidence was not contradictory. At the very least,
this is a case for the application of s. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code.

The judgment of the
Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. was delivered by

TASCHEREAU J.-The accused was charged with the murder
of Blanche Lepire, and was found guilty of man-slaughter. It is the contention
of the Crown that the appellant, for the unlawful purpose of procuring the mis-carriage
of the deceased woman, used on her instruments, which eventually caused her
death. The Court of Appeal[19]
confirmed the verdict, Chief Justice Galipeault dissenting. He reached the
conclusion that the evidence did not warrant a conviction, and that the trial
judge failed to instruct properly the jury, in omitting to review the evidence,
so that they could clearly appreciate the issues involved.

As I have come to the
conclusion that there should be a new trial, I do not intend to deal with all
the details of the evidence. It will be sufficient to say that I do not agree
with the learned dissenting judge, that the verdict was unreasonable and
unjustified. There was, I think, evidence upon which a jury could convict or
acquit, whether they accepted the theory of the Crown, or were left in doubt
when the defence rested its case.

On the second point, I
agree with the Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench. The rule which has
been laid down, and consistently followed is that in a jury trial the presiding
judge must, except in rare cases where it

[Page 498]

would be needless to do so, review the
substantial parts of the evidence, and give the jury the theory of the defence,
so that they may appreciate the value and effect of that evidence, and how the
law is to be applied to the facts as they find them. (Spencer
v. Alaska Parkers[20].
As Kellock J.A. (as he then was) said in Rex v. Stephen et al.[21] : ""It is not
sufficient that the whole evidence be left to the jury in bulk for
valuation."" The pivotal questions upon which the defence stands must
be clearly presented to the jury's mind. Of course, it is not necessary that
the trial judge should review all the facts, and that his charge be a minute
record of the evidence adduced, but as Rivard, J.A. said in Vincent v. Regem[22] :

Il faut admettre que l'adresse du juge est
plutôt brève et que, tant sur les faits que sur les questions de droit, il n'a
dit que l'essentiel, sans développement. Mais la question n'est pas de savoir
si le juge a été court; il faut rechercher plutôt s'il
a omis le nécessaire.

In Wu v. The King[23], Mr. Justice Lamont speaking for this Court expressed his views as
follows:‑

There is no doubt that in the trial court an
accused person is ordinarily entitled to rely upon all alternative defences for
which a foundation of fact appears in the record, and, in my opinion, it makes
no difference whether the evidence which forms that foundation has been given
by the witnesses for the Crown or for the accused, or otherwise. What is
essential is that the record contains evidence which, if accepted by the jury,
would constitute a valid defence to the charge laid. Where such evidence
appears it is the duty of the trial judge to call the attention of the jury to
that evidence and instruct them in reference thereto.

More recently, Mr. Justice Kerwin in Forsythe
v. The King[24],
also said:‑

However, while the general statement of the
law of conspiracy made by the trial judge may be unimpeachable, it was of the
utmost importance in this case that the application of the law to the facts
should be explained fully to the jury, particularly so far as the evidence
relating to Carson's activities was concerned.

In Rex v. Arnold[25], the Court of Appeal
,of Ontario ordered a new trial, and Mr. Justice Laidlaw, giving the unanimous
judgment of the Court restated the law as follows:‑

An accused is entitled to have a trial
judge give the theory of the defence to the jury, and it is difficult to
conceive of a case where, in doing so, he can refrain from making at least some
reference to the

[Page 499]

evidence. Here, I am thoroughly satisfied
that there was misdirection to the jury on the subject of consent, and apart
from that misdirection I think it was incumbent upon the learned trial judge to
do more than simply say to the jury that it was for them to decide whom they
believed, without making any reference to the evidence at all.

If any other authority
is needed, see Brooks v. The King[26],
Markadonis v. The King[27]
, Rex v. Hill et al[28].

In the present case,
the trial judge, after having ex­plained the law to the jury, said:‑

Now, as to facts. I will not comment on
them. Both parties have elaborated before you all the arguments for and against
the guilt or the innocence of the accused, and of course it is up to you to
say, not for me.

He then recapitulated
in a few words what the Crown Attorney and Counsel for the defence had said in
their addresses, and concluded by saying:‑

Both points of view have been well
elaborated by the Defence and the Crown and I shall say no more on facts.

I do not think that
this is sufficient. This trial lasted one week, twenty-four witnesses were
heard of which twelve for the defence. Three experts, two of which were called
by the appellant, gave very elaborate explanations on medical matters, and
their respective opinions on the result of the autopsy that was performed on
the body of the deceased woman. It was, I think, the duty of the trial judge,
in summing up this highly technical and con­flicting evidence, to strip it of
the non-essentials, and as O'Halloran, J.A. said in Rex v. Hughes[29] to present to the jury
the evidence in its proper relation to the matters requiring factual decision,
and direct it also to the case put forward by the prosecution and the answer of
the defence, or such answer as the evidence permitted. Unfortunately, this has
not been done, and the explanations and grounds of defence have not adequately
been put before the jury.

I am of opinion that
the jury was left in a state of confusion, and I cannot say that after the judge's
address, they were in a position to fully appreciate the value and effect of
the evidence. As I do not think that the verdict would have necessarily been
the same if the proper instruc­tions had been given, I believe that 1014 (2)
has no application.

I would direct a new
trial.

RAND J. (dissenting)
:-The defence here was plain and uncomplicated: it was that at the moment the
accused was about to examine the woman internally for fibromas, a spontaneous
process of miscarriage started causing a severance of the placenta from the
wall of the uterus and leading to a fatal hemorrhage. The issue was simply
whether the rupture was natural or had been provoked artificially by the
accused with the intent of bringing about an abortion.

The facts were largely undisputed: only those at
the critical moments leading to the severance were in contro­versy. Four items
of internal evidence were considered by the Crown to point to an artificially
induced dilatation of the cervix: an abrasion of the cervix; dilation of the
cervical canal; the presence of muscular fibre on the detached placenta; and
the existence of a burrow along the canal. What was said against this was that,
in the presence of fibromas, these conditions could possibly arise in the
natural course of dilatation. There were, in addition, surrounding
circumstances, presented in large part by the accused, on which little doubt or
question could arise.

Behind that facade of conditions and actions was
con­cealed the intent or purpose: was it legitimate or criminal? With what
""theory"" can we dignify such a simple situation? The trial took a
full week and there was much examination of the medical testimony: but in the
end, that of the defence reduced itself to what I have mentioned. What could the
repetition of the four items have added to the knowledge or appreciation of
that issue by the jury? They had listened to a proliferation of questions about
them almost at nauseam. They would, most probably, have received a further
reference to them from the court with secret impatience; and I have no doubt
that the absence of such a repetition had not and could not have had the
slightest influence on their minds in reaching their verdict. In such an
uncomplicated question, to speak of a ""theory"" or to require as,
virtually, an absolute rule, the recounting of the few salient facts would be
to add an artificiality of no value to the machinery of trial. The rule cannot
be taken to be absolute in requiring such an exposition; it depends upon the
circumstances of each case.

[Page 501]

Lazure J., who presided, has had a long and
distinguished experience in criminal trials, and in the situation as I con­ceive
it, I must decline to disregard his judgment that the narrow issues and
significant facts, with all their implica­tions, were fully and intelligently
appreciated by the jury. No objection to the charge was made by the able
counsel representing the accused nor was the ground urged here taken in the
notice of appeal to the King's Bench.

The rule arises from the necessity that the jury
be fully apprised of every aspect of the case; their judgment other-wise would
be vitiated. But once that essential condition is satisfied, anything further
of the nature suggested here would be a useless impediment. Its value is as a
safeguard against misjudging the jury's grasp of the issues and in the
impartial examination of controverted, involved or complex matters and their
significance. But there are situations in which it can be said with judicial
certainty that reiteration is unnecessary; in such cases the verdict is given
in disregard of its presence or absence. I take the condition of the rule to be
that the statement required must be such that its omission might have affected
the verdict: if, as here, it could not have done so, there is no ground for
appeal and a fortiori no substantial wrong has been done.

I would dismiss the appeal.

EsTEY, J.:-The appellant, charged with the murder of Mrs. P., was found
guilty of manslaughter. His conviction was affirmed in the Court of Queen's
Bench, Appeal Side, in the Province of Quebec [30],
Chief Justice Galipeault dissenting.

Mrs. P., on August 20, 1947, went to the office
of the appellant, a medical practitioner in Montreal, where, be-cause of a
haemorrhage caused by the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, she
died.

The Crown contends that the haemorrhage resulted
from an attempt on the appellant's part to effect an abortion. The appellant
contends that the separation and consequent haemorrhage were due to natural
causes.

[Page 502]

The Crown called
evidence as to events and conversa­tions leading to the examination, the manner
in which Mrs. P. was prepared therefore and the circumstances at the office. A
pathologist was also called who made a post mortem on the afternoon of the
death. He found the cervical canal abnormally dilated in relation to the length
of the cervix, abrasions on the cervix, a burrow or groove on the cervical
canal and fibres on the placenta, which came from the uterine wall. These
factors, viewed as a whole, together with his negative observations in his
opinion justified the conclusion that there had been an attempted abortion.

The appellant admitted
making an examination of the lungs, heart and abdomen and the taking of a
haemoglobin test; that before he had made any internal examination she had
commenced to haemorrhage; that in the course of his efforts to stop the
haemorrhage he used a speculum, a tenaculum and did some packing. He also gave
her Pituitrin and Vitamin K.

The medical evidence is
all to the effect that Mrs. P. had been pregnant between five and six months.
It is also clear that she had several fibroids upon the wall of her uterus
which, because of their size and condition, had been there some time. The
appellant was of the opinion that Mrs. P. was in labour when she consulted him
on the 20th and that because of the fibroids and consequently diseased and
weakened condition of the tissues this separation of the placenta occurred in
the course of labour. Moreover, he stated that the fact that she was in labour
explained the dilatation of the cervical canal.

Two pathologists were
called on behalf of the appellant whose evidence lent support to the view that
the dilatation of the cervical canal might have happened normally, par­ticularly
if she was in labour. They also expressed the view that in the same
circumstances, because of the diseased and weakened condition of the tissues of
the uterine wall, the fibres might have separated therefrom with, and remained
upon the placenta. As to the abrasions on the cervix and the groove on the
cervical canal, these did pro-vide evidence of trauma or injury which might
have been caused in the course of the packing.

[Page 503]

The learned trial judge clearly and
appropriately discussed the relevant law, the certainty that must be estab­lished
where the evidence is circumstantial and that the jury must be satisfied that
the evidence establishes the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt
before finding him guilty. In the course of his charge the learned judge stated,
in part, as follows:

Now, as to facts. I will not comment on
them. Both parties have elaborated before you all the arguments for and against
the guilt or the innocence of the accused, and of course it is up to you to
say, not for me.

Again he stated:

Both points of view have been well
elaborated by the Defence and the Crown and I shall say no more on facts.

The authorities contemplate that in the course
of his charge a trial judge should, as a general rule, explain the relevant law
and so relate it to the evidence that the jury may appreciate the issues or
questions they must pass upon in order to render a verdict of guilty or not
guilty. Where, as here, the evidence is technical and somewhat involved, it is
particularly important that he should do so in a manner that will assist the
jury in determining its relevancy and what weight or value they will attribute
to the respective portions. It is, of course, unnecessary that the jury's
attention be directed to all of the evidence, and how far a trial judge should
go in discussing it must depend in each case upon the nature and character of
the evidence in relation to the charge, the issues raised and the conduct of
the trial. Wu v. The King[31]
; Brooks v. The King [32]
; Picken v. The King [33]
; Preston v. The King [34];
Black-stone, Vol. 3, ch. 23, p. 375; The Queen
v. Coney [35];
Rex. v. Bateman[36].

Moreover, the defence throughout was that the
accused had treated Mrs. P. in a professional and legal manner. This was
supported by evidence of the accused as to his own conduct, his professional
opinion as to the nature and character of the natural cause of the separation
of the placenta and of his efforts to save her life. The evidence of the
pathologists, called on his own behalf, somewhat supported his opinion as to
the natural cause of the separation

[Page 504]

of the placenta and the
dilatation of the cervical canal. They also expressed their opinions that the
abrasions and groove might have been caused by instruments used in the course
of packing.

This theory of the
defence and the evidence in relation thereto were not placed before the jury in
a manner that would assist the jurymen in appreciating the particular facts and
circumstances they should consider in determin­ing whether the accused be
guilty or not guilty. Brooks v. The King, supra; Rex v. Henderson [37]; Rex v. Kirk[38]); Rex v. Arnold[39].

There was ample
evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed, might have found the accused
guilty, but it cannot be said that a jury, acting judicially, would neces­sarily
have arrived at that conclusion and, therefore, it is

not a case for the
application of the provisions of s. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code.

The appeal should be
allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.

FAUTEUX J. (dissenting) :-A
careful consideration of the record convinced me that the practical
significance which the defence expert opinions could have at the end of the
case was more dependent upon than promoting the measure of credit the jury
would then be ready to attach to the very testimony of the appellant himself.
Exonerating possibilities indicated by them could only be of trivial or no
value if his relation .of the occurrence, considered in the light of the rest
of the evidence, was not accepted as truthful. That the jury did disbelieve what
he said as to the nature of his intervention is clearly manifested by their
verdict. I have reached the conclusion that had the trial Judge dealt with the
expert opinions exhaustively, the case for the appellant would have been
weakened rather than strengthened. As there will be a new trial, it is not
convenient to review the evidence in order to demonstrate the factual premises
upon which the above findings are made. One may point out, however, that these
conclusions are not inconsistent with but, in some degree, supported by the
fact that in the course of his

[Page 505]

address, the then counsel of the appellant-an
able one, as the record shows-rather invited the jury to minimize the value to
be attached to expert opinions, the fact that he did not, at the end of the
address of the trial Judge, raise any objections as to the omission of the
latter to review this or other evidence, the fact that, in the notice of
appeal, counsel did not even mention this ground on which the argument before
us was centered and which, moreover, is not the one upon which the appeal in
the Court below fell virtually to be determined.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal allowed; new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE
 OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—S. 461—Jury trial—Refusal of trial judge to
have charge taken in shorthand—No report made under s. 1020 of the Criminal
Code.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec1, affirming, Casey and McDougall JJ.A.
dissenting, the appellant's conviction following his trial before a judge and
jury on a charge of breaking and entering with intent to commit a theft. The
evidence was circumstantial and the defence was an alibi.

After the address of the trial judge to the jury,
counsel for the defence moved that the trial judge should direct the jury to
the effect that they should acquit the accused if they entertained a reasonable
doubt concerning the question of alibi, to which motion the trial judge
answered that that had been sufficiently explained. The address of the trial
judge was not taken by a stenographer, a defence motion to have it done having
been refused.

The trial judge did not furnish to the Court of
Appeal a report as provided for under s. 1020 of the Criminal Code nor
was there any application made on behalf of the appellant in the Court of
Appeal for an order requiring the trial judge to comply with the section and
furnish a report. (Baron v. The King [1930] S.C.R. 194 and Northey
v. The King [1948] S.C.R. 135 were referred to during the argument
before this Court).

The offence was committed in December 1949, the
verdict was given in October 1950 and the judgment of the Court of Appeal was
rendered in June 1951. In view of the fact

[Page 480]

that the notice of appeal to this Court was served in
July 1951 and the case filed in September 1951, counsel for the appellant was
asked for, but gave no explanation as to, the cause of the delay in the setting
down of the case for hearing in this Court.

Alexandre Chevalier Q.C. for the appellant.

René T. Hébert Q.C. for
the respondent.

At the close of the argument on behalf of the appellant, the
following oral judgment was delivered by the Chief Justice :

The Court is unanimously of opinion that it was open to the
appellant to obtain before the Court of Appeal an order requesting the trial
judge to file the report under s.,1020; in which case, the Court of Appeal and
this Court as well would have had the proper material necessary for the
consideration of the appeal. In the absence of such material, we have to
dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Common betting-house—Summary
trial under Part XVI—Motion for non-suit—Criminal Code, ss. 229, 773(f),
777(a), 1013(4) 1023(2).

The appellants were jointly charged with
having kept a common betting-house and were tried summarily before a magistrate
pursuant to ss. 773(f) and 777(a) of the Criminal Code. On
a motion for nonsuit, made at the close of the case for the Crown, the charge was
dismissed as against all four accused. Pursuant to s. 1013(4) of the Code, the
Crown appealed the acquittal on the ground that there was evidence to support
the case against the accused and the Court of Appeal for Ontario ordered a new
trial.

Held: (1): The
appeal of the appellant Feeley should be dismissed; there was evidence which,
if accepted, showed circumstances from which the inference might fairly be
drawn that the building in question was being used as a common betting-house;
and the evidence as to the statements made by this appellant and as to his
actions was such that, in the absence of explanation or denial, the tribunal of
fact might properly have decided that he was guilty of being the keeper of such
betting-house.

(2): The appeals of the appellants Reid,
Hergel and Meechan should be allowed and a judgment of acquittal entered, there
being no evidence on which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, could
have found a verdict of guilty.

Held also,
that the rules laid down in The King v. Morabito [1949] S.C.R. 172. (i)
that the judicial officer presiding at the trial of a criminal charge can not
dismiss the charge at the close of the case for the Crown and before the
defence has elected whether or not to give evidence unless at that stage there
is no evidence upon which a jury might convict, and (ii) that whether or not
there is such evidence is a question of law alone, are applicable to the
conduct of a trial under Part XVI of the Criminal Code.

APPEALS from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario, allowing the Crown’s appeal from the acquittal of the
accused and ordering a new trial.

W.E. MacDonald for the appellants.

C.P. Hope Q.C. for the respondent.

[Page 60]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by:—

CARTWRIGHT J.—The appellants were jointly
charged that they,

within six months ending on the 4th day of
November A.D. 1950 at the Town of New Toronto in the County of York unlawfully
did keep a common betting house at the premises situate and known as Lakeside
Cigar Store, 132 Sixth Street in the said Town of New Toronto, contrary to
Section 229 of the Criminal Code.

They were tried summarily before His Worship
Magistrate Hand pursuant to sections 773 (f) and 777(a) of
the Criminal Code. Each of the appellants was separately represented.
Upon the close of the case for the Crown on January 26, 1951, the counsel for
each defendant moved “for non-suit and dismissal in respect of” his client. The
learned Magistrate granted this motion as to the appellants Hergel and Meechan,
reserved his judgment as to the appellants Feeley and Reid and adjourned the
hearing to January 29, 1951, on which date he gave judgment dismissing the
charge against them also.

The learned Magistrate did not give extended
reasons for judgment. In dealing with the motion so far as Hergel and Meechan
were concerned he said “I find no evidence for a conviction against Andrew
Hergel and Edward Meechan and the charge against them will be dismissed.” In
dealing with the motion as to Feeley and Reid he simply stated that the motion
would be granted and the charge dismissed.

From this judgment of acquittal the
Attorney-General appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario pursuant to
section 1013 (4) of the Criminal Code on the following ground:—

That the learned Magistrate erred in
holding that there was no evidence to support the Crown’s case against the
accused.

The appeal was allowed and a new trial directed
as to all four of the appellants, who now appeal to this Court pursuant to
section 1023 (2) of the Code. We have not the benefit of any
written reasons for the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

It is common ground that had the learned
Magistrate refused the motion the appellants would have had the right to call
evidence for the defence if so advised and

[Page 61]

counsel for the respondent submits that the
decision of this Court in The King v. Morabito[1] establishes (i) that at that stage it was
not open to the learned Magistrate to dismiss the charge unless there was no
evidence on which, had the trial been before a jury, a properly instructed
jury, acting reasonably, might have convicted the accused, and (ii) that
whether or not there was such evidence is “a question of law alone” within the
meaning of section 1013 (4) of the Code. I agree with this
submission.

Counsel for the appellant sought to distinguish
the Morabito case from the case at bar. It is true that in the former
case the trial was held under the provisions of Part XVIII of the Code and
in the latter under Part XVI; and that Perry v. The King[2], approved in the judgment of Kellock J.,
concurred in by Rand and Locke, JJ., in the Morabito case, dealt with a
charge disposed of under Part XV of the Code. It would seem, however,
that Rex v. Olsen[3] also,
approved in the judgment of Kellock J., dealt with a charge tried under Part
XVI. The offence there charged was one on which the Crown might have proceeded
either summarily or upon indictment and the fact that there was an appeal to
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia indicates that the latter course had
been followed. It is true that the corresponding sections in Parts XV, XVI
and XVIII of the Code are not identically worded but in proceedings
under each of such parts the judicial officer before whom the trial is held
acts as judge both of the law and of the facts and it appears to me that the
rules laid down in the Morabito case are applicable to the conduct of a
trial under Part XVI of the Code. It is therefore necessary to consider
as to each appellant whether at the close of the Crown’s case there was evidence
upon which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, might have convicted
him.

The charge being that of keeping a common
betting-house it was essential for the Crown to prove (i) that the building
known as 132 Sixth Street, New Toronto, was at the relevant time a common
betting-house, and (ii) that each appellant was a keeper thereof.

[Page 62]

The burden resting upon the prosecution as to
(ii) above is somewhat lightened by the terms of section 229 (3) of the Criminal
Code reading as follows:—

(3) Every one who appears, acts or behaves
as master or mistress, or as the person having the care, government or
management of any disorderly house, or as assisting in such care, government or
management, shall be deemed to be the keeper thereof and is liable to be
prosecuted and punished as such although in fact he or she is not the real
owner or keeper thereof.

As in my view the order for a new trial should
be upheld as to the appellant Feeley, I do not propose to discuss the evidence
in detail. During the argument counsel for the Crown made it clear that he did
not rely upon the presumptions created in certain circumstances by
sections 985 and 986 (2) of the Criminal Code. He submitted that a prima
facie case was made out against all of the appellants without the aid of
these statutory presumptions.

In my view there was evidence which, if
accepted, showed circumstances from which the inference might fairly be drawn
that on the 3rd of November, 1950 the building in question was being used as a
common betting-house. The more difficult question is whether there was evidence
that the appellants were the keepers of such betting-house.

I have reached the conclusion that the evidence
as to the statements made by the appellant Feeley, and as to his actions was
such that, in the absence of explanation or denial, the tribunal of fact might
properly have decided that he was guilty.

As to the appellants Reid, Hergel and Meechan
respectively counsel for the respondent relies on the following items of
evidence: As to Reid: (i) the license, Exhibit 30 (ii) the fact that in the
pocket of a coat hanging in a closet on the premises was “a liquor permit in
the name of George Reid” (iii) that he was found by the police in the cellar of
the store in the circumstances to be mentioned hereafter.

As to Hergel: (i) that on November 3,1950, he
was twice seen to leave the premises in question and return (ii) the same as
item (iii) in the case of Reid.

As to Meechan: (i) he had in his possession a
key which would open the back door of the building in question and a key which
would open the door of a small room in the building (ii) the same as item (iii)
in the case of Reid.

[Page 63]

It will be convenient to deal first with the
third item mentioned in the case of Reid as it is common to these three
appellants. There was evidence that Reid, Hergel and Meechan were all found by
the police in the cellar room, under the building in question, containing the
oil furnace. There was evidence from which it would have been open to a jury to
draw the inference that one or more of them had been burning in the furnace
pieces of paper which it was open to the jury to infer were betting slips but
there was no evidence from which the jury could infer that all three of them
had taken part in this or from which it could be determined which one had been
doing it. This being so the effect of this item is only to warrant the drawing
of an inference that each of the three was present while betting slips were
being destroyed. It does not warrant the drawing of the inference as to any one
of them that he destroyed betting slips.

Dealing next with item (i) as to Reid, there was
evidence that a document, Exhibit 30, was on the wall in the building in
question. It reads as follows:

                                                         TOWN

This License is granted to Lakeside Cigar
Store of 132 6th St. to carry on Business or Businesses as above mentioned

the Town of New Toronto, under which this License is Issued.

31st day of Dec. 1950 and no longer. This License may be Cancelled if the
provisions of any By-law regarding the same are not fully observed.

(Sgd.)                           F.R.
LONGSTAFF

Municipal
Treasurer

Below this appears a cash register printing
shewing $2.00 paid on February 1, 1950.

Counsel for the appellant objects that this has
no probative value in the absence of any evidence to identify the appellant
George Reid with the individual intended to be described by the words “Geo.
Reid” in the license. This point was not further developed in argument and I do
not

[Page 64]

propose to discuss the numerous decisions, some
of which are not easy to reconcile, in which the question has been considered
as to whether and to what extent identity of name is evidence of identity of
person. I will assume, without deciding, that a jury would have been entitled
to infer that the appellant George Reid was the individual described by the
words “Geo. Reid” in Exhibit 30. It might then be suggested that this indicated
that on February 1, 1950, the appellant Reid was the licensee permitted to
carry on business under the name “Lakeside Cigar Store” at the premises in
question and that the presence of Exhibit 30 on such premises on November 3,
1950 indicated that he had up to that date continued in charge of such
business. Be this as it may, it appears to me that if such an inference could
otherwise have been drawn it was displaced by the evidence given by the Crown
that Feeley was both the owner and the person in charge of the premises.

Item (ii) as to Reid seems to me to indicate
nothing more than that the appellant Reid had hung up his coat in a closet in
the premises in question and possessed a liquor permit. It throws no light on
the question as to what he was doing on the premises.

In my opinion, these three items of evidence,
taken together, are insufficient to make out a prima facie case that
Reid was in fact the keeper or that he appeared, acted or behaved as the person
having the care, government or management of the house in question or as
assisting in such care, government or management.

In the case of Hergel the evidence as to his
presence in the cellar in the circumstances mentioned, coupled with the
evidence as to his twice leaving and entering the premises, falls far short of
making out a prima facie case.

In the case of Meechan the evidence as to his
presence in the cellar and as to the possession of the two keys mentioned above
does not appear to me to indicate that he was a keeper. His possession of the
keys would permit the jury to infer that he had a right to enter the building
and a particular room therein, but would afford no foundation for a finding
that he took any part in its care, government or management.

[Page 65]

For the above reasons I have reached the
conclusion that as to the appellants Reid, Hergel and Meechan there was no
evidence on which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, might have
found a verdict of guilty.

I would dismiss the appeal of the appellant
Feeley. I would allow the appeals of the appellants Reid, Hergel and Meechan
and direct that as to each of them a judgment of acquittal be entered.

Appeal of the appellant Feeley
dismissed; appeals of the other appellants allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Theft—Evidence—Testimony of accomplice—Corroboration—Corroborative inference is
question of fact—Criminal Code, s. 1025.

Applying Rex v.
Baskerville [1916] 2 K.B. 658, it was held that, on a charge of theft, the
jury were rightly told that the evidence as to a certain cheque was capable of
being corroborative of the testimony of the accomplice who was the main witness
against the appellant. Applying Hubin v. The King [1927] S.C.R. 442, it
was also held that the jury should have been told that it was for them to
decide if it was in fact corroborative. As it was impossible to state that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage had occurred, the appeal was allowed and a new
trial directed.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing the appellant’s appeal from his
conviction on a charge of theft.

A.E. Moloney for the
appellant.

W.B. Common Q.C. for the
respondent.



The
judgment of the Court was delivered by:—



KERWIN
J.:—The appellant was convicted
in the Court of the General Sessions of the Peace in and for the County of York
on a charge that in the year 1950 he stole approximately $38,000 in money, the
property of S.P. Ryan, A.D. McAlpine and J.M. Ryan, contrary to the Criminal
Code. The Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed an appeal from his
conviction and sentence and, pursuant to section 1025 of the Code, he
appealed to this Court in accordance with leave granted by Cartwright J. on the
following grounds:—



(a)
Was the alleged fact that a certain cheque was given by the appellant to one,
Elsie Teasdale, in or about the month of April, 1950, capable in law of being
corroboration of the testimony of the said Elsie Teasdale?










(b)
Did the learned trial judge usurp the functions of the jury in instructing
them that the evidence concerning the said cheque was corroborative?

[Page 92]



In view
of the conclusion reached, it is not advisable to refer to the evidence at the
trial in detail. The substance of the charge against the appellant was that he
had counselled and procured Elsie Teasdale to steal the money in question from
her employers, the parties named in the indictment. Elsie Teasdale had already
pleaded guilty to a charge of theft and had been sentenced. She was the main
witness called against the appellant, and the trial judge charged the jury that
as she was an accomplice they ought not to convict on her uncorroborated
testimony. He also told the jury that the cheque given by the appellant to her
in or about the month of April, 1950, was capable in law of being such
corroboration. This cheque could not be found but, notwithstanding the argument
of counsel for the appellant, we are satisfied that there was evidence upon
which the jury could find that it had in fact been signed by the appellant and
given to Elsie Teasdale.



Then it
was said that while on her own testimony the cheque was to repay the amounts
she had given the appellant from her own funds and from the sums she had stolen
from her employers up to that time, the amount of the cheque exceeded the total
of all of these amounts down to the date of the cheque. However, the jury were
entitled to accept Elsie Teasdale’s
evidence that the amount of the cheque represented the approximate total and
that any excess was to be repaid by her to the appellant. In that view of the
matter and considering all the other evidence, the cheque was capable in law of
being corroborative as it falls within the classical statement as to what may
be corroboration as found in Rex v. Baskerville[1]. The answer, therefore, to
the first question must be in the affirmative.



The
second question must also be answered in the affirmative. The charge to the
jury must, of course, be read as a whole but it is necessary to refer only to
the following portions of it. At one stage the trial judge told the jury:—



I
will tell you here there is some evidence corroborative of her evidence and if
you accept that evidence you may believe her evidence, accept the whole of her
story.

[Page 93]










Later,
after referring to the evidence as to the existence of the cheque given by the
various bank officials, the trial judge continued:—



Gentlemen,
you may or may not accept that evidence. If you do, that is evidence
corroborative in a material respect and you may believe the whole or necessary
parts of Miss Teasdale’s evidence to bring in a
verdict. If you do not accept the evidence as corroborative of her story, as I
told you, you ought not to convict and should bring in a verdict of not guilty.



After
considering the matter for over four hours, the jury returned and the foreman
asked the following questions:—



...
something was said about the fact that it was unusual to convict person based
on or solely on the evidence of a convicted member or party to the offence.
Could you perhaps go over that for us again and clarify it just to what extent?



The
trial judge replied:—



I
am very glad you asked about that because they are very important. You see,
there is not enough evidence in this case, gentlemen, to convict the accused
unless you accept the whole or important parts of the evidence of Miss
Teasdale.



Now,
as I have told you as a matter of law, as I am supposed to tell you the law,
she is in law what is known as an accomplice, that is, if you find the accused
guilty the two of them were both in it, she is guilty anyway, she is what you
call an accomplice. You realize when you have two people accused of something
there might be a tendency to put the blame on the other so a person who is
admittedly guilty of a crime may not be too reliable, so the law is laid down
that the judge must tell the jury they ought not to convict the accused on the
evidence of an accomplice alone, it must be corroborated, that is, there must
be some other evidence which backs it up in some material particular.



I
have explained to you here that there is such evidence, which you accept it as
corroboration, if you accept that evidence you may take her story, holus bolus
if you want to. It is all in your hands; if there is no corroboration, I have
to tell you there is not. Here I explained what the corroboration was; it was
the evidence concerning this cheque which was signed by the accused which went
through the bank. You heard the evidence about that and if you believe that
evidence and accept it, it is open to you to accept the whole or any part of
Miss Teasdale’s evidence.



Particularly
bearing in mind this last quotation, we think the charge was defective and that
the jury should have been told clearly that the evidence as to the cheque was

[Page 94]










capable
of being corroboration but that it was for them to decide if it was in fact
corroborative. In Hubin v. The King[2], this Court decided, at
page 444, that “whether corroborative
inferences should be drawn is a question for the jury.” This rule was infringed in the
present case and it is impossible to state that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage has occurred. This appeal must therefore be allowed and a new trial
directed.

Appeal allowed; new trial
directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL
DIVISION

Criminal law—Murder—Drunkenness—Reasonable
doubt—Incapacity to form specific intent—Objections to charge of trial judge.

A jury found the appellant guilty of murder with ""the
strongest recommendation for mercy"". His appeal, mainly on grounds of
misdirections on the issue of drunkenness which he had raised at the trial, was
dismissed by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, on the ground
that, though some of the involved directions might have been objectionable or
that the principles could have been more clearly worded, the evidence supported
no finding other than that of murder and that, in any event, no substantial
wrong or miscarriage had occurred.

Held (Rinfret C.J. and Locke J. dissenting) : That the
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

The instructions given to the jury were confusing, incomplete,
illegal and were not corrected. The appellant was not bound to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that drunkenness had produced a condition such as did render
his mind incapable of forming the pertinent specific intent essential to
constitute the crime of murder. Furthermore, the jury should have been clearly
instructed that the accused should only be found guilty of manslaughter if, in
their view, the evidence indicated such incapacity or left them in doubt as to the
matter. (Latour v. The King [1951] S.C.R. 19 referred to).

On the evidence, it cannot be safely asserted that the jury,
properly instructed and acting honestly and reasonably, might not have found
itself in. doubt as to the accused's incapacity, on account of drunkenness, to
form the specific intent to murder. The length of the jury's deliberation
coupled with the fact that they came back for further instructions as to the
effect of intoxication, support the view that drunkenness was at least
considered and support the conclusion that it is impossible to say that the
verdict would have necessarily been the same had they been properly instructed
that any reasonable doubt had to be given to the accused. There was substantial
wrong or miscarriage.

Rinfret C.J. and Locke J. (dissenting) agreed with the
unanimous judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New
Brunswick, and would have dismissed the appeal.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New
Brunswick, Appeal Division, maintaining the verdict of murder found by a jury
against the appellant.

J. T. Carvell for the appellant.

H. W. Hickman Q.C. for the respondent.

[Page 45]

The dissenting judgment of Rinfret C.J. and Locke J. was
delivered by

Locke, J.:—I
respectfully agree with the unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division
delivered by Mr. Justice Hughes and would dismiss this appeal.

The judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey, Cartwright and
Fauteux JJ. was delivered by

Fatteux, J.:—On
the 6th day of March 1952, a. jury in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick
(Queen's Bench Division) presided over by Mr. Justice W. A. I. Anglin, after
four hours of deliberation, returned against the appellant a verdict of
guilty—to which they added ""the strongest recommendation for
mercy""—on the following charge:—

That Donald Capson, on or about the 2nd day of October A.D.
1951, at the City of Moncton, in the County of Westmorland, in the Province of
New Brunswick, did unlawfully murder Rosie Wing in violation of section 263 of
the Criminal Code of Canada.

This verdict, appealed mainly on ground of misdirections on
the issue of drunkenness raised at trial by the accused, was unanimously
maintained by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, on the
view that, though some of the involved directions might be objectionable or
that the principles could have been more clearly worded, the evidence in the
case would support no finding other than that of murder and that, in any event,
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had actually occurred.

Leave was thereafter granted to the appellant to appeal to
this Court on two questions of law, namely:—

Did the trial Judge misdirect the jury as to the burden of
proof with respect to the defence of drunkenness?

Did the trial Judge misdirect the jury in omitting to direct
them that the accused was entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt upon
the whole case, including the reduction of the crime of murder to manslaughter?

The directions in the address of the trial Judge that are attacked
are:—

(1) I must direct you that if you think the accused was so
intoxicated that he did not have the mind to appreciate what he was doing, then
the charge of murder may be reduced to manslaughter.

* * *

[Page 46]

(2) If he is so drunk that you are satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt he did not know what he was doing because of the alcohol,
then it is impossible for you to say that he intended to murder. So, under
those circumstances, the law is that a charge of murder must then be reduced to
manslaughter.

* * *

(3) If, however, he has drunk so much he does not know what
he is doing at all and you are well satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
his mind is so blurred by liquor that he does not appreciate what he is doing
at all, then you are unable to find that he had any one of these intents which
I will speak to you about later, so a charge of murder would have to be reduced
to a finding of manslaughter.

* * *

(4) As I told you before, if you think that he had
enough to drink that he did not know what he was doing in respect of any of
these occasions when he must have a specific intent, then you may bring in a
verdict of manslaughter instead of murder.

* * *

(5) …and you have to be satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt that his mind was so affected by liquor that he could not have meant
to inflict grievous bodily harm to facilitate robbery, if you say it was
robbery, or that he did not have the mind to intend to cause bodily injuries
known to him to be likely to cause death or that he was reckless whether death ensued
or not.

* * *

(6) But if you think that he had so much liquor during that
day that his mind was not in the state of appreciating what he was doing and
not just only influenced to do more readily and he would not probably have done
it, if he was sober, then you may find him guilty of manslaughter.

* * *

(7) So that if you think, not necessarily beyond a
reasonable doubt, but if you are satisfied that the influence of liquor was
such that he could not appreciate what he was doing in the sense that he could
not form the necessary intent to cause the death, then you may find him guilty
of manslaughter instead of murder.

With these instructions, the jury retired and returned, two
hours later, to ask the trial Judge ""to explain again the effect which the
different degrees of intoxication as regards to the accused, would have upon
the verdict of murder as distinguished from manslaughter."" The following
instructions were then given :—

(8) So in that intermediate stage you must satisfy
yourselves that the accused was so much under the influence of liquor that he
just could not be said to be capable or have the mental capacity to form any

of these specific intents…

* * *

(9) If he had so much liquor in him and his mind was so
affected that you can say he did not mean to cause her death then he would be
guilty of manslaughter only and not guilty of murder.

[Page 47]

It must be added that, with these conflicting instructions
related to doubt on the specific issue of drunkenness, the jury were not
instructed in a manner sufficiently clear that any reasonable doubt they might
have on the specific issue had to be given to the accused and that the verdict
should then be reduced from murder to manslaughter.

The jury retired again and after two more hours of further
deliberation, returned to give the above verdict and recommendation for mercy.

Appreciated in the light of well settled principles, as to
the burden of proof, in the matter, it is manifest that the instructions given
in this respect are confusing, incomplete and illegal. The appellant was not
bound to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that drunkenness had produced a
condition such as incapacitating his mind of forming the pertinent specific
intent essential to constitute the crime of murder. Furthermore, the jury
should have been clearly instructed that the accused should only be found
guilty of manslaughter if, in their view, the evidence indicated such
incapacity or left them in doubt as to the matter. (See Latour v. The
King 1
and authorities therein referred to).

The contention of the Crown that the instructions given were
innocuous or were corrected is, I think, undefendable.

The second submission of the Crown—accepted by the Court of
Appeal—is that there was no evidence upon which a jury could reasonably find
that the appellant's mind was incapacitated by drunkenness to form the intent
to commit murder; consequently, says counsel for the respondent, the jury
should not have been invited to consider the issue at all and even if the
directions given to them, in this respect, were illegal, no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice resulted therefrom since a verdict of manslaughter
could not, for the reason of drunkenness, be legally returned by the jury.

Since there is to be a new trial, no reference will be made
to the evidence.

In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, the appellant entered
Rosie Wing's house ""probably with the idea of trying to make a loan of
some money""; but what took place from then on up to the moment at which
the injuries

[Page 48]

were inflicted is not apparent in the evidence. On any view
that would bring the case under the provisions of ss. (b) of s. 259 of
the Criminal Code, the jury, properly instructed and acting honestly and
reasonably, might have had no hesitation in finding that Capson was not, on
account of drunkenness, incapacitated to form the specific intent therein
provided, but it cannot safely be asserted that the jury, equally properly
instructed and acting honestly and reasonably, might not have found itself in
doubt on the point. The very fact that, after two hours of deliberation, the
jury required from the trial Judge further instructions as to ""the effect
which the different degrees of intoxication as regards to the accused, would
have upon the verdict of murder as distinguished from manslaughter"",
together with the fact that, after receiving such additional instructions, they
deliberated again for two more hours before bringing a verdict of murder
""with the strongest recommendation for mercy"" support the view that
drunkenness to some degree was at least considered and support the conclusion
that it is impossible to say that the verdict would have necessarily been the
same had they been properly instructed that any reasonable doubt had to be
given to the appellant. It was, therefore, necessary for the trial Judge to
instruct the jury on the issue of drunkenness and to do so according to law.

This conclusion also disposes of the ultimate contention of
the Crown that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice actually resulted
from the illegal manner in which the jury were instructed.

The appeal should be maintained and a new trial ordered.

Appeal allowed; new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Criminal law—Having
instruments for making bill paper—Whether the manufacturing of paper is
necessary—S. 471 (a) of the Criminal Code.

The having in one's possession
without lawful excuse instruments enabling one to fashion or change a piece of
white paper to resemble Bank of America's bill paper, is an offence within the
meaning of section 471 (a) of the Criminal Code.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissing appellant's appeal from his
conviction at trial before a jury on a charge of having had in his possession
instruments for making paper intended to resemble the bill paper of the Bank of
America, contrary to s. 471 (a) of the Criminal Code.

J. Stevenson Hall for the
appellant.

H. A. Maclean K.C. for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice
and of Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:

ESTEY J.:—The appellant was
convicted of having in his ""possession instruments for making paper
intended to resemble the bill paper of a body corporate carrying on the
business of banking, to wit, the Bank of America,"" contrary to the
provisions of s. 471(a) of the Criminal Code. He was unsuccessful
in his appeal to the Court of Appeal in British
 Columbia and obtained leave, under s.
1025 of the Criminal Code, to appeal to this Court.

The instruments in his possession
enabled the accused to take a piece of white paper and make it into a Bank of
America traveller's cheque. Counsel for the accused submits that such instruments
are not included in s. 471(a). He would construe this subsection to
include only those instruments which can be used for the manufacture of the
bill paper from its original ingredients and not, therefore,

[Page 538]

to include the making of a piece
of white paper into a bill paper intended to resemble the bill paper of the
Bank of America. S. 471(a) reads:

471. Everyone is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to fourteen years' imprisonment who, without
lawful authority or excuse, the proof whereof shall lie on him,

(a) makes, begins to
make, uses or knowingly has in his possession, any machinery or instrument or
material for making exchequer bill paper, revenue paper or paper intended to
resemble the bill paper of any firm or body corporate, or person carrying on
the business of banking ;

The foregoing s. 471 follows in
the statute immediately after those dealing with the offence of forgery and is
included with those sections under the heading ""Forgery and Preparation
Therefor."" It is specifically directed against the preparation for a
forged bill and makes it an offence to be in possession of instruments, without
lawful authority or excuse, that may be used ""for making… paper intended
to resemble the bill paper of any firm or body corporate, or person carrying on
the business of banking.""

While ""exchequer bill
paper"" is defined in s. 335(k), bill paper generally, or that of a firm or
body corporate or person carrying on the business of banking, is not defined,
no doubt because each of these bodies selects its own particular bill paper.
The Bank of America, in making its traveller's cheques, used specially designed
paper. The acquisition or making of paper to resemble the bill paper of the
Bank of America would be a step toward, or in preparation of, a completed
forgery of its traveller's cheques. The accused was found to have in his
possession instruments with which he fashioned or changed a piece of white
paper, by impressions or other means, with intent that it would resemble the
bill paper upon which these traveller's cheques were made. It is the possession
of such instruments without lawful authority or excuse that the section makes
an offence.

The submission that, because the
instruments which were in the possession of the accused could not manufacture
bill paper which would resemble that of the Bank of America from its original
ingredients, but could only fashion or change white paper as already indicated,
the accused, in having them in his possession without lawful excuse, 

[Page 539]

had not committed an offence
contrary to s. 471 (a) is not tenable. The words ""making"" and
""manufacturing"" are sometimes used synonymously. The word
""making"" is, however, a wider term and somewhat more inclusive. The
mere physical fashioning or changing of a given commodity might, in some
circumstances, be described as manufacturing, but, in any event, it is a
making. The instruments in the possession of the accused enabled him to do just
that. He fashioned or changed the white paper with these instruments and made it
into that which he intended would resemble the bill paper of the Bank of
America. The language of this section cannot be given the narrow construction
suggested by counsel for the accused.

Counsel for the accused supported
his suggested construction of s. 471(a) by reference to a number of
cases which were decided under the language of particular statutes and which,
therefore, do not materially assist in the construction of the section here in
question. In one of the more recent, Gamble v. Jordan[1] , the accused was charged with having flock in his
possession ""for the purpose of making"" certain articles. He had
received from his sister a mattress, the seams of which he had opened, and
""removed the flock with the intention of putting it back in the same covering.""
It was held that the accused was neither making nor manufacturing a mattress.
In the language of Avory J., at p. 153:

In one sense a new mattress
may be made out of a secondhand one; new covering may be put upon old stuffing,
or an old cover may be stuffed with new flock. Those are not the operations in
question.

The accused, in the case at bar,
was fashioning or changing a piece of white paper into a paper to be used for
an entirely new and different purpose and without the additions he made it could
not be so used. The white paper had to be changed or fashioned; in a word, it
had to be made to serve that new purpose.

Counsel for the accused referred
to ss. 14, 15, 16 and 20 of the Forgery Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 165. No
doubt these were present to the mind of Parliament when it enacted s. 471(a)
(or rather its predecessor s. 434(a) in the Criminal Code of 1892
R.S.C., c. 29), which is entirely different in its language and much wider in
its scope. The foregoing

[Page 540]

sections were drafted in more detail
and in that sense are limited in their application and no doubt more favourable
to the contention of counsel for the accused. It is not, however, from a
construction of the language of those sections but rather that of s. 471(a)
that the submission of counsel on behalf of the accused must be determined. The
language of that section sets forth a clear intention on the part of Parliament
to make that which the accused here did an offence.

The appeal should be dismissed.

LOCKE J.:—I am of the opinion that
this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice O'Halloran
in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

and of Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:

FAUTEUX J.:—The nature and the
course of proceedings, eventually leading to these four separate appeals, are
substantially alike in all of the cases. Each of the respondents was separately
indicted on two counts: one being that, at some definite time in 1950, in the
province of British Columbia, he was found in unlawful possession of drugs,
under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act 1929 as amended, and the second
one charging him to be a habitual criminal within the meaning of the provisions
of Part X(A) of the Criminal Code of Canada. The first count—which is
not relevant to the point raised in the present appeal—was either admitted by
the accused or found by the jury. As to the second count, the accused pleaded
not guilty but were found guilty by the jury. An appeal, subsequently lodged
against the latter conviction, was unanimously maintained by the Court of
Appeal of the province[2] , which
quashed the conviction and directed a verdict of acquittal to be entered
thereon. Identical in all of the cases, the judgment rests on the
interpretation of the provisions of section 575(c) (1) (a) of
Part X(A). On this point, and under the authority of section 1025 of the Criminal
Code, leave to appeal to this Court was granted to the appellant.

It was agreed by counsel of all
interested parties that the argument made in the appeal of His Majesty the
King v. Gordon Robinson or Robertson—the first being called for
hearing—would apply in all the other cases.

The opposing contentions of the
parties, which are now to be considered, may more clearly be stated once the
relevant part of section 575(c) is quoted:

A person shall not be found
to be a habitual criminal unless the judge or jury as the case may be, finds on
evidence,

[Page 524]

(a) that since
attaining the age of eighteen years he has at least three times previously to
the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of an
indictable offence for which he was liable to at least five years'
imprisonment, whether any such previous conviction was before or after the
commencement of this Part, and that he is leading persistently a criminal life;
or

The submission of respondent,
which prevailed in the Court of Appeal, rests on an argument, centered solely
on the meaning of the words ""at least""—twice appearing in the above
provision—and purporting to implement the rule of literal interpretation. In
both instances the words are said to mean ""not less than"". ""Not
less than""—it may be pointed out—is the qualifying phrase used by
Parliament in relation to minimum mandatory sentences, which are few in number.
Paraphrasing the relevant part of the provision, in a manner strictly
consistent with the submission made, the provision would read: ""A person
shall not be found to be a habitual criminal unless it is found on the evidence
that, since attaining the age of eighteen years, he has not less than three
times, previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment,
been convicted of an indictable offence for which the minimum mandatory
punishment enacted is not less than five years' imprisonment."" In this
category, it may immediately be noted, there is only one offence in the Criminal
Code. The offence is dealt with in section 449:—Stopping the mail with
intent to rob.

In the appellant's view, the
words ""at least"", in the context, mean ""as much as"" and the
questioned part of the provision should read: ""… unless… he has… been
convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable or exposed to suffer
as much as five years' imprisonment."" Thus, it is said, that, in the
context—and not detached therefrom—these words are indicative of a minimum
manifestly related to the maximum number of years of imprisonment which the
offender is liable or exposed to suffer as punishment. There are, in the Criminal
Code, some one hundred and eighty indictable offences for which the
offender is liable to receive as a maximum punishment a sentence of at least
five years' imprisonment.

The will of Parliament is well
manifested by the provisions of Part X(A) and the words ""at least"",
when read

[Page 525]

in the context, are, in my
respectful view, quite inapt to defeat the primary as well as incidental
purposes of this Part.

Part X(A) is new in our Criminal
Code. Enacted in 1947, by section 18 of the Criminal Code Amendment Act,
chapter 35, its provisions may be traced to Part II of the English Act assented
to on December 21, 1908, being 8 Edward VII Ch. 59, the unabridged title of which is: ""An
Act to make better provision for the prevention of crime and for that purpose
to provide for the reformation of young offenders and the prolonged detention
of habitual criminals and for other purposes incidental thereto.""

The primary purpose of Part X(A)
is best indicated by the following underlined words of section 575(b):—

Where a person is convicted
of an indictable offence committed after the commencement of this Part and
subsequently the offender admits that he is or is found by a jury or a judge to
be a habitual criminal, and the court passes a sentence upon the said offender,
the court, if it is of the opinion that, by reason of his criminal habits and mode
of life, it is expedient for the protection of the public, may pass a further
sentence ordering that he be detained in a prison for an indeterminate period
and such detention is hereinafter referred to as preventive detention and the
person on whom such a sentence is passed shall be deemed for the purpose of
this Part to be a habitual criminal.

It is equally provided—by section
575 (g)—that persons undergoing preventive detention may be confined in
a prison or part of a prison set apart for that purpose, to be subjected to
such disciplinary and reformative treatment as may be prescribed by the prison
regulations. In brief, the provisions of Part X(A) are clearly directed to
persons who, by reason of ""criminal habits and mode of life"", must,
for the protection of the public, be subjected to preventive detention, for an
indeterminate period. It is left to the Minister of Justice to ""review the
condition, history and circumstances of that person—once at least in every
three years—with a view to determining whether the person should be placed out
on license, and if so, on what conditions (s. 575 (h)).

What the Legislature considers as
being tantamount to ""criminal habits and mode of life justifying
preventive detention for the protection of the public"", is indicated in
the provisions of secton 575 (c) where a minimum requirement, expressed
in the form of several conditions, is estab-

[Page 526]

lished. Three of the conditions
which must be found on the evidence, before a person can be branded and dealt
with as a habitual criminal, are that :

(1) Since attaining the age of
eighteen years

(2) he has, at least three times
previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been
convicted of an indictable offence

(3) that is, not any indictable
offence but an indictable offence for the commission of which the offender is
liable to at least five years' imprisonment.

The corresponding section in the
English Act is section 10, which, in substance, prescribes that:

(1) Since attaining the age of
sixteen

(2) he has, at least three times
previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been
convicted of a crime.

(3) which, according to ss. 6 of
section 10, comes within the definition of a crime as precised under the Prevention
of Crimes Act, 1871.

Thus, and under both Acts, it is
not the repeated commission of all kinds of offences which may cause an
offender to be found a habitual criminal. It is only the repeated commission of
such offences which are therein indicated. While such indication is, under
section 20 of the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1871, achieved by various
ways, only one method to that end is used in Part X(A). The offences are not
identified by names or by reference to sections describing them, but by the
measure of punishment or, more precisely, by the maximum punishment which the
offender is exposed to suffer. And only those crimes for which the authorized
maximum punishment is at least five years' imprisonment come within the purview
of Part X(A). Again, in such category, there are, in the Criminal Code,
some one hundred and eighty crimes while there is only the crime described in
section 449 for which the minimum mandatory sentence prescribed is five years'
imprisonment. If the appellant's submission is right, these one hundred and
eighty indictable offences are within the purview of Part X(A) which may then,
and for that reason, receive as general an application as the generality

[Page 527]

of the above quoted provisions
suggest it should. If, on the contrary, the submission of the respondents is
accepted, Part X(A) is inapplicable in the case of these one hundred and eighty
indictable offences and applicable only to the one indictable offence defined
in section 449.

That Parliament would have, in
1947, enacted all the provisions of Part X(A), and would further, by
incorporating it in the Criminal Code, have extended—by force of section
28 of the Interpretation Act—its application to other federal statutes
where indictable offences are created, with the sole object of dealing
exclusively with the now uncommon offence of stopping the mail with intent to
rob or search, is clearly untenable.

Can the intent of Parliament,
manifested by the above quoted provisions, be defeated on the alleged ground of
ambiguity or intractability of the language adopted by Parliament in the
following phrase of subsection (1) (a) of section 575(c)
""for which he was liable to at least five years' imprisonment""?

""It is quite true"",
says one of the learned members of the Court of Appeal, ""that when one reads
the subsection for the first time, the effect of the intractability of the
language may not be at once apparent; the dominant impression may be that it
simply excludes from its operation offences which do not merit imprisonment for
five years or more. But a check on this thinking reveals one cannot fix a
maximum of this kind if there is no minimum; the point at which the maximum
starts automatically fixes the minimum."" With this line of reasoning one
cannot disagree provided, in my respectful view, both the minimum and the
maximum are related to the same type of sentence. However that may be, this
reasoning does not solve the question for, in the appellant's submission, the
phrase ""for which he was liable to at least five years' imprisonment""
is related to the first kind of sentence above indicated and means ""for
which the authorized discretionary sentence is at least five years"" while,
in the respondents' view, it refers to the second kind of sentence and means
""for which the mandatory sentence is at least five years"". It thus
becomes apparent that the controlling word in the phrase is really the word
""liable"", and that the meaning of this word, in the ordinary language
as well as under the Code, must 

[Page 528]

then be ascertained to decide the
issue. Of the various imports ascribed to the word ""liable"" in The
Oxford English Dictionary, vol. VI, p. 234, the following are indicated:
""Exposed, or subject to, or likely to suffer"". Under the Code,
the provisions of section 1054 make it clear that Parliament has given to the
word ""liable"" a like practical significance. For this section reads:

Every one who is liable to
imprisonment for life, or for any term of years, or other term, may be
sentenced to imprisonment for any shorter term: Provided that no one shall be
sentenced to any shorter term of imprisonment than the minimum term, if any,
prescribed for the offence of which he is convicted.

The opening words of this section:
""Every one who is liable…"" are clearly in reference to similar words
used by Parliament in the pattern generally followed in the prescription of
punishment, as illustrated in the following section :

Every one is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to seven years' imprisonment who breaks and
enters any place of public worship, with intent to commit any indictable
offence therein.

(s. 456).

The words ""liable to seven
years' imprisonment"" in section 456, read in the light of the provisions
of section 1054, necessarily indicate an authorized but not a mandatory term of
imprisonment. And the words ""for which he was liable …"", in the new
enactment—section 575(c)—can only be related to similar words used in the
general pattern and must, thus, be presumed to be understood in the same sense.
The fact that the opposite view would entirely defeat what the above quoted
provisions of Part X(A) indicate as its clear object, is no reason to nullify
the presumption. That the word ""liable"" appears in few provisions—some
ten sections under the Code—where, by exception, a mandatory term is
prescribed, is of no avail as an argument against the above conclusion, for the
word ""liable"", in its proper sense, is there equally related to the
maximum authorized sentence to which the minimum mandatory term is attached. It
is also of some significance that in section 263, dealing with the
predetermined mandatory punishment for murder, the word ""liable"" is
not used.

In my respectful view, the
submission of the respondents cannot rest, as alleged, on the rule of literal
construction.

[Page 529]

As to the application of the
narrow construction doctrine, in the construction of penal statutes, this may
be said. The matter, in England, is deal with in Maxwell on Interpretation of
Statutes, 9th Edition, 1946, p. 267, in the following terms:

The rule which requires that
penal and some other statutes shall be construed strictly was more rigorously
applied in former times when the number of capital offences was very large (a),
when it was still punishable with death to cut down a cherry-tree in an
orchard, or to be seen for a month in the company of gipsies (b), or for
a soldier or sailor to beg and wander without a pass. Invoked in the majority
of cases in favorem vitae, it has lost much of its force and importance
in recent times, and it is now recognized that the paramount duty of the
judicial interpreter is to put upon the language of the Legislature, honestly
and faithfully, its plain and rational meaning and to promote its object.

In Canada, section 15 of the Interpretation
Act disposes of all discussion in the premises. This section, by force of
section 2, extends and applies to the Criminal Code and the following words in
section 15 ""or to prevent or punish the doing of anything which it deems
contrary to the public good"" make it clear that its provisions embrace
penal as well as civil statutory provisions in any Canadian statute except if
there is inconsistency or a declaration of inapplicability.

The appeal of His Majesty against
each of the four respondents should be maintained, and the judgment of the
Court of Appeal should be quashed. This conclusion, however, does not bring
these cases to an end, for there were, before the Court of Appeal, other points
besides the one discussed herein on which the respondents are entitled to have
an adjudication. Adopting the course followed in The King v. Deur[3]
, and The King v. Boak[4]
, the cases should be remitted to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in order that it may pass upon these other grounds of appeal.

The judgment of Rand, Kellock and
Locke, JJ. was delivered by:

LOCKE J.:—The contention of the
Crown is that while the words ""at least"", where they first appear in
subsection (a) of section 575C(1) of the Criminal Code, are to be
construed as meaning ""not less than"", where they again appear
following the words ""liable to"", they are to be

[Page 530]

taken as meaning ""as much
as"". Thus, if the respondents were shown to have been convicted three
times or more of criminal offences for which the maximum permissible punishment
was five years' imprisonment or more, this condition of the section would be
complied with. The Court of Appeal[5] , has
unanimously rejected this contention, the learned judges all being of the
opinion that in the context the expression should be construed, where used for
the second time, in the same manner as when first used.

Since no mention is made of
section 15 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 1, in the reasons
for the judgment appealed from or in the factum of either party, I judge that
it was not argued in the Court of Appeal that the rules of statutory
construction prescribed by that section were to be applied. Mr. Justice
O'Halloran refers to the common law rules of construction but, while the result
may not be affected, I am of the opinion that it is to the statute we must
look. Section 15 reads:

Every Act and every
provision and enactment thereof, shall be deemed remedial, whether its
immediate purport is to direct the doing of any thing which Parliament deems to
be for the public good, or to prevent or punish the doing of any thing which it
deems contrary to the public good; and shall accordingly receive such fair,
large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the
attainment of the object of the Act and of such provision or enactment,
according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.

This section appears to have had
its origin in section 5 of c. 10, Statutes of Canada 1849 which was, with
minor differences which do not affect the meaning, expressed in the same terms.
It was reproduced in substantially the same form in section 6 of c. 5
Consolidated Statutes of Canada 1859 and appeared as the 39th paragraph of
section 7 of the Interpretation Act, passed at the First Session of the
Parliament of Canada in 1867, and has been continued in language identical in
meaning up to the present time. Section 3 of the Act as passed in 1867 provided
that section 7 and each provision thereof should extend and apply to every Act
passed in the session held in that year and in any future session of the
Parliament of Canada, except in so far as the provision was inconsistent with
the intent and object of the Act or the interpretation which

[Page 531]

such provision would give to any
word, expression or clause inconsistent with the context and except in so far
as any provision thereof in any such Act is declared not applicable thereto.
Section 2 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 1, declared that
the Act and every provision thereof should extend and apply to every Act of the
Parliament of Canada then or thereafter passed, with the like exceptions, and
the legislation was in this state when the Criminal Code was first
enacted in 1892. Section 2 of the present Act is in like terms and its
application does not, in my opinion, restrict in any way the application of
section 15 to the language here to be construed.

Section 15 appears to me to be
substantially a restatement of the rules for the construction of statutes
contained in the Resolutions of the Barons in Heydon's Case[6]
. While in Attorney General v. Sillem[7]
, Pollock, C.B. said (p. 509) said that the rules of construction there stated
were not to be applied to a criminal statute which creates a new offence, this
argument is not available here to the respondents since the matter has been
dealt with by statute. The offence of being a habitual criminal is new to our
law. Clearly the language employed in defining it is capable of the
construction contended for by the respondents. This, if adopted, would lead to
the result that, unless the three offences or more proven against them were such
that the minimum permissible punishment was five years' imprisonment, they were
entitled to be acquitted. In re National Savings Bank Association[8]
, Turner, L.J. dealing with the construction of a clause in the Companies
Act 1862, said that he did not consider it would be consistent with the law
or with the course of the Court to put a different construction upon the same
words in different parts of an Act of Parliament, without finding some very
clear reason for doing so. There are dicta to the same effect by Cleasby, B. in
Courtauld v. Legh[9]
, and by Chitty, J. in Spencer v. Metropolitan Board of Works[10]
. In the present matter the clear indication that the words ""at
least"" are to be construed as meaning something else than ""not less
than"", where used the second time, must be

[Page 532]

found if at all in their
association with the word ""liable"" and it is really the sense in
which the latter word is to be understood in the context that determines the
matter.

In my opinion, the requirement
that statutes and their provisions are to be deemed remedial and that they
shall accordingly receive ""such fair, large and liberal construction and
interpretation"" as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the
Act does not mean that the object of the Act is not to be clearly manifest from
the language employed. The object of these amendments to the Criminal Code
is to be ascertained by determining the identity of the persons against whom
they are directed. In accordance with the canons for the interpretation of statutes
the Act as a whole may be examined as an aid to the construction of the
language of the amending sections. As appears from section 575B the legislation
is designed for the protection of the public against the danger inherent in
permitting habitual criminals being at large. While in sections 122, 364, 377,
449, 510A, 542 and 1054A, minimum terms of imprisonment are provided for the
offences defined, in but one of these, section 449, is the minimum permissible
term five years, and in none other is it more than this. In sections 122, 364,
449 and 510A the language is that the guilty person is ""liable to
imprisonment for a term not less than."" In 14 sections of the Code
where the prescribed punishment is or includes a fine and a minimum is
prescribed the words used are also ""not less than."" In none of the
sections is the minimum permissible term of imprisonment or fine expressed by
employing the expression ""at least"". Where, however, only the maximum
punishment by way of imprisonment which may be imposed is to be expressed, this
has been done in at least 260 other sections of the Code by saying that
the guilty person is ""liable to"" a penalty, leaving it to the
operation of section 1054, which provides that anyone liable to imprisonment
for life or any other term may be sentenced to imprisonment for any shorter
term except where a minimum term is prescribed, to enable the Court to impose
imprisonment for any lesser term. While in some 35 other sections of the Code
the maximum term of imprisonment is defined by saying that it shall be for a
term 

[Page 533]

""not exceeding"" or
""not more than"" a stated period, this appears unnecessary in view of
the provisions of section 1054.

The persons to whom the habitual
criminal sections of the Criminal Code are applicable are, if the
respondents' contention be accepted, only those who have on three occasions or
more been convicted of offences against section 449, dealing with the offence
of stopping a mail with intent to rob or search the same, and presumably such
other offences for which there may hereafter be prescribed a minimum term of
five years' imprisonment. Construing the subsection in the manner contended for
by the Crown means that conviction on three or more occasions of any of the
many other offences described in the Code for which the maximum
imprisonment might be five years or more would comply with the subsection. The
language of section 575B is that where a person is convicted of an indictable
offence committed after the commencement of the Part and subsequently admits
that he is, or is found by a jury or a judge, to be a habitual criminal:

the Court, if it is of the
opinion that by reason of his criminal habits and mode of life it is expedient
for the protection of the public, may pass a further sentence ordering that he
be detained in a prison for an indeterminate period.

It is habitual criminals as a
class against whom the public are to be protected. The words ""liable
to"", with the noted exceptions, being used throughout the Code to
indicate the maximum sentences which may be imposed, the expression
""liable to at least"" in subsection 575C(1), in my opinion, conveys,
and was intended to convey, the meaning contended for by the Crown. It is
inconceivable to me that these new sections of the Code were directed against
the very limited class of criminals who would be affected if the respondents'
contention were correct. We are required by section 15 to interpret the
subsection in such manner as will best ensure the attainment of its object
according to its true intent, meaning and spirit, and to construe this language
in this manner is, in my judgment, not to legislate but to comply with the
directions of the statute.

I would allow these appeals and
refer each case back to the Court of Appeal, in order that the other grounds of
appeal raised before that Court may be there dealt with.

[Page 534]

CARTWRIGHT J.—The only question
raised on this appeal is as to the proper interpretation of section 575C of the
Criminal Code. This section is found in Part XA dealing with habitual
criminals which was added to the Code in 1947 by 11 Geo. VI, c. 55,
section 18.

The section, so far as it is
relevant to this appeal, reads as follows:

575C. (1) A person shall not
be found to be a habitual criminal unless the judge or jury as the case may be,
finds on evidence,

(a) that since
attaining the age of eighteen years, he has at least three times previously to
the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of an
indictable offence for which he was liable to at least five years'
imprisonment, whether any such previous conviction was before or after the
commencement of this Part, and that he is leading persistently a criminal life;
or …

The controversy is as to the
proper construction of the words ""been convicted of an offence for which
he was liable to at least five years' imprisonment.""

The respondent submits that these
words, construed in their ordinary and natural meaning, describe an indictable
offence as punishment for which the law prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence
of imprisonment for at least five years. The appellant submits that they
describe an indictable offence as punishment for which the maximum penalty
permitted by the law is imprisonment for five years or more.

The solution of the question
depends upon the meaning to be given to the words ""liable to"". Their
ordinary and natural meaning is, I think, ""exposed to"". The intention
of Parliament as disclosed in the words of the section seems to me to be to
describe a class of indictable offences, and to require as one of the
conditions of a person being found to be a habitual criminal that he shall at
least three times have been convicted of an offence comprised in such class.
The offences of which the class is composed are described by reference to the
penalty which the law permits to be inflicted on a person convicted thereof,
that is to say, the penalty to which he is exposed, which he runs the risk of
suffering, which he is subject to the possibility of undergoing, not the
penalty which he must suffer. Every indictable offence on conviction of which a
person may lawfully is the permissible maximum and not a mandatory minimum. be
sentenced to five years imprisonment or more is, I think, 

[Page 535]

included in the class described
and every indictable offence on conviction of which a person may not lawfully
be sentenced to so long a term of imprisonment as five years is, I think,
excluded.

Expressing my view in different
words, I think that the question an affirmative answer to which will determine
that a particular indictable offence falls within the class described is: Does
the law permit (not does the law require) the imposition on a person guilty of
such offence of a term of imprisonment of as much as or more than five years?

The meaning which I ascribe to
the word ""liable"" is given in the Oxford English Dictionary (1933)
Volume VI, page 235. In Black's Law Dictionary, 3rd Edition (1933), page 1103,
the meaning given is: ""Exposed or subject to a given contingency, risk or
casualty which is more or less probable"". In In re Soltau's Trusts[11]
, North J. agreeing with a decision of Stirling J. in an earlier case held that
the expression ""is liable to be laid out in the purchase of land""
does not mean ""has to be laid out in the purchase of land"" but means
""subject to some disposition under which it may be laid out in the
purchase of land"".

If the words of the section only
were to be considered it would be my view that their natural meaning is that
attributed to them by the appellant. We are not, however, limited to a
consideration of the words of the section. In order to ascertain the intention
of Parliament we must construe the statute as a whole and not one part only by
itself. The great majority of the sections in the Criminal Code which define
indictable offences and prescribe the penalties therefor are in the following
form: ""Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to—years'
imprisonment who …"". Section 1054 of the Code provides as follows:

1054. Every one who is
liable to imprisonment for life, or for any term of years, or other term, may
be sentenced to imprisonment for any shorter term: Provided that no one shall
be sentenced to any shorter term of imprisonment than the minimum term, if any,
prescribed for the offence of which he is convicted.

In my opinion a consideration of
such sections strengthens the view that the words ""liable to""
followed by a stated term of years' imprisonment mean that such term In so far
as Parliament may be said to grade offences, in the Criminal Code, according to
their seriousness it does

[Page 536]

so by fixing for each a
permissible maximum sentence leaving it within the power and discretion of the
Court, before which a person is convicted, to impose such lesser sentence as
the particular circumstances may warrant, subject in the case of a few offences
to a prescribed minimum. The words with which we are concerned appear to me to
mean that no person shall be found to be a habitual criminal unless proved to
have been convicted at least three times of an offence so serious that the
permissible maximum sentence therefor is at least five years' imprisonment.
They set a minimum in the field of permissible maxima.

It will next be observed that the
Code contains only one offence, that described in section 449, for which
a mandatory minimum sentence of as much as five years' imprisonment is
prescribed. The words of a statute must be construed so as to give the statute
a sensible meaning if possible. Here the construction for which the appellant
contends gives the statute a sensible and effective meaning while that for
which the respondent argues would render Part XA without effect.

In my opinion if the words of an
enactment which is relied upon as creating a new offence are ambiguous, the
ambiguity must be resolved in favour of the liberty of the subject, but whether
or not such ambiguity exists is to be determined after calling in aid the rules
of construction. I have reached the conclusion that the words of the section
construed with the aid of the applicable rules, mentioned above, leave no room
for doubt as to the intention of Parliament, and that such intention is that
for which the appellant contends.

I would allow this appeal and
those in the cases of His Majesty the King v. McKenna, His Majesty
the King v. Cuthbert and His Majesty the King v. Beatty
which it was agreed should abide its result and refer each case back to the
Court of Appeal so that the other grounds of appeal, raised in that Court, may
be dealt with.

Appeals allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Manslaughter—Operation of motor
vehicle—Verdict of criminal negligence—Substituted by Court of Appeal for
dangerous driving—Whether dissent in Court of Appeal within section 1023(1) of
Criminal Code—Sections 285(6), 951(3), 1016(2) and 1023(1) of the Criminal
Code.

In 1948, appellant was tried before a jury on a charge of
manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. The jury,
implicitly acquitting him of that offence, returned a verdict of guilty of
criminal negligence. The Court of Appeal was unanimously of the opinion that
this verdict could not stand and the majority, therefore, basing itself on
sections 1016(2), 951(3) and 285(6) of the Criminal Code, substituted a
verdict of guilty of dangerous driving. The minority, expressing a doubt as to
whether section 1016(2) applied and not wanting to speculate as to what the
jury intended by their verdict, would have acquitted the accused.

Held: (Affirming the judgment appealed from) Locke and
Cartwright JJ. dissenting, that the appeal should be dismissed as the dissent
in the Court of Appeal was not on any ground of law dealt with by the majority,
and upon which there was a disagreement in the Court of Appeal. (Expressing a
doubt is not dissenting).

[Page 249]

Per the Chief Justice, Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: As
an appeal under s. 1023(1) of the Criminal Code is limited to grounds of
law alone, upon which there were points of difference in the Court of Appeal,
and as the ground raised by the minority, assuming that it was a ground of law
alone, was not considered by the majority because of the view they took of the
case, there was, therefore, no disagreement in the Court of Appeal on a
question of law alone and this Court has, consequently, no jurisdiction to
entertain the appeal.

Per Locke and Cartwright JJ. (dissenting): The appeal
should be allowed and a new trial ordered as the Court of Appeal had no right
to substitute a verdict of dangerous driving under 1016(2) since, because of
errors in law in the charge, this verdict could not have stood even if the jury
had found it.

Per Locke and Cartwright JJ. (dissenting): To give this
Court jurisdiction to entertain an appeal under s. 1023(1), it is not necessary
that the dissenting judgment upon which the appeal is based proceeded upon a
point of law with which the majority also dealt and upon which the majority and
the dissenting judges were in disagreement, but it is sufficient under that
section that (a) there be a dissenting judgment and (b) that a
ground upon which such dissenting judgment is based be a question of law.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench,
appeal side, province of Quebec 1, substituting, Letourneau C.J.A. and
Barclay J.A. dissenting, for a jury's verdict of guilty of criminal negligence
a verdict of dangerous driving of an automobile pursuant to section 285 of the Criminal
Code, affirming the sentence passed by the trial judge and dismissing the
appeal.

Jean Drapeau for the
appellant.

Noel Dorion K.C. and Lucien
Thinel for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau and
Fauteux J.J. was delivered by

Fauteux J.—The
appellant has been charged with the offence of manslaughter, arising out of the
operation of a motor vehicle on the 17th of October 1947, in the district of
Terrebonne, Province of Quebec. On the 26th of October 1948, the jury,
implicitly acquitting him of the major offence of manslaughter, returned a
verdict expressed in the following terms: ""guilty of criminal
negligence."" The record does not disclose any objection being taken to the
verdict, either as to its form or as to its substance, at the time it could
have been corrected.

[Page 250]

About two weeks later, Rozon appealed to the Court of King's
Bench (Appeal Division) 2 on questions of. law alone. There was no
appeal on questions of fact or mixed law and fact nor was there any leave
granted or even asked to appeal on such questions. Of the three grounds raised
on law, one was that the accused having been indicted for manslaughter as the
result of the operation of a motor vehicle, the verdict of criminal negligence
was illegal.

By a majority judgment (St.-Jacques, Gagné and
MacKinnon (ad hoc), JJ.), that appeal was dismissed; a verdict of reckless driving
was substituted for the one expressed by the jury and the sentence imposed by
the trial judge was allowed to stand. Mr. Justice Barclay, with the concurrence
of the late Chief Justice Létourneau, expressed a dissent
clearly limited to the manner in which the appeal should be disposed of in view
of the illegality of the verdict expressed by the jury: They would have allowed
the appeal and quashed the conviction and the sentence. Thus, there was no
dissent as to any of the grounds of appeal raised by the appellant in the Court
below and, in point of fact, all the judges, as appears by the following
excerpts from the reasons for judgment, agreed that the accused could not, on
the indictment, be found guilty of criminal negligence. Mr. Justice St.-Jacques,
in reference to the accused, said:

Il soutient que depuis l'amendement apporté en
1938, à l'article 951 du Code
Criminel, un verdict de négligence criminelle sous l'autorité de l'article 284
ne peut plus être rendu. Ainsi formulée, la proposition de l'appelant
n'est pas discutable; il faut l'admettre comme bien fondée.

Mr. Justice Gagné:

Comme M. le Juge St.-Jacques et M. le Juge
Barclay, dont j'ai eu l'avantage de lire les notes, je crois qu'en vertu des amendments
adoptés aux articles 951 et 285, en 1938, l'appelant ne pouvait pas être condamné
pour négligence criminelle.

And, then, Mr. Justice MacKinnon:

I am in agreement with the Hon. Messrs. Justices
St.-Jacques, Barclay and Gagné, whose notes I have had the
opportunity of reading and for the reasons given by them that the appellant
could not be found guilty of ""criminal negligence"" on this charge.

Though no reference is made to ss. 2 of section 1016 of the Criminal
Code, either in the formal judgment or in the reasons for judgment of Mr.
Justice St.-Jacques who wrote

[Page 251]

it, it appears from the reasons for judgment delivered by
the other members of the Court that the dissent is related to this section, in
respect of which the only two questions considered were:

1. Whether section 1016 ss. 2 is, in law, applicable to
the case and, if it is,

2. Whether or not, being applied, the substitution of
verdict could properly be made in the light of the actual finding and the facts
of the case.

It is convenient to quote ss. 2 of section 1016 and, then,
relate the views expressed on the two points by the members of the Court.

2. Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence and
the jury or, as the case may be, the judge or magistrate, could on the
indictment have found him guilty of some other offence, and on the actual
finding, it appears to the Court of Appeal that the jury, judge or magistrate
must have been satisfied of facts which proved him guilty of that other
offence, the court of appeal may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal,
substitute for the verdict found a verdict of guilty of that other offence, and
pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed by the trial court
as may be warranted in law for that other offence, not being a sentence of
greater severity.

Mr. Justice St.-Jacques first deals with the facts of the
case, then with the charge, and finally, without referring in terms to ss. 2 of
section 1016, concludes, as in the formal judgment, that the jury, really
intending to return a verdict of reckless driving, ill expressed themselves in
wording it: ""guilty of criminal negligence."" At page 150, the learned
judge says:

Lorsque ce verdict a été
rendu, le président du tribunal aurait pu ordonner au jury
de le libeller, suivant la preuve et la direction donnée, à savoir: conduite
dangereuse ou désordonnée d'une automobile suivant les expressions que l'on
retrouve au cours de la charge. Il ne l'a pas fait. Sans doute, parce que tout
le monde a compris, à ce moment-là, qu'il s'agissait bien, malgré la rédaction
du verdict, de l'offense prévue à l'article 285.

Je ne puis admettre que ce verdict doive être
cassé et mis à néant; il peut être modifié dans sa rédaction, sans en affecter
la substance qui ressort clairement, et de la preuve et de la charge du juge.

Messrs. Justices Gagné and MacKinnon
are clearly of the opinion that the section is applicable
to the case and applying it, conclude that the substitution is justified by the
finding and the facts of the case. Thus, at page 160, the former says:

Il s'agit de savoir si cette Cour a le pouvoir
de modifier le verdict pour le rendre conforme au paragraphe 6 de l'article 285. L'article 1016, paragraphe 2, nous le permet.

[Page 252]

And, having considered the address of the trial judge, he
concludes, at page 163, to the substitution of a verdict:

Comme on le voit, le savant juge confond, dans les remarques qui suivent la lecture de l'article 285,
par. 6, la négligence criminelle, ou
coupable, et ce qu'il appelle la conduite désordonnée d'une automobile. Mais,
tout cela est en relation avec l'offense prévue au dit paragraphe qu'il a lu en
entier.

Le jury n'a pas pu comprendre qu'il puisse
s'agir d'autre chose. L'expression employée au verdict est impropre, mais c'est
bien l'offense de conduite dangereuse que le jury avait à considérer, et c'est
de cette offense qu'il a voulu déclarer l'accusé coupable.

Finally, referring to the evidence, the learned judge says:

Ce qui s'est passé avant et après l'accident,
d'après la preuve, et l'état du cadavre lorsqu'on l'a trouvé, démontrent de façon
tellement évidente la culpabilité de l'appelant, que le jury n'a pas pu être
influencé par les quelques inexactitudes que signale le savant procureur.

Mr. Justice MacKinnon, at page 166,
states:

I consider that under Art. 1016, paragraph 2, C.C., this Court
has the right to substitute for the verdict as found a verdict of guilty of an
offence under paragraph 6 of Art; 285, C.C.

And, at the same page, on the second point, he concludes :

As pointed out by the Hon. Messrs. Justices St.-Jacques and Gagné, the judge in his address to the jury made no reference to
Art. 284 which defines criminal negligence. He did however read to the jury
paragraph 6 of Art. 285 C.C. which deals with reckless driving. To me it is
evident that taking the judge's charge as a whole that he intended to direct
the jury that it could bring in a verdict of guilty of manslaughter or reckless
driving and that it was the offence of reckless driving which the jury
considered when it found the appellant guilty of criminal negligence. For the
reasons given by Messrs. Justices St.-Jacques and Gagné, with
which I concur, I would substitute for the verdict given a verdict of guilty of
reckless driving and would allow the sentence to stand.

For the minority judges, Mr. Justice Barclay did not consider
the facts at all. Dealing first with the second point, he concludes, at page
159:

… With all these directions to the jury, I am of the opinion
that speculation as to what they really intended would be most unfair to the
accused.

And, dealing then with the first point, he expresses a
doubt:

I am also very doubtful as to whether Article 1016-2 is
applicable to the present case.

And he ends his notes of judgment in saying:

I consider therefore that we have no right to substitute any
other verdict.

[Page 253]

On the alleged basis of this dissent and under the
provisions of ss. 1 of section 1023, Rozon now appeals to this Court,
formulating as follows his grounds of appeal: 

(a) The verdict of criminal negligence was
illegal in view of the indictment for manslaughter resulting from an automobile
accident against the appellant in the present case; 

(b) The Court of Appeal erred in substituting as
it did a verdict of reckless driving to the verdict of criminal negligence
rendered by the jury; 

(c) The Court of Appeal, for the reasons
mentioned in the foregoing grounds of appeal, should have quashed the
conviction. 

It may, at first, be stated that the sole question of law,
if any, on which a dissent may be suggested by the appellant to establish the
jurisdiction of this Court and its limit is in ground (b). For it
clearly appears from the above excerpts from the various reasons for judgment
that there is no dissent as to ground (a) and what is alleged as ground
(c) does not point to a dissent but to the manner in which the appeal
should have been disposed of had the majority agreed with the minority that the
substitution was not appropriate under ss. 2 of section 1016.

So, whether, on the issue, the different conclusions reached
by the majority and the minority groups in the Court below rest on a point of
difference on a question of law and, if so, the merit of such point of law, are
the matters to be considered. For this purpose, what was said by the members of
the Court below as to each of the three features conditioning the exercise of
the special powers given to the Court of Appeal under ss. 2 of section 1016,
may now be examined.

The first condition is that the appellant must have been
convicted of an offence. The appellant contended that the existence of this
condition is not established because the offence of which he was found guilty
by the jury— criminal negligence—was not, in the case at bar, an offence
included in the indictment. Mr. Justice Barclay dealt with this point but left
it as above indicated with no conclusion but simply the expression of a doubt.
And if the sentence at the very end of his reasons: ""I consider there-

[Page 254]

fore that we have no right to substitute any other
verdict"" cannot, because of inconsistency with the doubt expressed, be
related to the point being considered, I should not hesitate to say that there
is no dissent within the meaning of section 1023 and, consequently, no
jurisdiction for this Court to deal with this point for dubitante is not
tantamount to dissentiente. (The King v. Bailey et
al 3).

Assuming, however, that this conclusion with respect to the
lack of right to substitute another verdict could be related to the point under
discussion, and that our jurisdiction cannot otherwise be questioned, I must
confess that I fail to see the difficulty. Again the first condition reads:
""Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence …"" It does not
read: ""Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence included in
the indictment."" To accept the appellant's suggestion would be
tantamount to add a qualification to the first condition. It would equally
curtail the field of the operation of the section to the limits of the
authority assigned in section 951 to a jury to bring a verdict of guilty for a
lesser offence. That ss. 2 of section 1016 includes a like power for a Court of
Appeal is certain but it goes further for the second condition to its
applicability does not read: ""And if the jury could, on the indictment,
have found him guilty of a lesser offence,"" but reads: ""… of some
other offence."" In brief, the evident purpose of the section is to
authorize the Court of Appeal to give effect to the finding of the jury or of
the trial judge, if at all possible within the conditions prescribed. And such
authority is consistent with the principle governing the disposal of appeals in
criminal matters that, failing miscarriage of justice or substantial wrong, the
appeal generally should be dismissed, even if it might, on the grounds raised,
be decided in favour of the appellant.

The second condition to the right of substitution is that it
must have been open to the jury on the indictment to find the appellant guilty
of the offence proposed in substitution. The provisions of ss. 3 of section 951
were specifically enacted for the purpose of giving the authority to find
""reckless driving"" and this verdict, substituted by the Court of
Appeal, is precisely the only one, the appellant

[Page 255]

contended, which could—failing a verdict of manslaughter or
an acquittal—have been rendered on the indictment. As to the second condition,
there is not even a discussion.

The third condition is that, on the actual finding, it must
appear to the Court of Appeal that the jury must have been satisfied of facts
which proved the appellant guilty of that other offence,—in the premises,
reckless driving. From their reasons for judgment, it is clear that the judges
of the majority have exhaustively dealt with all the material available in the
record to consider and answer the question implied in this condition. To that
end, and to that end only—for there was then no other issue legally before the
Court—they considered the verdict expressed by the jury, the facts revealed in
the evidence put before the latter, and the address of the trial judge. They
ultimately concluded that, on the actual finding of ""criminal
negligence,"" not only was it clear to them that the jury were satisfied of
facts which proved the appellant guilty of the offence of ""reckless
driving,"" but that there was no other rational conclusion. In point of
fact, they formed the opinion that, as expressed in the formal judgment, the
jury ill expressed themselves.

For the minority judges, Barclay J. proceeded on quite a
different basis with, naturally, quite a different result. He completely dismissed
from his examination the facts proven. Dealing simply with the address of the
trial judge and finding confusion as a result of some misdirections— which were
not in issue as such but which he found—he concluded:

With all these directions to the jury, I am of opinion that
speculation as to what they really intended would be most unfair to the
accused.

And, at the end, he said:

I consider that we have no right to substitute any verdict.

In substance, and as I read it, the dissent of the minority
rests on the view that the Court of Appeal cannot, as a matter of law,
substitute a verdict under section 1016 subsection 2 when speculation, needed
to ascertain what the jury intended by their actual verdict, would, because of
misdirections, be unfair to the appellant.

[Page 256]

In brief, what was really intended by the jury—this was the
issue and this cannot be a question of law alone—was clear to the majority,
while it was obscure to the minority the members of which, for the reason they
indicated, refused to speculate.

It is thus manifest that with different elements in mind in
the consideration of the question in issue,—the members of the minority
dismissing the evidence from the study of the question,—the members of the
Court naturally had a different view of the same and for reasons entirely
unrelated, were led, in the result, to a different conclusion. And while the
decision of the majority rests on a question of fact, i.e., the intent of the
jury, the dissent of the minority rests on the question of law above stated. On
this point of law expressed by the latter, the former never dissented either
expressly or by implication. Nor did, upon the view they took, even the
occasion to consider the point of law ever arise.

The appeal to this Court being taken under subsection 1 of
section 1023, as enacted in 1925 c. 38 s. 27 in substitution to the relevant
part of what was then section 1024, it is convenient to quote the material
parts of the two sections and a few of the decisions of this Court rendered
thereunder with respect to the limits of the jurisdiction of this Court in the
matter.

Before 1925, section 1024 read:

Any person convicted of any indictable offence whose
conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section 1013, may appeal
to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of such conviction:
Provided that no such appeal can be taken if the Court of Appeal is unanimous
in affirming the conviction …

In Davis v. The King 4, Newcombe,
J., delivering the judgment of the majority, said, at page 526, in reference to
section 1024 above:

The interpretation of the latter section has frequently been
considered by this Court and it is established by a long and practically
uniform course of decision which has become firmly embedded in the practice of
the Court that the only questions open to consideration upon appeals under that
provision are the points of difference between the dissenting judge or
judges and the majority of the Court of Appeal.

[Page 257]

Subsection 1 of section 1023, applicable to this case,
reads:

Any person convicted of any indictable offence whose
conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section 1013, may appeal
to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of such conviction on any
question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.

It may be observed that the latter provision, clearer in
this respect than the former, does not read ""any question of law in the
dissent"" but reads ""any question of law-ore which there has
been dissent in the Court of Appeal.""

In Manchuk v. The King 5, the
appeal being taken upon subsection 1 of section 1023 above, Sir Lyman Duff, the
then Chief Justice, delivering the judgment of the majority, said at page 346:

The appeal is, by law, necessarily limited to the grounds
upon which the learned judges dissented.

In The King v. Décary 6, the same learned jurist, again delivering the
judgment for the Court, stated at page 82:

It is well settled by the decision of this Court that such
grounds must raise the question of law in the strict sense and that it is not a
competent ground of appeal if it raises only a mixed question of fact and law.

And having proceeded to compare the reasons for judgment of
the majority with those of the minority, in order to find the points of difference on law, Sir Lyman concluded with respect to the
reasons of the former:

It is quite plain that the judgment does not rest upon any
view of the majority upon a question which is a question of law alone.

And with respect to the reasons of the latter: 

Turning now to the judgment of the minority, Mr. Justice
Hall simply says: ""I am of opinion that this appeal should be
dismissed."" Plainly there is no dissent upon any question of law. Mr.
Justice Walsh, in the reasons delivered by him for his conclusion that there
should be a new trial, does not say either expressly or by implication, that
this conclusion is based upon an opinion that the majority proceeds upon any
error in point of law alone.

Being of opinion that the judgment of the majority in this
case does not rest upon a question of law alone and that the judgment of the
minority rests on a question of law upon which there was no expressed or
implied dissent from the majority, I must conclude that it is not within the
jurisdiction of this Court to review the answer given

[Page 258]

by the Court of Appeal to the question implied in the third
condition of section 1016 subsection 2.

For the appellant, it was suggested, at first, that the
point of law ultimately raised by the minority is that subsection 2 of section
1016 cannot apply to a case where, the verdict proposed in substitution to the
actual verdict would, on the state of the record, have been bad in law, had it
been found by the jury. And then, it was said that the minority effectively
found misdirections which, in their views, could have vitiated the verdict of
reckless driving, had it been rendered.

With respect to the first branch of this contention, I must
say with deference, that I am unable to read this proposition of law as being
either expressed or implied in the views of the minority. It is certainly not
expressed and, even if and with the necessity of involved construction, it
could be said to be implied, again I should not fail to observe that the
members of the majority, because of the view they took, never considered nor
had to consider this proposition for the conclusion they reached and,
therefore, never dissented upon it.

As to the second branch of the contention, it must be
assumed that, had this been the reasoning of the minority, they would not have
failed—as they did—to deal with the facts of the case in order to consider
whether or not, in the light of the principle of subsection 2 of section 1014,
the result, notwithstanding these misdirections, would inevitably have been the
same. And in the event of a doubt on this question, they would, in view of the
evidence on the record, have ordered a new trial.

I may finally add that, if an affirmative conclusion, as to
the existence of such a dissent within the meaning judicially approved of
section 1023 could have been reached, it would then have been necessary, in the
consideration of the merit of the alleged point of law, to note that this Court
in the Manchuk case 7 applied subsection 2 of section 1016
though clearly of the opinion that there were, in the address of the trial
judge, misdirections amounting, in the result, to a mistrial.

For the above reasons, the appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 259]

The dissenting judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. was
delivered by

Cartwright J.—This
is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) of the
Province of Quebec 8 pronounced on the 12th of May, 1949,
substituting for a verdict of ""guilty of Criminal Negligence"" a
verdict of ""Dangerous driving of an automobile pursuant to section 285 of
the Criminal Code"", affirming the sentence passed by the learned
trial judge and dismissing the appeal. Létourneau C.J. and
Barclay J. dissenting would have allowed the appeal and directed the acquittal
of the accused.

The appellant was tried before Cousineau J. and a jury on a
charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. The
jury brought in a verdict of guilty of criminal negligence. This verdict was
entered and the appellant was sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment. An
appeal was taken, the grounds of appeal being as follows:

1. Le verdict de
négligence criminelle était illégal vu l'acte d'accusation porté contre
l'appelant dans la présente cause;

2. Les commentaires illégaux du procureur
de la Couronne dans son adresse aux jurés sur le fait que l'accusé n'a pas
témoigné et le refus du président du Tribunal d'arrêter les procédures et
d'ordonner un nouveau procès, tel que demandé par le procureur de l'appelant;

3. Le président du Tribunal a erré dans sa
charge aux jurés en omettant de leur donner les directives requises par la loi
dans le cas de preuve de circonstances.

The Court of Appeal held unanimously that the verdict of
guilty of criminal negligence could not stand and the correctness of that holding
was not questioned before us. It is, I think, clear that, as a matter of law,
on an indictment for manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor
vehicle only three verdicts are possible, (i) guilty of manslaughter, (ii)
guilty of the offence created by section 285(6) of the Criminal Code (which
by implication is a finding of not guilty on the charge of manslaughter);

[Page 260]

or (iii) not guilty. The majority of the Court of Appeal
were of opinion that the proper course was to substitute a verdict of guilty of
dangerous driving, pursuant to section 285(6), taking the view that this course
was authorized by the provisions of section 1016(2) of the Code.

From this judgment the appellant appeals to this court, the
grounds of appeal being stated as follows:

The grounds of law on which the present appeal is based are
those set forth in the dissenting judgment of the Honourable Messrs. Justices
Barclay and Létourneau of the Court of King's Bench,
Appeal Side, for the Province of Quebec, which heard the case and in the formal
judgment of the other judges and also those mentioned in the appeal, to wit:

A) The verdict of criminal negligence was illegal in view of
the indictment for manslaughter resulting from an automobile accident against
the appellant in the present case;

B) The Court of Appeal erred in substituting, as it did, a
verdict of reckless driving to the verdict of criminal negligence rendered by
the jury;

C) The Court of Appeal, for the reasons mentioned in the
foregoing grounds of appeal, should have quashed the conviction;

I agree with the view of Barclay J. that the Court of Appeal
had no right to substitute a verdict of guilty of dangerous driving.

It must, I think, be clear that the Court of Appeal can
convict an accused of an indictable offence of which he has not been convicted
by the court of first instance only if statutory authority can be found for
such a course. It is suggested that such authority is conferred by section
1016(2).

Before section 1016(2) can be effective to confer this power
upon the court in an appeal following a trial by jury there appear to be three
conditions which must exist.

(1) The appellant must have been convicted of an
offence.

(2) It must have been open to the jury on the
indictment to have found him guilty of some other, offence.

(3) It must appear to the Court of Appeal on the actual
finding that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved the
accused guilty of such other offence.

In the case at bar it is evident that the second condition
set out above is satisfied.

[Page 261]

Dealing with the first condition mentioned above, Mr. Drapeau argues that the offence of which the appellant has been
convicted must be an offence of which it was possible in law that he could be
convicted on the indictment and that a conviction of an offence neither charged
nor included in the indictment is a legal nullity and not a conviction at all.
We were not referred to any case in which this argument appears to have been
considered and I have not been able to find one. I have examined a number of
cases decided either under section 1016(2) of the Criminal Code or under
section 5(2) of the English Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, 7 Edward VII c. 23,
which is in substantially the same words, but I have found only one in which it
appeared that the verdict for which a different verdict was substituted was one
which could not in law have been found on the indictment. The case to which I
refer is The King v. Quinton 9 affirming 1947 O.R. 1. In
that case the accused was tried on an indictment charging attempted rape. The
jury returned a verdict of ""guilty of assault on a female causing actual
bodily harm."" The Court of Appeal for Ontario held unanimously, and it was
apparently not disputed in this court, that the last mentioned offence is not
included in a charge of attempted rape, the only other offences included in
that charge being indecent assault and common assault. The Court of Appeal
substituted a conviction for common assault and passed a lesser sentence. The
Crown appealed to this court arguing that a conviction for indecent assault
should have been substituted. The appeal was dismissed. There is nothing in the
reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal or of this court to indicate that
the argument put forward in the case at bar by Mr. Drapeau was
advanced or considered and the point appears to me to be still open for
consideration in this court. I do not find it necessary to pass upon it in this
appeal and I think it very doubtful whether it is open for our consideration in
view of the manner in which the dissenting judgments are expressed.

In my view the third condition mentioned above is not
fulfilled in the case at bar. It will be observed that it

[Page 262]

must appear to the Court of Appeal on the actual finding
that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved the appellant
guilty of a breach of section 285(6). 

In determining whether on the actual finding the jury must
have been satisfied of facts which proved the accused guilty of such offence no
doubt the Court of Appeal would find it necessary to examine the evidence and
the charge of the learned trial judge. If, in the course of such examination,
it should appear that there was error in law in the charge, so grave that had
the jury found a verdict of guilty of dangerous driving it must have been set
aside on appeal, I think that section 1016(2) would not empower the Court of
Appeal to enter such a verdict. The section must, I think, contemplate a
situation where if the jury had found the verdict proposed to be substituted
such verdict would on the state of the record have been good in law. To hold
otherwise would bring about the startling result that the Court of Appeal could
substitute for a verdict, which for some reason can not stand, another verdict
which if the jury had found it must have been set aside.

In my view, for the reasons given by Barclay J., because of
what was, I think, a fatal defect in the charge of the learned trial judge, a
verdict of guilty under section 285(6) could not have stood even if the jury
had made it. I think that in effect the learned trial judge charged the jury
that they could, and indeed should, find the accused guilty if, in their view
of the evidence, his conduct was such as to amount to what is commonly called
civil negligence. I think that this was clearly wrong. The learned trial judge
appears to have adopted a passage from one of the judgments delivered in McCarthy
v. The King 10, without giving effect to the
explanation of that judgment contained in The King v. Baker 11.
In my view this is entirely a matter of law and this ground is I think stated
in the dissenting judgment of Barclay J.

It is argued for the Respondent that this ground is not open
for our consideration. It is said that it was not taken in the notice of appeal
to the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) and is not a ground of dissent. It
is true

[Page 263]

that the defect in the charge referred to above was not made
a ground of appeal to the Court of Appeal but this seems to me, in this case,
to be unimportant. The conviction from which the appeal was taken was bad in
law as not being possible on the indictment. I do not think that the appellant
was required to set out other grounds or to anticipate that the Court of Appeal
would substitute a different verdict and to state reasons why that course
should not be followed. The appeal to this court is expressly stated to be
based on ""the grounds of law set forth in the dissenting judgment.""
While it may be proper that the notice of appeal should state with particularity
what those grounds are said to be, it is in the reasons for judgment given by
the dissenting judge rather than in the notice of appeal that our jurisdiction
must be found. The only question as to which there was disagreement in the
Court of Appeal was whether the verdict of guilty of criminal negligence having
been annulled, the Court of Appeal could or should substitute another verdict.
If and in so far as this decision turned on matters of fact or of mixed fact
and law we have no jurisdiction to review it, but if and in so far as it turned
on matters of law and if and in so far as such matters of law form part of the
grounds of dissent, we have jurisdiction. I read the reasons of the minority as
holding inter alia that section 1016(2) cannot be applied because there
was such misdirection by the learned trial judge as to the kind of negligence
which must be found to exist to warrant a verdict of guilty of dangerous
driving under section 285(6) that as a matter of law a verdict of dangerous
driving even if the jury had found it could not have stood.

It will be observed that at the commencement of his reasons
Barclay J. says ""In the view which I take of this case, it is not
necessary to consider the facts."" After holding that the jury could not on
the indictment legally find a verdict of criminal negligence, the learned judge
goes on to discuss the question whether a verdict of dangerous driving should
be substituted under section 1016(2). He quotes the fatal misdirection referred
to above, adds other criticisms of the charge and continues: ""With all
these directions to the jury, I am of the opinion that speculation

[Page 264]

as to what they really intended would be most unfair to the
accused."" He then expresses a doubt, but does not decide, as to whether
section 1016(2) applies unless the verdict proposed to be substituted is
included in the offence found by the jury; and concludes ""I consider
therefore that we have no right to substitute any other verdict.""

I do not think it is a forced construction of the reasons of
the learned judge to read them as indicating that one of the grounds which
moved him to hold that the Court of Appeal had no right to substitute a verdict
was the misdirection referred to above.

In The King v. Décary 12, in quashing an appeal on the ground that there
was no dissent on any question of law, the judgment of the court at page 84
reads as follows: ""Mr. Justice Walsh in the reasons delivered by him for
his conclusion that there should be a new trial, does not say, either expressly
or by implication, that this conclusion is based upon an opinion that the
majority proceeds upon any error in point of law alone.""

In my view, in the case at bar, Barclay J. does point out an
error in law, the misdirection referred to above, and does, I think expressly
but certainly if not expressly then by implication, base his judgment upon it,
I think the point is properly before us.

It has been suggested that it is a condition of this Court's
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal under section 1023(1) of the Criminal
Code that the dissenting judgment upon which such appeal is based shall
proceed upon a point of law with which the majority also deals and upon which
the majority and the dissenting judge or judges are in disagreement. I am
unable to accept this view. It is not, I think, disagreement between the judges
of the Court of Appeal on a point of law which gives jurisdiction. If that were
so there would be a right of appeal in a case in which one judge expressed
definite disagreement on a point of law dealt with by the other members of the
court but agreed with them that the appeal should be dismissed. In my opinion
the existence of the following two conditions is sufficient to give this court
jurisdiction: (i) that there be a dissenting judgment in the

[Page 265]

Court of Appeal, that is a judgment
differing from the result proposed by the majority and (ii) that a ground upon
which such dissenting judgment is based be a question of law.

I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction but under
all the circumstances of the case I think that the proper course is not to
direct a verdict of acquittal to be entered but to direct a new trial on the
charge of a breach of section 285(6) of the Criminal Code.

Appeal dismissed.

Reporter’s Note—The appeal was argued on June 4, 1951 before Kerwin, Kellock,
Estey, Locke and Fauteux JJ. By order of the Court it was re-argued before the
full bench on Oct. 2.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Theft—Receiving—Retaining—Recent
Possession—Whether where explanation rejected but accused acquitted of
receiving conviction on retaining charge maintainable—Whether doctrine of
recent possession applies to retaining—Cr. Code s. 399.

The accused was charged with (a)
receiving and (b) retaining stolen goods knowing them to
be stolen. The evidence established that the goods were found in the recent
possession of the accused. He gave no evidence but his wife, called as a
witness on his behalf, gave an explanation as to how the goods came into her
husband’s possession. The trial judge, sitting without a jury, found that the
explanation was not a reasonable one but acquitted the accused on the receiving
charge and convicted him on the charge of retaining. An appeal to the Ontario
Court of Appeal was dismissed but leave to appeal to this Court was granted on
the following questions of law: (a) The doctrine of recent possession
does not apply to a charge of retaining stolen goods; (b) The learned
trial judge having acquitted the accused

[Page 171]

on a charge of receiving could not in the
circumstances of the case convict him on a charge of retaining; (c) An
accused person cannot be convicted of both of the offences of receiving and
retaining.

Held: Rinfret
C.J., Rand, Kellock, Estey, Locke and Cartwright JJ., (Kerwin, Taschereau and
Fauteux JJ. dissenting):

1. The appeal should be allowed.

2. An accused person cannot be convicted both
of receiving and of retaining. R. v. Yeaman 42 Can. C.C. 78; R. v. Searle 51
Can. C.C. 128; Frozocas v.
The King 60 Can. C.C.
324; Ecrement v. The King 84 Can. C.C. 349.

3. The accused having been acquitted on a
charge of receiving, could not in the circumstances of the case be convicted of
retaining.

Per Rand, Kellock,
Locke and Cartwright JJ. The accused having been acquitted on the receiving
charge it was for the Crown to establish subsequent guilty knowledge which it
failed to do. There was accordingly no evidence or no sufficient evidence upon
which a charge of retaining could be supported.

Per Kerwin J. contra.
The rejection of the explanation permits the doctrine of recent possession
to apply to the charge of retaining. Not only was there evidence to determine
that the explanation was not reasonable but it appeared that was the only
proper conclusion.

Per Taschereau
and Fauteux JJ. contra. In acquitting the accused on the charge of
receiving the trial judge said he did not accept the explanation and therefore
the presumption was not rebutted and it was open to him to decide as he did.

Held: also,
Rinfret C.J. Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux JJ., (Rand, Kellock, Locke
and Cartwright JJ. dissenting). The doctrine of recent possession applies to a
charge of retaining. The King v. Lum Man Bo 16 Can. C.C. 274; Lopatinsky v. The King [1948] S.C.R. 220.

Per Taschereau
and Fauteux JJ. S. 399 provides for two distinct offences “receiving” or
“retaining” knowing it to have been so obtained. It matters not then since
when on a charge of retaining, or how long after on a charge of
receiving, the guilty knowledge co-exists with possession, provided it does at
any time during retention on the former, and at the time of reception on the
latter. To import into the section any question as to the duration of the
guilty knowledge is to add to the word “knowing”, the most essential word in
the entire section, a qualification expressly rejected from the provision by
the very word itself.

Per Estey J.
The language adopted by Parliament indicates it contemplated the application of
the doctrine to the offence of retaining, and this view finds support in that
Parliament has not since Lum Man Bo supra was decided in 1910, enacted
any amendment to the section.

Per Rand,
Kellock, Locke and Cartwright JJ. contra. The doctrine does not apply,
the Crown must establish not only possession but knowledge subsequently
acquired of the stolen character of the goods. R. v. Cohen 8 Cox
C.C. 41 and R. v. Sleep 1 Le. & Ca. 44, applied. The King v.
Lum Man Bow supra, Richler v. The King [1939] S.C.R. 101 and Lopatinsky
v. The King, supra, distinguished.

[Page 172]

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming his
conviction by Forsyth County Court Judge in the County Court Judges’ Criminal
Court for the County of York on a charge of retaining stolen goods in his possession. Reversed.

C.L. Dubin K.C. for the appellant. The doctrine of recent possession does not apply to a charge of
retaining. The theory upon which the doctrine evolved was that a person who was
in possession of goods recently stolen was likely to be the thief and he was
called upon for an explanation as to the manner in which they came into his
possession. It had been the law that the so-called presumptive inference from
which a jury might convict related only to theft and not receiving. R. v.
Langmeand[2]
apparently for the first time extended that charge to receiving because
receiving also contemplates a guilty knowledge at the time of receipt.
Receiving recently stolen goods brings into question only the initial
possession of the goods whereas on a charge of retaining the initial possession
is presumed to be innocent and a person is guilty of retaining as distinguished
from receiving when having come by the goods honestly he later acquires knowledge
that they are stolen and keeps them. On such a charge an accused is not called
on to explain his initial possession because it is presumed innocent and the
entire doctrine of recent possession only calls upon the accused to explain his
initial possession. R. v. Searle[3];
R. v. Jones[4]; R.
v. Carmichael[5]; R.
v. Powell[6]; R.
v. Lamoureux[7]; R.
v. Scott[8]; R. v.
Watson[9].

The judgment in R. v. Lum Man Bow[10] to the contrary was wrongfully decided and
it will be noted that the argument now submitted was not made in that case, The
contrary view in Richler v. The King[11] is obiter and the Court was not
dealing with the argument now submitted.

In the alternative, assuming that the doctrine
of recent possession applies to a charge of retaining, the learned trial judge
having acquitted the accused of receiving could not

[Page 173]

properly in the circumstances have convicted him
of retaining and the verdict is inconsistent. Assuming the doctrine did apply
all that is thereby required was an explanation that might be reasonably true
that the accused came by the goods honestly. Roach J.A. in the Court of Appeal
held that the doctrine only required an explanation of how the accused came by
the goods and that an explanation which rebuts the presumption on the receiving
charge also rebuts it on the retaining charge and in the absence of other
evidence establishing guilty knowledge at the time of receiving he is entitled
to an acquittal. By an acquittal on the charge of receiving the accused has
rebutted the presumption of guilty knowledge at the time he initially came into
possession of the goods and any adverse inference from recent possession of
stolen goods has been met. The Court of Appeal failed to give any effect
whatever to the acquittal on the charge of receiving. Having been acquitted of
receiving the accused is in the same position as if his explanation had been
accepted and he could not properly be convicted unless there was evidence that
after his initial possession of the goods he subsequently learned they were
stolen. There is no such evidence. Neither the trial judge nor the Court of
Appeal made any such finding and the conviction was made and affirmed solely on
the doctrine of recent possession. The conviction on the charge of retaining
was inconsistent with the acquittal on the receiving charge. R. v. Cook[12]; R. v. Mondt[13]; R. v. Hayes and Pallante[14]; R. v. Christ[15].

The accused cannot be convicted of both the
offences of receiving and retaining. The Court of Appeal held that the accused
should have been convicted of receiving but having been acquitted on the
receiving charge all the evidence could be considered on a retaining charge as
if there had been no acquittal on the charge of receiving, and that the accused
could be convicted of both offences, but the offences are alternative offences
and an accused cannot be guilty of both. Where the accused has knowledge of the
goods being stolen at the time of their reception, he is guilty of receiving
and that offence is complete. If he continues to hold them he is still only guilty
of receiving. It is only where he realizes some time after he initially
received

[Page 174]

them that the goods are stolen and then retains
them that he is guilty of retaining. R. v. Brown[16]; R. v. Yeamen[17]; R. v. McClennan[18]; Ecrement v. The King[19]; R. v. Ungaro[20].

C.P. Hope K.C. for the respondent. “Receiving” and “retaining” in s. 399 relate to two different
offences. R. v. Searle[21]. This
statement of the law applies here as the appellant was acquitted of “receiving”
and convicted of “retaining”. The appellant contends the doctrine of recent
possession does not apply to a charge of retaining. It has long been held that
it applies to the offence of receiving. R. v. Langmead[22]. The Court of Appeal of British Columbia
held that it applied to the offence of retaining. R. v. Lum Man Bow[23] and R. v. Davis[24]. The latter case proceeded on the basis
that the Crown must prove that the goods were in fact stolen. In R. v. Parker[25] McDonald J.A. at p. 12 says that in cases
of receiving and retaining the question is not whether the explanation is
believed but whether it is a reasonable one. O’Halloran J.A. in R. v. Mandzuk[26] at 290 “Lack of proof that the appellant
knew the nature of the property and that it was stolen, fail to take into
consideration that when a person is found in possession of recently stolen
goods (in this case slightly under two months) that fact may be regarded as
circumstantial evidence of his knowledge (and cf. R. v. Wilson[27] Martin J.A. at 67) that they were stolen,
unless he gives a reasonable explanation of his possession of them.” Bird J.A.
at 295 “There being evidence of recent possession of stolen goods, a prima
facie presumption arises that the accused is either the thief or the
retainer of the stolen property.” In R. v. Tuck[28] the accused convicted of retaining
appealed, one ground being misdirection as to recent possession. Roach J.A. who
wrote the judgment of the Court says at p. 52 “The proper direction on the
trial of an accused charged with receiving or retaining has been settled, if
there was previously any doubt about it by the Supreme Court of Canada in Richler
v. The King[29].”

[Page 175]

At 103 the learned Chief Justice, with whom the
other members of the Court agreed, said: “The question, therefore, to which it
was the duty of the learned trial judge to apply his mind was not whether the
explanation might be reasonably true, or to put it in other words, whether the
Crown had discharged the onus of satisfying the learned trial judge beyond a
reasonable doubt that the explanation of the accused could not be accepted as a
reasonable one and that he was guilty”, and at p. 54 “It is true that the
learned trial judge in those parts of his charge which I have quoted refers to
the doctrine of recent possession in cases where the charge is receiving. But since
the doctrine of recent possession applies similarly to a charge of retaining
there was no misdirection…” In R. v. Lopatinsky[30] Estey J., who wrote the judgment of the
Court, applies the doctrine to the offence of retaining.

As to the appellant’s second point that the
trial judge having acquitted on the receiving charge could not convict on the
retaining charge. He was entitled to convict on both or either of them
according to the way in which he viewed the evidence. R. v. Langmead
supra per Pollock C.B. at 467, Martin B. at 468. In the instant case it was
just as logical to convict of the retaining on an acquittal of receiving as it
was in the Langmead case to acquit of theft and convict of receiving. It
is for the jury to decide what is the proper verdict having regard to the
facts. R. v. Lincoln[31].
The reasoning of Roach J.A. who wrote the judgment of the Court of Appeal[32] is the correct reasoning, that of Martin
J.A. in R. v. Brown[33]
appears to be based on fallacious reasoning.

As to the appellant’s third point that an
accused person can not be convicted of both the offences of receiving and
retaining, the point is irrelevant as the appellant was convicted only of
retaining.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE: Leave to appeal was granted
on the following questions of law:

(a) The doctrine of recent possession
does not apply to a charge of retaining stolen goods;

[Page 176]

(b) The learned trial judge having
acquitted the accused on a charge of receiving could not in the circumstances
of the case convict him on a charge of retaining;

(c) An accused person cannot be convicted
of both offences of receiving and retaining.

In my humble view, the answer to Question (b)
is sufficient to dispose of the appeal.

There is no doubt that the weapons were stolen
goods; that the accused received them and that he had acquired recent
possession of them. The only other element necessary to be proved in order to
justify conviction on the charge of receiving was that the accused, at the time
he received them, knew they were so stolen.

To establish that necessary element “the Crown
relied on the doctrine of recent possession by the application of which the
burden rested on the accused to give an explanation that he came by these
weapons innocently”, which explanation might reasonably be true, and, because
it might reasonable be true, would raise a doubt as to his guilt.

Such explanation was given by the wife of the
accused. The trial judge analyzed that explanation, examined every fact or
element of same and came to the conclusion that it was not reasonable; but,
when he came to apply that conclusion to the charge of receiving, he
nevertheless acquitted the accused of that charge. On the same explanation,
which he did not believe, he found the accused guilty of retaining.

As the only ground upon which he could acquit
the accused of receiving was the explanation given by the wife, one must come
to the conclusion that he believed it and found it reasonable with regard to
the charge of receiving; while he stated in his judgment that he did not
believe it with regard to the charge of retaining.

In my opinion that is incompatible. He could not
at the same time believe the explanation or find it reasonable and disbelieve
it and find it unreasonable.

All the facts considered by him with regard to
that explanation, which led him to state that he thought the latter
unreasonable, were all facts having to do with the charge of receiving. None
were fresh facts which happened

[Page 177]

subsequent to the receiving and relating only to
the charge of retaining. That is precisely the interpretation of Roach J.A.,
who delivered the reasons for the Court of Appeal:[34]. “The trial judge held that the
explanation was not reasonable but he nevertheless acquitted him”. There was
only one explanation given and it applied to the charge of receiving. There was
no distinct explanation given as regard to the charge of retaining.

There were no new facts put in evidence whereby
a distinction could be made between the receiving and the retaining.

Very respectfully I think that the trial judge
having acquitted the accused on the charge of receiving could not, in the
circumstances of the case, convict him on a charge of retaining.

In my view, there is an absolute contradiction
between the two findings of the trial judge.

For that reason, I am of opinion that the appeal
should be allowed and the conviction set aside.

However, I understand that the reason for
submitting de novo the appeal to the full Court was mainly to have the
Court pronounce upon the question whether the doctrine of recent possession
does or does not apply to a charge of retaining stolen goods; and on that
additional point I wish to state that I concur with the other members of the
Court who express the opinion that the doctrine does apply equally to a charge
of retaining as to a charge of receiving stolen goods.

KERWIN J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal, by
leave granted under section 1025 of the Criminal Code as enacted by
s. 42 of c. 39 of the Statutes of 1948. The appellant was convicted in the
County Court Judge’s Criminal Court of the County of York, on June 7, 1950, of
retaining in his possession, in the months of January and February, 1950, a
Remington repeating shot gun and a Remington repeating rifle, the property of
Grayson D. Burruss and therefore stolen, knowing the same to have been so
stolen. This charge was the fourth count in a charge sheet which charged the
appellant, first, with breaking and entering by day in

[Page 178]

January, 1950, the dwelling house of Grayson D.
Burruss and stealing three guns and other articles, second, with breaking and
entering by night in January, 1950, the same dwelling house with intent to
commit theft, third, with receiving in his possession in the months of January
and February the shot gun and rifle theretofore stolen, knowing the same to
have been so stolen.

It was proved that on January 16, 1950, the gun
and rifle were stolen from Mr. Burruss’ house. The gun was found in the
possession of the accused in his house on February 25, 1950. The rifle had on some
earlier date in February been handed by the accused to one Enge for sale by the
latter on terms that it would be sold for at least twenty dollars and that
anything over that could be kept by Enge. There is no question about the
identity of the gun and rifle and of the fact of their having been stolen. The
accused did not give evidence but an explanation as to how these two articles
came into his possession was given by his wife, which to some extent was
corroborated by the testimony of Enge who had been called on behalf of the Crown.
The County Court Judge found the explanation not reasonable and he found the
appellant guilty on the fourth count, that is, of retaining, but endorsed the
charge sheet with a verdict of not guilty on counts 1, 2 and 3.

Under these circumstances the first point argued
was that the doctrine of recent possession does not apply to a charge of
retaining. The applicable provision of the Criminal Code is s. 399,
which reads as follows:

399. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to fourteen years’ imprisonment, who receives or retains in
his possession anything obtained by any offence punishable on indictment, or by
any acts wheresoever committed, which, if committed in Canada would have
constituted an offence punishable upon indictment, knowing such thing to have
been so obtained.

The offence of retaining was unkown to the
common or statute law of England but was introduced in Canada when the Criminal Code was first enacted in 1892. It is an
entirely separate offence from receiving. The doctrine of recent possession, as
to both theft and receiving, was clearly established in Reg. v. Langmead[35]. There, Langmead had been indicted and
tried for stealing sheep, and

[Page 179]

on a second count, for receiving the sheep
knowing them to have been stolen. The jury convicted him on the latter count.
It was argued that upon an indictment for receiving stolen goods, there should
be some evidence to show that the goods were in fact stolen by some other
person, and that recent possession of the stolen property was not alone
sufficient to support such an indictment as such possession was evidence of
stealing and not of receiving. That argument was not accepted. Chief Baron
Pollock pointed out that the distinction between the presumption as to
felonious receiving and stealing is not a matter of law. Blackburn J. stated
that as a proposition of law, there was no presumption that recent possession
points more to stealing than receiving. He continued:

If a party is in possession of stolen
property recently after the stealing, it lies on him to account for his
possession, and if he fails to account for it satisfactorily, he is reasonably
presumed to have come by it dishonestly; but it depends on the surrounding
circumstances whether he is guilty of receiving or stealing. Whenever the
circumstances are such as render it more likely that he did not steal the
property, the presumption is that he received it.

Of course, he was concerned only with the
charges of stealing and receiving as there was no such offence as retaining
known to the law at that time.

Logically there is as much reason to apply the
doctrine to a charge of retaining as to a charge of receiving. It was so held
by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in The King v. Lum Man Bow[36], and by this Court in Lopatinsky v.
The King[37]. The
point may not have been raised in those cases in the same manner as it was
presented on this appeal but it was distinctly mentioned in the factum for the
Crown, filed in this Court in the Lopatinsky appeal. I agree with the view of
Roach J.A. in the Court of Appeal[38] in the
present case where he states:

Where the charge is retaining the
explanation relates to the period of retention in this way and to this extent,
that if at the time the accused received the goods he had knowledge that they
were stolen, he continued

[Page 180]

thereafter to have that knowledge, but if
at the time he received them he had not that guilty knowledge, there is no
presumption that he thereafter acquired it. There is no burden on the accused
who is charged with the offence of retaining to do more than give an
explanation which might reasonably be true that at the time of receiving the
goods he had not the guilty knowledge that they were stolen. Indeed, it is not
difficult to think of a case in which a party innocently obtained possession of
stolen goods and, apart from giving an explanation of the circumstances in
which those goods came into his possession, he could do no more.

From the foregoing it follows that if an
accused stands charged with both receiving and retaining stolen goods an
explanation which rebuts the presumption on the receiving charge also rebuts it
on the retaining charge and in the absence of other evidence establishing
guilty knowledge at the time of receiving, he is entitled to an acquittal on
that charge and in the absence of evidence establishing that after having
received them he acquired knowledge that they were stolen, he is entitled to an
acquittal on the retaining charge.

The second point raised by the appellant is that
the trial judge having acquitted the accused of the charge of receiving could
not, in the circumstances, convict him of retaining. However, it is not as if
the trial judge had stated that he had accepted the explanation offered on
behalf of the accused and therefore dismissed the charge of receiving, in which
case it might be argued that there was nothing upon which he could base the
conviction for retaining. In the circumstances existing in the present case,
the fact that for some unexplained reason the appellant was found not guilty of
receiving does not prevent a verdict of guilty of retaining. The rejection of
the explanation permits the doctrine of recent possession to apply to the
charge of retaining. It should be added that not only is there evidence upon which
the trial judge could determine that the explanation was not reasonable but it
appears that was the only proper conclusion.

The third point raised, that an accused person
cannot be convicted of both offences, receiving and retaining, does not arise
since the appellant was found not guilty of receiving.

The appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 181]

The judgment of Taschereau and Fauteux, JJ. was
delivered by:

FAUTEUX J.:—It appears necessary, in view of the
arguments raised in this appeal, to deal, at first, with the true legal notion
of the offence or offences, created by the Canadian Parliament, in s. 399 of
the Criminal Code, and then, consider the evidence on record and the
conviction of retaining which is questioned by this appeal.

As to the first point.

By—and ever since—the enactment of the Criminal
Code of Canada, retaining, as well as receiving, goods obtained by theft,
knowing them to have been so obtained, constitutes a criminal offence in
Canada. In this respect and since 1892, the Canadian law is at variance with
the English law, wherein only the act of receiving, and not the act of
retaining, constitutes an offence.

One of the consequences of this change and this
difference in the two laws is that the cases decided in England,—where the
occasion to discuss and apply a provision similarly worded as s. 399 never
arose,—do not and cannot offer a precise and exhaustive definition of receiving
and of retaining, both standing in relation to one another, as they do in s.
399.

But an important feature of the change, with
respect to the real import of the section, stems from the very process by which
it was accomplished. For this change in the law was not achieved by amendment,
but by a codification of what became the main body of the Canadian Criminal
Law, a law flowing from sources different in nature and origin. This very fact
brings to the fore the rule of interpretation related to codification,
according to which resort must not be had to the law pre-existing the codified
law, unless the provisions of the latter be obscure and ambiguous.

Thus, to gather the true legal notion of the
provisions of s. 399, the “proper course”—in the very words of Lord Halsbury,
L.C., in Bank of England v. Vagliano Brothers[39], at page 151:

* * * is in the first instance to examine
the language of the statute and to ask what is its natural meaning,
uninfluenced by any considerations derived from the previous state of the law, and
not to start with inquiring

[Page 182]

how the law previously stood, and then,
assuming that it was probably intended to leave it unaltered, to see if the
words of the enactment will bear an interpretation in conformity with this
view.

But whether or not this rule is applied—and I
can think of no reasons why it should not in the case under consideration—I
fail to see what the difficulty is with respect to the first point, i.e., what
facts may constitute an offence under the provisions of the section.

In the very terms of the provision under our
law, everyone commits an indictable offence who:

(a) “RECEIVES or RETAINS in his
possession * * *”

(b) “* * * anything obtained by any
offence punishable on indictment, or by any acts wheresoever committed, which,
if committed in Canada, would have constituted an offence punishable upon
indictment

(c) “* * * KNOWING such thing to have
been so obtained.”

The natural meaning of this language is clear
and non-ambiguous.

In (a):—If the evidence indicates the
reception, on a charge of receiving, or the retention, on a charge of
retaining, the first element, respective to each case, is fully established.
This conclusion is equally true if, on either charge, both the reception and
the retention are shown in the evidence; for—as far as the evidence is
concerned—the question in each case, is not related to superabundance but only
to sufficiency of the proof. Indeed, and in fact, less frequent may be the
cases—but there are—where the one who receives does not retain, at least for
some measurable time. The case of Milton v. The King[40] is a case in point. Equally, accidental
may be the cases where a person who retains dishonestly, has received honestly,
even though he had throughout the knowledge that the goods were stolen. This is
illustrated by the case of Rex v. Matthews[41]. Again and by the mere operation of s. 69
or others, one may in law, if not in fact, retain without having first
received.

[Page 183]

The difficulty there may be in certain
cases,—where, as an illustration, the reception and the retention amount to one
single transaction—to determine when the reception ceases and when the
retention begins, is one related to evidence and not to substantive law.

In my view, this element in (a), while
being worded in all-embracing, but not obscure nor confusing terms, is clear
evidence of the will of the Canadian Parliament to cover in the most complete
and effective manner the case of possession, at both reception and retention
time.

In (b):—No discussion arises in this
case.

In (c):—The third element which, as the
second, is common to receiving and retaining, is the guilty knowledge. The
words in the enactment are “knowing such thing to have been so
obtained”. The guilty knowledge must then co-exist with possession,—and this
statutory requirement is fully satisfied if it does—(1) at the time of
reception, on a charge of receiving, or (2) at any time during the period of
retention, on a charge of retaining. In this respect, receiving and retaining
are distinguishable as criminal offences. And once an accused is proved to have
received or retained anything, obtained in any of the manners indicated in (b),
the question is:—Did he, (1) at the time of receiving or (2) at any time
during the period of retaining, or (3) throughout the whole period of his
possession, have the knowledge that the thing was so illegally obtained?

An affirmative answer to (1), or (2), or (3)
undoubtedly establishes clear guilt and certainly makes the accused amenable to
justice, for receiving in (1), for retaining in (2), or either of them in (3);
for in each case, the elements of guilt, as enacted by Parliament, are present.

Indeed and in the third alternative, guilty
knowledge co-exists with both the reception and the retention of the
possession. The fact that the evidence on a charge of retaining would indicate
that the guilty knowledge proven to exist during the retention, would have
equally preexisted to it, or the fact that the evidence on a charge of
receiving would indicate that the guilty knowledge, proven to exist at the time
of reception, would not have ceased to exist but continued thereafter, cannot
alter but only strengthen, in each case, the proof of the co‑existence of

[Page 184]

the guilty knowledge with possession. For the
enactment merely says “knowing the same to have been so obtained”. No
matter then, since when, on a charge of retaining, or how long after,
on a charge of receiving, does the guilty knowledge co-exist with
possession, provided it does at any time during retention, on the former, or at
the time of reception, on the latter. To import in the section any like
questions as to the duration of the knowledge is, in my view, adding to the
word “knowing”—the most essential word in the entire section—a qualification
expressly rejected from the provision by the very word itself.

In brief, the section provides, as it was
decided in several Canadian cases, for two distinct offences, the first being
receiving and then the second being retaining anything illegally obtained, knowing
it to have been so obtained.

With respect to punishment, the inescapable
consequence of the distinction between the two offences is that the sentence
stated in the section is the authorized punishment for the commission of
either of the two offences therein created.

It is from the latter conclusion—which is not
disputed—that stem the following argument and conclusion made on behalf of the
appellant.

It is said that Parliament never intended that,
in addition to a penalty for receiving, the accused should be liable to a
further penalty if, after so acquiring stolen goods, he retains them. On the
basis, and as a result of this assumption, another and a new concept of the
offence of retaining is advanced and concluded to be the one meant by the
language of the section. It is suggested that retaining stolen goods, knowing
them to have been stolen, ceases to be the offence of retaining once the
evidence, establishing a guilty knowledge during retention, also indicates that
this guilty knowledge was gained at the time of reception of the stolen goods
or, to put it with more precision, that the guilty knowledge in retaining must
be—and, therefore, must be proved to be—not only subsequent to reception but
exclusively so.

One would observe, at first, that this concept
of retaining—in support of which no precedent has been found to exist—rests on
the limited consideration of a case where receiving and retaining amount to a
continuous or a single transaction.

[Page 185]

It would nevertheless, if accepted, affect the
infinite variety of cases where retaining or receiving may, in fact and in law,
not amount to a continuous or single transaction. This, particularly in view of
the clear language of the section, calls for the necessity of examining both
the assumption and the conclusion advanced on behalf of the appellant.

As to the first.

Whether or not Parliament intended, in the
particular case above stated, that an accused should be liable to two
penalties, is a matter that we are not called upon to decide in this case. In
all the reported cases where the occasion to decide the question could have
arisen, one penalty only was given, or if two were stated, they were made
concurrent. I fail nonetheless to appreciate how a negative answer to the
question could afford a valid criterion for the interpretation of the section.
For the fact that a man may not be punished twice for the same offence
does not necessarily import that he may not twice be prosecuted on a
different charge setting up another legal aspect of the same facts. S. 15 of
the Criminal Code supports that proposition.

As to the conclusion of the new definition.

With deference, I am unable to agree with the
view that while, admittedly, the offence of retaining must, as one of its
elements, include the guilty knowledge at some time while the possession is
being retained, it must also exclude it at the time when possession is gained.
I can think of no case where Parliament states—except in express language—the
elements of a crime in maximum or exclusive terms and where, as a consequence,
evidence must be made to exclude certain facts in order to reach the degree of
certainty required for a conviction in criminal matters. Receiving and
retaining, in s. 399, are certainly not described in such a manner. Strange and
most technical, I think, it would be (a) if a person accused of
retaining, could, having admitted the existence of the guilty knowledge during
the retention, plead successfully that this knowledge had been already gained
by him at the very time the goods were received; or, conversely, (b) if
a person, accused of receiving, could plead successfully on that charge, that
the guilty knowledge existing, at the time he gained possession, continued
thereafter with the retention of the possession.

[Page 186]

Under the authorities where possession is proved
to be recent in relation to theft, a presumption arises that the possessor came
by the goods dishonestly. If, consequently, the above definition of retaining
is accepted, this presumption of fact could, by itself, defeat the case of the
prosecution on a charge of retaining, where the evidence indicates recent
possession.

That the evidence, in some cases, may, on either
charge, indicate the elements of both crimes is certain, but, if it does, I can
find no justification to say that one of either the charge of receiving or the
charge of retaining should have been preferred, by preference to the other.

For these reasons, I am not only unable to
conclude that the above contention, made on behalf of the appellant, casts any
obscurity or ambiguity on the natural meaning of the provision, but I am
convinced that, if accepted, it would directly defeat the only import of the
word knowing.

Dealing now with the second point, i.e., the
evidence on record with respect to the conviction of retaining in the present
appeal.

In the present case, the evidence revealed
particularly the following facts: On the 16th of January 1950, the residence of
one Burruss was broken into and entered; certain chattels, including a
Remington repeating shot-gun and a Remington repeating rifle were stolen
therefrom; having gained possession of these weapons, the appellant gave the rifle—valued
at sixty-eight dollars—to an immediate neighbour, one Enge, with instructions
to sell it, at a price left at the latter’s discretion, provided that out of
the proceeds of the sale, twenty dollars would be remitted to the appellant;
the other gun was still in the possession of the latter, on the 25th of
February 1950, when it was seized in execution of a search warrant.

Thus the appellant—even on the theory of a
defence—did, as a fact, receive and retain possession of stolen goods. Of this
there is no dispute.

The only point in issue is related to the third
element, i.e., the guilty knowledge of the appellant.

One cannot in fact—even if he may in law—retain
possession of a thing without having first gained possession of the same. Thus,
on a charge of retaining, in order to decide whether the retaining is honest or
dishonest, it

[Page 187]

becomes not only pertinent and material but
essential to consider whether there is any admissible evidence in the case
indicating that the accused had or had not the guilty knowledge when he gained
possession.

For once the character of this original
possession is, in a given case, ascertained by direct or circumstantial
evidence, as being dishonest or not proved to be such, the character of this
original possession cannot suddenly change without further evidence of some
subsequent intervening fact altering it. Thus, and in the absence of any such
subsequent fact, if the knowledge is shown by the evidence to be dishonest at
the time when possession is gained, no presumption arises that it becomes
honest during retention; and conversely, if the knowledge is proved to be
honest—or not proved to be dishonest—at the time the accused gained possession,
no presumption can either arise, without such subsequent fact, that this
knowledge at the time possession was gained became dishonest during the period
possession was retained.

Knowledge is a matter of fact and the proof of
its character is not dependent on the nature of the charge laid but on the very
nature of the facts disclosed in the evidence.

Amongst the methods of proving the guilty
knowledge, the doctrine of recent possession must be considered. Thus, any
person, found in possession of stolen goods, is presumed to have come by them
dishonestly if such possession is recent in relation to the theft; or, as was
said by the Lord Chief Justice in Rex v. Powell[42], at page 2:—

The possession of recently stolen property
throws on the possessor the onus of shewing that he got it honestly.

The presumption being applied in the case of an
indictment with a count of theft and a count of receiving, the jurisprudence is
that in the absence of any explanation which might reasonably be true, the
accused may—but must not necessarily—be found guilty of either theft or
receiving. But the presumption itself is one of fact and not one of law. Again,
it is not dependent on the charge laid, but it rests solely on the fact that
the possession of the stolen goods is recent in relation to the theft thereof.
The guilty knowledge is then presumed.

[Page 188]

The fact that there are no authorities in
England indicating that the presumption arising from recent possession would
apply to what is a case of retaining under the Canadian law, is of no
significance in the present discussion but is only consistent with the other
fact that the offence of retaining as we have it under the Code, is not
known in England.

That the complete doctrine of recent possession
has been applied in Canada on a charge of retaining, is clearly evidenced by
the following decisions: The Supreme Court of Canada in Lopatinsky[43]; The Ontario Court of Appeal in Rex v.
Tuck[44]; The
British Columbia Court of Appeal in The King v. Lum Man Bow[45]. And in no reported cases, anywhere in
Canada, was it said that the presumption is inapplicable on a charge of
retaining.

In the present case, it is granted that the
possession by the appellant of the stolen guns was recent in relation to the
theft thereof. Thus, this sole fact, conditioning the play of the presumption,
being established, the appellant is therefore presumed to have come by these
guns dishonestly. This is a rule of evidence and not of substantive law.

Further, there is nothing in the evidence
indicating that this original guilty knowledge was subsequently changed to
become honest during the period of time covered by the count of retaining, in
the charge sheet.

The accused was jointly tried on four counts,
the third being for receiving and the fourth for retaining. At no time did he
ask for a separate trial on each or any of these counts. And, in the evidence
common to all counts and admissible in each, appears an explanation, not only
as to how the appellant gained possession of the stolen guns but how he dealt
with each of them thereafter. This explanation was not accepted by the trial judge,
and was qualified as “preposterous” by all the members of the Court of Appeal.
In the views of both Courts, the presumption that the accused came by these
guns dishonestly had not been rebutted. It was open, therefore, to the trial
judge to decide, as he did, that the guilty knowledge existing at the time the
appellant gained possession of these guns continued while he retained them, for
there was no evidence

[Page 189]

of any subsequent fact affecting the dishonest
character of the original possession. On the contrary, the facts subsequent to
the time the accused gained possession of the guns, added to the presumption,
resulting from the recent possession, that he came by them dishonestly, were
only capable of strengthening this guilty knowledge during the time of
retention. Thus, (a) the appellant sold one of the two guns which the
alleged unknown hunters were supposed to claim back, (b) the sale was
made at a ridiculous price left, besides, to the discretion of a neighbour to
whom the gun was entrusted; (c) these alleged hunters unknown to the
appellant were never heard of though two months had elapsed when the seizure of
the last gun took place.

It is true that the learned trial judge
acquitted the appellant on the charge of receiving—one is not bound to convict
on the strength of the presumption alone, the rule is “may” but not “must” find
guilt,—and found him guilty on the charge of retaining. This leads the
appellant to argue that, there being no other evidence as to the guilty
knowledge but the presumption arising from recent possession, the acquittal on
receiving was evidence that the trial judge accepted the explanation of the
defence as to recent possession.

No doubt that, having been acquitted of
receiving, the appellant could, on a fresh indictment for the same offence,
plead autrefois acquit. But to say that, on the basis of this acquittal
on receiving, one must conclude that on the consideration of the charge of
retaining, the trial judge accepted the explanation of the appellant when, in
too concise oral reasons for judgment but yet in unmistakable terms, he
effectively said he did not, does not follow. It may be that, had the verdict
been given by a jury or had the trial judge given no reasons, the appellant
could have invoked the decision rendered in the Quinn case[46], a decision resting on what is still a
conflicting view of the law in Canada. See Rex v. Bayn[47]; L. v. The King[48]. But again, and in the present instance,
the trial judge plainly said he did not accept the explanation. The presumption
was not rebutted and it was open to the trial judge to decide as he did.

[Page 190]

In support of the appellant’s contention on this
last point, the case of Leonard Edward Ernest Christ[49], was quoted. In my view, this case is not
only distinguishable from the present one, but is rather conclusive against the
theory advanced on behalf of the appellant. The ratio decidendi in that
appeal is to be found behind the verdict. It rests on a consideration of the
evidence made in the light of the summing up. It is expressed in these terms by
Devlin J.: “It is impossible to believe that the jury could have accepted the
evidence of the police, upon which alone they would be justified in convicting
him of receiving, and that at the same time rejected it, or not accepted it, in
the case of larceny.” In that case, there was no alternative. The police could
not, at the same time, be believed and disbelieved.

On the contrary, there is an alternative open to
a judge or a jury when the presumption of guilt, arising from recent
possession, is actually found to be unrebutted. Upon such unrebutted
presumption, there may, or may not, be a verdict of guilty. Again, the doctrine
is not that the judge “must” but that he “may” convict upon it. The essential
point in the present appeal is that there is no place for speculation as to
what the finding of fact of the trial judge was in this respect for he clearly
stated he did not accept the explanation. This was a finding of fact and even
if it may be stated that his conclusion or the verdict he rendered on the
charge of receiving, did not follow from this finding of fact, this can hardly
supply a valid reason to adopt, on the consideration of the charge of
retaining, a conclusion which, again, would not follow from this particular
finding of fact further supplemented with evidence of circumstances subsequent
to the time of reception of the guns.

Furthermore, even on the basis of the
proposition propounded on behalf of the appellant,—a proposition which, with
deference, I do not accept—that in a case of retaining, the guilty knowledge
must be exclusively subsequent to receiving, the oral judgment of the trial
judge fully justifies the conclusion that on his view of the evidence, there
was no doubt that the appellant had the guilty knowledge during the period of
retention of the guns, even if he did not have it at the time he received them.

[Page 191]

While each case must be determined according to
its own factual and legal features, in the circumstances of the instant case I
agree with the conclusion reached in the unanimous judgment of the Ontario
Court of Appeal that the conviction on the count of retaining should stand.

The appeal, consequently, should be dismissed.

The judgment of Rand, Kellock, Locke and
Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:

KELLOCK J.:—The appellant was charged in the
County Court Judge’s Criminal Court with (a) breaking and entering by
day the dwelling house of one Grayson D. Burruss and the theft therefrom of
certain guns and other articles, (b) breaking and entering by night
the said dwelling house with intent to commit theft therein, (c)
receiving a shotgun and rifle, property of the said Burruss, knowing the same
to have been stolen, and (d) retaining in his possession the said
shotgun and rifle, knowing the same to have been stolen.

He was acquitted on the first three charges but
was convicted on the charge of retaining, his appeal with respect to this
charge being dismissed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The appellant now
appeals to this court, by leave, upon the following questions of law:

(a) The doctrine of recent
possession does not apply to a charge of retaining stolen goods.

(b) The learned trial judge, having
acquitted the accused on a charge of receiving, could not, in the circumstances
of the case, convict him on a charge of retaining.

(c) An accused person cannot be
convicted on both the offences of receiving and retaining.

The charge of receiving of which he was
acquitted was as follows:

That the said John Clay, at the Township of
North York and elsewhere within the County of York, in the months of January
and February in the year 1950, received in his possession a Remington repeating
shotgun and a Remington repeating rifle, the property of Grayson D. Burruss,
and therefore stolen, knowing the same to have been so stolen, contrary to the
Criminal Code.

[Page 192]

The charge which is the subject matter of this
appeal is

And further, that the said John Clay, at
the Township of North York and elsewhere within the County of York, in the
months of January and February in the year 1950, retained in his possession a
Remington repeating shotgun and a Remington repeating rifle, the property of
Grayson D. Burruss, and theretofore stolen, knowing the same to have been
stolen, contrary to the Criminal Code.

This last mentioned offence was for the first
time made an offence in Canada under that name in 1892 when the Criminal
Code was first enacted by 55-56 Vict. c. 29, s. 314 (now s. 399). The
words, “or retains in his possession,” were not in the bill as originally
drafted, but were apparently added between second and third readings. The same
words were also placed in s. 315 (now s. 400) and in the early part of s. 316
(now 401), but were omitted, perhaps by oversight, in the latter part of that
section.

As to the offence of receiving stolen property
with knowledge that it had been stolen, it was said by Avory J. in Rex v.
Norris[50], that
the offence of “receiving” is one of the most simple in the criminal law. “The
essence of the charge is that the defendant should be proved to have known at
the time” that the property had been stolen. The learned judge also
said that, “Generally, it is enough to say that it is not a crime merely to be
in possession of stolen property.” So much is this so, even with knowledge of
their stolen character, that in R. v. Tennet[51], the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed a
conviction on the charge of receiving because the trial judge, in the course of
his summing up to the jury, had said that the Crown had to prove that the
accused knew the goods were stolen at the time he received them “or had them in
his possession.”

Knowledge, then, at the time the accused person
comes into possession of the goods is the essence of the charge of receiving,
and if the element of knowledge at that time be lacking, it will not do, in
order to support a charge of receiving, to show that the goods were kept after
guilty

[Page 193]

knowledge subsequently acquired; R. v. Johnson[52]. In fact, even though at the very time of
receipt the accused person knows that the goods are stolen, but then intends to
turn them over to the police, although he subsequently changes his mind, the
offence of “receiving” is not made out; R. v. Matthews[53].

As s. 402 provides, the act of receiving is
complete as soon as the offender has possession or control over the goods, or
aids in concealing or disposing of them. Merely because, however, the goods may
remain in the possession of the offender, does not render the offence any the
less that of receiving, the essence of the offence being, as already pointed
out, not length of possession but knowledge of the stolen character of the
goods at the time possession is acquired. It is of interest to observe in this
connection that the old form of indictment against a receiver, as set out in
Taschereau’s Criminal Acts (1888) p. 444, was

“that A.B.,… did receive and have…”

When, therefore, Parliament added the words,
“retains in his possession” anything obtained by any offence punishable on
indictment “knowing such thing to have been so obtained,” it could hardly have
intended to have constituted a new and additional offence to be made out by
mere continuance of possession for some “measurable interval of time” (to use
the language of Roach J.A. in the court below) after receipt, as this ground
was already covered by the offence of “receiving.” Parliament must have
intended to create an offence distinct from that of receiving, and as the
latter includes all cases in which guilty knowledge was acquired at the time of
the receipt of the goods, the offence of “retaining” can only arise where that
element is lacking but where knowledge of their stolen character is
subsequently acquired and the goods are kept thereafter. It has been so held in
R. v. Yeaman[54], a
decision of the

[Page 194]

British Columbia Court of Appeal; R. v. Searle[55], a decision of the Appellate Division of
the Supreme Court of Alberta; Frozocas v. The King[56], and Ecrement v. The King[57], both decisions of the Court of King’s
Bench, Appeal Side, of the Province of Quebec. I think the offence of retaining
is correctly described in R. v. Searle by Harvey C.J.A. at p.
128:

Section 399 makes one “who receives or
retains” guilty of an offence. One may receive stolen goods not knowing them to
be stolen and subsequently learning that they were stolen may retain them and
thereby become guilty of “retaining” though he could not be found guilty of
“receiving”.

These two different offences are very clearly
described by Walsh J. in the Frozocas case at p. 331, as follows:

It is true that an accused may be guilty of
receiving goods stolen; he may also innocently receive the stolen goods, and
become guilty of retaining them later, when he will have acquired knowledge of
their unlawful source. Section 399, Cr. Code, was amended to cover the
latter offence.

In the case with which the court was there
concerned, it was contended that the conviction of the appellant was illegal
because it condemned him for having committed two distinct offences; first, for
having received the goods knowing them to have been stolen, and second, for having
retained them with the same knowledge. Notwithstanding the form of the
information and conviction, the evidence in the case was all directed to
establishing guilty knowledge at the time of the actual receipt of the goods.
With respect to the objection to the conviction, Walsh J. had this to say:

Though s. 399 speaks of receiving and
retaining, and though these may indicate at times separate offences, yet
there are also times, and the present case is to the point, when retaining is a
continuation of the act of receiving. In this instance, to have said that the
accused retained the goods in question was only surplusage.

[Page 195]

Howard J. put the point another way at p. 327,
referring to the judgment of Harvey C.J.A. in Searle’s case:

I concur in the opinion expressed by the
learned Chief Justice that s. 399 deals with two offences in a case such as he
describes, but I have serious doubt that, where an accused has received goods
which he knew at the time were stolen and retained them, an indictment to that
effect can be said to contain two distinct counts. I am rather disposed to the
opinion that in such circumstances, there is but one offence charged—that the
acts of receiving and retaining constitute “in substance one transaction,
one continuous set of transactions:” Weinbaum v. The King 53 Que.
KB. 270.

Letourneau J. at p. 329 dealt with the matter as
follows:

The appellant is right in alleging
irregularity in the indictment for having received, concealed and kept
stolen goods (Rex v. Searle, 51 Can. C.C. 128) in fine when s.
399 of the Cr. Code says, “who receives or retains in his possession…”
but then again it must be said that if we come to the conclusion that a crime
of having “received… knowing” etc., was committed, this plea in regard to a
defect in the form of the complaint, is without any bearing.

Tellier C.J. and Dorion J. concurred.

It is plain, therefore, that the difference
between these two offences is that, in the case of the offence of retaining,
there is an interval of time, however short, between the actual receipt of the
goods and receipt of knowledge of their stolen character, during which interval
the possession is either an honest possession or the character of this interval
is not in question. The answer to the third question of law raised on the
appeal is, therefore, that an accused person cannot be convicted of both the
offence of receiving and that of retaining the same goods. They are distinct
offences and mutually exclusive. No one would suggest, I think, that the thief
may be convicted of retaining merely because he keeps possession. I think a
similar contention as to the receiver is equally unsound.

With respect to the presumption arising from
possession of recently stolen goods, Pollock C.B., in his charge to the jury in
Regina v. Exall[58], put
the matter this way:

Property recently stolen, found in the
possession of a person, is always presumptive evidence against that person,
unless the possession can be accounted for and explained consistently with
innocence.

The question which arises is as to the offences
with respect to the commission of which, such possession is evidence,

[Page 196]

and that is answered by the learned Chief Baron
in the passage immediately following that above quoted, namely,

The principle is this, that if a person is
found in possession of property recently stolen, and of which he can give no
reasonable account, a jury are justified in coming to the conclusion that
he committed the robbery.

And so it is of any crime to which the
robbery was incident, or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson or
murder. For, if the possession be evidence that the person committed the
robbery, and the person who committed the robbery committed the other crime,
then it is evidence that the person in whose possession the property is
found committed that other crime.

Examples of the application of the presumption
in connection with the crimes mentioned are referred to in Taylor on Evidence,
12th Edition, p. 135, and Archbold, 32nd Edition, p, 404.

The offence of receiving is, of course,
“incident to” or “connected with” robbery, burglary or theft, as may be also
arson and murder, but that is not true of the offence of retaining stolen
goods, as the latter is separated from knowledge of the character of the goods
by reason of the interval of time already referred to. There is a complete
break between the commission of these other offences and that of retaining,
while in the case of receiving it is directly connected by reason of the guilty
knowledge existing from the moment when the possession of the accused
commences. In other words, recent possession implies association with the thief
in the particular case. Any such connection in respect of a charge of retaining
is, however, excluded by the elements of that offence.

The close connection between the offences of
theft and receiving is indicated in East’s Pleas of the Crown, Vol. 2, p. 744,
in the author’s discussion of earlier legislative attempts to deal with these
offences, where he says that the receiver was generally the employer and patron
of the thief. In fact, 29 Geo. II c. 30, s. 1, recites that “buyers or
receivers are the principal cause of the commission of such theft.” It may be
that this fact entered into the reason for the rule under discussion.

In Regina v. Langmead, which is
best reported in 1 Le. & Ca. 427, the defendant was indicted on two counts,
one for theft and the other for receiving, knowing the goods to

[Page 197]

have been stolen. Blackburn J. at 437 stated the
presumption which arises from the fact of possession, as follows:

I should have said that recent possession
was evidence either of stealing or receiving, according to circumstances, and
that, as soon as it was proved that the person in whose possession they were
found did not steal them, his possession, if unaccounted for, was evidence that
he had received them knowing them to be stolen.

While, as already stated, the offence of
retaining stolen goods does not exist in England, the following from the same
learned judge in the above case is pertinent with respect to the
inapplicability of the presumption to an offence such as retaining. Blackburn
J. said at p. 438:

If you start with the datum that the
prisoner was in possession of the sheep, then, his possession being dishonest,
he must have been the receiver, if he was not the thief. As soon as it was
shown that the prisoner could not have been the thief, it followed that he was
the receiver.

This renders the point, in my opinion, very
clear. In the case of theft and receiving, the possession of an accused can
only be a dishonest possession, the only question to be answered so far as
guilt is concerned being whether the accused actually stole the goods himself
or received them from another person knowing them to be stolen. But if the
character of the original receipt of the goods by the accused is not in
question, but he is charged only with having subsequently acquired guilty
knowledge, there is no room for the operation of the presumption with which the
court in Langmead’s case was concerned, and the Crown must establish
affirmatively that such knowledge was in fact acquired. Just as the offence of
retaining is itself the creation of statute, a statute would also be required
to raise a presumption of guilty knowledge acquired after a receipt the character
of which is not in question.

While, as already mentioned, there is no offence
in England of retaining stolen goods generally, there has been for a great many
years the offence of having possession of military or naval stores marked with
His Majesty’s mark. The statute 9-10 Wm. III c. 41 recites by s. 1 that it
rarely happens that direct proof can be made that such goods have been stolen,
but only that goods so marked were found in the possession of the accused.
Section 2 goes on to provide that “such person or persons in whose
custody, possession or keeping such goods or stores, marked as aforesaid” are
found, should be liable to conviction.

[Page 198]

In Regina v. Cohen[59], the defendant was charged on indictment
under s. 2 with unlawfully having in his possession certain naval stores marked
with the broad arrow. It was held that it was necessary for the Crown to show,
not only that the defendant was possessed of the articles, but also that he
knew they were marked. Watson B. said at p. 42:

I am of opinion that it is necessary, in
order to convict a person under this statute of having naval stores marked with
the broad arrow in his possession, to show not only that he had them in his
possession, but that he also knew the nature of the articles, and that they
were marked with the broad arrow. The statute is no doubt couched in very
general terms; it does not state in so many words that he must have them in his
possession “knowingly,” but that must be the true meaning of the statute.

Hill J. said at p. 43 that

no offence is committed under the second
section unless it is shown that the individual in whose possession or
custody the goods were knew that they were marked with the broad arrow.

A similar case under the same statute arose in Regina
v. Sleep[60], in
which the decision in Cohen’s case was specifically approved. In Sleep’s
case, the Crown contended that upon the true construction of the statute a prima
facie case was made out by showing that the stores were found in the
prisoner’s possession, and that the onus was then cast upon him of “showing
that his possession is innocent.” This contention was negatived, it being held
that it was for the Crown to show that the defendant knew that the goods were
marked goods. Notwithstanding that the statute said nothing about knowingly,
the well settled principle of the criminal law that the defendant must have a
guilty mind, rendered it necessary that the principle should be imported into
the statute. The principle of this decision is embodied in s. 434 of the
Code.

In a case such as the present, namely, retaining
possession of goods recently stolen, the Crown must prove (a) that the
goods were recently stolen, (b) that they were found in the possession
of the accused, and (c) that after the accused acquired possession he learned
of their stolen character. Just as, in a case arising under 9-10 Wm. III, there
is no onus upon the accused to explain anything until the Crown has established
not only possession of the marked goods but that the accused knew they were so
marked,

[Page 199]

equally in the case of an offence of retaining
stolen goods, the Crown must establish not only possession in the accused but
knowledge subsequently acquired of their stolen character. As Roach J.A.
himself says in the court below, there is no presumption establishing such
knowledge.

If it be said that the presumption here under
discussion is applicable to a charge of retaining stolen property knowing it
was stolen, and that the person accused of that offence must go into the
witness box and explain how it was “come by,” it seems to me that those who so
say are also saying something else, namely, that in every charge of retaining
there is included a count of receiving, with respect to which the accused must
clear himself before the Crown will be called upon to do anything in the way of
establishing that after the receipt of the goods the accused learned of their
stolen character. From this it follows that if the explanation of the accused
as to how he “came by” the goods is not accepted, he will be convicted, and, as
the charge is that of retaining, the conviction will also be called retaining,
although in reality, it will be for receiving. Such a procedure merely confuses
the two charges which by definition are separate and distinct. If this view were
permissible, it is difficult to see why the Crown would lay a charge of
receiving in any case.

As the Quebec Court of Appeal pointed out in the
case of Frozocas, a charge of receiving has nothing added to it by words
alleging that the accused retained the goods. On the other hand, if a charge of
retaining were drawn expressly so as to include a charge of receiving, it would
be bad for multiplicity. I come back to the point that on a charge of retaining
as distinct from receiving, the state of mind of an accused person when he
received possession of the goods is not in issue. In Rex v. Bond[61], Kennedy J. said at p. 397:

It may be laid down as a general rule in
criminal as in civil cases that the evidence must be confined to the point in
issue: Roscoe’s Digest of the Law of Evidence in Criminal Cases, 12th Ed.
(1898) pp. 78, 79. When a prisoner is charged with an offence it is of the
utmost importance to him that the facts laid before the jury should consist
exclusively of the transaction which forms the subject of the indictment which
alone he can be expected to come prepared to answer. It is therefore a
general rule that the facts proved must be strictly relevant to the particular
charge and have no reference to any conduct of the prisoner unconnected

[Page 200]

with such charge; therefore, it is not
allowable to shew on the trial of an indictment that the prisoner has a generel
disposition to commit the same kind of offence as that for which he stands
indicted.

It is said that the decision of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia in The King v. Lum Man Bow[62], was decided in a contrary sense. It is
true that the charge in that case was that the accused did “unlawfully retain
stolen property in their possession” knowing the same to have been stolen, but
when the report is examined, it is plain that the case was treated as one of
receiving and that the distinction between the two offences was not in the mind
of any of the members of the court. The goods there in question which were
stolen on the night of December 3-4, were found, on the afternoon of the 4th,
in the possession of the accused who failed, in the language of the stated
case, “to give a satisfactory account of how they came by the property.”

Macdonald C.J.A., with whom Galliher J.
concurred, referred, in the course of his judgment, to the argument on behalf
of the accused that the only presumption which arose on the facts stated was a
presumption that the accused had stolen the property, which excluded the
presumption that they had retained it knowing it to be stolen. The learned
Chief Justice negatived the contention, stating that in his opinion, the
question was fully covered by the decision in Langmead’s case where, he
said, “precisely the same question arose and where the judges were unanimously
of the opinion that whenever circumstances are such as to render it likely that
the accused did not steal the property, the presumption is that he received it.”
The learned Chief Justice went on to say that in the case he was discussing,
the charge was for retaining, not receiving, and that he thought the principle,
so far as the presumption was concerned, was the same. He said that he adopted
the contention of the Crown that the extension of the Code to the offence of
retaining “was, I think, intended, as Mr. Maclean argued, to remedy a
defect in the law which failed to reach persons who were indicted for the
offence of receiving, but who afterwards were proven to be the thieves. The
same person could not be the thief and the receiver, but under the present section he
may be convicted notwithstanding that it should turn out on the trial that he had
actually

[Page 201]

stolen the
goods.” It is quite evident from this what the idea of the offence of retaining
was in the mind of the learned Chief Justice, and that it was not the offence
which, in my view was created by the provisions of s. 399. The learned Chief
Justice was making two offences out of theft merely from the fact that the
person taking the goods did not immediately pass them on. This is the same contention
applied to “receiving” with which I have already dealt.

It is also quite plain from the judgments of
both Irving and Martin JJ.A. that they treated the case with which they were
dealing as one of receiving. The latter expressly says that he had no doubt
that the conviction of the accused “as receivers” was justified.

This case cannot, therefore, be said to be
authority for the proposition contended for by the Crown in the case at bar.

On behalf of the Crown, we were referred to the
decision of this Court in Richler v. The King[63]. A reference to that case shows that the
conviction there was for “receiving or retaining,” and there is no discussion
in the judgment of retaining as a separate offence. The point here in question
was not raised. The Crown also referred us to Lopatinsky v. The King[64], where the conviction was for retaining.
Again, however, the distinction between the two offences was not raised, and
the evidence in the case was directed entirely to establishing guilty knowledge
at the time the goods were received. While the charge there under discussion
was one of retaining, the offence actually proved was receiving, and no point
was made in the case of any distinction between the two offences. The same is
to be said of Rex v. Pomeroy[65].
The appeal to this court was dismissed, but is unreported. I think, therefore,
that this court is not hampered by anything said in any of the decisions cited,
and that the answer to the first question of law with respect to which leave to
appeal was granted should be that the doctrine does not apply. This brings me
to the second question.

In Regina v. Sleep, ubi cit., appeal
was from a conviction under 9-10 Wm. III c. 41, s. 2, for having been found in
possession of naval stores marked with the broad arrow. The jury, in answer to
questions, found (a) that the goods

[Page 202]

were so marked, (b) that the prisoner had
reasonable means of knowing they were so marked, but (c) that there was
not sufficient evidence he did know. The conviction was set aside,
notwithstanding that in the opinion of the court on appeal, there was abundant
evidence of guilty knowledge, and that the jury ought to have so found.

In the case at bar, the appellant has been
acquitted on the charge of receiving. In my opinion, he ought to have been convicted
on that charge, but there is no appeal as to it, and that being so, there is no
longer any question as to the state of mind of the appellant when he obtained
possession of the guns here in question. It was for the Crown, therefore, to
establish that subsequently, guilty knowledge as to the character of the goods
was acquired by the appellant. In my opinion, the respondent failed to do so.
It was contended that the fact that the name of the owner was on the case in
which one of the guns was contained, was sufficient. Even if this could be said
to be sufficient evidence, which I doubt, it is not to be assumed that this
fact came to the attention of the accused at all, or did not come to his
attention at the time he obtained possession originally. While the learned
trial judge was entitled to give consideration to all the evidence when dealing
with the charge of retaining, there was, in my opinion, no evidence or no
sufficient evidence upon which a conviction on that charge could be supported.
I would therefore allow the appeal and set aside the conviction.

ESTEY J.:—The appellant was tried before a
judge, sitting without a jury, upon an indictment containing four counts:
first, breaking and entering by day and stealing; second, breaking and entering
by night with intent to steal; third, that he did receive a shot gun and a
rifle, knowing they were stolen; and fourth, that he did retain in his
possession the shot gun and rifle, knowing the same to have been stolen. He was
found not guilty under counts one, two and three, but guilty under count four
of retaining the shot gun and rifle. This conviction was affirmed by the
Appellate Court of Ontario.

The evidence established the theft of the shot
gun and rifle and that they were found in the recent possession of the
appellant. The appellant did not give evidence, but his wife was called as a
witness on his behalf and gave an

[Page 203]

explanation as to how the shot gun and rifle had
come into the possession of her husband. At the conclusion of the trial the learned
trial judge stated, in part:

I do not think that the explanation offered
by the defence, in this matter, is a reasonable explanation and am therefore
finding the accused guilty on the evidence, guilty of retaining, and that is
guilty on count four.

Counsel for the accused contends that the
presumption arising out of recent possession does not apply to a charge of
retaining. S. 399 of the Criminal Code, under which counts three and
four were laid, reads as follows:

Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to fourteen years’ imprisonment, who receives or retains in
his possession anything obtained by any offence punishable on indictment, or by
any acts wheresoever committed, which, if committed in Canada would have
constituted an offence punishable upon indictment, knowing such thing to have
been so obtained.

The offence of retaining was not known to the
common law, nor is it included in any of the British statutory offences. In
Canada it was first made an offence by the insertion of the words “or retains”
in the section of our Code of 1892 (S. of C. 1892, c. 29, s. 214). The
language “receives or retains” in s. 214 (now 399) would indicate an intention
on the part of Parliament to treat these offences as separate and distinct.
Such an intention is emphasized by the provision in s. 402 in which it is
provided that the act of receiving is completed as soon as the person has
possession or control over the property. This section has been so
construed in Canada. Rex v. Yeaman[66]; Rex v. Searle[67]; Frozocas v. The King[68]; Ecrement v. The King[69].

The issue here raised was decided adversely to
the contention of counsel for the appellant by the Court of Appeal of British
Columbia in The King v. Lum Man Bow[70]. The Court of Appeal of Ontario, in
affirming the conviction of the appellant, expressly concurred in the view
expressed in The King v. Lum Man Bow. The British Columbia Court
of Appeal based its conclusions largely upon the decision in Reg. v. Langmead[71]. In the Langmead case the accused
was charged with both stealing and

[Page 204]

receiving and his counsel submitted that, as the
evidence proved no more than recent possession by the prisoner, the jury should
have been directed that they could not lawfully find the prisoner guilty of
receiving. This contention was rejected. Pollock, C.B. stated:

* * * the distinction taken by Mr. Carter
between a charge of stealing and one of receiving, with reference to the
effect of evidence of recent possession, is not the law of England. If
no other person is involved in the transaction forming the subject of the
inquiry, and the whole of the case against the prisoner is that he was found in
the possession of the stolen property, the evidence would, no doubt, point to a
case of stealing rather than a case of receiving; but in every case, except,
indeed, where the possession is so recent that it is impossible for any one
else to have committed the theft, it becomes a mere question for the jury
whether the person found in possession of the stolen property stole it himself or
received it from some one else. If, as I have said, there is no other evidence,
the jury will probably consider with reason that the prisoner stole the
property; but, if there is other evidence which is consistent either with his
having stolen the property, or with his having received it from some one else,
it will be for the jury to say which appears to them to be the more probable
solution.

Blackburn, J. stated:

I do not agree with Mr. Carter in
thinking that recent possession is not as vehement evidence of receiving as of
stealing. When it has been shewn that property has been stolen, and has been
found recently after its loss in the possession of the prisoner, he is called
upon to account for having it, and, on his failing to do so, the jury may well infer
that his possession was dishonest, and that he was either the thief or the
receiver according to the circumstances.

In Great Britain where, as already stated, there
is no offence of retaining, the courts have held that recent possession of
stolen property raises a prima facie case or a presumption to the effect
that the accused knew the goods were stolen when he received them. The further
question of whether recent possession should raise a presumption to the same
effect when the offence charged is retaining has, in Great Britain, never been
considered. It would appear, therefore, that in Canada, where the offence of
retaining is contained in the Criminal Code, the answer to the question
must be found in an examination of the nature and character of the presumption
as well as the offence of retaining, and the purpose and object Parliament had
in enacting the same, with a view to ascertaining whether the presumption
should be applied to the offence of retaining as well as to that of receiving,
just as in Reg. v. Langmead it was held that the presumption
applied to receiving as well as to theft.

[Page 205]

In Reg. v. Exall[72], the charge was burglary. Pollock, C.B.
stated to the jury:

The principle is this, that if a person is
found in possession of property recently stolen, and of which he can give no
reasonable account, a jury are justified in coming to the conclusion that
he committed the robbery. And so it is of any crime to which the robbery was
incident, or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson or murder. For, if
the possession be evidence that the person committed the robbery, and the
person who committed the robbery committed the other crime, then it is evidence
that the person in whose possession the property is found committed that other crime.

The law is, that if, recently after the
commission of the crime, a person is found in possession of the stolen goods,
that person is called up to account for the possession, that is, to give
an explanation of it, which is not unreasonable or improbable.

Wills on Circumstantial Evidence, 7th Ed., pp.
93 and 94:

Since the desire of dishonest gain is the
impelling motive to theft and robbery, it naturally follows that the possession
of the fruits of crime recently after it has been committed, affords a strong
and reasonable ground for the presumption that the party in whose possession
they are found was the real offender unless he can account for such possession
in some way consistent with his innocence * * * The force
of this presumption has been recognized from the earliest times; and it is
founded on the obvious consideration, that if such possession had been lawfully
acquired, the party would be able, at least shortly after its acquisition, to
give an account of the manner in which it was obtained; and his unwillingness
or inability to afford such explanation is justly regarded as amounting to
strong self-condemnatory evidence.

Roscoe’s Criminal Evidence, 15th Ed., p. 22:

It has already been stated that possession
is presumptive evidence of property; but where it is proved, or may be
reasonably presumed, from the proved circumstances, that the property in
question is stolen, the onus probandi is shifted, and the possessor, to
rebut an accusation, is bound to explain reasonably that he came by it
honestly; and if he fail to do so, the presumption is that he is the thief or
the receiver, according to the circumstances.

The foregoing quotations indicate that the
presumption of recent possession has no statutory origin, but has developed in
the common law on the basis that reason and experience may justify a conclusion
of guilt where the recent possession of stolen property remains unexplained.
The nature and purpose of such a presumption is emphasized by Thayer,
Preliminary Treatise on Evidence, p. 314:

Presumptions are aids to reasoning and
argumentation, which assume the truth of certain matters for the purpose of
some given inquiry. They may be grounded on general experience, or probability
of any kind; or merely on policy and convenience.

This presumption of recent possession is applied
where a party has been found in possession of stolen property so recently in
relation to the time of the theft thereof that reason and experience lead to
the conclusion that he may either be a party to the theft or has possession of
the property with knowledge of its theft. It is of the utmost importance to
keep in mind that the Crown must first prove that the property has been stolen
and then that it was found in possession of the accused. It is not, however,
the mere possession, but rather the recent possession in relation to the time
of the theft, that raises the presumption and which presumption is rebutted by
a reasonable explanation of honest possession. If the possession of stolen
property is not found to be recent, the presumption does not arise, no matter
what the offence charged may be.

This presumption of fact has not been restricted
in its application to theft and receiving. In Regina v. Exall[73], it was extended to burglary and, as
Pollock, C.B. stated, it applies to “any crime to which the robbery was
incident, or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson or murder.” In
Taylor on Evidence it is pointed out that “The presumption… applies to all
crimes, even the most penal,” and reference is there made to cases of arson,
burglary and murder. Taylor on Evidence, 12th Ed., 135, para. 142. See also
Archibald’s Cr. Pl. Evid. & Pr., 32nd Ed., 404.

It would appear, having regard to the language
of Pollock, C.B. in the Exall case supra, that the offence of
retaining, in relation to this presumption, is as “incident” to, or as
immediately “connected” with the theft as receiving. The issues at a trial of
theft and receiving are quite different. The Queen v. Lamoureux[74]; R. v. Lincoln[75]. A thief cannot receive from himself… R. v.
Langmead supra; R. v. Exall supra. R. v. Carmichael,[76]; R. v. Brown[77]. The offence of receiving contemplates a
person receiving the property after the theft has been completed. Retaining is
in exactly the same position except that the retention contemplates an innocent
receiving, then subsequently, in any appreciable time, however short, the

[Page 207]

acquisition of knowledge that the property was
stolen, and thereafter a retention of same. When the importance of recent
possession in relation to the time of the theft is kept in mind, retaining is
as “incident” to, or as “connected” with the theft as receiving.

It has been emphasized that at common law it was
only the initial possession to which the presumption was applied, not, however,
because of the nature and character of the presumption, but because in the
offence of receiving it was only the knowledge at the moment of the initial
receipt that was in issue. Upon a charge of receiving an accused might have any
amount of subsequent knowledge that the goods were stolen, but, if he received
them innocently, at common law he was not guilty of that or of any other
offence. This was because of the definition of the offence of receiving and not
the nature and character of the presumption, under which an accused found in
recent possession of stolen property might be found guilty in the absence of
any reasonable explanation on his part. In other words, the presumption was
raised against an accused charged with receiving, whether he received the
property with knowledge that it had been stolen, or whether he acquired that
knowledge subsequently to receiving it and then continued to retain the goods,
or, indeed, whether he received and at all times held the property innocently.
He could at common law, however, be found guilty only if he acquired the
possession with guilty knowledge.

The offence under s. 399, without the words “or
retaining,” is the common law offence of receiving stolen property. One who was
charged with receiving at common law and whose evidence was accepted that he
had received the stolen goods innocently, but that subsequently, in no matter
how short a time, he acquired knowledge that the property was stolen and still
retained it, was not guilty of receiving. Re Richard Johnson[78]; Rex v. Tennet[79]; Rex v. Matthews[80]. The Parliament of Canada concluded that
one who retained stolen property, knowing it to have been stolen, committed an
offence against society as great as that of the receiver and in 1892, while the
bill was passing through Parliament, inserted the words “or retaining” after
the word “receiving” in s. 214 (now 399)

[Page 208]

and placed that offence on the same basis and
provided the same punishment therefor as that of one who received the goods
knowing they were stolen. It would seem that Parliament, by such an enactment,
would intend that the same rules of evidence and presumption should apply to
both offences.

As already stated, the British Columbia Court of
Appeal, in 1910, decided that the presumption of recent possession applied
where the indictment charged that the accused retained stolen property knowing
the property was stolen. The King v. Lum Man Bow supra. While
apparently the question has never been raised in a subsequent case with the
clarity here presented by Mr. Dubin, it appears that in all of the
reported cases subsequent thereto it has been more or less assumed that the
presumption did apply to both receiving and retaining. Rex v. Mandzuk[81]; Rex v. Davis[82]; Rex v. Parker[83]; Rex v. Sullivan and Godbolt[84]; Rex v. Tuck[85]; Rex v. Richler[86]; Rex v. Lopatinsky[87]. It would appear that if Parliament had
not intended that this well known presumption, so long established in our law,
should apply to retaining as well as to receiving that it would, at some date
since 1910, have amended the section by the addition of apt words to that
effect.

Receiving and retaining, as already stated, just
as theft and receiving, are separate and distinct offences and an accused, even
when the evidence of guilty knowledge is found only in the presumption, can
only be found guilty of either theft or receiving, but not both. Upon the same
basis an accused cannot be found guilty of receiving and retaining. The Criminal
Code contemplates that upon the same facts an accused shall be convicted
and suffer but one punishment. If an accused party receives the guilty
knowledge coincident with possession of the stolen property, he is guilty of
the offence of receiving and not of retaining. If, however, he receives the
property and subsequently acquires knowledge that the property was stolen, and
thereafter continues to retain same, he is guilty of the offence of retaining.
The presumption of recent possession

[Page 209]

applies to all three of these offences and if
counts covering each one are included in the indictment it is for the jury, at
the conclusion of the hearing, to find the accused guilty of one or other, or
not guilty of all of these offences. Pollock, C.B., in Reg. v. Langmead
supra, expresses this view as to theft and receiving, and, following his
analogy, if the evidence of guilty knowledge adduced by the prosecution is
restricted to that arising out of the presumption of recent possession and no
further evidence is adduced, a jury would probably conclude that the accused
was guilty of receiving. If, however, there is other evidence, it will be for
the jury to say whether the accused be guilty of either receiving or retaining,
or not guilty of either.

While the offences of receiving and retaining
are separate and distinct, the essential difference is the time of the acquisition
of knowledge on the part of the accused. In all other essentials there is no
great difference. The existence of the motive for dishonest gain referred to in
Wills on Circumstantial Evidence supra as a basis for the presumption is
of no greater significance in relation to receiving than to retaining.

It would appear, therefore, that the submission
that the presumption applies to retaining as well as to receiving is justified
in principle. The language adopted by Parliament would seem to have contemplated
its application to the offence of retaining, and this view finds support in
that Parliament has not, since Lum Man Bow supra was decided in 1910,
enacted any amendment in respect of this section.

The explanation here given related to the
initial reception of the stolen property and was disbelieved by the learned
trial judge. With great respect, upon that finding the accused should have been
found guilty of receiving. There was no evidence that justified the conclusion
that he received the goods without knowledge of their having been stolen and
subsequently acquired such knowledge and thereafter continued to retain same.
Learned counsel for the Crown suggests that, because the accused sold the rifle
for $20, when the evidence disclosed that its replacement cost would be $68,
therefore there was an inference of subsequent knowledge, but this he may well
have done, because he knew it was stolen when he received it. Certainly there
is no fact here established to suggest he received it at any other time.

[Page 210]

He next drew attention to the fact that the
purchaser of the rifle found the owner’s name thereon, which aroused his
suspicion and caused him to communicate with the police. The evidence
establishes that the name was not at all conspicuous and was only found by the
purchaser when he was cleaning the rifle, nor is it suggested throughout the
evidence that the accused knew of the presence of that name. Counsel then
referred to the fact that the hunters never came back. The difficulty with
regard to the hunters is that the only evidence of their existence forms a part
of the explanation which the learned trial judge did not believe.

In my opinion, with great respect, the evidence
here adduced on the part of the Crown justified a conviction for receiving,
upon which the learned trial judge acquitted and from which no appeal has been
taken and which is, therefore, not before this Court. The evidence does not
support a conviction of retaining, as that offence is constituted under s. 399.

The appeal should be allowed and the conviction
quashed.

Appeal allowed and conviction set
aside.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL
OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.

Criminal Code—s. 286—Theft—Grand Juries—Sufficient
Evidence for true bill.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Criminal Appeal of Prince Edward Island ([1]),
Campbell C.J. and Tweedy and McGuigan JJ., dismissing the accused's appeal from
his conviction and sentence following his trial before McGuigan J. and a jury on a charge of theft under s. 386 of the Criminal
Code. Following a preliminary inquiry a grand
jury returned a true bill on the indictment. Prior to the swearing of
the petit jury appellant's counsel moved to quash on the grounds that the grand
jury had examined only one witness and that from the evidence given by him at the preliminary hearing the Crown had failed to
establish the identity, ownership or unlawful conversion of the goods, essential elements of the offence charged.
In support of the motion Rex v.
Court ([2])
was cited and the judgment of Campbell C.J. therein that an indictment found by a grand jury on inadmissible or inadequate
material must be quashed. The motion
was refused and the trial proceeded
with. On the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and before this
Court the same ground was pressed, as well as misdirection and non-direction by
the trial judge.

D. L. Mathieson K.C. for the appellant. 

J. O. C. Campbell
K.C. for the
respondent.

At the close of
the appellant's argument the Court retired. On its return to the bench, Kerwin
J. speaking for the Court stated: It will not be
necessary to call on you, Mr. Camp-bell. On
the first point we express no opinion on the








[Page 123]

correctness of the decision in Rex v. Court.
It is sufficient to say there is nothing
in this case to show that the grand jury did not have before it
sufficient evidence to justify it bringing in
a true bill. On the other points we are all of opinion that while there were errors in the trial judge's charge
to the jury, those errors were immediately corrected upon them being called to the judge's attention by Counsel for the appellant. In the circumstances, it cannot
be said that the trial judge did not put before the jury the defence raised on behalf of the appellant.

The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

PAUL LEMAY APPELLANT; 

AND 

HIS MAJESTY THE KING RESPONDENT. 

PRESENT: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin,
Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Estey, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Criminal Law-Evidence-Sale of drugs-Denial
by accused-Proof of identification-Duty of Crown as to calling
witnesses-Whether notice of appeal must be signed by Attorney General-Power of
Court of Appeal to reverse acquittal and enter conviction-Opium and Narcotic
Drug Act, 1929, S. of C. 1929, c. 49-Criminal Code, es. 1013(4), 1014, 1023(2).

The appellant was
charged with having unlawfully sold a drug. The evidence for the prosecution
was that Bunyk, an officer of the R.C.M.P., saw the accused, who was already
known to him, sitting at a table in a restaurant. Bunyk, who was at the time
accompanied by an. informer, one Powell, could not say whether Powell saw the
accused or not. Bunyk entered the restaurant alone and sat down beside the
accused at whose table one Lowes was also sitting, and thereupon purchased the
drug from the accused. Neither Powell nor Lowes was called as a witness. The
accused denied that he was the man from whom the purchase was made and
testified that he was not present, he also denied any knowledge of any person
named Lowes. The proceedings were by way of speedy trial, and the trial judge,
although stating that he disbelieved the accused, acquitted him because of the
failure of the prosecution to call Lowes or account for his absence. The appeal
taken by the Crown was allowed and a conviction entered.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed (Cartwright J., dissenting in part, would have
ordered a new trial).

Held, that
counsel acting for the prosecution has full discretion as to what witnesses
should be called for the prosecution and the Court will not interfere with the
exercise of that discretion unless it can be shown that the prosecutor has been
influenced by some oblique motive (of which there is here no suggestion). This is
not to be regarded as lessening the duty of the prosecutor to bring forward
evidence of every material fact known to the prosecution whether favourable to
the accused or otherwise. The appeal should be dismissed since there was no
obligation on the Crown to call either Powell or Lowes at the trial. (Adel
Muhammed El Dabbah v. A.G. for Palestine [1944] A.C. 156 applied; Rex
v. Seneviratne [1936] 3 All E.R. 36 explained).

(Rex v. Lemay (100
Can. C.C. 367), a decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia
in an appeal by the same accused from his previous conviction on the same
charge and ordering a new trial, overruled).

Per Locke
J.: Since the Criminal Code is silent, the Criminal Law of England as it
existed on the 19th day of November, 1858, governs the matter. If what appears
to have been considered as a rule of practice prior to 1858 had become part of
the common law of England, the








[Page 233]

principle
applicable was as stated in R. v. Woodhead (1847) 2 C. & K. 520, and
R. v. Cassidy (1858) 1 F. & F. 79, and the Crown was under no
obligation to call either Powell or Lowes as a witness. (R. v. Sing (1932)
50 B.C.R. 32 and R. v. Hop Lee (1941) 56 B.C.R. 151 referred to).

Held also,
that since it is not expressed either explicitly or inferentially in s. 1013(4)
of the Criminal Code that the Attorney General should personally sign
the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal, there is no substance to the
objection that the notice was signed by B. as agent for the Attorney General of
British Columbia. (Locke J. agreed with Robertson J.A. that the signature by
the agent was sufficient since the appeal was substantially and actually in the
name of, and for, the Attorney General of British Columbia).

Held further,
following Beleyea v. The King [1932] S.C.R. 279, that the Court of
Appeal had the power to enter a conviction, it appearing that not only did the
trial judge not accept or believe the accused's testimony but he believed and
accepted the evidence of the R.C.M.P. officer, and that he dismissed the charge
only because he considered wrongly that the Crown had to call Lowes or account
for his absence. (Cartwright J., dissenting in part, would have ordered a new
trial on the ground that it did not appear certain but only probable that the
trial judge would have convicted but for his erroneous ruling on the point of
law).



APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia [1], allowing, O'Halloran J.A. dissenting, the
Crown's appeal from the accused's acquittal at trial on a charge of unlawful
sale of drugs.



J. Stevenson Hall for the appellant. S. 1013(4) of the Criminal
Code gives the right of appeal to the Attorney General and the power to
appeal cannot be delegated by the Attorney General. Therefore the notice of
appeal to the Court of Appeal signed by B. as agent for the Attorney General of
British Columbia was not proper in farm and in accordance with s. 1013(4) of
the Code (Rex v. Gallant [2]and Rex v. Perry [3].



Powell and Lowes were
essential Crown witnesses who were present throughout the major part of the
transaction of selling between Lemay and Bunyk, and should, therefore, have
been called as witnesses. The appellant relies in this respect upon the
dissenting judgment of O'Halloran JA. and the cases therein referred to, and
specially to Rex v. Seneviratne [4] and Rex v. Guerin[5].








[Page 234]



The Court of Appeal
erred in directing a conviction to be entered. If the setting aside of the
acquittal is upheld, a new trial should be directed, since it does not appear
from the judgment of the trial judge that he was satisfied of facts which
proved the accused guilty. He stated that he disbelieved the accused but does
not state expressly, nor does it follow by irresistible inference from anything
he does say, that he accepted the evidence of Bunyk. He does not say that, but
for the rule of law which he applied, he would have found the accused guilty.
It is not certain that he would have convicted the accused. (Rex v. Gun Ying[6] and Rex v. Tonelli[7].



Douglas McKay Brown
for the respondent. The
narrative had been completely unfolded by Bunyk. The evidence of Lowes was not
essential to the unfolding of the narrative and under the circumstances of the
evidence, the Crown was not obliged to call him as a witness. There was no duty
on the part of the Crown to call Lowes, who was associating with the accused, a
known criminal engaged in the drug traffic. From the principles laid down in Rex
v. Seneviratne (supra) and Rex v. Hop Lee[8]), it is clear: (a) There is no general obligation on
the part of the Crown to call every available witness; (b) Their
Lordships refused to lay down any rule to fetter discretion on a matter such as
this which is so dependent on the particular circumstances of each case; (c)
That, speaking generally, they could not approve of an idea that the
prosecution must call witnesses irrespective of consideration of number, and of
reliability, or that 'the prosecution ought to discharge the functions both of
prosecution and defence; (d) Witnesses essential to the unfolding of the
narrative on which the prosecution is' based must be called by the prosecution
whether in the result the effect of their testimony is for or against the case
for the prosecution. Under the circumstances of the present case, it was not
mandatory on the part of the Crown to call Lowes or Powell as a witness. In the
case of Adel Muhammed El Dabbah v. A.G. for Palestine [9], it was stated that the prosecutor has a discretion as
to what witnesses should be called for the prosecution, and the Court will not
interfere with the exercise of that discretion unless, perhaps, it

[Page 235]










can be shown that the
prosecutor has been influenced by some oblique motive. There is no suggestion
of such a motive here. The Crown, therefore, exercised that discretion in not
calling Powell or Lowes as witnesses.



There is a distinction
to be made between the Crown's duty of calling witnesses and the question of
identification.



In view of the
decision of this Court in Beleyea v. The King[10], the Court of Appeal had the power to convict the
accused. Since the trial judge would have convicted if he had not considered
that in law he could not, therefore the Court of Appeal was right in doing what
it did.



S. 1013(4) of the
Criminal Code does not say that the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal must
be signed personally by the Attorney General. It is sufficient if the appeal is
substantially and 'actually taken in the name of the Attorney General. The
present case is different from that of Rex v. Gallant (supra) cited by
the appellant.



The ease of Rex v.
Lee Fong Shee[11] is cited to show the clandestine nature of the drug
traffic and the difficulty to obtain a conviction.



The judgment of the
Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Taschereau, Kellock, Estey and Fauteux JJ. was
delivered by










KERWIN J.:-The
appellant Lemay was charged with having sold 'a drug to Steven Bunyk, on
September 21, 1950, at Vancouver contrary to the provisions of the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, as amended. Lemay was tried on that charge and
acquitted by His Honour Judge Sargent in the County Court Judges' Criminal
Court. On an appeal by the Crown to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [12] that acquittal was set aside, a
conviction entered, and the case remitted to the trial judge for sentence.
Under subsection 2 of section 1023 of the Code as enacted
by section 30 of chapter '55 of the Statutes of 1947, Lemay now appeals to this
Court alleging that his conviction was erroneous on two grounds (a) the Court
of Appeal erred in finding that it was not essential that the Crown call as a
witness one Henry Powell, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police informer, and one Art
Lowes, both of whom it was alleged were present throughout the

[Page 236]



major part of the
transaction of selling between the appellant and Bunyk; (b) the notice of
appeal to the Court of Appeal, which was signed ""Douglas McKay Brown,
Agent for the Attorney General of British Columbia"", was not proper in
form or in accordance with section 1013(4) of the Criminal Code as
enacted by section 28 of chapter 11 of the Statutes of 1930. These grounds will
be considered in order.



Steven Bunyk, who is
'a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, testified that he had known
Lemay by sight for some time previous to 21st September, 1950, having seen him
on about twelve occasions and having seen his picture several times. He
described Henry Powell as a coloured boy used by the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police and paid by them as an informer. Powell had pointed Lemay out to Bunyk
on the street, and on September 20, the two of them went to see Lemay in room
10 in a rooming house in Vancouver known as the Beacon Rooms. Failing to find
Lemay there, Bunyk, still 'accompanied by Powell, proceeded to depart when he
saw Lemay at the head of the stairs leading to the ground floor, whereupon
Lemay said to Bunyk : ""I thought you were coming as I saw you pass the
cafe several times."" Nothing else was said upon that occasion.



On the next day,
September 21 (the date of the alleged offence), Bunyk and Powell walked in a
westerly direction, on the south side of Hastings Street, towards the Malina
Cafe. The door to the cafe is on the east side of the cafe with a window
immediately to the west. Bunyk looked through that window and saw Lemay sitting
in a booth on the west side of the cafe. Bunyk could not say that Powell saw the
accused. Bunyk entered the cafe and sat down near Lemay in the booth and there
the transaction occur-red, which is the basis of the charge. It is not denied
that on that 'occasion Bunyk paid three dollars and received the drug but Lemay
denied that he was the man from whom the purchase was made and testified that
he was not present. Also sitting in the booth was the other man referred to,
known to Bunyk as Art Lowes. The accused denies any knowledge of such a person.
He denies knowing Bunyk or seeing or speaking to him on September 20 or 21. He
admits that he lived in room 10 in the Beacon Rooms

[Page 237]










for some time prior to
September 20 but states he moved from there on that date. While he says he was
away from Vancouver during parts of August and September, he admits being in
the city on September 20 and 21 and that on some occasions he had taken his meals
at the Malina Cafe.



Neither Powell nor
Lowes was called as a witness. For some time prior to September 20, Bunyk was
acting as an under cover agent and he stated that Powell came from the United
States and that he did not know where he was. Then the following question and
answer appear in the record:‑



Q. Do you know of
any inquiries which have been made to locate him?



A. Inquiries were
made to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in Seattle but they have failed to locate
him.



As to Lowes, Bunyk
'testified that he knew him to see him but that he had no idea how Lowes happened
to be with Lemay on September 21 and that Lowes had no connection with the case
as far as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was concerned and that Lowes was
not an operator for that organization.



Prior to the hearing
before His Honour Judge Sargent, Lemay had been convicted on the same charge by
His Honour Judge Boyd, but that conviction was set aside by the Court of Appeal
[13], consisting of O'Halloran, J.A.,
Robertson, J.A., and Sidney Smith, J.A. (dissenting), on the ground that Powell
had not been called as a witness. On the Crown's appeal from the acquittal on
the new trial, Sidney Smith, J.A., adhered to the view that he had ex-pressed
on the prior appeal, while Robertson, J.A., decided that on the second trial it
appeared that Powell had not looked through the window. As to Lowes, he
considered that 'the fact that that individual was associated with a drug
pedlar, as Lemay was found to be, probably convinced the Crown that his
evidence would not be reliable. He pointed out that the fact that Lowes was
present was made known at the preliminary hearing and, notwithstanding this,
counsel for Lemay did not ask that Lowes be subpoenaed or for an 'adjournment
to permit him to have him before the Court, and that the Court was not bound to
discharge the functions of the defence. O'Halloran J.A.








[Page 238]



dissented. He retained
the view he had held on the prior appeal as to Powell because he considered the
explanation of Powell's absence was of a vague and general character. That view
was to the effect that there is a rule whereby the Crown was bound to call
Powell as a witness essential to the unfolding of the narrative. He also
considered that it was difficult to avoid the reflection that if Lowes could
have identified Lemay, the Crown would not have failed to call him,
particularly since the Crown knew from the first trial that Lemay denied being
in the cafe and, there-fore, on the same basis, that the Crown was bound to
call him as a witness. He proceeded further to deal with what he described as a
fundamental aspect, viz., the trial judge's attitude towards Lemay's testimony.
These views of the learned Justice ,of Appeal cannot be accepted since it is
plain upon a reading of the reasons of the trial judge that he believed the
evidence of Bunyk and certainly he categorically stated that he did not believe
the evidence of Lemay. The trial judge had the witnesses before him and it was
not necessary that he itemize the reasons which led him to conclude that
Lemay's evidence was not to be believed.



While certain
decisions in the British Columbia Courts are referred to in the reasons for
judgment in the Court of Appeal, as well on the first appeal as on the second,
all the arguments on behalf of Lemay in connection with the first ground of
appeal are garnered from the following statement in the judgment of Lord Roche,
speaking on behalf of the Judicial Committee in Seneviratne v. Rex[14]. ""Witnesses essential to the unfolding of the
narrative on which the prosecution is based must, of course, be called by the
prosecution whether in the result the effect of their testimony is for or
against the case for the prosecution."" Now, in addition to this statement
being obiter as Lord Roche clearly stated, it also appears from page 48
of the first report and page 377 of the second, that he was dealing with the
case of the maid Alpina (and similar cases) whose good faith was not questioned
by the Crown, and pointed out that what she had said was given apparently
without previous cross-examination as to other and previous oral statements

[Page 239]



 It was pointed out
that this was both undesirable and not permitted by any sections of the Ceylon
Law of Evidence Ordinance. Lord Roche continued:










It is said that
the state of things above described arose because of a supposed obligation on
the prosecution to call every available witness on the principle laid down in
such a case as Ram Ranjan Roy v. R. ((1914) 1 L.R. 42 Cale., 422: 14
Digest 273, 2816 (ii)) to the effect that all available eye-witnesses should be
called by the prosecution even though, as in the case cited, their names were
on the list of defence witnesses. Their Lordships do not desire to lay down any
rules to fetter discretion on a matter such as this which is so dependent on
the particular circumstances of each case. Still less do they desire to
discourage the utmost candour and fairness on the part of those conducting
prosecutions; but at the same time they cannot, speaking generally, approve of
an idea that a prosecution must call witnesses irrespective of considerations
of number and of reliability or that a prosecution ought to discharge the
functions both of prosecution and defence. If it does so confusion is very apt
to result, and never is it more likely to result than if the prosecution calls
witnesses and then proceeds almost automatically to discredit them by
cross-examination.



Then follows the
statement relied on. In truth Lord Roche was dealing with an entirely different
matter, and reading the whole of his reasons it is clear that not only was he
not laying down any such rule as that here asserted but one directly contrary
to it.



It is made abundantly
plain from the subsequent decision of the Judicial Committee in Adell
Muhammed v. A.G. for Palestine[15], delivered by Lord Thankerton (which was not brought
to the attention of the Court of Appeal), that no such rule as has been
contended for, and apparently applied by the majority of that Court on the first
appeal and by the dissenting judge on the second appeal, has ever been laid
down. The earlier cases are referred to in the argument of counsel for the
accused in the Palestine case but Seneviratne v. Rex is not mentioned.
At pages 167, 168 and 169, Lord Thankerton deals with the contention that the
accused had a right to have the witnesses whose names were on the information
but who were not called to give evidence for the prosecution, tendered by the
Crown for cross-examination by the defence. Their Lordships agreed with the
trial judge and the Court of Criminal Appeal in Palestine that there was no
obligation on the prosecution to tender these witnesses. However, while the
Court of Criminal Appeal had held that that was the strict position

[Page 240]










in law, they expressed
the opinion that the better practice was that the witnesses should be tendered
at the close of the case for the prosecution so that the defence might
cross-examine them if they wished, and the Court desired to lay down as a rule
of practice that in future this practice of tendering witnesses should be
generally followed. Their Lordships of the Judicial Committee doubted whether
that rule of practice as expressed by the Court of Criminal Appeal sufficiently
recognized that the prosecutor has a discretion and that the Court will not
interfere with the exercise of that discretion unless perhaps it could be shown
that the prosecutor had been influenced by some oblique motive. Lord Thankerton
referred to the judgment of Baron Alderson in Reg. v. Woodhead[16], that the prosecutor is not bound to 'call witnesses
merely because their names are on the back of the indictment; that they should
be in Court but that they were to be called by the party who wanted their
evidence. Lord Thankerton also referred to Reg. v. Cassidy[17] where
Baron Parke, after consultation with Cresswell J. stated the rule in similar
terms. Lord Thankerton does go on to say that it is consistent with the
discretion of counsel for the prosecutor, which is thus recognized, that it
should be a general practice of prosecuting counsel, if they find no sufficient
reason to the contrary, to tender such witnesses for cross-examinaion by the
defence, but it remains a matter for the prosecutor's discretion. Reference was
also made to an interlocutory remark by Lord Hewart in Rex v. Harris[18] : ""in criminal cases the prosecution is bound to
call all the material witnesses before the court, even though they give
inconsistent accounts, in order that the whole of the facts may be before the
jury."" Lord Thankerton said that in their Lordships' view, the Chief
Justice could not have intended to negative the long-established right of the
prosecutor to exercise his discretion to determine who the material witnesses
are.



In the present case
there did not appear on the back of the charge sheet the name of any witness
but that fact is unimportant. Powell and Lowes did not give evidence at the
preliminary inquiry. There was no obligation on the Crown to call either of
them at the trial and we are therefore

[Page 241]










not concerned with the
question whether the explanation of Powell's absence was satisfactory or not.
Of course, the Crown must not hold back evidence because it would assist an
accused but there is no suggestion that this was done in the present case or,
to use the words of Lord Thankerton, ""that the prosecutor had been
influenced by some oblique motive."" It is idle to rely upon such
expressions as this or the one used by Lord Roche without relating them to the
matters under discussion but the important thing is that unless there are some
particular circumstances of the nature envisaged, the prosecutor is free to
exercise his discretion to determine who are the material witnesses.



The second ground of
appeal may be disposed of in a few words. Subsection 4 of section 1013 of the Code
enacts:



(4) Notwithstanding
anything in this Act contained, the Attorney General shall have the right to
appeal to the court of appeal against any judgment or verdict of acquittal of a
trial court in respect of an indictable offence on any ground of appeal which involves
a question of law alone.



It is not contended
that Mr. Brown was not the agent of the Attorney General of British Columbia or
that he did not have the latter's authority to institute the appeal to the
British Columbia Court of Appeal but it is said that at least the Attorney
General personally should have signed the notice of appeal. It is sufficient to
say that it is not so expressed in the subsection, either explicitly or
inferentially, and that there is no substance to the objection.



In registering a
conviction, the Court of Appeal had the authority of this Court in Belyea v.
The King[19]. It was there pointed out that by section 1014 of the Criminal
Code, the powers of a Court of Appeal on hearing 'an appeal by a person
convicted are, under subsection 3, in the event of the appeal being allowed, to



(a) quash the
conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered, or



(b) direct 'a new
trial; and in either case may make such other order as justice requires.



This section is made
applicable on an appeal by the Attorney General against an acquittal by the
provisions of subsection 5 of section 1013 as enacted by section 28 of chapter
11 of the Statutes of 1930, that mutatis mutandis

[Page 242]



(1) on the appeal
thereby given, the Court shall have the same powers as it has on an appeal by
the accused. Chief Justice Anglin pointed out that while it seemed rather a
strong thing to hold that the effect of the words mutatis mutandis is that
that clause must be made to read ""on an appeal by the Attorney General to










(a) quash the acquittal and direct a
judgment and verdict of conviction to be entered;""



yet that apparently
was the construction put upon the provision by the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Ontario. Chief Justice Anglin continued by stating that while
it had occurred to some members of this Court that the correct course would be
to apply clause (b) and to direct 'a new trial, the Court was merely affirming
the facts found by the trial judge and upon them reached the conclusion that
the only course open to the Appellate Division was to allow the appeal and
convict the accused.



Upon reading the
reasons for judgment of His Honour Judge Sargent, I am convinced that not only
did he not accept or believe the 'appellant's testimony but he believed and
accepted the evidence of Bunyk and it was only be-cause he considered himself
bound by the previous decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia that
he dismissed the charge.



The appeal should be
dismissed.



RAND J.:-I think it
clear from the authorities cited that no such absolute duty rests on the
prosecution as the Court of Appeal in the earlier proceeding held. Material
witnesses in this context are those who can testify to material facts, but
obviously that is not identical with being ""essential to the unfolding of
the narrative."" The duty of the prosecutor to see that no unfairness is
done the accused is entirely compatible with discretion as to witnesses; the
duty of the Court is to see that the balance between these is not improperly
disturbed.



On the other two
points also, I concur, and the appeal must be dismissed.

[Page 243]



LOCKE J. :The
appellant, Paul Lemay, was in the month of September 1950 charged with having,
at the City of Vancouver, sold a narcotic drug to one Stephen Bunyk, contrary
to the provisions of the Opium and Narcotic Drugs Act, and on that
charge, after a preliminary enquiry, was committed for trial by the Deputy
Police Magistrate on October 6, 1950.



At the preliminary
hearing, evidence for the Crown was given by Bunyk, an officer in the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, to the effect that he had on September 21, 1950,
proceeded to ,a restaurant on Hastings Street in Vancouver, in company with one
Powell, and entering the restaurant alone purchased the drug from Lemay in the
presence of one Art Lowes.










Thereafter, having
elected to take a speedy trial before His Honour Judge Bruce Boyd, a judge of
the County Court at Vancouver, he was found guilty and sentenced to a term of
imprisonment and a fine. Powell, an informer in the employ of the Mounted
Police, who had not entered the restaurant with Bunyk, was not called by the
Crown at the trial before the learned County Court Judge, though the fact that
he had accompanied Bunyk to the restaurant was mentioned. I would infer from
the reasons for judgment delivered upon this appeal that the name of Lowes was
not mentioned at the trial and it is clear that he was not called as a witness.
The present Appellant appealed to the Court ,of Appeal for British Columbia [20] and that court, by ,a decision of the
majority (Sidney Smith J.A. dissenting), set the conviction aside upon the
ground that as, apparently, Powell had seen the accused in the restaurant his
evidence was material on the question of identification, and that there was an
obligation on the prosecution to call him. Adopting an expression used by Lord
Roche, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Rex v.
Seneviratne[21], that witnesses essential to the ""unfolding of
the narrative on which the prosecution is based"" must be called by the
prosecution, O'Halloran J.A., with whom Robertson J.A. agreed, said in part:



If all material
witnesses are not called by the prosecution, the defence is thereby deprived of
the opportunity for cross-examination, and to that extent an accused is denied
the right of full defence which our courts have long recognized as essential to
a fair trial.

[Page 244]










Lemay appeared for
trial again before His Honour Judge R. A. Sargent of the County Court of
Vancouver on. February 8, 1951, and was represented by counsel. Bunyk gave
evidence that Powell had accompanied him to the restaurant and had not entered
and, while not mentioning in his evidence in chief the presence of Lowes, did
so in cross-examination, saying that Lowes was sitting in a booth in the
restaurant with Lemay when he had purchased the drug. Describing thé
transaction he said that Lemay had in his hand a fingerstall containing
capsules wrapped in silver paper when he (Bunyk) sat down opposite him in the
booth and asked if he could get one, whereupon Lemay took .one of the capsules
and placed it on the table in front of him and he thereupon paid Lemay $3.00.
Some evidence was given at the hearing of efforts made by the Crown to locate
Powell and of their failure but, in the view that I take of this matter, it is
unnecessary to consider its sufficiency since if the Crown was .under .a legal
obligation to call Powell or account for his absence, clearly there was the
same obligation in respect of Lowes who saw the whole transaction, and no
effort was made to account for the failure to call him.



It is of importance to
note that while the appellant had known from the date of the preliminary
hearing before the Deputy Police Magistrate that Bunyk had, according to his
story, been accompanied by Powell to the restaurant and had purchased the drug
in the presence of Art Lowes, no request was made at the commencement of the
trial before His Honour Judge Sargent or during the course of the trial for a
direction that the Crown should either call them or assist the defence in
locating them, or for an adjournment so that they could be located. The only
evidence of identification was that of Constable Bunyk who, while .a police
officer, had been working under cover in Vancouver and who had during a period
of weeks before the date of the purchase seen Lemay a number of times. Lemay's
defence was simply a complete denial of the whole affair and he swore that he
had never seen Bunyk before the latter appeared in the Police Court to give
evidence. As to Lowes, he said that while he might know him he did

[Page 245]



not know him by that
name. On the question of credibility, the learned trial judge, in giving
judgment, said in part :



The accused went
into the box and categorically denied any sale of narcotics and the testimony
of Bunyk in toto. He further states that he did not know Lowes, at least
by name. These denials I do not accept, nor do I believe his testimony.



Then saying that he
did not feel that there was sufficient evidence to make a finding as to whether
Powell did or did not see the transaction, that the evidence had shown that
Lowes was not connected with Bunyk or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and
that no explanation had been given as to why he had not been called or what, if
any, attempts had been made to find him, after quoting from the judgment of
O'Halloran J.A. as to the obligation of the Crown to call all material
witnesses, dismissed the charge against the prisoner.










The Attorney-General
of the Province of British Columbia appealed to the Court of Appeal[22] under the provisions of subsection 4 of
section 1013 of the Criminal Code and that Court, by a decision of the
majority (O'Halloran J.A. dissenting) allowed the appeal, set the acquittal
aside and directed that a conviction be entered and the case remitted to the
trial judge for sentence.



The appellant alleges
two errors in the judgment appealed from : the first, that the notice of appeal
to the 'Court of Appeal which was signed by Douglas Mackay Brown, agent for the
Attorney-General of British Columbia, was an insufficient compliance with
section 1013(4) of the Code, and the second, in finding that it was not
essential to the Crown to call Powell and Lowes as witnesses at the trial.



As to the first of
these points there was no disagreement in the Court of Appeal and I
respectfully agree with Mr. Justice Robertson that the signature by the agent
of the Attorney-General was sufficient.



The contention of the
appellant upon the second point is that, as stated by Mr. Justice O'Halloran,
Lowes and Powell were material witnesses on the question of the identification
of Lemay and there was an obligation in law upon the Crown to call them. For
the Crown it is said that it is for the Crown prosecutor, as the representative

[Page 246]



of His Majesty, to
decide what evidence is to be called for the prosecution and that, subject to
something in the nature of bad faith on his part, such as endeavouring to
obtain a conviction by suppressing the truth (in which event the trial judge
could properly intervene), his decision in the matter may not be interfered
with. It is perhaps unnecessary to say that there is no suggestion of any such
impropriety on the part of those representing the Crown at the preliminary
hearing and the trial of this matter.










Since the Criminal
Code is silent on. the matter, the obligation contended for by the
appellant, if it exists, must be part of the common law of British Columbia.
The question, or one closely allied to it, has been considered in a number of
decisions in England. In R. v. Simmonds[23], where counsel for the Crown declined to call a
witness whose name appeared on the back of the Indictment, Hui-lock B. said
that, though the prosecution were not bound to call every witness whose name
was on the indictment, it was usual to do so and, if it was not done, he as the
judge would call the witness so that the prisoner's counsel might have an
opportunity to cross-examine him. In a note to this case there is a reference
to R. v. Witebread, where on 'a trial for larceny the prosecution
omitted to call an apprentice of the prosecutor who had been implicated in the
theft and who had been examined at the police office and before the grand jury
and whose name was on the back of the indictment. Counsel for the prisoner
contended that the witness ought to be called but counsel for the prosecution
declined, saying that the prisoner's counsel might himself call him if he
chose. Holroyd and Burrough JJ. held that the prosecutor's counsel was not
bound to call all the witnesses whose names were on the indictment merely to
let the other side cross-examine them. The note further reports, however, that
in the case of R. v. John Taylor, tried in the same year, Park J. called
all the witnesses whose names appeared on the back of the indictment whom the
prosecutor had not called, merely to allow the prisoner's counsel to
cross-examine them. In R. v. Beezley[24], Littledale J. said that counsel for the prosecution
who had closed his case without calling all of the witnesses whose names were
on the indictment should call all of them, in

[Page 247]



order to give the
prisoner's counsel an opportunity of cross-examining them. In R. v. Bodle [25], where the charge was murder and counsel for the Crown
declined to call the father of the prisoner whose name was on the back of the
indictment, Gaselee J., having conferred with Mr. Baron Vaughan, said that they
were both of the opinion that if counsel for the prosecution declined to call a
witness whose name is on the back of the indictment it is in the discretion of
the judge who tries the case to say whether the witness should be called for
the prisoner's counsel to examine him, before the prisoner is called on for his
defence. In R. v. Holden[26], the charge was murder. The Crown did not call the
daughter of the deceased person who, apparently had been present when the
offence was committed, whose name was not on the back of the indictment and who
was in court. Patteson J. said that she should be called and that every witness
who was present at a transaction of that kind, even if they give different
accounts, should be heard by the jury so as to draw their own conclusion as to
the real truth of the matter. There had been a postmortem examination of the
body of the deceased in the presence of three surgeons but, of these, only two
were called to give evidence for the Crown, though the third was in court.
Patteson J. said that he was aware that the name of this person was not on the
back of the indictment but that as he was in court he would insist on his being
examined and said :










He is a material
witness who was not called on the part of the prosecution and as he is in court
I shall call him for the furtherance of justice.



In R. v. Bull[27], counsel for the Crown said that there was one witness
examined before the grand jury whom, on account of information he had since
received, it was not his intention to call as a witness for the prosecution; on
counsel for the prisoner objecting that it was unfair not to examine all those
whose names were on the back of the bill and Crown counsel saying that his
intention was to put the witness into the box, Vaughan J. said that the proper
course was to put the witness into the box and that:

[Page 248]



every witness
ought to be examined. In cases of this kind counsel ought not to keep back a
witness because his evidence may weaken the case for the prosecution.



In R. v. Stroner[28], Pollock C.B. directed the prosecution to call two
persons as witnesses for the prosecution whose evidence he considered to be
material and whose names were not on the back of the indictment but who were in
court as witnesses for the accused. In R. v. Barley[29], where the prosecution did not call two witnesses
whose names were on the back of the indictment, Pollock C.B. after consulting
with Coleridge J. intimated that the witnesses ought to be called by counsel
for the prosecution, whereupon the witnesses were placed in the box and sworn
on the part of the Crown and cross-examined on behalf of the prisoner.



The practice in the
matter appears to have been clarified in 1847 when in R. v. Woodhead[30], where counsel for the Crown, after stating the case
for the prosecution, had observed that he did not deem it necessary to call all
the witnesses whose names were on the back of the indictment, unless counsel
for the prisoner should desire it, Alderson B. said:



You are aware, I
presume, of the rule which the judges have lately laid down, that a prosecutor
is not bound to call witnesses merely because their names are on the back of
the indictment. The witnesses, however, should be here, because the prisoner
might otherwise be misled; he might, from their names being on the bill, have
relied on your bringing them here, and have neglected to bring them himself.
You ought, there-fore, to have them in court, but they are to be called by the
party who wants their evidence. This is the only sensible rule.



Counsel for the
prisoner then asked whether if he called these persons he would make them his
own witnesses, to which Alderson B. replied :










Yes, certainly.
That is the proper course, and one which is consistent with other rules of
practice. For instance, if they were called by the prosecutor, it might be
contended that he ought not to give evidence to shew them unworthy of credit,
however falsely the witnesses might have deposed.



In R. v. Cassidy[31], where the prosecutor refused to call a witness whose
name was on the back of the indictment and counsel for the prisoner contended
that ""according to the usual practice"" he ought in fairness to do so,
Baron Parke said that while the usual course was for the prosecutor to call the
witness and, if he declined to examine, the prisoner might cross-examine him,
he thought the practice

[Page 249]



did not stand upon any
very clear or correct principle and was supported only on the authority of
single judges on criminal trials, and he should, therefore, follow what he
considered the correct principle, that the counsel for the prosecution should
call what witnesses he thought proper, and that, by having had certain
witnesses examined before the grand jury whose names were on the back of the
indictment, he only impliedly undertook to have them in court for the prisoner
to examine them as his witnesses; for the prisoner, on seeing the names there,
might have abstained from subpoenaing them. He then said that he would follow
the course said to have been pursued by Campbell C.J. in a recent case, who
ruled that the prosecutor was not bound to call such a witness and that, if the
prisoner did so, the witness should be considered as his own. Upon counsel for
the prisoner saying that he believed that Creswell J. had acted differently,
Parke B. consulted with the latter and then said that Creswell J. had informed
him that he had always allowed the prosecutor to take his own course in such
circumstances, without compelling him to call the witness if he did not think
fit to do so, and that he entirely agreed with what Baron Parke proposed to do.










The judgment of Baron
Parke in Cassidy's case was delivered in March 1858. Section 11 of the Criminal
Code declares that the criminal law of England as it existed on November
19, 1858, in so. far as it has not been repealed by any ordinance or act, still
having the force of law, of the colony of British Columbia, or the colony of
Vancouver Island, passed before the union of the said colonies, or by this Act
or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, and as altered, varied, modified
or affected by any such ordinance or Act, shall be the criminal law of the
Province of British Columbia. Prior to the enactment of the Code the
matter had been dealt with and the same date fixed by a proclamation issued
under the public seal of the colony of British Columbia by Governor Douglas on
November 19, 1858, and by an Ordinance to assimilate the general application of
English Law (30 Viet. o. 70) adopted by the Legislative Council of British
Columbia on March 6, 1867. In substantially the same form, the provisions of
the Ordinance are continued in the English Law Act, c. 111, R.S.B.C..
1948, section 2. The matter we are considering has not been dealt with by
statute. If, therefore, what appears to

[Page 250]



have been considered
as a rule of practice prior to 1858 had become part of the common law of
England, the principle was as stated by Baron Alderson in R. v. Woodhead and
Baron Parke in R. v. Cassidy. That these decisions are to be regarded as
correctly stating the law of England as it was in 1858 is settled by the
decision of the Judicial Committee in Adel Muhammed v. Attorney-General for
Palestine[32] . Lord Thankerton, it will be noted, in delivering the
judgment of the Judicial Committee, said in part:



While their
Lordships agree that there was no obligation on the prosecution to tender these
witnesses, and, therefore, this contention of the present appellant fails,
their Lordships doubt whether the rule of practice as expressed by the Court of
Criminal Appeal sufficiently recognizes that the prosecutor has a discretion as
to what witnesses should be called for the prosecution, and the court will not
interfere with the exercise of that discretion, unless, perhaps, it can be
shown that the prosecutor has been influenced by some oblique motive.



While the case was an
appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal of Palestine and the conviction had
been made under the Criminal Code Ordinance 1936 of that State, it is apparent
that the matter had not been dealt with by statute and that the law of
Palestine was in this respect the same as that of England.










In delivering the
judgment in the appeal taken by Lemay to the Court of Appeal from his
conviction, O'Halloran J.A. refers to two decisions of the courts of British
Columbia in which the matter was considered. In R. v. Sing [33], where the Crown did not call certain witnesses whose
names were on the back of the indictment, Macdonald J., referring to R. v.
Woodhead and R. v. Cassidy and to a more recent decision in R. v.
Wiggins [34], ruled that, unless the Crown saw fit to do so, it was
not necessary to call all of the witnesses whose names appeared. Counsel for
the prisoner contended that there were two other witnesses called at the
preliminary who should be called, in order that he might cross-examine them,
but the report of the matter does not indicate that any such order was made. In
R. v. Hop Lee[35], where the charge was selling narcotic drugs,



the Crown did not call
a Chinese witness who was in the employ of the police and who had been a
witness to the sale. The accused was convicted and appealed to the Court

[Page 251]



of Appeal and the
report shows that counsel for the Crown there took the attitude that the Crown
was under no obligation to call all, the witnesses and that this particular man
was a ""stool pigeon"" whose evidence could not be relied upon. The
Court unanimously dismissed the appeal and it may be noted that McDonald J.A.
(afterwards C.J.B.C.) quoted a length from the judgment of Lord Roche in Rex
v. Seneviratne, which has been so much discussed in the present matter,
including that passage where it is said that their Lordships could not,
speaking generally, approve of an idea that a prosecution must call witnesses
irrespective of considerations of number and of reliability, or that a
prosecution ought to discharge the functions both of prosecution and defence.










In the present matter
'the prisoner, who was tried before His Honour Judge Sargent in February 1951,
had known since the previous September that Bunyk would give evidence that he
had been accompanied to the restaurant by Powell and that Lowes was sitting in
the booth with him when the sale was made to the constable. The proceedings
following the committal were, by reason of the election of the appellant, by
way of speedy trial and there was thus no indictment upon which the names of
the witnesses proposed to be called would be endorsed and there is no
suggestion that any step was taken on the part of the prosecution which would
lead counsel for the accused to expect that they would be in court when the
matter came up for hearing and thus available to give evidence, as was the case
in R. v. Woodhead. Powell was an informer in the employ of the police
and, even had he been available, counsel for the Crown might well have decided
not to call him as a witness for the prosecution, as was done in the case of
Hop Lee. As to Lowes, the only information concerning him in the record is that
Constable Bunyk on re-examination said that he (Lowes) had no connection with
the matter ""as far as the R.C.M.P. is concerned"" and that he was not
an operator for the R.C.M.P. From the fact that Lowes was, according to Bunyk,
sitting at the table in the restaurant with Lemay when the latter produced the
finger-stall containing the small packages of the drug and made the sale to
Bunyk, it might be inferred that Lowes was a confederate of the latter, since, otherwise,
he would be unlikely to commit a criminal offence in his presence. If

[Page 252]



this be the proper
inference to draw, is it to be said that, as a matter of law, the Crown was
required to call Lowes as a witness for the prosecution and thus, assuming he
should join with Lemay in denying that any such trans-action had taken place,
assist 'a guilty person to escape? From a practical view point, if that was the
law, far from furthering the due administration of justice it would, in my
opinion, actively retard it. In the case of those engaged in the illicit drug
traffic, by working in pairs, the one making the sale would be assured at all
times of having a witness with him available, in the case of a prosecution, to
join in denying that anything of the kind had taken place and whom the Crown
would be bound to call. For the appellant, reliance is placed upon that portion
of the judgment of Lord Roche, hereinbefore referred to, where it was said that
the witnesses essential to the ""unfolding of the narrative on which the
prosecution is based"" must be called. This language must, however, be read
together with its context, as was done by McDonald J.A. in Hop Lee's case, and
so read it does not, in my opinion, sustain the contention of the appellant.
If, indeed, there were any difference between what was said by Lord Roche in
that case, which, as the report indicates, was obiter, and what was said
by Lord Thankerton in the case of Adel Muhammed (and I think there is
not), it is, in my opinion, the latter view that should be accepted.



The reasons for
judgment delivered by His Honour Judge Sargent satify me that he believed the
evidence of the witness Bunyk and that, had he not considered that he was bound
to acquit the accused by reason of the failure of the Crown to call Lowes as a
witness or account for his absence, he would have found the accused guilty.



As to the contention
that there was error in the judgment appealed from, in that the appellant was
found guilty and the case remitted to the trial judge for sentence, the matter
appears to me to be determined against the appellant by the decision of this
court in Rex v. Belyea[36]










I would dismiss this
appeal.

[Page 253]



CARTWRIGHT J.
(dissenting in part) :-This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia [37] dated March 22, 1951, setting aside the
judgment of acquittal of a charge of unlawfully selling a drug contrary to the
provisions of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act pronounced on the 27th
February, 1951, by His Honour Judge Sargent, ordering a conviction to be
entered and remitting the case to the trial judge to impose sentence.



The respondent was
first tried for the said offence before His Honour Judge Boyd and was convicted
on November 2, 19'50. On December 22, 1950, this conviction was set aside by
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[38]  (O'Halloran, Robertson and Sidney Smith,
JJ.A.) the last named learned Justice of Appeal dissenting, and a new trial was
directed.



The evidence mainly
relied on by the Crown at the trial with which we are concerned, before His
Honour Judge Sargent, was that of Constable Bunyk of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police who testified in chief that on the 21st of September, 1950, at about
9.15 a.m. accompanied by one Powell he approached the Malina 'Café in
Vancouver; that he looked through the window and saw the appellant, who was
already known to him, seated at a table in about the fifth booth on the west
side of the café; that he can not tell whether Powell also looked through the
window or saw the appellant; that he (Bunyk) entered the café alone and sat
down beside the appellant; that the appellant had in his hand a grey
finger-stall containing several capsules wrapped in silver paper and was trying
to remove an elastic band from around the top of the finger-stall; that he said
to the appellant-""Can I get one?"" and the appellant replied
""Yes""; that the appellant took one of the capsules from the
finger-stall and placed it on the table in front of Bunyk; that he (Bunyk)
picked it up and put it in his pocket and handed the appellant three dollars;
that he left the café and rejoined Powell about two doors east of the café. In
cross-examination and re-examination Bunyk testified that throughout the
trans-action which he had described in chief one Art Lowes was sitting in the booth
with the appellant and that Lowes was

[Page 254]



known to him (Bunyk).
The following questions and answers are found in the re-examination:










Q. How did Lowes
happen to be with LeMay at the time of this transaction?



A. I have no idea.



Q. Did the Art
Lowes who was with LeMay at the time of the transaction have any connection
with this case as far as the R.C.M.P. is concerned?



A. None whatever.



Q. Is Lowes an
operator for the R.C.M.P.? 



A. No, he is not.



The Crown proved that
the capsule purchased by Bunyk contained the drug mentioned in the charge.



The appellant gave
evidence. He denied having had anything to do with the matter; stated that he
had never seen Bunyk prior to the preliminary hearing; that he did not use
drugs and that he had never sold ,a drug to Bunyk or to anyone else. The
learned trial judge reserved judgment and later dismissed the charge.



In examining the
reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge it is necessary to know
something of the earlier trial of the appellant ,and of the reasons which moved
the Court of Appeal to set aside that conviction and direct a new trial.



The only substantial
differences between the evidence given at the first trial and that given at the
second which were suggested to be relevant to the determination of this appeal
appear to be: (i) At the first trial the evidence in the view of the Court of
Appeal indicated that Powell was in a position to see what occurred in the café
at the time Bunyk purchased the drug, while the effect of the evidence in this
regard at the second trial is summarized by the learned trial judge as follows:



I do not feel
that there is sufficient evidence before me upon which to make any finding,
either that Powell did or did not see the transaction between the accused and
Bunyk.










(ii) At the first
trial no evidence was given to shew why counsel for the Crown did not call
Powell as a witness, while at the second trial evidence was received to the
effect that he had disappeared and that inquiries as to his whereabouts were
unproductive of result. (It should be mentioned that Mr. Hall argued that the
evidence as to the making of these inquiries was inadmissible on the ground

[Page 255]



that it was hearsay,
but as, in my view, this evidence has no bearing on the result of the appeal I
do not deal with this question.) (iii) At the first trial there was no evidence
of the presence of Art Lowes at the time of the sale, indeed, Lowes was not mentioned
at all.



The reasons for
judgment of the Court of Appeal on the appeal from the conviction at the first
trial are set out in full in the reasons of O'Halloran J.A. in the present case
and are reported as LeMay (No. 1) in 100 C.C.C. pages 367 and 368. The question
whether that judgment was right in the result is not before us and I express no
opinion. That appeal was brought by the accused and under section 1014(c) of
the Criminal Code it was the duty of the Court of Appeal to allow the
appeal if of opinion that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice.



The learned judge
presiding at the second trial appears to me to have interpreted the reasons of
the Court of Appeal in LeMay (No. 1) as laying down as a rule of law that the
unexplained omission on the part of the Crown to call a witness shewn by the
evidence to have been in a position to give relevant and material evidence as
to the guilt or innocence of the accused necessitates an acquittal. The learned
trial judge appears to have inclined to the view that the failure to call
Powell was sufficiently explained. He then proceeds:



However, there is
one other piece of evidence which came out in cross-examination, namely, that a
,third person, Lowes was present at the sale to Bunyk. Evidence was led by the
Crown to show that Lowes was not connected with Bunyk or the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, but no explanation was given as to why he had not been called,
or what, if any, attempts were made to find him.



On these facts I
am faced with the principle laid down by the Court of Appeal in Rex v.
Lemay. In that case, Mr. Justice O'Halloran said in the course of his
judgment:



If all material
witnesses are not called by the prosecution, the defence is thereby deprived of
the opportunity for cross-examination, and to that extent an accused is denied
the right of full defence which our Courts have long recognized as essential to
a fair trial.



The judgment is
binding on me in. this case. Therefore, the motion to dismiss will be allowed
and the charge dismissed.



The right of appeal
against a judgment of acquittal is given to the Attorney-General by section
1013(4) and is, of course, restricted to grounds of appeal which involve a
question of law alone.








[Page 256]



In my respectful
opinion the learned trial judge erred in law in instructing himself that there
is a rule of law such as he deduced from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in
LeMay (No. 1) viz: that the unexplained omis



sion on the part of the
Crown to call a witness shewn by the evidence to have been in a position to
give relevant and material evidence as to the guilt or innocence of the accused
necessitates an acquittal.



I do not propose to
examine the authorities at length. I think it sufficient to refer to the
judgment of their Lordships of the Judicial Committee delivered by Lord
Thankerton in Adel Muhammed El Dabbah v. Attorney-General for Palestine[39] and
particularly at pages 167 to 169, where it is laid down that the Court will not
interfere with the exercise of the discretion of the prosecutor as to what
witnesses should be called for the prosecution unless, perhaps, it can be shewn
that the prosecutor has been influenced by some oblique motive. I find no
conflict between this judgment and that pronounced by Lord Roche, also speaking
for the Judicial Committee in Rex v. Seneviratne[40]). Counsel for the appellant laid emphasis on the
following passage at page 378:



Witnesses
essential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the prosecution is based
must, of course, be called by the prosecution, whether in the result the effect
of their testimony is for or against the case for the prosecution.



It must be remembered
that Rex v. Seneviratne was a ease in which the accused had been
convicted of murder on purely circumstantial evidence. In the passage just
quoted it appears to me that Lord Roche Was referring to the duty which clearly
rests upon the prosecutor to place before the Court evidence of every material
circumstance known to the prosecution including, of course, those circumstances
which are favourable to the accused. It must also be remembered that Lord Roche
was not dealing with an argument of counsel for the accused that the prosecutor
had failed to call witnesses that he should have called, but with the reply of
counsel for the Crown to the argument of counsel for the defence that the
prosecutor had called a number of witnesses who gave irrelevant and
inadmissible evidence and whose evidence ought not to have been received.








[Page 257].



I wish to make it
perfectly clear that I do not intend to say anything which might be regarded as
lessening the duty which rests upon counsel for the Crown to bring for-ward
evidence of every material fact known to the prosecution whether favourable to
the accused or otherwise; nor do I intend to suggest that there may not be
cases in which the failure of the prosecutor to call a witness will cause the
tribunal of fact to come to the conclusion that it would be unsafe to convict.
The principle stated by Avory J. in Rex v. Harris[41]), that in a criminal trial where the liberty of a
subject is at stake, the sole object of the proceedings is to make certain that
justice should be done between the subject and the State, is firmly
established.



While it is the right
of the prosecutor to exercise his discretion to determine who the material
witnesses are, the failure on his part to place the whole of the story as known
to the prosecution before the tribunal of fact may well be ground for quashing
a conviction. Such a case is that of Edward Guerin [42]).



For the above reasons
I am of opinion that the learned trial judge erred in directing himself that he
was bound as a matter of law to acquit the appellant because of the fact that
the Crown did not call Art Lowes as a witness; and that the Court of Appeal
were right in deciding that the judgment of acquittal should be set aside.



As to the second
ground of appeal argued before us-that the notice of appeal to the Court of
Appeal was not in accordance with section 101'3(4) of the Criminal Code-I
agree with what has been said by my brother Kerwin.



It remains to consider
Mr. Hall's final argument that the Court of Appeal erred in directing a
conviction to be entered ,and that if the setting aside of the acquittal is
upheld a new trial should be directed.










We are bound by the
judgment of this Court in Rex v. Belyea [43], which decided that the wording of section 1013(5) of
the Criminal Code is apt to confer jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal
in an appeal brought by the Attorney-General under section 1013(4) not only to
set aside the judgment of acquittal and to direct a new trial but, in a proper
case, to direct a conviction to be entered, and

[Page 258]



it is irrelevant to inquire
whether, if the matter were res integra I would have found the wording
of the section sufficiently plain and unambiguous to effect so revolutionary a
change in the pre-existing law.



In my opinion the
power to direct that a conviction be entered after an acquittal by 'a trial
judge has been set aside can be exercised only if it appears to the Court of
Appeal from the judgment of the trial judge that he must have been satisfied of
facts which proved the accused guilty of the offence charged. In the case at
bar I do not think that this appears. It is quite true that the learned trial
judge says:



The accused went
into the box and categorically denied any sale of narcotics, and the testimony
of Bunyk in tote. He further states that he , did not know Lowes, at
least by name. These denials I do not accept, nor do I believe his testimony.



but he nowhere states
expressly, nor does it follow by irresistible inference from anything he does
say, that he accepts the evidence of Bunyk. He does not say that, but for the
supposed rule of law which he applied, he would have found the accused guilty.
He does not indicate that he is left without any reasonable doubt as to his
guilt. In the view he took of the law, it was, indeed, no more necessary for
the learned trial judge to express himself upon any of these vital matters than
it would have been fora jury to da so after being directed that in view of a
point of law taken by the defence they must return a verdict of ""not
guilty"". It is not, I think, sufficient that, from the reasons of the
learned trial judge, it should appear to the Court of Appeal in the highest
degree probable that he would have convicted but for his erroneous ruling on
the point of law; it must appear certain that he would have done so.



I would allow the
appeal to the extent of setting aside that part of the order of the Court of
Appeal which directs a conviction to be entered and would order a new trial.

Appeal
dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Criminal law—Evidence—Sale of

witnesses—Whether notice of appeal must be signed by the Attorney General—Power
of Court of Appeal to enter conviction—Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, S. of

The facts in this case were
similar to that of Lemay v. The King, reported in this volume at
page 232, with the exception that the sale was made by Agostino to Bunyk on the
street and that Powell, but not Lowes, was present on that occasion. The
members of the Court were the same, and for the reasons respectively given by
them in the Lemay case, dismissed the appeal (Cartwright J.,
dissenting in part, would have ordered a new trial).

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL OF
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Appeals—Autre fois acquit—Autre
fois convict—Conviction for manslaughter on indictment for murder quashed for
misdirection but new trial not ordered nor an acquittal directed—Fresh
indictment preferred by Crown for manslaughter—Statutory authority given Court
of Appeal to direct acquittal or a new trial, mandatory—Failure of court to exercise
such authority precludes another trial under s. 873—The Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1927, c. 86, ss. 856, 878, 905-909, 951, 1014 (3).

The Criminal Code provides:

“Section 1014 (3). Subject to the
special provisions contained in the following sections of this Part, when
the court of appeal allows an appeal against conviction it may

(a) quash the conviction and direct a
judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered; or

(b) direct a new trial:

and in either case may make such other order
as justice requires.”

[Page 413]

Held: By the
majority of the court (Rinfret C.J., Kerwin and Taschereau JJ., dissenting),
that the exercise of the statutory authority given to the court of appeal under
s. 1014 (3) to direct an acquittal to be entered, or to direct a new trial, and
in either case to make such other order as justice requires, is not permissive
but mandatory. The right of appeal being such an exceptional right, all the
substantive and procedural provisions relating to it must be regarded as
exhaustive and exclusive and need not be expressly stated in the Statute. If
therefore the court of appeal fails to exercise its authority and refrains from
directing a new trial, another trial cannot be had by resorting to s. 873. The
powers under that section are not absolute and cannot obtain in all
circumstances. Like many others in the Code, they remain subject to
qualifications and restrictions implicitly and necessarily flowing from other
provisions in the same Act.

Per Rinfret
C.J. and Taschereau J., dissenting: The only competent authority in a case of
misdirection to order a new trial is the Court of Appeal, but failure of that
court to make such an order does not preclude the Crown from exercising its
rights to prefer a fresh bill of indictment under s. 873. The proceedings under
the fresh bill of indictment do not constitute a new trial, within the
meaning of s. 1014, they initiate a second trial, entirely independent
of the first on a new indictment. A “new trial” which alone the court of appeal
has the power to order in a criminal prosecution, is the re-examination of a
case on the same information or indictment. It supposes a
completed trial, which for some sufficient reason has ben set aside, so that
the issues may be litigated de novo. It is ordered so that the court may
have the opportunity to correct errors in the proceedings at the first trial.
Such is not the case here, and unless there are valid reasons to prevent the
Crown to initiate a second trial as it did, this appeal must fail. We
have to decide if the incomplete judgment of the Court of Appeal, is a bar to
the exercise by the Crown of its unquestionable power to prefer a bill of
indictment. A solid ground of defence would undoubtedly be a plea of autre
fois acquit or autre fois convict, but this cannot be successfully
argued. The appellant has neither been acquitted nor convicted, and it is only
in such cases that an accused may say, if he is brought to trial again on the
same charge, that he has been in “jeopardy” twice. Rex v. Ecker and Fry, 64
O.L.R. 1 at 3. The law does not allow that a man be tried a second time when he
has already been convicted, or exposed to be convicted, when he has already
been acquitted, but it does not forbid a second trial when the first did not
come to a legal conclusion. Only the pleas of autre fois acquit or autre
fois convict could be successfully raised by the appellant in the present
case, and as they both fail, the appeal should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin J.,
dissenting: The power given to the Court of Appeal under s. 1014 (3) is
permissive as indicated by the use of the word “may” and includes the power to
allow an appeal and set aside a conviction leaving the Crown free to prefer a
new and different indictment, if it sees fit. The powers of the Court of Appeal
are not circumscribed as are those of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England
and the decisions of that Court are, therefore, of no assistance on the point
under review. This appeal is to be decided under the provisions of the Criminal
Code, Rex v. O’Keefe, 15 N.S.W.L.R. 1; Rex v. Lee, 16 N.S.W.L.R. 6,

[Page 414]

distinguished; Rex v. Welch, [1948]
O.R. 884, Rex. v. Pascal, 95 C.C.C. 288, approved. Gudmundson v. The
King, 60 C.C.C., distinguished. Where an accused upon an indictment for
murder is convicted of manslaughter a court of appeal may properly under s.
1014 (3) allow the appeal and set aside such conviction. If it neither directs
a verdict of acquittal to be entered, nor directs a new trial, s. 873 (1) is
then wide enough to permit the preferring of a bill of indictment for
manslaughter. In provinces where there is no grand jury, subsequent sub‑sections of
s. 873 takes care of the situation. The second ground of the appeal, that, “the
accused was entitled in answer to the present indictment to the common law defence
that a man should not be put twice in jeopardy for the same matter,”—is not a
plea or defence, as the plea of autre fois acquit is grounded on the
maxim, that a man shall not be brought into danger of his life for one and the
same offence, more than once. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, 8th Ed. Vol.
II, c. 35, s. 1. As to the 3rd and 4th grounds of appeal—(a) “s. 902 (2)
was a bar to the present indictment;” (b) “the accused was entitled to
succeed on his plea of autre fois acquit pursuant to s. 907.”—The
meaning of s. 907, may be gathered from the use of the word “lawfully” in s.
906 (3), this expresses what has been well understood for many years viz. that
the defence of autre fois acquit applies only where the first trial has
been concluded by an adjudication: Reg. v. Charlesworth, 121 E.R. 786; Rex
v. Ecker, 64 O.L.R. 1. Here, the only adjudication was against the accused
for manslaughter and that adjudication was merely set aside by the first order
of the Court of Appeal. As to the first leg of s. 909 (2) “a previous
conviction or acquittal on an indictment for murder shall be a bar to a second
indictment for the same homicide charging it as manslaughter”. This must mean a
previous general conviction or acquittal.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1]
dismissing the appellant’s appeal from a conviction by a judge and jury for
manslaughter. The appellant had previously been indicted for murder and
convicted of manslaughter, but the conviction was quashed on appeal.[2]

G.A. Martin, K.C., and C.L. Dubbin, for
the appellant.

W.B. Common, K.C., and J.D. Bell, for the
respondent.

The dissenting judgment of the Chief Justice and
Taschereau J. was delivered by:—

TASCHEREAU J.:—The accused appellant was charged
with the murder of his wife and his trial took place at the City of
St. Thomas in the County of Elgin, in March, 1949. He was acquitted of the
charge of murder but convicted of manslaughter.

[Page 415]

The Court of Appeal of the Province of Ontario
allowed the appeal, and set aside the conviction for manslaughter on the ground
of misdirection by the trial judge. The Court however, did not direct a new
trial, but in their reasons for judgment, Laidlaw and Hogg JJ. both made the
emphatic statement that the accused was not acquitted. Mr. Justice
Henderson, who also heard the case, was of the opinion that the appeal should
be dismissed.

The reason for not ordering a new trial is that
on a count charging murder, no count charging any other offence may be joined. (Cr.
Code, sec. 856). The contention is that if the Court of Appeal had
ordered a new trial, although manslaughter is an included offence in a count of
murder, the accused would have had to face a second time an indictment charging
murder, an offence of which he had previously been acquitted. (Cr. Code 951,
para. 2). Vide: (Rex v. McDonald,[3];
Rex v. Anthony,[4]; Rex
v. Pascal,[5], Part
XX, 849).

A new indictment charging manslaughter was
therefore preferred by the Crown, and before Mr. Justice Schroeder and the
jury, the appellant pleaded “autrefois acquit”, submitting that the
Order of the Court of Appeal which did not direct a new trial, had the effect
of an acquittal. A jury having been sworn dismissed this contention of the
appellant following in this, the direction of the trial judge. The jury then
found the accused guilty of manslaughter and he was sentenced to 10 years in
penitentiary. The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed his appeal.

It is now submitted before this Court that the
accused, having once before been tried for murder arising out of the same
homicide, and convicted of manslaughter, could not again be tried for
manslaughter, because that conviction had been set aside by the Court of
Appeal, which did not direct a new trial. It is claimed that he cannot be put
twice in “jeopardy” for the same matter, and that, under the provisions of
section 909, para. 2, his first acquittal on the indictment for murder, is
a bar to a second indictment for the same homicide charging it as manslaughter.

It is an elementary principle of criminal law
that when an accused charged of a crime has been convicted or acquitted by a
jury, he cannot be charged a second time for

[Page 416]

the same crime, and it is also clear that if on
a charge of murder, an accused is acquitted and not found guilty of
manslaughter, he cannot foe charged of manslaughter, because under the
provisions of section 907, para. 2, Cr. Code, the accused might on
the former trial have been convicted of manslaughter, and this is obviously a
bar to a new charge of manslaughter.

But in the present case, the accused was
acquitted of murder and found guilty of manslaughter, and the Court of Appeal,
although it found that there had been misdirection, did not acquit the
appellant. The Order of the Court was that the trial was not a fair one,
but the reasons of Laidlaw and Hogg JJ. clearly indicate that the accused was
not acquitted. The majority of the Court thought that a new trial could not be
ordered, but left it to the Crown to take the proper steps, if found opportune,
to bring the accused before the courts once more.

I had the advantage of reading the reasons for
judgment of my brother Fauteux, and I agree with him, that when the Court of
Appeal allows an appeal against a conviction, in a case like the one at bar, it
has only two alternatives. It may quash the conviction and direct a verdict of
acquittal, or direct a new trial, and it is only when one of these two courses
has been followed that it may make such other order as justice requires.
It is however imperative and not only permissive, that there
should be an acquittal or that a new trial should be directed.

I entertain no doubt that the Court of Appeal
had power by virtue of section 1014 (3) of the Cr. C., after
having quashed the conviction, to direct a new trial limited exclusively to the
charge of manslaughter. This would have clearly been an order authorized by the
concluding part of section 1014 (3) Cr. C.

But the Court of Appeal did not give such an
order, with the result, that the accused has neither been acquitted nor convicted,
and as there was no jurisdiction upon this Court to apply the proper remedy, it
necessarily follows that for all practical purposes the first indictment cannot
be acted upon any further. These proceedings have come to an end, as there can
be found nothing in the law to authorize the revival of this first trial.

[Page 417]

I fully concur in the view expressed that the
only competent authority, in a case of misdirection, to order a new trial
is the Court of Appeal, but I do not agree that the failure by the court to
make such an order had the effect of precluding the Crown from exercising its
rights to prefer a fresh bill of indictment under 873 Cr. C. as it has
been done in the present case.

The proceedings under the fresh bill of
indictment do not constitute a new trial, within the meaning of
section 1014; they initiated a second trial, entirely independent
of the first, on a new indictment. “A new trial” which alone the Court
of Appeal has the power to order in a criminal prosecution, is the re-examination
of a case on the same information or indictment. It supposes a
completed trial, which for some sufficient reason has been set aside, so that
the issues may be litigated de novo. It is ordered so that the court may
have an opportunity to correct errors in the proceedings at the first trial.

But such is not the case here, and unless there
are valid reasons to prevent the Crown to initiate a second trial as it
did, this appeal must fail. We have to decide if the incomplete judgment given
by the Court of Appeal, is a bar to the exercising by the Crown of its
unquestionable power to prefer a bill of indictment.

A solid ground of defence would undoubtedly be a
plea of “autrefois acquit” or “autrefois convict”, but I am
satisfied that this cannot be successfully argued. The appellant has neither
been acquitted nor convicted, and it is only in such cases that an accused may
say, if he is brought to trial again on the same charge, that he has been in
“jeopardy” twice. As Chief Justice Latchford said in Rex v. Ecker and Fry[6] (at page 3):—

This Court was of the opinion that “in
jeopardy twice”—the bis vexari of the legal maxim—has not the meaning of
subjection twice to a trial for the same offence except in cases where the
first trial has been concluded by an adjudication or judgment declaring the
accused acquitted or convicted. Not otherwise could the plea of autrefois
acquit or autrefois convict prevail.

I fully agree with this statement of the law,
and I may add that there are a great number of cases, where accused have
undergone second trials, when it was established that the plea of “autrefois
acquit” or “autrefois convict” could not be successfully raised. The
law does not allow that a

[Page 418]

man be tried a second time when he has already
been convicted, or exposed to be convicted, when he has already been legally
acquitted, but it does not forbid a second trial when the first did not come to
a legal conclusion.

Only the pleas of “autrefois acquit” or “autrefois
convict” could be successfully raised by the appellant in the present case,
and as they both fail, the appeal should be dismissed.

KERWIN J., dissenting:—By leave granted under
subsection 1 of section 1025 of the Criminal Code as enacted
by section 42 of chapter 39 of the Statutes of 1948, the accused, Welch,
appeals against a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing his
appeal against his conviction for manslaughter. He had been previously
convicted of manslaughter after his; trial upon an indictment for murder,
arising from the death of the same person. The Court of Appeal allowed an
appeal against that conviction on the ground of misdirection of the jury by the
trial judge. The terms of that order and the reasons therefor are succinctly
set forth in the following extract from the reasons of the Chief Justice of
Ontario for the decision now appealed against:—

In his reasons for judgment in disposing of
the appeal, Mr. Justice Laidlaw, referring to the jury’s verdict of guilty
of manslaughter, said “That verdict, having been reached after such
misdirection, is not a valid conviction and must be set aside. At the same
time, I make it clear that the accused has not been acquitted of the offence of
manslaughter and I express no opinion as to what further proceedings the Crown
can or ought to take against the appellant in the particular circumstances.”
Mr. Justice Hogg, who concurred in setting aside the conviction said “I
agree with the observations made by my brother Laidlaw that the appellant has
not been acquitted of the crime of manslaughter.” Mr. Justice Henderson,
who, with Mr. Justice Laidlaw and Hogg, made up the Court that heard the
appeal, was of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. The formal
certificate of the Court’s order, after a recital, was in these words, “This Court
did order that the said appeal should be and the same was allowed and that the
said conviction should be and the same was vacated and set aside.”

A new indictment charging manslaughter was
preferred and upon his arraignment the accused pleaded autrefois acquit. On
the trial of that issue, the jury on the judge’s instruction found against the
accused. He thereupon pleaded not guilty but was convicted and sentenced to ten
years’ imprisonment. The appeal to the Court of Appeal

[Page 419]

followed, and, upon the affirmance of the
conviction, leave to appeal was granted. The points upon which that leave was
granted are set forth in the appellant’s factum as follows:—

(a) The accused having once before been
tried for murder, arising out of the same homicide, and convicted of
manslaughter, and whose conviction had been set aside by the Court of Appeal,
could not again be tried for manslaughter without a formal order of the Court
of Appeal directing a new trial.

(b) The accused was entitled in answer to
the present indictment to the common law defence that a man should not be put
twice in jeopardy for the same matter.

(c) Section 909 (2) of the Criminal
Code was a bar to the present indictment.

(d) The
accused was entitled to succeed on his plea of autrefois acquit pursuant
to Section 907 of the Criminal Code.

It was argued that the Court of Appeal had no
power merely to set aside the first conviction and that, therefore, its order
must be taken to be an acquittal of manslaughter under the indictment for
murder. That argument is based upon the provisions of subsection 3 of
section 1014:—

3. Subject to the special provisions
contained in the following sections of this Part, when the court of appeal
allows an appeal against conviction it may

(a) quash the conviction and direct a
judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered; or

(b) direct a new trial;

and in either case may make such other
order as justice requires.

The contention is that when the Court of Appeal
allows an appeal against conviction it must either (1) formally allow the
appeal; and (2) quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of
acquittal to be entered; and (3) make such other order as justice requires; or
(1) formally allow the appeal; and (2) direct a new trial; and (3) make such
other order as justice requires. The argument amounts to a contention that if
the Court merely allows an appeal and quashes the conviction, the case falls
within the first alternative. To that argument I am unable to accede. While
some plausibility is lent to it by the expression “in either case”, the power
given to the Court of Appeal is permissive as is indicated by the use of the
word “may” and includes the power to allow an appeal and set aside a conviction
leaving the Crown free to prefer a new and different indictment, if it sees
fit.

[Page 420]

The powers of the Court of Appeal are not
circumscribed as are those of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England and the
decisions of that Court are, therefore, of no assistance on the point under
review.

On the reargument of this appeal before the full
Court, a discussion took place as to the powers exercised in England before
1904 of granting a writ of venire de novo and as to the powers of a
Court of Error. I have considered these arguments and the practice and law
prevailing as to each of these matters and particularly the two cases in New
South Wales referred to, Rex v. O’Keefe[7],
and Rex v. Lee[8], but
have been unable to gain any assistance from any of these in coming to a
conclusion. This appeal is to be decided under the provisions of the Criminal
Code.

In Rex v. Pascal[9], the Court of Appeal for British Columbia,
by a majority, followed the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal on the
first appeal by Welch to it[10].
Mr. Justice O’Halloran dissented and came to the conclusion that the
proper order to make in circumstances such as existed in that and the present
case was for the Court of Appeal, after setting aside the conviction, to direct
a new trial upon the charge of manslaughter, of which the accused had been convicted
and which conviction was set aside by the Court of Appeal. That learned judge
realized the difficulty in coming to that conclusion in view of the provisions
of section 909 (2) of the Code and of the obstacle of arraigning an
accused on the same indictment, but concluded that because of his view as to
the meaning of 1014 (3), the Court of Appeal had the power to direct a new
trial on the charge of manslaughter since, while by section 856, to a
count in an indictment charging murder, no count charging any other offence
shall be joined, 951 (2) provides:—

2. On a count charging murder, if the
evidence proves manslaughter but does not prove murder, the jury may find the
accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, but shall not on that
count find the accused guilty of any other offence.

With respect I am unable to agree with
Mr. Justice O’Halloran’s view of section 1014 (3) and in my opinion
the proper course to follow is that adopted by the Ontario

[Page 421]

Court of Appeal and followed by the British
Columbia Court of Appeal. Section 873 (1) is then wide enough to permit
the preferring of a bill of indictment for manslaughter. In provinces where
there is no grand jury, subsequent subsections of section 873 take
care of the situation. It may be that in some cases, if an accused is charged
with murder and convicted of manslaughter and this conviction is set aside,
then, on a new indictment for manslaughter, the accused might be found by the
second jury not guilty of manslaughter but guilty of some included offence.
This, in my opinion, is not an objection either to what I deem is the proper
construction of section 1014 (3) or to the possibility of the accused
being found guilty of such included charge which would not have been possible
under the first indictment for murder. That possibility does not alter my view
as to the correct interpretation of section 1014 (3) nor, in the event of
that occurring, would it place an accused in double jeopardy since, on the
first indictment, he could not have been found guilty of such included charge.

It was also argued that what the Court of Appeal
did was based upon its former decisions in Rex v. MacDonald[11], and Rex v. Antony[12], and that these are in conflict with the
decision of this Court in Gudmondson v. The King[13]. As appears from an examination of the
case and factums in that case, the accused had asked that his conviction be
quashed and a new trial not ordered. This Court was not prepared to say that a
verdict of acquittal should be entered and, as the point now under discussion
was not argued or considered, the decision cannot be taken as being in conflict
with the orders made by the Court of Appeal in the cases mentioned.
Furthermore, a mere reading of the reasons for judgment on Welch’s first appeal
shows that the Court did not direct a verdict of acquittal. This disposes of
the first ground of appeal.

As to the second ground, it is sufficient to
point out that former jeopardy is not a plea or defence as the maxim nemo
debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa, or as it is sometimes expressed, nemo
debet bis puniri pro uno delicto, is merely the basis for the plea of autrefois
acquit. ‘“The plea of autrefois acquit is grounded on this maxim,

[Page 422]

that a man shall not be brought into danger of
his life for one and the same offence, more than once.” Hawkins’ Pleas of
the Crown, 8th ed. vol. II, c. 35, s. 1.

The third and fourth grounds may be considered
together. Sections 905 to 908 inclusive of the Code deal with the special
pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict. The meaning and
effect of section 907, referred to by the appellant, may be better
gathered from the use of the word “lawfully” in subsection 3 of
section 906.

3. In any plea of autrefois acquit or
autrefois convict it shall be sufficient for the accused to state that
he has been lawfully acquitted or convicted, as the case may be, of the offence
charged in the count or counts to which such plea is pleaded, indicating the
time and place of such acquittal, or conviction.

This expresses what has been well understood for
many years, viz., that the defence of autrefois acquit applies only
where the first trial has been concluded by an adjudication: Reg. v. Charlesworth[14], Rex v. Ecker[15]. Here, the only adjudication was against
the accused for manslaughter and that adjudication was merely set aside by the
first order of the Court of Appeal. Nor is the appellant assisted by the first
leg of subsection 2 of section 909 upon which he relies:—

A previous conviction or acquittal on an
indictment for murder shall be a bar to a second indictment for the same
homicide charging it as manslaughter.

This must mean a previous general conviction
or acquittal. The appellant does not, of course, contend that he was convicted
and, as the Chief Justice of Ontario points out, the suggestion that he was
acquitted is precisely the same contention advanced in support of the plea of autrefois
acquit.

The appeal must be dismissed.

The judgment of Rand, Kellock, Estey, Locke,
Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:—

FAUTEUX
J.:—This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of
Ontario (Robertson C.J.O., Laidlaw and Roach JJ.A.)[16] dismissing, on March 17, 1949, an appeal
from the conviction of the appellant on a charge of manslaughter. The appellant
had been previously tried on an indictment for murder, arising

[Page 423]

from the death of the same person. Upon this
first trial, the jury brought in a verdict of manslaughter. An appeal from this
conviction was allowed under section 1014, on the ground of misdirection.
The formal certificate of the Court’s order, after a recital, is in these
words:—

This Court did order that the said appeal
should be and the same was allowed and that the said conviction should be and
the same was vacated and set aside.

In his reasons for judgment, Laidlaw J.A., with
reference to the jury’s verdict of “guilty of manslaughter” said:—

That verdict having been reached after such
misdirection is not a valid conviction and must be set aside. At the same time,
I make it clear that the accused has not been acquitted of the offence of
manslaughter and I express no opinion as to what further proceedings the Crown
can or ought to take against the appellant in the particular circumstances.

Concurring in setting aside the conviction, Hogg
J.A., said:—

I agree with the observations made by my
brother Laidlaw that the appellant has not been acquitted of the crime of
manslaughter.

Henderson J.A., expressed the opinion that the
appeal should be dismissed.

No direction was then made by the Court of
Appeal either to enter a judgment and verdict of acquittal or for a new trial.
The Court of Appeal did not in either respect exercise its authority under
section 1014 (3). Confronted with this situation, the Crown first moved to
appeal this judgment to this Court but, for reasons of jurisdiction, leave was
refused.

It was in these circumstances that a fresh bill
of indictment charging the appellant with manslaughter was subsequently
preferred by the Crown under the provisions of section 873 of the Criminal
Code. A true bill was found by the grand jury, the appellant was brought to
trial and, eventually, found guilty of the offence charged. His appeal against
this conviction was unanimously dismissed by the judgment now before us for
review.

As a new trial was not directed by the first
judgment of the Court of Appeal, it is manifest that the sub stratum of
jurisdiction for all the proceedings leading to the conviction of the appellant
and eventually to the present appeal can stem only from this fresh bill of
indictment preferred under section 873 in the circumstances above

[Page 424]

related. In the present instance, this question
of jurisdiction is twofold. Once the appeal is allowed for misdirection and the
conviction is quashed by the Court under section 1014, is the statutory
authority vested in the Court of Appeal to direct a verdict of acquittal to be
entered or to direct a new trial, mandatory or simply permissive? And if this
authority is mandatory, can another trial,—notwithstanding the express lack of
direction for a new trial by the judicial body solely empowered to make it,—be
had by resorting to the provisions of section 873?

Dealing with the first point. The relevant
provisions of section 1014 were enacted by Parliament in 1923 (13-14
George V, chap. 41, s. 9). They read:—

1014.

3. Subject to the special provisions
contained in the following sections of this Part, when the Court of appeal
allows an appeal against conviction it may

(a) quash the conviction and
direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered; or

(b) direct a new trial;

and in either case may make such other
order as justice requires.

The corresponding section of the English
Criminal Appeal Act of 1907 (7 Edward VII, c. 23, art. 4) from which the above
were taken reads:—

4. (2) Subject to the special provisions of
this Act, the Court of Criminal Appeal shall, if they allow an appeal against
conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal
to be entered.

The above juxtaposition of the two sets of
provisions makes it clear that the differences between them, as well as the
different manner in which each is set up, are attributable to the existence of
an alternative course,—a new trial,—which our Courts only, in a proper case,
must, as I propose to show, direct. That in the process of thus amending our
law, the indented letter (a) has been misplaced before the words “quash the
conviction and”, rather than being properly placed after them, cannot alter the
true meaning and the only possible construction of the section. For it is clear
that if the appeal against a conviction is allowed, of necessity the conviction
must be quashed. No other purpose can be served by the allowance of the appeal.
And it is then, and then only, that

[Page 425]

the occasion to exercise the further statutory
authority related to the election between a verdict of acquittal or a new
trial, may arise.

That there will be cases where the Court of
Appeal will not order one or other of the alternatives is certain. Thus a
conviction on an indictment signed by an unauthorized person cannot be
sustained and must be quashed. And in such a case, an order, either directing a
verdict of acquittal to be entered or a new trial, would be meaningless and
senseless. It cannot, therefore, be stated that this further authority is given
with respect to trials affected with such complete and fatal nullity. On that
point, our law is not at variance with the law in England even if, in the
relevant provisions of the latter, the word “shall” and not the word “may” is
used to govern the construction of the statutory power (Crane v. Director of
Public Prosecutions[17], Brodie
v. Rex[18].) In
like cases, the accused, having never been in peril of conviction, could not
subsequently if and when validly indicted, plead autrefois acquit on the
occasion of a trial which, if truly the second in fact, would be the first in
law.

However, in a case where the appeal is allowed
on ground of misdirection and the conviction is quashed, then necessarily
arises the occasion to exercise the further statutory authority. In England,
the Court of Appeal, having no power to direct a new trial, “shall” then direct
a verdict of acquittal to be entered,—”even though the prisoner be clearly
guilty”.—(Kenny, Outlines of Criminal Law, 13th Ed., foot note page
500). In Canada, the Court of Appeal must equally exercise the further
statutory power and order, either a verdict of acquittal to be entered, or
direct a new trial. For, until such an order is made, there is still pending
before the Court of Appeal a valid indictment upon which there is no final
adjudication. And the very procedure to that end is provided for. The accused,
for one, has, in such circumstances and under our law, a clear and
unimpeachable right to such judicial pronouncement with respect to the election
between two courses,—one of which resulting in his acquittal,—on the sole and
very basis of the case as then under review and that, according to well
established principles.

[Page 426]

The expression “may” related to this further
authority of the Court is not and cannot, in the context of the
section read in the light of paramount principles of our criminal
procedure, be permissive. It is mandatory. In M’Dougall v. Patterson[19], it was held that

* * * when a statute confers
an authority to do a judicial act in a certain case, it is imperative on those
so authorized to exercise the authority, when the case arises and its exercise
is duly applied for by a party interested, and having the right to make the
application. For this reason, we are of the opinion that the word “may” is not
used to give a discretion but to confer a power upon the Court and Judges and
that the exercise of such power depends, not upon the discretion of the Court
or Judges, but upon the proof of the particular case out of which such power
arises.

That a like reasoning and meaning is to obtain
with respect to the same word “may” in the last member of this
section clearly stems from the context “and in either case may make such
order as justice requires”. For new and extraordinary would be a rule of
construction stating that, being empowered to make an order required by
justice, a Court of justice would be free to refrain from making it when the
occasion to do so arises. In Reg. v. Bishop of Oxford[20], it was held that

so long ago as the year 1693 it was decided
in the case of R. v. Barlow[21], that
when a statute authorizes the doing of a thing for the sake of justice or the
public good, the word “may” means “shall” and that rule has been acted upon to
the present time * * * .”

With like powers, or rather duties, I fail, I
must say with deference, to appreciate the alleged obstacles standing in the
way of the Court of Appeal to exercise its authority if, as suggested, the
majority judges wanted to direct a new trial only on this sole undisposed of
part of the indictment, that is, the lesser charge of manslaughter. Legal and
sufficient it would have been to direct a new trial on the offence of
manslaughter exclusively and to further order that the original indictment of murder
be, to that end, amended. Thus, on this new trial, the accused could only be
found guilty or not guilty of manslaughter. The language of the statute is
broad enough to embrace the authority to make such “other order”, if the
justice of the case suggests no other. And I know of no principles of law which
could have then been violated by such order. I must, therefore, conclude that

[Page 427]

the exercise of the statutory authority given to
the Court of Appeal, under section 1014 (3), to direct an acquittal to be
entered or to direct a new trial and in either case, to make such other order
as justice requires, is not permissive but mandatory.

Dealing with the second point, the Court having
failed to exercise its authority in the first appeal and having refrained from
directing a new trial by a judgment which, though substantially incomplete,
remains undisturbed, could another trial be had by resorting to
section 873?

It cannot be disputed that, had either one of
the courses, which the Court of Appeal was bound to direct, been directed, this
fresh bill of indictment would never have been preferred in fact. And never
then could, in law, a fresh bill of indictment be authorized under
section 873. For on the one hand, the entry of a verdict of acquittal by
the Court of Appeal would have brought the case to an end.

On the other hand, had the Court of Appeal
directed a new trial, a fresh bill of indictment could no more, in law, have
been preferred. For such a course would have subjected the order of the Court
to the finding of a true bill by a grand jury. On a new trial being ordered,
the accused is not even required to plead. The trial proceeds immediately on
the original or amended indictment.

These considerations suffice to indicate that,
general and unrestricted as they may appear, the powers under section 873
are not absolute and cannot obtain in all circumstances. Like many others in
the Code, they remain subject to qualifications and restrictions implicitly and
necessarily flowing from other provisions in the same Act.

Again, the relevant provisions of
section 873 were enacted much before those of section 1014 (3)
and then, not in relation to the latter. It cannot be contended, therefore,
that they were meant, when enacted, to provide a mode of redress,—left,
furthermore, at the discretion of the Attorney General or of the trial
Judge,—against the failure of a Court of Appeal,—a higher authority,—to comply
with the imperative provisions of section 1014 (3).

Our criminal law clearly prescribes two methods
leading to the holding of a trial. One is by way of an information

[Page 427]

or complaint and the other is by way (in the
province of Ontario) of a preferred bill of indictment. There are no other
methods.

Whatever be the method adopted if on a valid
indictment, the trial proceeds, with no defect as to jurisdiction, to verdict
and judgment, then the procedure provided by the law for the trial of that
issue,—or included issues,—is exhausted and the trial is brought to an end,
unless there is an appeal. The legislature does not, in addition to the above
procedure, contemplate or authorize,—either by laying another information or
complaint, or preferring another bill of indictment under 873,—such a thing as
the actual holding of another trial on the same issue, or included issues,
parallel to or independently of the first trial and irrespective of the
juridical consequences developing and rights accruing thereby to either of the
parties, according to law in the course of the latter. For such duplication
would, to say the least, render one course futile. So if a trial has been had
following the laying of an information, the provisions of section 873
could have no application with respect to the issue, or included issues,
therein.

If, the case being concluded in first instance,
there is an appeal, for the same reason, like duplication of the procedure
cannot obtain. And the matter must, from then on, be considered in the light
only of the provisions relating to the appeal.

The right of appeal is an exceptional right. That
all the substantive and procedural provisions relating to it must be regarded
as exhaustive and exclusive, need not be expressly stated in the statute. That
necessarily flows from the exceptional nature of the right.

In Craies, on Statute Law, 4th Edition,
p. 236, it is stated:—

In Viner’s Abr. (m) the
following rule is laid down: “Every statute limiting anything to be in one
form, although it be spoke in the affirmative, yet includes in itself a
negative”; and in Bacon’s Abr. (n), the rule given is, that “if an
affirmative statute which is introductive of a new law direct a thing to be
done in a certain way, that thing shall not, even if there be no negative
words, be done in any other way.”

In Rex v. Howell[22], an accused person was charged with an
indictable offence and when brought before the Magistrate, the latter failed to
state to him the matters

[Page 429]

required by the then section 778,
subsection 2, of the Code. The accused having elected for a summary trial
was found guilty but on appeal the conviction was set aside. Cameron J.A. said
in part:—

Though ss. 2 of sec. 778 of the Criminal
Code, as it now stands, amended by 8 & 9, Ed. VII, c. 9, is
affirmative in form, it must be treated as implying a negative on the principle
that “if an affirmative statute which is introductive of a new law directs a
thing to be done in a certain way, that thing shall not, even if there be no
negative words, be done in any other way.”

It was for the Court of Appeal acting under the
powers vested in it by subsection 3 of section 1014 to direct a new
trial and not for counsel for the Crown, with the consent of the learned trial
judge, or for the Attorney-General, to decide that there should be a second
trial for the same offence. When the accused was arraigned before Mr. Justice
Schroeder, counsel on his behalf contended that, in the absence of an order for
a new trial made by the Court of Appeal, the accused could not be tried again
for the same offence. As for the reasons above expressed, I think a new trial
for the same offence was, in the absence of such an order, prohibited by the
statute, effect should have been given to this objection. I express no opinion
upon the other grounds of appeal which were argued before us.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and
direct the discharge of the accused.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Appeal from Summary Conviction
under an order adjudging sum of money to be paid into Court—Whether condition
precedent to right of appeal met, where appellant prior to date fixed for
payment, deposits with the Court the amount fixed by it to cover costs of
appeal.—The Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1927, c. 36, s. 750(c), as amended by 1947,
c. 55, s. 23. Husband and Wife—Summary Proceedings for Maintenance—The
Deserted Wives’ and Children’s Maintenance Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 211.

[Page 382]

The Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1927, c.
36, s. 750(c) as enacted by S. of C., 1947, c. 55, s. 23, provides
that an appellant, if the appeal is from an order whereby a penalty or sum of
money is adjudged by a justice to be paid, shall within the time limited for
filing the notice of intention to appeal, in cases in which imprisonment in
default of payment is not directed, deposit with such justice an amount
sufficient to cover the sum so adjudged to be paid together with such further
sum as such justice deems sufficient to cover the costs of the appeal.

On Feb. 17, 1948 the deputy judge of the
Family Court of Toronto under the Deserted Wives’ and Children’s Maintenance
Act, R.S.O., 1937 C. 211, ordered the appellant to pay his wife at
the said Court the sum of $15 per week for her support, the first weekly
payment to be made on March 1. On Feb. 24 appellant paid to the Court the sum
of $25 as security for the costs of an appeal to the County Court, the amount
fixed by the Court as such security, and on Feb. 26 served and filed notice of
appeal.

His appeal to the County Court was dismissed
on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, and an application for an order of
mandamus made to the Supreme Court of Ontario was refused by a judge of that
court and on appeal by the Court of Appeal, on the ground that the provisions
of s. 750(c) of the Criminal Code were not complied with.

Held: that at
the time the appellant served and filed his notice of appeal there was no “sum
of money adjudged to be paid” and the appellant had done all that was required
of him in order to vest jurisdiction in the County Court.

Held: also,
that the appeal should be allowed, the order below set aside and a writ of
mandamus directed to be issued to the County Court to proceed with the hearing
of the appeal.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario dismissing appellant’s appeal from the judgment of Smiley J.
who refused appellant’s application for an order of mandamus directing a judge
of the County Court to hear appellant’s appeal from an order of the Toronto
Family Court directing payment by the appellant of the sum of $15 per week for
the support of his wife.

H. Gordon Webb in person for the
appellant.

No one appearing for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice, Kerwin, Rand
and Estey JJ. was delivered by:

KERWIN J.:—On February 17, 1948, the Deputy
Judge of the Family Court for the City of Toronto ordered Doctor Harry Gordon
Webb to pay his wife “at the Family Court, 90 Albert Street, in the City of
Toronto, the sum of $15 per week for the support of the wife of the said Dr.
Harry Gordon Webb, the first weekly payment to be made

[Page 383]

on the 1st day of March, 1948.” The order was
made under the Deserted Wives’ and Children’s Maintenance Act, R.S.O.
1937, chapter 211. On February 24, 1948, Webb paid to the Family Court $25 as
security for the costs of an appeal to the County Court (the amount fixed by
the Family Court Judge as such security), and on February 26 served and filed
notice of appeal. A County Court Judge decided, purporting to follow the
decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Johnson v. Johnson[1], that the County Court had no jurisdiction
to entertain the appeal.

Webb thereupon applied for an order of mandamus
directing a judge of the County Court to hear and determine the appeal. This
application was dismissed by Smiley J., as was also an appeal to the Court of
Appeal. In each case the application was refused on the ground that the
provisions of section 750(c) of the Criminal Code as enacted
by section 23 of chapter 55 of the Statutes of 1947 were not complied
with. Under the Deserted Wives’ and Children’s Maintenance Act, proceedings
are to be in accordance with the provisions of the Ontario Summary
Convictions Act, R.S.O. 1937, chapter 136. By virtue of section 13 of
the latter, an appeal is given in such a case as this to the County Court, and
by section 3, certain sections in Part XV of the Criminal Code, including
section 750(c) shall apply mutatis mutandis.

The only decision besides the Johnson case
referred to, so far as we are aware, was Fink v. Fink[2] There Kellock J.A., with whom
Gillanders J.A. agreed, decided that the giving of a cheque was not a “deposit”
but he did not determine whether the “amount sufficient to cover the sum so
adjudged to be paid” would be the sum of $7, which was the only sum falling due
to be paid under the order of the magistrate at the time notice of appeal was
given, or the amount of all payments that would fall due under the order between
its date and the date upon which the notice of appeal was returnable, or some
other amount. I do not read the judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario as
deciding anything beyond that except to point out that it was generally
considered that compliance with section 750(c) was a condition
precedent. At that time that part of section 750(c), dealing with
appeals in cases where

[Page 384]

imprisonment in default of payment is not
directed, provided for the entering into a recognizance as an alternative to
the payment of the deposit. In the Johnson case, which was an
application for prohibition, which on appeal came before the Ontario Court of
Appeal, that Court granted an order of prohibition where cheques had been given
instead of cash. By that time the section as we now have it had been
enacted omitting the provision for entering into a recognizance.
Notwithstanding this alteration, the question left open in the Fink case
was still undecided.

It is now necessary to decide the precise point.
The matter does not lend itself to extended discussion but a reading of the
whole of section 750(c) satisfies me that the appellant had done
all that was required of him in order to vest jurisdiction in the County Court.
Section 750(c) as enacted in 1947 reads as follows:—

(c) the appellant, if the appeal is
from a conviction or order adjudging imprisonment, shall either remain in
custody until the holding of the court to which the appeal is given, or shall
within the time limited for filing a notice of intention to appeal, enter into
a recognizance in form 51 with two sufficient sureties before a county judge,
clerk of the peace or justice for the county in which such conviction or order
has been made, conditioned personally to appear at the said court and try such
appeal, and to abide the judgment of the court thereupon, and to pay such costs
as are awarded by the court or enter into a recognizance so conditioned and
make such cash deposit in lieu of sureties as the justice may determine; or if
the appeal is from a conviction or order whereby a penalty or sum of money is
adjudged to be paid, the appellant shall within the time limited for filing the
notice of intention to appeal, in cases in which imprisonment upon default of
payment is directed either remain in custody until the holding of the court to
which the appeal is given, or enter into a recognizance in form 51 with two
sufficient sureties as hereinbefore set out, or deposit with the justice making
the conviction or order an amount sufficient to cover the sum so adjudged to be
paid, together with such further amount as such justice deems sufficient to
cover the costs of the appeal; and, in cases in which imprisonment in
default of payment is not directed, deposit with such justice an amount
sufficient to cover the sum so adjudged to be paid, together with such further
amount as such justice deems sufficient to cover the costs of the appeal; and
upon such recognizance being entered into or deposit made the justice before
whom such recognizance is entered into or deposit made shall liberate such
person if in custody.

The part italicized deals with the situation
that confronted the present appellant. I cannot conceive that, if the appellant
had served and filed his notice of appeal and

[Page 385]

deposited the sum deemed sufficient by the
justice to cover the costs of the appeal, after one payment had fallen due
under the order, he would have been required to pay anything more than that one
payment. It might be, as in fact was the case, that some considerable time would
elapse before his appeal would be heard, and it could never have been the
intention that the appellant should make further deposits from time to time
until the appeal was heard. In my view, there was no
“sum * * * adjudged to be paid” at or before the time the
appellant served and filed his notice of appeal.

The appeal should be allowed, the order below
set aside and a writ of mandamus directed to be issued to the County Court to
proceed with the hearing of the appeal.

LOCKE J.:—I concur in the allowance of this
appeal and in the granting of a writ of mandamus.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Appeal—Special leave—Jurisdiction—Whether
statute giving new right of appeal is retrospective—New trial—Starting point of
proceedings—Same indictment—11-12 Geo. VI, c. 39, s. 42, enacting s. 1025 (1)
Criminal Code.

Held: The amendment to section 1025 (1) of the Criminal
Code, by which any person whose conviction on an indictable offence has
been affirmed by a Court of Appeal may, on any question of law, with special
leave granted by a judge, appeal to this Court, creates a new right of appeal
""which cannot be construed retrospectively so as to cover cases that arose
prior to the new legislation. (Boyer v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 89.)

[Page 353]

Held: Even though a new trial ordered by the Court of
Appeal was heard subsequent to the coming into force of the new legislation,
appellant cannot avail himself of the amendment as the new trial is not the
starting point of the proceedings—it is merely the reconsideration of the case
under the same indictment.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench,
appeal side, province of Quebec 1, dismissing appellant's appeal from his
conviction on a murder charge.

Valmore Bienvenue, K.C. for the appellant.

H. M. Loranger, K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by:

Taschereau, J.:
In September, 1947, the appellant was originally charged with the murder of
Marcel Boileau, and was found guilty in October of the same year. In September,
1948, the Court of King's Bench of the Province of Quebec (Appeal Division)
ordered a new trial which was held in November, 1948, and a second verdict of
murder was rendered by the jury. The Court of King's Bench (Appeal Division) 2
unanimously confirmed this finding in September, 1949.

Special leave to appeal to this Court was granted on the
21st day of October, 1949.

The respondent now raises the question of jurisdiction of
this Court and submits that the appellant, having been charged in September,
1947, is still subject to the law, as it existed at that time, and that he may
not therefore, even with the permission of one judge, appeal to this Court on a
question of law, as he would have the undisputable right, if the proceedings
had originated on or after the 1st of November, 1948, date on which the new
amendment came into force.

There can be no doubt that special leave to appeal granted
by a judge of this Court under the new amendment, on a question of law, does
not confer jurisdiction on this Court, if otherwise this jurisdiction does not exist.
Special leave to appeal is a condition precedent to the right to appeal, but
the latter is subordinate to the power

[Page 354]

of this Court to hear such an appeal. Moreover, I may add
that when the application for special leave was heard, the question of
jurisdiction of the Court was not raised.

Before the 1st of November, 1948, an accused person,
convicted of a crime, and whose conviction had been unanimously affirmed
by a Court of Appeal, could appeal to this Court by special leave, under
section 1025 of the Criminal Code, only when the judgment of the Court of
Appeal came in conflict with the judgment of any other Court of Appeal in a
like case. However, since the 1st of November, 1948, the law has been amended,
and now any person convicted of an indictable offence, whose conviction has
been affirmed by a Court of Appeal, may on any question of law, with special
leave granted by one judge, appeal to this Court. The jurisdiction of the Court
has thus been considerably extended.

When the appellant made his application for special leave,
he did not attempt to show that the judgment of the Court of Appeal conflicted
with the judgment of another Court of Appeal in a like case, but merely raised
questions of law which he argued, were sufficient under the new 'amendment to
allow his appeal to be heard by the full Court.

It is now said on behalf of the respondent that section 1025
of the Criminal Code as amended, applies only to proceedings that originated
after the 1st of November, 1948, and that in view of the unanimous judgment
of the Court of Appeal, it was imperative upon the appellant in order to obtain
special leave, to show the existence of a conflict.

With this proposition, I entirely agree, as I do not think
that the new amendment which creates a new right of appeal, can be construed
retrospectively, so as to cover cases that arose prior to the legislation. It
is true that the new trial was heard in November, 1948, at a date subsequent to
the coming into force of the new legislation, but this new trial ordered by the
Court of Appeal under the provisions of section 1014 of the Criminal Code, is
not the starting point of the proceedings. It is merely the reconsideration of
a case previously heard in October, 1947, which in the opinion of the Court of Appeal
had

[Page 355]

been illegally tried. The indictment is the same, and the
new trial is therefore the continuation of proceedings started prior to the new
amendment.

In the case of Boyer v. The King 3,
the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal was given on the 30th of
November, 1948, one month after the coming into force of the amendment. On
behalf of the appellant it was argued that the judgment of the Court of Appeal,
being posterior to the new legislation, he could take advantage of the amendment
and obtain leave to appeal on a question of law. The Chief Justice 3,
after consultation with all the members of this Court, held that the amendment
created a new right of appeal, and had no retroactive effect. It therefore did
not apply to pending cases, which, in the view of the Chief Justice, continued
to be governed by the former ss. 1 of s. 1025 Cr. C.

I fail to see how the present case can be distinguished from
the Boyer case, and I would therefore quash the appeal for want of
jurisdiction.

Appeal quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Murder—Trial by jury—Misdirection—Pleas of self-defence,
provocation and drunkenness—Onus probandi—Reasonable doubt—Evidence—Use of word “establish” in charge is potentially
dangerous—Intent in drunkenness—Criminal Code, ss. 263,
1025(1).

Appellant was convicted of
murder after a trial by jury. He had pleaded self-defence, provocation and
drunkenness. His appeal was unanimously dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

Held: The appeal should be
allowed and a new trial ordered.

Held: That, when dealing with the
specific pleas of self-defence and provocation, there was a grave departure by
the trial judge from the general principles he had laid down in the opening
part of his charge with respect to the burden of proof—using the word “establish” in such a way that the
jury could reasonably understand it to mean “if it was established by the accused”—and that it was never
stated to the jury, either expressly or by clear implication, that, if they
were in doubt as to whether the act was provoked, it was their duty to reduce
the offence from murder to manslaughter.

Held: A direction to the jury
(which could reasonably be, by them, related to the accused) that, if on one
point they found the evidence of a witness to be deliberately untrue, they could
not believe him in any other particular, was a misdirection of a most serious
nature and tantamount to an encroachment upon the right of full answer and
defence.

Held: The validity of the defence
of drunkenness is dependent upon the proof that the accused was at the time of
the commission affected by drunkenness to the point of being unable to form not
any intent but the specific intent to commit the crime charged.

Held: As it is the duty of a
juror to disagree if unable conscientiously to accept the views of his
colleagues, it is wrong in law to tell the jury that they “must agree upon a verdict”.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing appellant’s appeal from his conviction by a
judge and jury on a charge of murder.

Lacourcière and R.H. Frith for the appellant.

The
judgment of the Court was delivered by



FAUTEUX
J.:—The appellant has been
convicted, in the city of Sudbury, in the province of Ontario, of the murder of
the wife of his first cousin, one Cécile Rainville. His appeal against such
conviction was unanimously dismissed by the Court of Appeal, the reasons for judgment
reading:



After
listening to the able and elaborate argument addressed to us, we are quite
unable to find anything in what has been adduced, which would warrant our
interfering with the verdict of the jury. There is nothing to be gained by
going over, one by one, the items so ably put before us but the facts in this
case are overwhelming and, in view of the findings of the jury and the
interpretation they put upon them, there is nothing to be said. The appeal will
be dismissed.



Pursuant
to section 1025(1), 1948 ch. 39 s. 42 of the Criminal Code, leave
to appeal was granted on the following points of law: (a) Misdirection
of the trial judge as to the onus probandi. (b) Lack of adequate
direction with respect to the benefit of reasonable doubt on every issue raised
in the defence (Latour v. The King)[1] (c) Misdirection in
the following instructions to the jury:—



Should
you come to the conclusion that any witness came here and told something that
he knew was not true, that would be tantamount to perjury, and anybody who
gives evidence that was not true in any one instance, could not be believed in
any other particular.



and (d)
Failure of the trial judge to relate to the specific crime charged, the
rule as to intent applicable in the defence of drunkenness.



At the
close of the argument, the Court indicating that reasons for judgment would be
delivered later, allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and ordered a new
trial. In view of this order, only such circumstances as are necessary for the
determination of the questions raised will be referred to.



On the
morning of September 12, 1949, the appellant, both hands badly bleeding, was
seen by the landlady and another tenant of the building, leaving the apartment
occupied by his cousin Peter Rainville, the deceased Cécile Rainville, and her
brother Alexander Verdon. After a short visit to the home of some friends, to
wash his hands, he immediately proceeded to the police department where he
reported that he had been in a fight and, from there, was escorted to the
hospital where he received








[Page 21]



surgical
attendance on his injuries on both hands. Meanwhile, the police, alerted by the
landlady of the apartment, proceeded thereto and found the body of the
deceased, bearing some thirty-two wounds; they also found a knife admittedly
identified as belonging to the appellant and a coat the latter had borrowed
from Verdon. As to what took place in the apartment, there is no evidence but
the incomplete account—hereinafter referred to—given by the appellant
himself; the evidence of the landlady and of the other witness on the point
throws little or no light. The theory submitted to the jury by the Crown was
that the appellant, well aware of the absence of both his cousin and the
brother of the victim, Verdon, visited the apartment that morning for the
purpose of having carnal knowledge with the victim and that, when she refused,
he stabbed her with his knife. It was conceded that there is no evidence in
point of an assault prompted by such motives nor of any prior guilty passion by
the accused towards the deceased. The evidence reveals that the appellant, a
bushman, was, on the day of the fatal occurrence, terminating, in the city of
Sudbury, a two-weeks vacation during which, being on good terms with the
Rainvilles, he freely visited their home. The appellant testified that the
return of the coat of Verdon was the purpose of his visit to the apartment on
the morning of the 12th. He relates the following facts: Having delivered the
coat, he was departing from the apartment when the deceased invited him to
stay, sit and talk and, eventually, proposed to have sexual relations with him.
He says that he then scolded her and told her he knew much of how she was
carrying on. It may be pointed out here that independent evidence shows that
the day before, the appellant having, in the presence of Peter Rainville and
Verdon, made unfavourable remarks as to the moral conduct of the deceased,
Verdon became angry and left the company in protest. There is no evidence,
however, that these remarks of the appellant were subsequently conveyed to the
victim either by her husband or by Verdon. The appellant testified that the
victim became incensed and told him he knew too much of her past and that she
then drew a knife from behind her back and went to stab him. He protected

[Page 22]










himself
with his hands but being then stabbed and by reason of the combined effect of
the stabbing, of pain in his hands and of two weeks of persistent drinking, he
said he lost his head and does not recall what happened from that moment, up to
time he was washing his hands at the home of their common friends. He further
denied having brought the knife with him suggesting the deceased must have
taken it from his room, which she visited with him two days before, for the
purpose of looking over some old family pictures. The occurrence of this visit
is corroborated by an independent witness. On the basis of these facts, pleas
of self‑defence, provocation and drunkenness were advanced on behalf of
the appellant, and with respect to each of these pleas, the jurors received
from the trial judge instructions which must now be considered conjunctively
with the above grounds of appeal.



Dealing
with grounds (a) and (b). The principles of the criminal law as
to the onus probandi and the benefit. of the doubt being substantially
correlated in their application, the merits of the first two grounds of appeal
may, in this case, conveniently be dealt with together.



In the
early part of his charge the trial judge, before entering upon the discussion
of the facts of the case and before any reference whatever to the pleas of
self-defence, provocation and drunkenness, and to the different verdicts
resulting respectively therefrom, properly charged the jury as to the burden of
the proof and the benefit of the doubt, making his own the following words of
Viscount Sankey, Lord Chancellor, in Woolmington v. Director of Public
Prosecutions[2], particularly at page 94:—



…it is not until the end of
the evidence that a verdict can properly be found and that at the end of the
evidence, it is not for the prisoner to establish his innocence but for the
prosecution to establish his guilt. Just as there is evidence on behalf of the
prosecution, so there may be evidence on behalf of the prisoner which may cause
a doubt as to his guilt. In either case, he is entitled to the benefit of the
doubt. It must be kept in mind that while the prosecution must prove the guilt
of the prisoner, there is no such burden laid upon the prisoner, to prove his
innocence and it is sufficient for him to raise a doubt as to his guilt. He is
not called upon to satisfy the jury of his innocence.



And he
further instructed the jury with respect to circumstantial evidence, giving
them the rule formulated

[Page 23]










by
Baron Alderson in the Hodge[3] case. No complaint is made
as to the way in which these matters were explained as general principles in
criminal law. It is complained, however, that, when he later dealt with the
pleas of self-defence and of provocation, there was a grave departure by the
learned trial judge from the general principles he had laid down with respect
to the doubt, he entirely failed throughout the charge to direct the attention
of the jurors, in their consideration of the plea of provocation, to their
duty, to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt, if any, in favour of the
lesser charge of manslaughter. The following excerpts from the charge, fairly
representing the substance of the directions with which the jury was left in
the matter, are impeached by the appellant as casting the burden of proof upon
him and, therefore, as being in violation of the principles laid down
particularly in the Woolmington case. As to the plea of self-defence, the trial
judge said, at page 407 of the record:



It
is for the jury to say whether or not the necessary facts have been established
to warrant a plea of self-defence.



and as
to the plea of provocation, he said, at page 413:



The
doctrine is that an unlawful killing resulting from a deliberate act of
violence is prima facie murder but that, if it is established that the
accused acted under a certain set of conditions which were such as to deprive
an ordinary person of the power of self-control, that presumption is rebutted
and the killing is only manslaughter.



On
behalf of the respondent, it was pointed out that the trial judge did not say “established by the accused” but simply “established” and then argued that no
burden was consequently cast upon the appellant to prove the ingredients
necessary to a plea of self-defence or to a plea of provocation as had been
explained to the jury. In the circumstances of this case, the jury, in my view,
could only, or to say the least, could reasonably understand the directions as
if it had, in effect, been said: “if
it was established by the accused”
for, in this case, it is virtually only from the account given by the appellant
of what took place in the apartment between himself and the victim, that the
proof of the ingredients necessary to each defence could, if at all, be found.
It is on that view that the legality

[Page 24]



of the
instructions must be considered for, in Bigaouette v. The King[4], Duff J., as he then was,
delivering the judgment for the Court, stated at page 114:



The
law, in our opinion, is correctly stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice
Stuart in Rex v. Gallagher, in these words:



…it is not what the judge
intended but what his words as uttered would convey to the minds of the jury
which is the decisive matter. Even if the matter were evenly balanced, which I
think it is not, and the language used were merely just as capable of the one
meaning as the other, the position would be that the jury would be as likely to
take the words in the sense in which it was forbidden to use them as in the
innocuous sense and in such circumstances I think the error would be fatal.










It is
suggested, on behalf of the appellant, that according to the dictionary, the
word “establish” means “place beyond dispute.” (Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary, 3rd edition, page 684). On that basis, it would then appear
sufficient to substitute these words to the word “establish” to conclude that, had it been said:



It
is for the jury to say whether or not the necessary facts have been placed
beyond dispute by the accused to warrant a plea of self-defence.



or had
it been said with respect to the plea of provocation:



…if it is placed beyond
dispute by the accused that he acted under a certain set of conditions…



the two
directions, standing alone, would have been palpably wrong, for the law only
requires that the evidence in the record,—introduced by the Crown or the
defence, it does not matter—be sufficient to raise in
the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused acted in
self-defence or under provocation.



In
judicial proceedings, the word “establish” is correlated to the
burden of the proof but to the burden of the proof not in the sense of the
necessity there may be for an accused in the course of the enquête to introduce
evidence in order to explain away the case being made by the Crown, but in the
sense of the permanent and paramount obligation there is for the Crown, at the
end and on the whole of the case, to have proved the guilt beyond all
reasonable doubt.



In
Phipson on Evidence, 8th edition, it is stated at page 27:



As
applied to judicial proceedings, the phrase “burden of proof” has two distinct and
frequently confused meanings: (1) The burden of proof as a matter of law and
pleading—the burden, as it has been
called, of

[Page 25]



establishing
a case, whether
by preponderance of evidence, or beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) The burden
of proof in the sense of introducing evidence… So in criminal cases, even where the
second, or the minor burden of introducing evidence is cast upon or shifted to
the accused, yet the major one of satisfying the jury of his guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt is always upon the prosecution and never changes; and if, on
the whole case, they have such a doubt, the accused is entitled to the benefit
of it and must be acquitted.



(Mancini
v. D.P.P.[5]; Woolmington v. D.P.P.[6])










It is
clearly in relation to the “major burden,” it may be pointed out,
that the word “establish” is used by the House of
Lords in the above excerpt from the Woolmington case. In giving directions to
the jury, the use of the word “establish” in relation to the “minor burden” of introducing evidence,
is inadequate, confusing and potentially dangerous as it may, depending upon
the context or upon the whole charge and the nature and circumstances of the case,
lead the jury into error as to the plain nature of their duty with respect to
the most important feature of our criminal law, the paramount and permanent
burden of the Crown to establish ultimately its case beyond all reasonable
doubt. Not that it is suggested that the word “establish” is necessarily improper in all cases.
Used with proper qualifications, it has been approved—it was pointed out on behalf of the
respondent—in cases where a defence of
insanity is raised. This, however, affords no argument in favour of the latter’s views, for a defence of
insanity is a matter altogether different. In point of fact, the legislature
affirms a legal but rebuttable presumption against insanity. Section 18 of
the Criminal Code reads:



Everyone
shall be presumed to be sane at the time of doing or omitting to do any act until
the contrary is proved.



So,
there is, in such case, an obligation to prove or to establish the defence of
insanity even if it needs not be established beyond reasonable doubt but only
to the reasonable satisfaction of the jury. Smythe v. The King[7] No similar presumption
exists, however, with respect to the issue of self-defence or of provocation.
Even the presumption that everyone intends the natural consequences of his act
needs, in order to be rebutted, no more than evidence sufficient to raise a
doubt as to the intent.

[Page 26]










Nor is
it suggested that the use of the word “establish” will always be fatal in
all of the cases, for each case must be judged upon its merits but confusion in
words naturally, if not always, leads to confusion in ideas and, in the matter,
to confusion as to what the duty is. Again and in the case at bar, all what was
said as to the burden of proof and the benefit of reasonable doubt, has been
indicated above and was further stated as general principles in the earlier
part of a charge, necessarily lengthy, and long before any reference was made
to the special issues raised in the case, to the necessary ingredients thereof
and to the different verdicts resulting therefrom. But the principle that, if
the jurors were in doubt as to whether the act was provoked, it was their duty
to reduce the offence from murder to manslaughter, was never stated to them,
either expressly or by clear implication. In the case of Prince[8], the accused, charged with
murder, pleaded provocation. This was the only issue. A verdict of murder was
set aside for the following reasons stated by the Lord Chancellor at page 64:



We
think that the summing up was insufficient. Having regard to the absence of any
direction that, if upon the review of all the evidence, the jury were left in
reasonable doubt whether, even if the appellant’s explanation were not accepted, the
act was provoked, the appellant was entitled to be acquitted of the charge of
murder.



In the
case of Manchuk v. The King[9], the jury, while
considering the case, returned to Court to request the assistance of the
learned trial judge upon a difficulty which they explained in the following
question:



In
order to reduce a murder charge to a manslaughter charge, is it necessary to
establish the fact that the person killed committed the act of provocation?



At page
349, Sir Lyman Duff, the then Chief Justice of Canada, said:



The
terms in which the question is expressed manifest plainly that (notwithstanding
some observations in the earlier part of the charge as to the burden resting
upon the Crown up to the end of the case of establishing guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt) they had fallen into the very natural error of thinking that,
in proving the killing, the Crown had disposed of the presumption of the
prisoner’s innocence and that they
must find the prisoner guilty of murder unless he affirmatively established to
their satisfaction provocation in the pertinent sense. The interrogatory of the
jury ought to have been answered in such a manner as to remove this error from
their minds. It ought to have been made clear to them

[Page 27]



that
in the last resort the prisoner could not properly be convicted of murder if,
as the result of the evidence as a whole, they were in reasonable doubt whether
or not he was guilty of that crime.



On
behalf of the respondent, it was suggested that the general instructions given
at the beginning of the charge of the trial judge as to the burden of proof and
the doubt, were sufficient and that, as stated at page 280 in the Mancini case
(supra):



There
is no reason to repeat to the jury the warning as to the reasonable doubt again
and again, provided that the direction is plainly given.



It is
not difficult to agree with this sentence from the Mancini case but it
is impossible to accept that in the charge made in the present case, the
pertinent direction was “plainly given.”



In Albert
Edward Lewis[10], Avory J., as he then was,
stated, at page 34:










The
importance of telling the jury that the burden has not shifted is probably
greater in a case in which the defendant goes into the witness-box (as the
appellant did) than in one in which he does not. The jury not unnaturally are
apt to think that when a defendant goes into the witness-box the burden is on
him to satisfy them of his innocence.



While
one may regard the direction given with respect to the plea of self-defence as
being less questionable because of the general instructions given in the
earlier part of the charge, the impeached direction with respect to the plea of
provocation, coupled with the complete lack of direction as to the duty of the
jury to give the benefit of the doubt, if any, on the issue raised and bring a
verdict of manslaughter instead of a verdict of murder, leaves no doubt, I must
say with deference, that the jury was not instructed according to law. For,
once properly instructed as to what the law recognizes as ingredients of
self-defence or of provocation, the accurate question for the jury is not
whether the accused has established such ingredients but whether the
evidence indicates them. And they, then, must be directed that, should they
find affirmatively or be left in doubt on the question put to them, the accused
is entitled, in the case of self-defence to a complete acquittal, or in the
case of provocation to an acquittal of the major offence of murder.

[Page 28]



To
dispose of the third ground of appeal, it could be sufficient to say that, with
natural fairness, it was conceded by Mr. Common, K.C., of counsel for
respondent, that it was a misdirection to instruct the jury in the following
terms:



Should
you come to the conclusion that any witness came here and told something
that he knew was not true, that would be tantamount to perjury and anybody who
gives evidence that was not true in any one instance, could not be believed in
any other particular.



And it
could be added that this Court, in Deacon v. The King[11], approved, at page 536,
what had been said by Riddell J. in Rex v. Kadeshewitz[12], when the latter refused
to accept, as being the law in Canada, the following summarized statement, the
substance of which is attributed to Lord C.J. Hewart in the case of Harris[13]:



If
a witness is proved to have made a statement, though unsworn, in distinct
conflict with his evidence on oath, the proper direction to the jury is that
his testimony is negligible and that their verdict should be found on the rest
of the evidence.










But to
examine in a proper light the ultimate suggestion made on behalf of the
respondent that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice resulted from
such misdirection, it is further convenient to consider two questions: To which
of the witnesses heard in this case such warning could reasonably be related by
the jury, and, then, what effect, if any, it could have in the result.



The
facts, proof of which was material to the case of the Crown—the death of Cécile
Rainville, the violent cause of her death, and the author of her death,—were not virtually disputed
by the appellant who, by his very testimony, assumed the task of explaining
them away in relating what, according to him, took place between him and the
victim in the apartment, for the advancement of his pleas of self-defence and
of provocation. At the end of the case, the veracity and the credibility of the
accused really turned to be the crucial point for the decision of the case.
Naturally, any direction in this respect would particularly and at first be
applied to the accused by the jury. Furthermore, the manner and the measure in
which the appellant was cross-examined by the Crown Attorney and the trial
judge as well, could only add to the natural disposition of

[Page 29]



the
jury to relate the misdirection to him. Throughout the address to the jury, the
instructions with respect to the special pleas advanced, were either prefaced
or followed by the caveat: “If
you accept the testimony of the accused.” To be virtually directed that, if on
one point, they found his evidence deliberately untrue, they could not believe
him in any other particular, was a misdirection of a most serious nature as, if
the condition on which rested the direction was found to exist, the jury was
then instructed to entirely disregard the whole defence. To say that, in the
circumstances of this case, this misdirection could be tantamount to an
encroachment upon the right of full answer and defence, would not be an
extravagant statement.










Dealing
now with the last ground of appeal. It was formulated orally in the course of
the argument, leave to do so being then granted upon the consent of the Crown,
and in view of the importance of the case. The grievance is that the trial
judge failed to direct the jury that the validity of the defence of drunkenness
is dependent upon the proof that the accused was, at the time of the
commission, affected by drunkenness to the point of being unable to form not
any intent but the specific intent to commit the crime charged in this case,
the crime of murder, or the lesser crime of manslaughter. As it turned out,
this ground was not pressed in the argument and, for this reason, its merits
will not be discussed. As there will be a new trial, it may be pertinent to say
a word on this and another matter. The rules of law for determining the
validity of the defence of drunkenness have been stated, in the two following propositions,
by Lord Birkenhead, in the Beard case[14]:



That
evidence of drunkenness which renders the accused incapable of forming the specific
intent essential to constitute the crime should be taken into consideration
with the other facts proved in order to determine whether or not he had this
intent.



That
evidence of drunkenness falling short of a proved incapacity in the accused to
form the intent necessary to constitute the crime, and merely
establishing that his mind was affected by drink so that he more readily gave
way to some violent passion, does not rebut the presumption that a man intends
the natural consequences of his acts.



Reference
may equally be had to the judgment of this Court in MacAskill v. The King[15]

[Page 30]



The
other matter in which comments may be added, although the point was not raised
by the appellant, is related to the following direction given to the jury:



This
is an important case and you must agree upon a verdict. This means that you
must be unanimous.



This is
all that was said on the subject. If one of the jurors could have reasonably
understood from this direction—and it may be open to such
construction—that there was an obligation
to agree upon a verdict, the direction would be bad in law. For it is not only
the right but the duty of a juror to disagree if, after full and sincere
consideration of the facts of the case, in the light of the directions received
on the law, he is unable conscientiously to accept, after honest discussion
with his colleagues, the views of the latter. To render a verdict, the jurors
must be unanimous but this does not mean that they are obliged to agree, but
that only a unanimity of views shall constitute a verdict bringing the case to
an end. The obligation is not to agree but to co-operate honestly in the study
of the facts of a case for its proper determination according to law.










In the
presence of the misdirections above discussed, their gravity and their combined
effect, I am unable to say that the respondent has affirmatively shown that
there was, in the result, no substantial wrong and that justice was done
according to law. And, as above indicated, the judgment rendered by the Court
is that the appeal is allowed, the verdict of murder is quashed and a new trial
is ordered.

Appeal allowed and new
trial directed.

PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Murder—Evidence—Defence of denial and of
alibi—Charge of trial judge—Misdirection—Non-direction—Substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice—Accomplices—Corroboration—Evidence of previous
offence—Interference with cross-examination of witness—Circumstantial

Code, ss. 259, 263, 1014(1) (2), 1023, 1025.

[Page 116]

Appellant was convicted of murder after a trial by jury. His
defence was a denial that he had anything whatever to do with the matter. He
testified that he was not at the time of the crime with the deceased and the
three principal Crown witnesses as to all of whom it was open to the jury to
take the view that they were accomplices. His conviction was affirmed by the
Court of Appeal.

The Crown called evidence in rebuttal of statements made by a
defence witness in the absence of the accused contradictory of the evidence
given by such witness at the trial. The trial judge not only failed to explain
to the jury that such contradictory statements were no evidence of the truth of
the facts stated therein and must be considered solely as a test of the
credibility of such witness, but gave the jury to understand that this rebuttal
evidence had evidentiary value and might be regarded by them as corroborative
of the evidence of the alleged accomplices. Held: that, particularly as
the trial judge had failed to instruct the jury that before evidence can be
considered as corroborative within the meaning of the rule requiring
corroboration of the evidence of an accomplice it must tend to show not merely
that the crime has been committed but that the accused committed it, such
non-direction and misdirection were fatal to the validity of the conviction.

Crown counsel, in re-examination of a Crown witness, for the
purpose of refreshing his memory, read to him from the transcript of his
evidence at the preliminary hearing and elicited evidence that the accused had
made a threat to such witness including a statement which would lead the jury
to believe that on another occasion the accused had shot another person. Held:
that, following the King v. Laurin, the deposition should not
have been read to the jury. Quaere: Whether under the circumstances of
the case it was permissible to refer to the deposition at all for the purpose
of refreshing the memory of the witness. Held further: The trial judge
should have, in this case, in the exercise of his discretion, excluded any
evidence indicating that the accused had made such a statement, even though it
might have been relevant to the issue of the guilt or innocence of the accused
as being evidence of an attempt, on his part, to suppress evidence by means of
a threat; it was wrong to admit such evidence which was highly prejudicial to
the accused and in this case had substantially no probative value. (Noor Mohamed
v. The King; Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions and Rex
v. Shellaker referred to.)

Held: The interference of the trial judge with the
right of the defence to cross-examine one of the Crown witnesses (a right
included in the right to make full answer and defence any improper interference
with which will usually be a sufficient ground for quashing a conviction) did
not produce any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in the particular
circumstances of this case.

Held: The trial judge should have followed the usual
practice of indicating to the jury the nature of the evidence in support of the
alibi and telling them that, even if they were not satisfied that the alibi had
been proved, if the evidence in support of it raised in their minds a
reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt it was their duty to acquit him.

[Page 117]

Held: The evidence as to the cause of the victim's
death being largely circumstantial, the jury should have been directed that if
and in so far as they based their verdict on circumstantial evidence, they must
be satisfied not only that those circumstances were consistent with the accused
having killed him but also that they were inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion. (Hodge's case).

Held: Once this Court reaches the conclusion, on one or
more of the points properly before it, that there has been error in law below,
it is unfettered in deciding what order should be made by the views expressed
in the Court of Appeal. Therefore, the argument, that the jurisdiction of this
Court in criminal matters being limited to questions of law and the court
appealed from having held that notwithstanding certain errors in law at the
trial there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, such decision
being on a question of fact or of mixed fact and law cannot be reviewed in this
Court, is not entitled to prevail. (Brooks v. The King; Stein v. The
King; Bouliane v. The King; Schmidt v. The King and Chapdelaine
v. The King referred to).

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming the conviction of the
appellant, before a judge and jury, upon a charge of murder.

Alexandre Chevalier K.C. for the appellant.

Noel Dorion K.C. and Paul Miquelon K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Cartwright J.:—This
is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal
Side) of the Province of Quebec 2, pronounced on the 5th day of May, 1950,
affirming the conviction of the appellant upon a charge of having ""in the
night of the 14th to the 15th of June, 1947, with other persons to be later
identified killed and murdered Gérard Beaumont.""

The appeal comes before us pursuant to an order of the Chief
Justice of Canada pronounced on the 22nd day of May, 1950, granting the
appellant leave to appeal to this court upon the following grounds.

(1) the illegal admission of
rebuttal evidence presented by the Crown for the alleged sole purpose of
attacking the credibility of a defence witness by the name of Hamel which
rebuttal evidence consisted in proof

[Page 118]

(2) of a previous
contradictory statement made by the witness Hamel in the presence of the
witnesses heard in rebuttal but in the absence of the Petitioner Lizotte and
the failure of the trial Judge to explain to the jury that the said rebuttal
evidence purported to be exclusively a test of the credibility of the said
witness Hamel;

(3) the illegal admission of
a proof of character of the Petitioner by the illegal introduction in the
evidence before the jury in the re-examination of one Maurice Légaré of the
previous testimony of the said Légaré at the time of the preliminary inquiry
which previous testimony included an alleged statement in the presence of
Légaré that the Petitioner had previously shot somebody and would be able to shoot
another person;

(4) the illegal refusal by
the trial Judge to permit the defence to establish in cross-examination of Mrs.
René Boivin that the said Mrs. Boivin was greatly antagonistic and entertained
a spirit of revenge against the Petitioner on account of previous testimonies
by the Petitioner against the husband of the said Mrs. René Boivin in some
previous cases before the Courts;

(5) the error of the trial
judge in his instructions to the jury in failing to direct the jury relatively
to the proof of alibi and to the question of the benefit of the doubt in
connection with this defence; the failure of the trial judge to instruct the
jury that the Crown must prove not only the death of the victim but also that
the death was caused by the accused considering that there was in the record no
scientific or other proof of the cause of the death of Gérard Beaumont nor of
the time of the said death;

(6) the failure of the trial
judge to instruct the jury concerning circumstantial evidence that such
evidence must be not only compatible with the guilt of the accused but
incompatible with his innocence.

On the afternoon of the 14th of June, 1947, Gérard Beaumont
left his home at St-Gérard Majella intending to

[Page 119]

go by motor-bus to the City of Quebec. He was apparently in
good health and sober and was said to have with him approximately forty dollars
(although it is questionable whether this last mentioned fact was proved by any
admissible evidence).

On the 22nd of June, 1947, the body of Beaumont was observed
floating in the St. Charles River. A police officer brought the body to shore
by the use of a rope with a brick attached. An inquest was held but there was
no autopsy. The body was already in a state of decomposition. It was said by
some of the witnesses that there were marks on the forehead of the victim. A
verdict of death from drowning was returned.

The accused was arrested on the 26th of November, 1948. At
the trial three witnesses Maurice Légaré, Vallières and Demers gave evidence
which, while containing a number of contradictions and differences in matters
of detail some of which were of importance and some comparatively trifling, was
in substantial agreement as to the broad outlines of the case on which the
Crown relied. Their account of what occurred may be briefly summarized as
follows.

At about eleven o'clock on the night of June 14, Légaré,
Vallières and Demers were together at or near a bus terminal in Quebec and were
intending to return to the place where they were working at Rivière aux Pins in
a taxicab driven by the accused. Before leaving they were in conversation with
the deceased who said that he was going to return by motor-bus. The witness,
Demers, says that Lizotte said to the deceased ""No, you are coming with
us"" and that some of them pushed him into the car. Before leaving the city
they stopped and Légaré purchased some bottles of beer. They continued on their
way and drank some of the beer in the car. Légaré and the deceased, who had had
some of the beer, began to quarrel in the back seat. Légaré said to the chauffeur ""arrête, on va
régler cette affaire-là drette icitte."" The chauffeur stopped the car.
Légaré and Beaumont got out of the car. After getting out of the car, Légaré struck
Beaumont twice on the head with a beer bottle and Vallières struck him once.
Beaumont fell to the ground. At this point Lizotte is said

[Page 120]

to have taken hold of Beaumont by the hair, to have struck
him in the face with his fist and to have kicked him in the face. Thereafter
they put Beaumont back into the rear of the car on the floor and drove off.
They stopped for gasoline at the garage of Jean Paul Hamel at St. Gérard Majella
as to which a little more must be said later. They then drove away towards
Quebec on the Forty Arpents road. At a lonely spot on the road they stopped,
took Beaumont out of the car, removed most of his clothes, took the money from
his pockets and divided it amongst the accused, Légaré and Vallières. They put
Beaumont back in the car and then drove on and stopped at a point near le
Remous des Hirondelles on the St. Charles River. At that point Lizotte is said
by Vallières and Légaré to have taken Beaumont out of the car and dragged him
away in the direction of the river. According to Demers, Lizotte, Vallières and
Légaré went away together dragging Beaumont. Demers says that at this point
Lizotte threatened him, seizing his neck-tie and saying:—""Ti-blond, tu vas
m'aider ou tu vas mourir, la même chose, toi aussi."" Demers says that he
refused to help saying he would as soon die. Demers says that when Lizotte, Vallières
and Légaré returned to the car he asked what they had done with Beaumont and
Lizotte, Vallières and Légaré said ""Il recommence à revenir, il reprend sa
connaissance, que le diable l'emporte, il s'en ira tout seul.""

It is said that the accused then drove Demers, Vallières and
Légaré back to Rivière aux Pins arriving there about five o'clock in the
morning of Sunday, June 15, 1947.

It should be emphasized that the above is but a brief
outline of the main points of the narrative contained in the evidence of
Demers, Vallières and Légaré which occupied some hundreds of pages in the
transcript and contains numerous points of disagreement.

Evidence was given that the accused did not return the taxi
to the garage of his employer, Madame Boivin, until the morning of Tuesday,
June 17, that the seat-covers had then been removed and that he told Madame
Boivin that he had removed them because they were dirty.

[Page 121]

The theory of the Crown appears to be that Beaumont died
either as a result of the blows or kicks given to him by the accused or as a
result of being thrown into the river by the accused, while still alive.

The defence is a denial that the accused had anything
whatever to do with the matter. The accused gave evidence. He denied that he
was with the deceased, Légaré, Vallières or Deniers on the night in question.
Evidence was given by his wife and sister-in-law that during the month of June,
1947, which his wife claims to remember particularly well as she was expecting
shortly to give birth to a child, the accused never came into the house at
night later than midnight except on one occasion when he came in about 1.30
a.m.

The first ground of appeal arises out of the following
circumstances. The Crown witnesses, Demers, Vallières and Légaré stated, as
mentioned above, that after Beaumont had been assaulted and put back in the
car, the accused remarked that he was running short of gasoline and drove to
the gas station of Jean Paul Hamel at St-Gérard Majella, arriving there about 2
o'clock in the morning, that they had to wait for some little time but that
Hamel finally came down and supplied them with some gasoline and that they then
drove away.

Hamel, called as a witness for the defence, testified that
he had not served Lizotte or any of the other witnesses with gasoline on the
night in question and he went on to state that he could not have done so as he
did not have any gasoline during the month of June. The defence called one
Georges Marchand an employee of the Imperial Oil Company who said that that
company had supplied Hamel with gasoline in the years 1946 and 1947 but had not
supplied him with any between the month of November, 1946 and the 28th of June,
1947. In rebuttal the Crown called one Joseph Légaré who testified that he had
supplied Hamel with a total of ten barrels of gasoline containing 45 gallons
each during the months of May, June and July, 1947. During Hamel's
cross-examination he was asked whether he had had conversations with three
persons, Eugene Rivard, Lucien Falardeau and Germaine Beaumont (Dame Lucien
Falardeau). Hamel was asked

[Page 122]

whether Rivard had come to his store during the night of the
15th to the 16th of June, 1947, apparently to get gasoline. Hamel said that
Rivard had come but he thought that it was on the previous night, and that he
had not come out nor had he served Rivard with gasoline. He
was asked whether he had had a conversation with Rivard a few days later and
had said to him, referring to his visit just mentioned: ""Pourquoi
ne vous êtes-vous pas nommé des fois qu'il vient des jeunes qui sont chauds,
qui font du train"", ou encore ""généralement des jeunes qui viennent
la nuit, qui font du train la nuit, j'aime pas ça et si vous vous étiez nommé
je vous aurais servi?"" Hamel admitted having had a conversation with
Rivard but denied having used the words mentioned. Rivard was called in
rebuttal and deposed to the words which Hamel had used. These words were
identical in meaning with those which had been put to Hamel. Hamel was asked in
cross-examination whether on or about the 22nd of June, 1947, he had had a
conversation with Lucien Falardeau, a brother-in-law of Beaumont. The question was then put to him: ""Quelques
jours après la disparition de
celui qui serait son beau-frère aujourd'hui et que vous lui aviez dit ceci:
'Que vous trouviez ça effrayant la disparition de Gérard et que dans la nuit du
samedi, samedi en question, 14 au 15 juin, vous lui aviez dit qu'il était venu en
taxi, vous aviez cru entendre sa voix, la voix de Gérard?'"" Hamel denied having made any such statement. In
rebuttal Lucien Falardeau deposed that Hamel had said to him speaking of the
deceased: ""Bien, il m'a dit qu'il était allé un char, le samedi qu'il
était disparu, pour avoir du gaz. Il m'a dit 'J'ai cru que Gérard
était dans le char'."" Hamel was asked in
cross-examination in regard to Madame Falardeau: ""Vous
rappelez-vous d'avoir rencontré madame Falardeau, soeur de Gérard Beaumont, quelques jours après la disparition
de son frère ou après qu'on eut repêché le cadavre de son frère et lui avoir
dit à peu près ceci, et je cite: 'Je sais qu'il est venu un taxi pour avoir du
gaz, ils ont cogné pas mal longtemps, j'ai vu que c'était des gars pour avoir
du gaz, j'ai descendu et je leur en ai donné. J'ai jeté un coup d'oeil dans la
machine puis j'ai cru que c'était Gérard qui était étendu dans le fond de la
machine, à terre,

[Page 123]

puis il y avait du sang dans la machine, oui
ou non avez-vous dit ça à madame Falardeau?"" Hamel denied having
made such a statement. Madame Falardeau was called in rebuttal but just after
the question had been put to her as to what statement, if any, Hamel had made
to her, she was apparently taken ill in the witness box and the matter was not
further pursued.

What is here complained of is not the admission of the
evidence of Rivard and Lucien Falardeau as to the statements contradictory of
his evidence in chief which Hamel is alleged to have made to them or of the
evidence of the witness Jos. Légaré as to his having
supplied gasoline to Hamel but the complete failure of the learned trial judge
to explain to the jury that the contradictory statements were no evidence of
the truth of the facts stated therein but must be considered solely as a test
of the credibility of the witness Hamel. It is said that, far from giving the
jury any such direction, the learned judge gave them to understand that this
rebuttal evidence had evidentiary value and could be regarded by the jury as
corroboration of the evidence of Légaré and Vallières,
whose evidence was clearly that of accomplices, and of the evidence of
Demers as to which the learned trial judge, in my opinion properly, told the
jury that they might or might not regard it as being that of an accomplice.

At the conclusion of the argument, in the absence of the
jury, upon the trial judge ruling that the rebuttal evidence tendered was
admissible, counsel for the accused said: ""Alors, je croirais qu'il faudrait que vous expliquiez aux jurés qu'il s'agit de la crédibilité
d'Hamel,"" and the learned trial judge replied ""Absolument.""
and after a short further discussion counsel for the accused said, ""Je
fais application pour que, dans votre charge, vous l'expliquiez bien.""

In charging the jury the learned trial judge dealt fully
with the danger of convicting an accused upon the uncorroborated evidence of an
accomplice or accomplices. His charge in this regard is not a subject of
complaint before us but the directions given in regard to the rebuttal evidence
must be considered in the light of what had been said on the matter of
corroboration and it is important to

[Page 124]

note that there was a complete failure to instruct the jury
that before evidence can be considered as corroborative within the rule it must
be evidence which tends to implicate the accused, or, as it is often put, it
must be evidence which tends to show not merely that the crime charged has been
committed but that the accused committed it.

The effect of this rebuttal evidence was dealt with by the
learned trial judge in the following passages in his charge to the jury:

Il y a aussi le fait du voyage du retour et de
ce qui s'est passé à Québec, vous vous demanderez s'il n'y a pas certains faits
que ces trois témoina rapportent qui ne sont pas corroborés par des témoins
étrangers. Vous vous demanderez ensuite ce qui s'est passé chez Hamel dans la
nuit, et là, vous aurez à examiner si ce témoin dit la vérité, et si vous en
venez à la conclusion que réellement il y a eu arrêt chez Hamel, vous aurez là
une corroboration d'une partie importante des témoignages
de Légaré, Vallières et Demers.

* * *

C'est un incident assez important, c'est un
fait matériel, que s'il était prouvé, et c'est à vous à décider s'il est
prouvé, servirait à corroborer pour partie la version des trois témoins de la
Couronne.

* * *

Si vous en venez à la conclusion que Hamel n'a
pas dit vrai, vous avez là une corroboration du témoignage des trois témoins de
la Couronne, pour ce fait qui se serait passé entre le prétendu assaut et entre
le temps ou à Québec où le corps aurait été jeté à l'eau. Car lorsqu'on aurait
pris de la gazoline chez Hamel, la victime dans ce temps-là aurait été
assaillie et aurait été dans le fond de la voiture.

In my view there was both non-direction and misdirection as
to the purpose and effect of the rebuttal evidence.

In dealing with the second ground of appeal mentioned above,
it is first necessary to state briefly what occurred at the trial. Towards the
end of the examination in chief, by counsel for the Crown, the witness, Maurice
Légaré was asked the following questions and made the
following answers.

Q. Maintenant, monsieur Légaré, après que ça a
été fait, avez-vous recontré Roger Lizotte dans la suite?

R. Oui.

Q. Combien de temps après et où l'ayez-vous
rencontré?

R. Quinze jours, trois semaines après.

Q. A quel endroit?

R. Chez Omer Daigle.

Q. A-t-il été question de cette affaire-là?

R. Oui.

Q. Qu'est-ce qui s'est dit à ce propos-là?

R. Je m'en rappelle pas.

[Page 125]

Q. Vous en a-t-il parlé, lui?

R. Je sais qu'il m'a dit de fermer ma gueule.

Q. A-t-il ajouté d'autre chose?

R. Il dit: si tu fermes pas ta gueule, il y a
de quoi qui est dangereux.

Q. Y a-t-il eu d'autre chose de dit?

R. Je m'en rappelle pas.

The examination in chief concluded shortly after this and
was followed by a lengthy cross-examination in which the witness was asked
nothing whatever in regard to this particular incident. At the conclusion of
the cross-examination counsel for the Crown re-examined the witness on certain
matters which had arisen in the course of the cross-examination, and when he
had reached the end of this reexamination asked the court's permission to
examine on a matter which did not arise out of the cross-examination. Counsel
indicated that he wished to refer the witness to certain statements made by him
at the preliminary enquiry for the purpose of refreshing his memory. Counsel
for the defence objected on the ground that the evidence proposed to be given
would be inadmissible as constituting evidence of the bad character of the
accused. After some argument, the learned trial judge decided to permit the
re-examination. His grounds for so doing are stated in the following words:

Il n'est pas question d'un fait; il est
question d'un aveu, d'une déclaration de l'accusé. C'est différent entre
prouver un fait et une déclaration. Il y a une grosse différence. Je vais
permettre la question, mais seulement M. Dorion, complétez, s'il y a lieu, la
déclaration d'aveu que vous entendez établir, jusqu'à preuve du contraire.

The jury was brought back into the court room and the
transcript continues as follows:

Q. Monsieur Légaré, pour revenir à ces propos
qu'aurait tenus Lizotte chez Daigle, auxquels vous avez référé hier dans votre
examen en chef, vous rappelez-vous qu'il en a été question également à
l'enquête préliminaire devant l'Honorable Juge Pettigrew, alors que je vous
interrogeais?

R. Oui, monsier.

Q. Vous rappelez-vous que je vous ai posé la
question, à la page 115 …

LA COUR: Avant, demandez lui ce qu'il a
déclaré.

Me NOEL DORION, c.r.

Q. Quelle est la déclaration que vous avez
faite à l'enquête prélimi-que j'ai ici à la page 115 de l'enquête préliminaire.

R. Je ne me rappelle pas.

Q. Si vous ne vous en souvenez pas, je vais
vous lire la déclaration que j'ai ici à la page 115 de l'enquête préliminaire.

Q. Qu'est-ce que Lizotte a dit? racontez çà à
la Cour?

[Page 126]

R. Il a dit: ""Si tu fermes pas ta gueule,
je vais faire comme j'ai déjà fait à un autre."" avez-vous dit cela à
l'enquête préliminaire?

R. Oui, monsieur.

Q. Et ce que vous avez dit à l'enquête
préliminaire, était-ce exact?

R. Oui, monsieur.

Q. Alors, est-ce qu'il a dit cela, oui ou non?

R. Oui, monsieur.

LA COUR:

Q. Vous vous en rappelez maintenant?

Oui, monsieur.

Me NOEL DORION, c.r.

Q. Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit qu'il ferait? Je vous
posais la question—et vous avez répondu: d'après l'enquête préliminaire:
""il a dit: 'J'en ai déjà tiré un, je suis capable d'en tirer un autre';
vous rappelez-vous avoir dit cela à l'enquête préliminaire?

R. Oui, monsieur.

Q. Ce que vous avez dit à l'enquête
préliminaire était-il exact là-dessus?

R. Oui, monsieur.

Q. Alors, est-ce vrai qu'il vous a dit celà à
cette occasion-là?

R. Oui.

It appears to me that the evidence quoted above offends the
well settled rule stated in the following words in the judgment of the Judicial
Committee in Noor Mohamed v. The King 3.

In Makin v. Attorney General for New South Wales (1894)
A.C. 57, 65, Lord Herschell L.C. delivering the judgment of the Board, laid
down two principles which must be observed in a case of this character. Of
these the first was that ""it is undoubtedly not competent for the
prosecution to adduce evidence tending to show that the accused has been guilty
of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment, for the purpose of
leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from his criminal
conduct or character to have committed the offence for which he is being
tried."" In 1934 this principle was said by Lord Sankey L.C., with the
concurrence of all the noble and learned Lords who sat with him, to be ""one
of the most deeply rooted and jealously guarded principles of our criminal
law"" and to be ""fundamental in the law of evidence as conceived in
this country."" (Maxwell v. The Director of Public Prosecutions 4
).

The rule just stated, is subject to the qualification also
stated in Makin's case that the mere fact that the evidence adduced tends to
show the commission of other crimes does not render it inadmissible if it be
relevant to an issue before the jury. It is urged that the evidence in question
was legally admissible and was relevant to the issue of the guilt or innocence
of the accused as being evidence of an attempt, on his part, to suppress
evidence by means of a

[Page 127]

threat. The Crown relies upon such statements as the
following: ""The presence or absence of facts showing (the accused's)
consciousness of having done the act may also be proved—e.g.,—the fabrication
or suppression of evidence."" Phipson on Evidence, 8th Edition at page 127.
There is a similar statement in Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Edition, vol. 2,
section 278. The principle on which such evidence is admitted is stated by
Phillimore J. in Rex v. Watt 5 It may be taken, I think,
to be the general rule that evidence may be given against a party in either a
civil or criminal case to show that he attempted to suppress evidence. It is
true that in the English cases cited in support of the rule proceedings were
actually pending at the time of the alleged suppression but there seems to be
no reason, in principle, for refusing to apply the rule to cases of attempts to
suppress evidence before any proceedings have been commenced. It is argued by
the Crown that had the witness Légaré given the evidence
objected to when he was first asked about his conversation with the accused it
would have been admissible under the principle just stated. It might be
sufficient for the disposition of this argument to point out that this did not
happen and that we are not concerned to discuss a situation which did not, in
fact, arise; but, since, in my view, there should be a new trial, I think it
desirable to state that, in my opinion, this is eminently a case in which the
learned judge presiding at the trial should, in the exercise of his discretion,
exclude any evidence indicating that Lizotte had made a statement which would
lead the jury to believe that on another occasion he had shot another person.
The rule which I think should guide the trial judge in regard to this matter is
referred to in the judgment of Isaacs C.J. giving the unanimous judgment of the
Court of Criminal Appeal, the other members of which were Channell, Bray, Avory
and Lush, JJ., in Rex v. Shellaker.6 At page
418, the learned Chief Justice refers to the class of cases ""in which,
though in strictness the evidence is admissible, the judge may be of opinion
that it is of so little real value and yet indirectly so prejudicial to the
prisoner, or that it

[Page 128]

is so remote, that it ought not to be given."" In Noor
Mohamed v. The King (supra) the
matter is put as follows at page 192.

It is right to add, however, that in all such cases the
judge ought to consider whether the evidence which it is proposed to adduce is
sufficiently substantial, having regard to the purpose to which it is
professedly directed, to make it desirable in the interest of justice that it
should be admitted. If, so far as that purpose is concerned, it can in the
circumstances of the case have only trifling weight, the judge will be right to
exclude it. To say this is not to confuse weight with admissibility. The
distinction is plain, but cases must occur in which it would be unjust to admit
evidence of a character gravely prejudicial to the accused even though there
may be some tenuous ground for holding it technically admissible. The decision
must then be left to the discretion and the sense of fairness of the judge.

I refer also to the same case at page 195.

… Their Lordships think that a passage from the judgment of
Kennedy J. in the well known case of Rex v. Bond, (1906) 2 K.B.
389, 398, may well be quoted in this connection: ""If, as is plain, we have
to recognize the existence of certain circumstances in which justice cannot be
attained at the trial without a disclosure of prior offences, the utmost
vigilance at least should be maintained in restricting the number of such
cases, and in seeing that the general rule of the criminal law of England,
which (to the credit, in my opinion, of English justice) excludes evidence of
prior offences, is not broken or frittered away by the creation of novel and
anomalous exceptions."" Their Lordships respectfully approve this
statement, which seems to them to be completely in accord with the later
statement of the Lord Chancellor in Maxwell's case (1935) A.C. 309, 320, when
he said ""It is of the utmost importance for a fair trial that the evidence
should be prima facie limited to matters relating to the transaction which
forms the subject of the indictment and that any departure from these matters
should be strictly confined."" They would regret the adoption of any
doctrine which made the general rule subordinate to its exceptions.

My reason for thinking that this evidence should have been
excluded, no matter when tendered, is that the statement, while calculated to
create a prejudice against the accused the extent of which could scarcely be
overestimated, has in the particular circumstances of this case substantially
no probative value. Evidence of a threat made by the accused for the purpose of
suppressing evidence, given by some independent witness, might, in a greater or
less degree, go to strengthen the jury's belief in Légaré's story
or to lessen their belief in that of the accused, but when the alleged incident
comes only out of the mouth of Légaré who had already
deposed to all the

[Page 129]

facts on which the Crown relied as establishing the guilt of
the appellant, its probative value seems to me to be very slight.

No permission to cross-examine Légaré was obtained nor was
he declared an adverse witness so that his statement made at the preliminary
hearing might be proved pursuant to the provisions of section 9 of the Canada
Evidence Act; and there is nothing in the record to suggest that either of
these courses could properly have been followed. The sole ground on which
counsel for the Crown sought permission to show the deposition to the witness
was for the purpose of refreshing his memory and it is on that ground that it
was argued before us that the course followed was not unlawful.

At the trial while counsel for the defence objected
throughout to the re-examination of Légaré on this subject-matter he did not
expressly raise the objection that under the circumstances of this particular
case Légaré ought not to be allowed to refer to the transcript of his evidence
at the preliminary hearing for the purpose of refreshing his memory on the
grounds that such evidence had been given more than seventeen months after the
alleged conversation and that Légaré had repeatedly stated in the course of his
cross-examination that statements made by him at the preliminary hearing were
inaccurate. I do not think that the question whether such objection if made
should have been maintained is before us on this appeal. Had it been otherwise
it might have been necessary to consider whether the view expressed in Phipson
on Evidence, 8th Edition at page 461 and in Halsbury's Laws of England, 2nd
Edition, Volume 13, pages 753 et seq., section 829, or
that in Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Edition at pages 100 et seq., sections
758 to 765, is to be preferred and whether if the former view is accepted the
principles which guide the court in determining whether a witness may look at a
writing to refresh his memory differ in the case of a deposition from those
applicable in the case of other writings. Assuming, but not deciding, that the
circumstances of this case were such that the witness might have been permitted
to refer to his deposition for the purpose of refreshing his memory, I agree
with Barclay J.

[Page 130]

that the whole incident was illegal. I think it was rightly
held in The King v. Laurin7, that the deposition must
not be read to the jury as was done in the case at bar. I think that the
evidence in question was wrongly admitted and that it cannot be said that it
did not cause the gravest prejudice to the accused.

As to the third ground of appeal, the court indicated to
Counsel for the Crown that it did not require him to address any argument in
regard to this ground. It was, I think, made clear at the time that the reason
for so doing was that in the particular circumstances of this case it was the
opinion of the court that the interference by the learned trial judge with the
cross-examination could not be said to have produced any substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice. The purpose of the cross-examination of Madame Boivin
which was stopped was to elicit an admission that she entertained ill feelings
towards the accused because of evidence which he had given against her husband
in criminal proceedings in which her husband had been convicted. The facts
which the defence sought to establish were brought out in the cross-examination
of the witness Boivin in the witness box. I am in agreement with Bertrand
J.8 where he says in his judgment:

C'était le droit de la défense de pouvoir
transquestionner le témoin sur ces raisons, et le juge aurait dû permettre ces
questions.

The ruling of the court on this point was not intended to
cast any doubt on the well established rule that the right to make full answer
and defence includes the right to cross-examine the Crown witnesses with
freedom and that any improper interference by the trial judge with this right
will usually be a sufficient ground for quashing a conviction.

As to the fourth ground of appeal, the learned trial judge
made only passing reference to the evidence given in support of the defence of
an alibi. I do not find it necessary to consider whether, in view of the
repeated and eminently proper direction given by the learned trial judge to the
jury that they must consider all the evidence whether given by the Crown or the
defence and if having done so they entertained a reasonable doubt as to the
guilt of the accused they should acquit him, it could be

[Page 131]

said that there was error in the charge in this regard; but
I do respectfully venture to suggest that in this case it would have been well
to follow the usual practice of indicating to the jury the nature of the
evidence put forward in

support of the alibi and telling them that, even if they are
not satisfied that the alibi has been proved, if the evidence in support of it
raises in their minds a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt it is their
duty to acquit him.

It is obvious that where an accused is not charged until
some seventeen months after the alleged commission of an offence, although he
be in fact innocent, it will only be in the rarest of cases that he is able to
establish an alibi beyond peradventure. While the evidence of the witness
Savard tendered in support of the alibi appeared to relate not to the week-end
of the 15th of June, 1947, but rather to the following week-end, the evidence
of the accused's wife, if believed, showed that he could not have committed the
crime and it was supported by the evidence of the accused's sister-in-law.

The fifth and sixth grounds of appeal may well be considered
together. It is argued on behalf of the appellant that the learned trial judge
failed to instruct the jury that before they could convict the accused of the
murder of Beaumont they must find on the evidence that it was proved beyond a
reasonable doubt not only that the victim was killed but that he was killed by
the accused. In my respectful opinion the learned trial judge failed to charge
the jury adequately on this point.

On the theory of the Crown as set out in the factum of
counsel for the respondent, the death of Beaumont was caused by Lizotte by striking
and kicking the victim in the face or by throwing him into the river when he
was still alive. If there was evidence on which the jury could properly find
beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim's death must have been caused by one
or other of these means, it would not be necessary that such evidence should be
of what is commonly referred to as a scientific nature but it was essential to
the verdict that there should be such evidence.

[Page 132]

In a case, such as this, where the defence is that the
accused had nothing to do with the matter whatever, it is obvious that the
defense will be unable to furnish any explanation as to how the victim met his
death and the onus rests upon the Crown to bring home to the accused, beyond a
reasonable doubt, the killing of the victim by him. This being so, and the
evidence upon which the jury might have come to the conclusion that the accused
killed Beaumont being largely circumstantial, it was, in my opinion essential
that they should be directed that if and in so far as they based their verdict
on circumstantial evidence, they must, in the words of Alderson B. in Hodge's
case 9, be satisfied not only that those
circumstances were consistent with his having committed the act but also that
such circumstances were inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than
that it was the prisoner who in fact killed Beaumont.

In the factum of the respondent it is submitted that it
matters not whether Beaumont was actually killed by the accused, by Légaré or
by Vallières or by the combined actions of the three of them. This submission
is based on the ground that each was responsible for the acts of the others by
reason of the provisions of section 69, subsection 2 of the Criminal Code. The
addresses of counsel to the jury do not appear in the record before us but I
find nothing in the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury to indicate
that the theory of the Crown depended upon invoking the terms of section 69(2).
In my opinion the evidence falls short of disclosing the formation by the
accused, Vallières and Légaré of a
common intention to prosecute any unlawful purpose and to assist each other
therein, which preceded the alleged striking of the victim with a beer bottle
by Légaré and Vallières. Certainly
there was no adequate instruction to the jury as to the necessity of their
being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, Légaré
and Vallières had formed a common intention to
prosecute an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein and that the
killing of Beaumont was or ought to have been known to be a probable
consequence of the prosecution of such common purpose before they

[Page 133]

could properly convict Lizotte, if, in their view, the
evidence was consistent with the view that the victim was killed by Légaré and
Vallières.

Our jurisdiction is limited to dealing with the points of
law upon which leave to appeal has been granted and these points do not include
a submission that there was no evidence upon which a jury could have found that
Lizotte, in fact, killed Beaumont, and I, therefore, do not consider whether
such an argument could have been supported. I am, however, of opinion that a
verdict of guilty cannot be supported in the absence of a clear direction to
the jury that they could not find the accused guilty unless they were satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that it was he who actually killed Beaumont. If, for
example, the jury were of the opinion that, consistently with the evidence, the
death of Beaumont may have been caused by the blows on the head with bottles
said to have been struck by Légaré and Vallières
and were not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that his death was
caused by blows struck by the accused or that the accused took part in throwing
him into the river while still alive they could not find him guilty of murder;
I cannot find that they were properly instructed in this regard.

The importance of what I respectfully consider to be
non-direction in regard to the effect to be given by the jury to circumstantial
evidence arises chiefly in regard to the matter of the actual cause of death. Hodge's
case was a case where all the evidence against the accused was
circumstantial. It is argued that the direction there prescribed is not
necessary in a case where there is direct evidence against the accused as well
as circumstantial evidence. However that may be, it is my opinion that where
the proof of any essential ingredient of the offence charged depends upon
circumstantial evidence it is necessary that the direction be given.

One further argument requires consideration. At the
conclusion of his able argument Mr. Dorion submitted that the jurisdiction of
this court in criminal matters being limited to questions of law and the court
appealed from having held that notwithstanding certain errors in law at the
trial there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage

[Page 134]

of justice and that the appeal should be dismissed under the
provisions, of section 1014(2) of the Criminal Code, such decision
cannot be reviewed in this court. It is argued that in reaching the decision to
apply section 1014(2) the Court of Appeal must of necessity have examined and
weighed the evidence and that consequently such decision is one of fact or of
mixed fact and law and, therefore, not subject to review in this court. It is
urged that the appeal must be dismissed even if this court should be of opinion
that any or all of the points of law argued before us are well taken.

I do not think that this argument is entitled to prevail. In
the case at bar it might perhaps be disposed of by pointing out that in my
opinion there were serious errors in matters of law at the trial which the
Court of Appeal did not regard as being errors at all; but even had the Court
of Appeal found the existence of all the errors in law which in my view did
occur and nonetheless dismissed the appeal pursuant to section 1014(2), I do
not think that this court would be without jurisdiction.

Counsel were not able to refer us to any reported case in
which the argument put forward by Mr. Dorion appears to have been considered.
Its importance is obvious. If given effect it would have the result that in any
case in which a Court of Appeal dismisses an appeal because in its view, in
spite of error in law at the trial, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has actually occurred this court could not entertain, or at all events
could not allow, an appeal from such judgment no matter how grave, in the view
of this court, was the error complained of.

The solution of this question depends, in the first
instance, on the wording of the relevant sections of the Criminal Code. It
will be observed that the jurisdiction of this court is conferred by a form of
wording different from that which confers jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal.
As has already been mentioned, the jurisdiction of this court is confined to
considering questions of law while the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to deal
not only with questions of law but with questions of mixed law and

[Page 135]

fact and with questions of fact alone. Under section 1014(1)
the Court of Appeal shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion:

(a) that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the
evidence; or

(b) that the judgment of the trial court should be set aside
on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of law; or

(c) that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal. Then
follows subsection 2, reading as follows:

The court may also dismiss the appeal if, notwithstanding
that it is of opinion that on any of the grounds above mentioned the appeal
might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is also of opinion that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

The jurisdiction of this court is limited to hearing and
determining appeals on:

(i) any question of law on which there has been dissent in
the Court of Appeal.

(1023), or

(ii) any question of law, if leave to appeal, is granted by
a judge of this court.

(1025).

In my view it is the duty of this court, in the first
instance, to examine the point or points of law properly brought before it
either under (i) or (ii) above or, as may sometimes happen, under both (i) and
(ii). If the court comes to the conclusion that there has been no error in law
it follows that the appeal will be dismissed. If, on the other hand, this court
is of opinion that there has been error in law in regard to any one or more of
the points properly before it, then I think, there devolves upon it the duty,
in disposing of the appeal, to ""make such rule or order thereon, either in
affirmance of the conviction or for granting a new trial, or otherwise, or for
granting or refusing such application, as the justice of the case
requires."" (section 1024).

In my opinion once this court reaches the conclusion, on one
or more of the points properly before it, that there has been error in law
below it is unfettered in deciding what order should be made by the views
expressed in the Court of Appeal. This would be my view if the point were
devoid of authority. It is I think supported by the practice followed for many
years. While numerous cases

[Page 136]

might be cited it seems to me to be sufficient to refer to: Brooks
v. The King 10 and Stein v. The King 11.
In Brooks v. The King this court allowed the appeal and directed
a new trial on the ground that the learned trial judge had misdirected the jury
as to the consideration which they should give to certain evidence given by the
defence. In the Court of Appeal for Ontario 12, Masten J.A. dissented,
taking the view that because of this particular misdirection the conviction
should be quashed. The judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal 13
was delivered by Grant J.A. After discussing the misdirection complained of
that learned judge continued:

We are of opinion that upon this ground no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice can have occurred.

This court 14, after holding that there was
misdirection, continued:

… That it may seem probable to an appellate court perusing
the record that the jury would have reached that conclusion, does not warrant
affirming the conviction. That would, in effect, be to substitute the verdict
of the court for that of a jury properly instructed, to which the appellant was
entitled. Misdirection in a material matter having been shewn, the onus was
upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the jury, charged as it should have
been, could not, as reasonable men, have done otherwise than find the appellant
guilty. Gouin v. The King (1926) S.C.R. 539, at p. 543; Allen v.
The King (1911) 44 Can. SCR. 331, at p. 339; Makin v. Att.-Gen.
for New South Wales (1894) A.C. 57, at p. 70. That burden the Crown, in the
view of the majority of the Court, has not discharged. There was non-direction
by the learned trial judge in a vital matter, tantamount in the circumstances
of this case to misdirection, and constituting a miscarriage of justice within
subs. 1(c) of s. 1014 of the Criminal Code. Upon the whole case, and
taking into consideration the entire charge, the majority of the Court, with
respect, finds itself unable to accept the view expressed by the learned judge
who delivered the majority judgment in the Appellate Division that ""no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice can have occurred"" at the
trial. (Criminal Code, s. 1014(2)).""

Stein v. The King, supra, was an appeal from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (4). The court consisted of
Perdue, C.J.M., Fullerton, Dennistoun, Prendergast and Trueman J.J.A. Fullerton
J.A. dissented on the ground that statements made by persons other than the
accused were wrongly admitted in evidence. Prendergast J.A. held that this
evidence had been wrongly admit-

[Page 137]

ted but that the appeal should be dismissed as there was no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. (See the report at page 379).
Trueman J.A. held that at least one of the statements admitted should have been
refused and continued,—""independently altogether of the statements made by
Paulin and Webster in the presence of Stein, the Crown's case was conclusively
made out. The jury must inevitably have arrived at the same verdict had the
impeached evidence not been admitted."" (See report at page 388). The Chief
Justice and Dennistoun J.A. simply agreed that the appeal should be dismissed.
It seems clear that the ratio decidendi of the majority of the Court of
Appeal for Manitoba was that although an error in law had been made no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred. This court also held
that the error in law complained of had occurred but, differing from the Court
of Appeal, held that it could not be said that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice had actually occurred, and allowed the appeal.

The view that this court exercises its own judgment as to
whether or not it can be said that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred, I think, appears not only from the two cases last cited
but also from Boulianne v. The King 15 and Schmidt
v. The King 16, in both of which this court gave effect
to the argument that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had
occurred, and dismissed the appeals, and from Chapdelaine v. The King
17
in which this court allowed the appeal, refusing to give effect to the argument
that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred.

I have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that this is
not a case in which it can be said that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred by reason of the errors in law made at the trial which
have been pointed out above. The test to be applied is found in the words of
Kerwin J., giving the judgment of the court in Schmidt v. The King (supra).

… The meaning of these words has been considered in
this Court in several cases, one of which is Gouin v. The King (1926)
S.C.R. 539, from all of which it is clear that the onus rests on the Crown to
satisfy

the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been the
same if the charge had been correct or if no evidence had been improperly
admitted. The principles therein set forth do not differ from the rules set
forth in a recent decision of the House of Lords in Stirland v. Director
of Public Prosecutions (1944) A.C. 315,
i.e., that the proviso that the Court of Appeal may dismiss the appeal if they
consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred in
convicting the accused assumes a situation where a reasonable jury, after being
properly directed, would, on the evidence properly admissible, without doubt
convict.

As, in my view, there should be a new trial, it is not
desirable that the evidence should be discussed at any length. I do not think
it can be said that a properly instructed jury acting honestly and reasonably
might not have acquitted the appellant.

For the reasons stated above and particularly because of
error in regard to the matters set out in the first, second, fifth and sixth
grounds of appeal, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the
conviction quashed and a new trial ordered.

Appeal allowed; new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA

Criminal law—Assault occasioning bodily harm—Accused
owner of premises on which acts occurred—As hotel keeper he retained two
suitcases for rent due by former roomer—Friends tried to obtain them without
paying—Whether injured person a trespasser with intent to commit a wrong or an
invitee—Right of accused to resist—Deree of force permisisble to repel
assault—Hotel Keepers Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 98—Criminal Code ss. 57, 290.

[Page 393]

The accused, being the proprietor of a rooming house, retained
two suitcases belonging to a former woman roomer as security for unpaid rent.
Four of her friends decided to obtain them without paying the rent. On arriving
at the house one remained outside in a taxi and the three others went into the
room occupied by the accused and his wife and when their purpose was known a
fight started and the accused hit one of them with a hammer, fracturing his
skull. The accused was convicted in police court of assault occasioning bodily
harm, the magistrate holding that the men were not trespassers. The Court of
Appeal being equally divided, his appeal was dismissed.

Held: The failure of the trial judge to appreciate that
the men were wrongdoers and under the circumstances trespassers, as well as his
failure to direct himself as to the effect of sec. 57 of the Criminal Code under
which the accused had the right to resist provided he did not use more force
than was necessary, amounted to misdirection and therefore a new trial ordered.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba 1 dismissing on an equal division,
Richards and Coyne J.A. dissenting, the appeal of the appellant from his
conviction, before Macdonell J., on a charge of assault occasioning bodily
harm.

The material facts of the case and the questions at issue
are stated in the above head note and in the judgment now reported.

W. A. Molloy for the appellant.

C. W. Tupper, K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

Estey J.:—The
appellant, John Nykolyn, was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily
harm upon the person of Peter Farr at Winnipeg on July 29, 1947. His conviction
was affirmed by an equal division in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 2,
Mr. Justice Richards and Mr. Justice Coyne dissenting. Several grounds of
dissent are set out in the formal judgment. It seems sufficient to deal with
the following only:

(1) The learned magistrate failed to direct himself
that Farr, Pyke and Gendre were, as they entered upon the
premises, trespassers engaged in the purpose of carrying out a conspiracy to
commit a criminal offence.

[Page 394]

(2) That the invitation as found by the learned
magistrate was given under duress or misapprehension of the purpose of the men,
and therefore not an invitation in law.

(3) That the accused had a right in law to resist the
taking of the property from his premises.

The learned magistrate accepted the evidence of Farr, Pyke
and Gendre, which may be summarized: The appellant
conducted a rooming house. A few days before July 29, 1946, a young woman left
appellant's rooming house but being unable to pay her rent the appellant
retained her two suitcases, under the provisions of The Hotel Keepers Act, R.S.M.
1940, ch. 98. No question is raised as to the right of the appellant to retain
these suitcases.

Farr was present and took part in the conversation between
the young woman and appellant when the suit-oases were retained. In fact he
said that one of the suitcases was his, it having been loaned to her. The rent
has neither been tendered nor paid. On July 29th Farr, Pyke, Gendre
and Seymour were in the beer parlour at the Woodbine Hotel in Winnipeg
where they had a few glasses of beer. There Farr told the other three the story
of the retention of the suitcases and they decided to go and get them. They all
went, as Pyke said ""We expected there might be some trouble,"" and as
Farr said that they might ""over-awe"" the appellant ""with
superior strength."" They proceeded shortly after five o'clock in the
afternoon in a taxi. At the rooming house Seymour remained in the taxi with the
driver while Farr, Pyke and Gendre went into the rooming
house. Appellant lived on the ground floor at the rear of the hall. Farr said
that the three of them went to the door and when they knocked it was opened by
appellant. Farr asked for the suitcases and the appellant said ""Just a
minute"" and went out, while Mrs. Nykolyn said ""Take them."" Farr
and Pyke walked in, seeing the grips under a table in the room picked them up,
when Mrs. Nykolyn began yelling and striking Pyke with a flashlight. Pyke
apparently paid no attention to her conduct and carried one of the suitcases
out to the taxi.

The evidence is not entirely clear as to just what happened
but Gendre, who did not go into the room but remained in
the hall, said that while Mrs. Nykolyn was yelling and striking Pyke with the
flashlight, Nykolyn came

[Page 395]

out into the hall apparently following Farr who had the
other suitcase. Gendre held the appellant, not because he
entertained any fear of Nykolyn assaulting him, but because as he said,
""there was Peter Farr and Mr. Nykolyn arguing about suitcases, and I was
going to quiet them down."" He then said that after a couple of minutes
""I let Mr. Nykolyn go and he said 'Just a minute' and he went behind the
door and he picked up a hammer …"" Gendre said he saw
Nykolyn hit Farr with the hammer and then he (Gendre) struck
Nykolyn on the jaw with his fist as a result of which Nykolyn fell into his own
room and he, Gendre, helped Farr out of the house.

Seymour said he remained in the taxi and ""the taxi
driver and I heard the screaming and we thought there was a murder on.""
The taxi driver said ""I could hear the noise, but I could not distinguish
what it was.""

The magistrate accepted the evidence of the three men but
failed to direct his attention to the admitted fact that they had gone to
appellant's home, as arranged in the beer parlour, to take from him the two
suitcases. Farr knew why the suitcases were held because he was present when
the appellant had asserted his right to and did retain them. Appellant, in
retaining them, was exercising his right under the law of Manitoba and thereby
had a property interest in and a right of possession to these suitcases. If, as
they deposed, these men went there under the terms of a conspiracy or with a
common intent to 'commit the offence of theft, they were wrongdoers' as they
entered upon the premises and were, under the circumstances, trespassers. The
learned magistrate made no reference in his judgment to this evidence and
misdirected himself in law in stating ""When they were on the property they
weren't trespassing— they rang the bell.""

The magistrate also found that ""they were told they
could get the grips—there was no trespassing there."" His finding that they
were told to get the grips is based on the statement of Mrs. Nykolyn, who,
immediately the door was opened, made some such remark as ""Take
them."" Some question was raised as to the authority of Mrs. Nykolyn to
grant such permission on behalf of her husband, which, under the circumstances,
I do not think it is neces-

[Page 396]

sary to consider. Why the invitation was given is not clear.
It seems to have been given before any trouble started when she may have been
under the impression that the parties had come for the suitcases and would pay
the rent and take them lawfully. Certainly the moment she found they were
taking them without doing so she began actively to resist. The fact that Mrs.
Nykolyn may have been momentarily deceived in thinking the parties were upon a
lawful errand and under that misapprehension gave the invitation as found,
would not alter the fact that these men were throughout proceeding in the
execution of their unlawful purpose and were trespassers. The learned
magistrate did not direct his attention to this phase of the case. Perhaps it
should be mentioned that apart from all questions as to whether the invitation
was given under fear or apprehension of consequences or under the belief that
the parties intended to pay the rent for which the suitcases were held, which
does not appear to have been 'Considered, there is the important question
whether or not by her conduct she had withdrawn any permission or licence she
had given that would permit these parties to take the suitcases away. The
learned magistrate did not direct his attention to this important issue and his
failure to do so would seem, under the circumstances, to constitute a
misdirection.

The appellant was in his own home in peaceful possession of
the suitcases in question. Sec. 57 of the Criminal Code provides:

57. Every one who is in peaceable possession of any movable
property or thing under a claim of right, and every one acting under his
authority, is protected from criminal responsibility for defending such
possession, even against a person entitled by law to the possession of such
property or thing, if he uses no more force than is necessary.

The appellant was in peaceful possession of the suitcases
under a claim of right and therefore had, under the foregoing section, a right
to resist these men in their endeavour to take the suitcasess provided or so
long as he did not use more force than was necessary. The record here would
indicate, particularly if the permission, found by the learned magistrate to
have been given by Mrs. Nykolyn, was withdrawn or otherwise ineffective in law,
that the issue under sec. 57 would be a very important part of this case

[Page 397]

and to which the learned magistrate did not direct his
attention. Whether one in exercising his right under the foregoing section uses
more force than is necessary is a question of fact which, under the particular
circumstances of this case, should be determined at a trial where the evidence
is directed to this issue and the question of credibility of the witnesses
determined by the presiding magistrate who has an opportunity to observe them.

In my opinion the appeal should be allowed and a new trial
directed.

Appeal allowed; new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Murder—Evidence—Statements made to police
after questioning—Whether made voluntarily—Whether incriminating or
exculpatory—Admissibility—Criminal Code s. 259.

While in custody, on a coroner's warrant, as a material
witness, during the investigation of a murder case, appellant made two written
statements to the police during the course of questions put to him by them. For
the first statement, the usual warning was not given before accused bad
completed his verbal answers, but it was given before the written statement was
signed. This statement contained an account of the movements of the appellant
for some days before and after the day of the commission of the crime, which
indicated that he could not have been concerned in the crime. It also contained
admissions of his intimate relations with the wife of the murdered man. The
second statement before which a warning was given, reiterated the substance of
the first, but added a complete confession of the commission of the crime by
appellant. The trial judge ruled that these statements were admissible in
evidence and the majority in the Court of Appeal agreed with him.

Held: Estey J. dissenting, that both statements were voluntarily
made and that the appeal should be dismissed.

Held also, that the first statement was incriminating
and not exculpatory (The Chief Justice and Taschereau J. contra).

Held further, that the dictum in Gach v. The
King [1943] S.C.R. '254 that ""when a person has been arrested, all
confessions made to a person in authority, as a result of questioning, are
inadmissible in evidence, unless proper caution has been given"" was
obiter: Ibrahim v. The King [1914] A.C. 599 and Prosko v. The
King 63 S.C.R. 226 followed. (The Chief Justice and Taschereau J.
expressing the opinion that the Gach case had no application to the
present case as, in their view, the first statement was exculpatory).

Per Estey J. (dissenting): The first statement was
incriminating and the trial judge misdirected himself to the effect that the
statement was exculpatory and not evidence against the accused. That though a
warning was given prior to the second statement, it was immediately followed by
questions and incidents which were not sufficiently disclosed by the evidence
to justify a conclusion that the statement was voluntarily made.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench,
appeal side, province of Quebec 1, dismissing

[Page 263]

(Bissonnette J.A. dissenting) the appellant's appeal from
his conviction, at trial before Coté J. and a jury, on a charge of murder.

Hon. Lucien Gendron K.C. for the appellant.

Nöel Dorion K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. was
delivered by

Taschereau, J.:—The
appellant Gaston Boudreau was charged with the murder of Joseph Laplante, and
on the 26th of September, 1947, he was found guilty and condemned to be hanged.
This conviction was upheld by the Court of King's Bench, Province of Quebec 2,
Mr. Justice Bissonnette dissenting, on the ground that certain confessions made
by the appellant were illegally admitted in evidence.

The main facts leading to these alleged confessions which
are impugned, may be briefly stated as follows:

On the morning of May the 29, 1947, the body of Laplante was
found on the highway, leading to Lake Castagnier, a small municipality near
Amos, Abitibi, P.Q, The police authorities started immediately to investigate,
and the Coroner's inquest, originally fixed for the 29th of May, was adjourned sine
die by Coroner Brousseau until further evidence could be obtained. It was
resumed on the 6th of June, 1947.

At first, Constable Lefebvre, Sergeant Dupont, Sergeant
Massue, Detective Oggier and Dr. Roussel, legal medico expert for the Provincial
Government, who had come from Amos and Montreal to try and solve the mystery of
Laplante's death, which was obviously a brutal murder, had but very scant clues
leading to the discovery of the author of this crime.

On Sunday, the 1st of June, Lefebvre, Oggier and Dr. Roussel
went at Laplante's house where the body was exposed. There, they saw amongst
others, Mrs. Laplante and Gaston Boudreau, the appellant in the present case.
As Boudreau looked nervous, he was asked by Oggier to follow him, and was brought
the same evening to Amos at the police headquarters. He was there put under the

[Page 264]

supervision of the jailer, in the Constable's room, and
Sergeant Massue telephoned the Coroner to obtain the necessary authorization to
detain him as an important witness. This authorization was given verbally on
Sunday 'night, and the next morning, Massue received by mail a written
authorization to detain Boudreau.

On that morning, Massue summoned Boudreau in his office and
told him that he was held as an important witness. In view of the fact that
Boudreau's friendship with Mrs. Laplante was publicly known, it was decided to
ask him a few questions, and on Tuesday evening, at about eight thirty, Massue
questioned him on his movements during the week of the murder. Without being
warned, Boudreau said that he had left the previous Tuesday to go hunting at a
place called Canton Vassal, and that he had taken with him a shot gun. He
explained his run in the bush where he had sprung his traps, his return on foot
the following Saturday to one Therrien's house, and then to his home in a taxi
with one Carpentier. He also gave some information concerning his fire-arms,
his cartridges and the result of his hunt. Massue then pursued further his
investigation, and asked him about his relations with Mrs. Laplante. Boudreau
freely told the circumstances in which he had met her, and the fact unknown to
the police, that she was his mistress.

Boudreau was then asked if he was willing to repeat his
statement so that it could be taken in writing, and he agreed without hesitation.
Mr. Z. Bacon, secretary at the police headquarters, took down word for word
Boudreau's statement. As the sheet of paper on which the answers were to be
typewritten bore the regular warning, it was read to the accused before
anything was committed to writing. Upon completion, the whole document
including the warning, was read to the appellant who signed it after having
been sworn by a Justice of the Peace.

Oggier continued his investigation. It was discovered that
the pellets found in Laplante's skull were BB Gauge, shot very likely from a 12
gauge shot gun, the same calibre as the one found in Aubuchon's house and
belonging to Boudreau. The cartridges he had in his house were also BB. This
new evidence strengthened the detective's suspicions which at first were very
slight, but were, nevertheless

[Page 265]

still quite insufficient to charge Boudreau with murder.
There was no direct evidence to link him with the commission of the crime.

On the 5th of June, when Oggier returned from Lake
Castagnier with Massue, it was decided to call Boudreau back to obtain from him
additional information. Massue told him that he was held as an important
witness concerning Laplante's death, and warned him that he was not
obliged to talk, but that if he wished to say anything, it could be used as
evidence before the Court. Boudreau then volunteered to give further
information. He gave additional details concerning his intimacy with Mrs.
Laplante, and while he was talking, Massue left the office to get a glass of
water, and the accused spontaneously admitted to Oggier, without any question
being put to him: ""I may as well tell you, I killed him."" Oggier
called Massue back, and in the presence of Oggier and Massue Boudreau told the
whole story of how he killed Laplante. This statement was typewritten by an
employee of the police, and sworn to by Boudreau.

The learned trial judge ruled that these statements were
admissible in evidence, and the majority of the Court of Appeal 3 agreed
with him.

The law concerning the admissibility of statements made to
persons in authority, finds its application only when these statements are 'of
an incriminating nature. The first statement made by the appellant on the 2nd
of June to. Massue, was not in my opinion of that 'character, and nothing can
be found in it, which directly or indirectly tends to connect the appellant
with Laplante's murder. In fact, Boudreau denied all participation in the
offence, by telling all that he had done in the course of his hunting trip. His
statement was exculpatory. The admission of his intimacy with Mrs. Laplante may
at the most constitute a possible motive, but cannot in itself be considered as
evidence of guilt. It does not show in the remotest way that the appellant was
involved in Laplante's death.

Counsel for the appellant has cited the case of Gach v.
The King 4. I do not think that the present case
can be governed by that case, where the accused had made confessions of an
incriminating nature. The Court 5

[Page 266]

held that in view of the circumstances revealed by the
evidence, the accused was entitled to the same protection, before being
questioned by a person in authority, as if he had been in custody.

As to the second statement made on June the 5th, it is said in
the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Bissonnette, that it was a logical
sequence of the first one, and therefore became illegal, notwithstanding the
warning by the police officers. With due respect, I do not agree with this
contention. I fail to see anything in the first statement that could in any way
influence the second one, and be an inducement for Boudreau to make it to the
police. Boudreau spoke freely after having been warned, and I have no doubt
that it is without fear and without a hope of advantage from the detectives,
that he made the minutely detailed recital of this premeditated crime. The
spontaneity of that part of the confession, dealing with the actual killing,
establishes clearly its voluntary character, and this, with all the other circumstances
shown at the trial, leaves no doubt in my mind, that the conclusions reached by
the learned trial judge on the ""voir-dire"", were right.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Kerwin J.:—The
first statement has been treated by the majority of the judges in the Courts 6
below as exculpatory and I understand that that is also the view in this Court
of my lord the Chief Justice and my brother Taschereau. There is no doubt,
however, that the statement affords a possible motive for the murder, and in my
opinion that would be sufficient to warrant applying the rule, if it exists,
that once a person is under arrest any statement given by him in answer to
questions by those in authority is inadmissible unless preceded by a proper
warning. It was argued that such a rule was laid down by this Court in Gach v.
The King 7. Mr. Justice Taschereau, who spoke for
the majority in that case, is of opinion that the decision does not apply but
that is because, in his view, the first statement given by Boudreau was
exculpatory. For the reason given, I am, with respect, unable to concur and it
therefore becomes necessary to consider the Gach decision.

[Page 267]

I believe it is agreed that it was sufficient for the
disposition of that appeal 8 to decide that the statement there in
issue was given as a result of a threat and that the following statement, at
page 254, was therefore unnecessary for the actual decision:—

There is no doubt that when a person has been arrested, all
confessions made to a person in authority, as a result of questioning, are
inadmissible in evidence unless proper caution has been given. This rule which
is found in Canadian and British law is based on the sound principle that
confessions must be free from fear, and not inspired by a hope of advantage
which an accused may expect from a person in authority.

This statement is couched in very broad terms and, if read
in its widest sense, would prevent, for instance, the placing in evidence of
any incriminating answers to questions put by a police officer to a person
arrested at the scene of a crime immediately after its commission. It has been
construed to change the law as it was considered to be prior to Gach,—by the
Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Scory 9, and by
the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal 10 in the present case and
is really the basis of the appeal to this Court.

Again with great respect, I think it advisable that it
should now be stated clearly what this Court considers the law to be. My view
is that it has not been changed from that set out in Ibrahim v. Rex 11
and Rex v. Prosko 12. The fundamental question is whether a
confession of an accused offered in evidence is voluntary. The mere fact that a
warning was given is not necessarily decisive in favour of admissibility but,
on the other hand, the absence of a warning should not bind the hands of the
Court so as to compel it to rule out a statement. All the surrounding
circumstances must be investigated and, if upon their review the Court is not
satisfied of the voluntary nature of the admission, the statement will be
rejected. Accordingly, the presence or absence of a warning will be a factor
and, in many cases, an important one.

In the present case the accused gave a second statement in
which is repeated the admissions of his intimacy with the deceased's wife
contained in the first statement but, in addition, contained an admission of
the slaying. The second statement was made after a proper warning. The

[Page 268]

trial judge admitted both in evidence and notwithstanding
that he admitted the first because of his view that it was exculpatory, I am
not prepared to disagree with his conclusion as to either. The police were not
compelled to tell the accused specifically that notwithstanding his first
statement he was not obliged to make another, and the first contains nothing
that is not incorporated in the latter.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Rand, J.:—The
appellant Boudreau was 'Convicted of murder and the point of dissent on which
he comes to this Court is the improper reception of two written statements, the
first containing an admission of intimacy with the wife of the murdered man and
the second, in addition to a repetition and an elaboration of the first
admission, a full confession of the deed itself. At the time of making them he
was being held under a coroner's warrant as a material witness. There was no
more than a suspicion against him when in the first conversation with police
officers in which questions were asked him he purported to detail his movements
on the two or three days before the death and admitted the intimacy. Having
consented to make the statement in writing, a justice of the peace was summoned
and the statement made out, signed and sworn to by him. Before the signing, the
justice read out the words of the usual warning which happened to be printed
across the top of the paper. Two days later, after a formal warning, a further
discussion took place with two officers and while one of them was momentarily
out of the room and after a reference had been made to his mother, Boudreau
suddenly burst out with the words ""j'aime autant vous le dire: c'est moi
qui l'a tué."" This was followed by details. He then, as in the first case,
consented to have the statement put in writing, and a like course was followed
as before.

The objection is that the first oral admission, without
warning, of what, in my opinion, was, in the circumstances, an incriminating
fact, nullified both statements: that, having committed himself so far, what
followed was its compulsive sequence, unless, which was not the case, the
warning on the second occasion had so specifically dealt with the previous
statement as to efface any effect that might then have remained on his mind.

[Page 269]

In support of this position, Rex v. Gach 13,
is cited. Mr. Gendron argued that what was formerly a rule of practice under
which the trial judge could and almost invariably did but was not bound to rule
out confessions resulting from questions put to a person under arrest by one in
authority without a warning has, by that decision, been converted into an
inflexible rule of law; and it is pointed out that that view of it has been
taken by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Scory 14.
The particular language from which this conclusion is drawn is that of
Taschereau J. in the following paragraph:—

There is no doubt that when a person has been arrested, all
confessions made to a person in authority, as a result of questioning, are
inadmissible in evidence unless proper caution has been given. This rule which
is found in Canadian and British law is based on the sound principle that
confessions must be free from fear, and not inspired by a hope of advantage
which an accused may expect from a person in authority.

As the reasons of both Kerwin, J. and Taschereau, J. show,
there was in the case clear evidence of a threat on the part of the officer,
and the facts which might have called for such an examination of the rule as is
suggested were not present. At the most, then, it could be only a dictum: but I
am bound to say that I cannot take the language as intended to do more than to
state the existing rule. It is, therefore, I think, a misinterpretation of this
decision to treat it as having effected a significant change in the character
of the rule, and the point 'as put to us by Mr. Gendron fails.

The cases of Ibrahim v. Rex 15, Rex
v. Voisin 16 and Rex v. Prosko 17
lay it down that the fundamental question is whether the statement is
voluntary. No doubt arrest and the presence of officers tend to arouse
apprehension which a warning may or may not suffice to remove, and the rule is
directed against the danger of improperly instigated or induced or coerced
admissions. It is the doubt cast on the truth of the statement arising from the
circumstances in which it is made that gives rise to the rule. What the
statement should be is that of a man free in volition from the compulsions or
inducements of authority and what is sought is assurance that that is the

[Page 270]

case. The underlying and controlling question then remains:
is the statement freely and voluntarily made? Here the trial judge found that
it was. It would be a serious error to place the ordinary modes of
investigation of crime in a strait jacket of artificial rules; and the true
protection against improper interrogation or any kind of pressure or inducement
is to leave the broad question to the court. Rigid formulas1 can be
both meaningless to the weakling and absurd to the sophisticated or hardened
criminal; and to introduce a new rite as an inflexible preliminary condition
would serve no genuine interest of the accused and but add an unreal formalism
to that vital branch of the administration of justice.

I do not mean to imply any right on the part of officers to
interrogate or to give countenance or approval to the practice; I leave it as
it is, a circumstance frequently presented to courts which is balanced between
a virtually inevitable tendency and the danger of abuse.

The appeal must therefore be dismissed.

The judgment of Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by

Kellock, J.:—This
appeal comes to this court upon the basis of the dissenting judgment of
Bissonnette J. in the court below 18, which affirmed the conviction of the
appellant by the Superior Court on a charge of murder. The questions raised
involve the admissibility of two statements made by the appellant to police
officers during the course of questions put to him by them on two different
occasions. On the first occasion the usual warning was not given until the
appellant had completed his verbal answers but it was given before his
statement was committed to writing and signed by him. This statement contained
a circumstantial account of the movements of the appellant for some days before
and after the day upon which the crime was committed, which indicated that he
could not have been concerned in the crime. It also contained admissions
however, with respect to relations existing between the appellant and the wife
of the murdered man.

The second statement reiterated the substance of the first,
but added a complete and circumstantial account of the commission of the crime
by the appellant. Mr. Justice

[Page 271]

Bissonnette treated the first statement as having been made
without a warning and he considered it inadmissible on the ground that it had
been laid down by this court in the case of Rex v. Gach 19,
that lack of warning in any case rendered a statement inadmissible as a matter
of law. He was also of the 'opinion that the inadmissibility of the first
statement rendered the second inadmissible, as in his view, the appellant ought
to have been pointedly warned that notwithstanding he had made the first
statement he need not say anything. The question is therefore raised as to
whether or not, assuming the warning with respect to the first statement to
have been insufficient, either statement was thereby rendered inadmissible as a
matter of law, even although the learned trial judge, upon a consideration of
all the relevant circumstances, was of opinion that in each instance the
appellant had spoken voluntarily.

The governing principle is stated by Viscount Sumner in Ibrahim
v. The King 20 as follows:

It has long been established as a postive rule of English
criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against
him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement,
in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear or prejudice
or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority. The
principle is as old as Lord Hale. The burden of proof in the matter has been
decided by high authority in recent times in Regina v. Thompson 21
…

At page 613 Viscount Sumner refers to the decision of the
Court of Criminal Appeal in England in Rex v. Knight and Thayre 22,
and quotes from the judgment of Channell J. at page 713, where the latter said
with respect to answers to questions put by a constable after arresting:

When he has taken anyone into custody … he ought not to
question the prisoner … I am not aware of any distinct rule of evidence, that
if such improper questions are asked the answers to them are inadmissible, but
there is clear authority for saying that the judge at the trial may in his
discretion refuse to allow the answers to be given in evidence …

On the same page Viscount Sumner refers to an excerpt from
the judgment of Channell J. in Rex v. Boot and Jones 23,
where the latter said at p. 179:

the moment you have decided to charge him and praotically
got him into custody, then, inasmuch as a judge even cannot ask a question, or
a magistrate, it is ridiculous to suppose that a policeman can. But there is

[Page 272]

no actual authority yet that if a policeman does ask a
question it is inadmissible; what happens is that the judge says it is not
advisable to press the matter.

Viscount Sumner concludes:

And of this Darling J., delivering the judgment of the Court
of Criminal Appeal observes the ""principle was put very clearly by
Channell J.""

Lord Sumner at p. 614 refers to this view of the law as
""a probable opinion of the present law, if it is not actually the better
opinion"", although their Lordships say that the final declaration as to
the law on the subject should be left to the ""revising functions of a
general Court of Criminal Appeal.""

In Rex v. Colpus 24, a decision of the
Court of Criminal Appeal in England, in delivering the judgment of that court
Viscount Reading C.J., said at 579:

We do not propose to say more in this case than that the
principle laid down in Reg. v. Thompson 25 and
approved in Ibrahim v. Rex 26 is the principle which
is to be applied in the present case.

The case before that court involved statements made by the
appellants before a military court of inquiry. These were admitted although
there had been no warning, the court being of opinion that on all the evidence
they were voluntary statements.

In the following year in The King v. Voisin 27,
again a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the appellant, in response to
a request by the police, went to a police station where he made a statement
which was taken down in writing. He was then asked whether he had any objection
to writing down certain words, and upon his stating he had no objection, he
wrote them. He was not cautioned at any time. It was contended at the trial
that the words which he had written were inadmissible on the ground that the
writing was obtained by the police without having first cautioned the appellant
and while he was in custody. The writing was, however, admitted. The court
followed the judgment of Lord Sumner in Ibrahim's case 28. At
page 558 A. T. Lawrence J. said:

The question as to whether a person has been duly cautioned
before the statement was made is one of the circumstances that must be taken

[Page 273]

into consideration, but this is a circumstance upon which
the judge should exercise his discretion. It cannot be said as a matter of law
that the absence of a caution makes the statement inadmissible.

I do not think it possible to regard this case as other than
a case of a statement obtained from a person in custody as the result of
questioning by the police and it was so dealt with by the court. There is, in
my opinion, no room for distinction whether there be one or more than one
question asked.

In 1922 the question came before this court in Prosko v.
The King 29. In that case the appellant was in the
custody of two American detectives for the purpose of being brought before the
American Immigration authorities. A warrant for his arrest on a charge of
murder had been issued in this country.

The appellant was told by the immigration officers that they
were going to take up his case with the United States Immigration officials and
have him deported to Canada, whereupon he said, ""I am as good as dead if
you send me there."" Upon the officers asking ""why"", he gave the
statement which was in question. No warning had been given to him. The Chief
Justice, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur, JJ., followed and applied the principle
laid down in Ibrahim v. The King 30, The
King v. Colpus 31 and The King v. Voisin 32.
In this case but a single question was asked. The case was treated by all the
members of the court as one of answers made to questions by persons in
authority without a warning having been given. It was held that the evidence
was admissible. The court considered that the basic question to be answered was
as to whether or not the statement had been voluntarily made. At page 237
Anglin J. said:

The two detectives were persons in authority; the accused
was in my opinion in the same plight as if in custody in extradition
proceedings under a warrant charging him with murder. No warning whatever' was
given to him. While these facts do not in themselves suffice to exclude the
admissions, as Duff J. appears to have held in The King v. Kay '33,
they are undoubtedly circumstances which require that the evidence tendered to
establish their voluntary character should be closely scrutinized.

In Gach v. The King 34, the
appellant was charged with having unlawfully received certain ration' books,
knowing them to have been stolen. Certain police officers

[Page 274]

called upon the appellant and told him that one Nagurski had
stated that he had sold ration books to the appellant, that he could be
prosecuted, and that in any event it would be better for him to hand them over.
At the end of the conversation they told him that he was to accompany them to
the police barracks to talk to an inspector. The inspector there told the
appellant that he would, in all probability, be charged. He was then asked
certain questions and made certain answers. No warning was given. The admissibility
of these answers was challenged.

Kerwin J., who delivered the judgment of himself and Duff
C.J., referred to Ibrahim v. The King 35 and Sankey
v. The King 36, and held the evidence inadmissible as
having been made after appellant had been told by the police that it would be
better if he made a statement.

The judgment of Taschereau J., with whom Rinfret J., as he
then was, and Hudson J. agreed, reached the same result. The judgment of the
majority is based upon the judgments in The Queen v. Thompson 37, Rex v. Knight and Thayre 38,
Lewis v. Harris 39, and Rex v. Crowe and
Myerscough 40.

As already mentioned, the first two of the above four
authorities are referred to by Viscount Sumner in Ibrahim's 41
case. In The Queen v. Thompson 42 there is no suggestion
that any warning had been given. The statement, however, was not rejected on
that ground but on the ground that the Grown had not satisfied the burden
resting on it of establishing that the statement had been made voluntarily.
That is all that the case is cited for by Taschereau J. Had the mere lack of
warning been regarded as rendering the statement inadmissible, the strong court
which decided The Queen v. Thompson 43, would
undoubtedly have said so. They did not.

Again in Rex v. Knight and Thayre 44,
the statement which the Crown tendered had in fact been preceded by a warning. It
is not therefore in itself a decision as to

[Page 275]

admissibility or inadmissibilty where no warning is given.
Taschereau J. quotes from the reasons for judgment of Channell J. at p. 713,
including:

When he has taken anyone into custody, and also before doing
so when he has already decided to make the charge, he ought not to question the
prisoner. A magistrate or judge cannot do it, and a police officer certainly
has no more right to do so.

Channell J. immediately adds, however, what is included in
that which is quoted by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim's 45 case:

I am not aware of any distinct rule of evidence, that if
such improper questions are asked the answers to them are inadmissible, but
there is clear authority for saying that the judge at the trial may in his
discretion refuse to allow the answer to be given in evidence and in my opinion
that is the right course to pursue.

That is not to say that the rule is that all such answers
are inadmissible, but that as a matter of discretion the judge may refuse to
admit. That this is the correct view of what the learned judge says is shown by
that part of his direction in Rex v. Booth and Jones 46,
quoted by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim's case at p. 613:

… the (moment you have decided to charge him and practically
got him into custody, then, inasmuch as a judge even cannot ask a question, or
a magistrate, it is ridiculous to suppose that a policeman can. But there is no
actual authority yet that if a policeman does ask a question, it is
inadmissible—what happens is that the judge says it is not admissible to press
the matter.

In Rex v. Booth and Jones 47, as in
Rex v. Knight and Thayre 48, the statement tendered
had in fact been preceded by a warning.

In Lewis v. Harris 49, the
headnote to which is quoted by Taschereau J., a constable had observed a child
coming out of a store on a Sunday, and finding out from her that she had made a
purchase of candy, he went back into the store with her and asked the
proprietor certain questions, the admissibility of which was in question on the
appeal. In that case the fact was that the appellant was not in custody and the
constable had not made up his mind to lay a charge. The case is therefore not
in pari materia with the case at bar. In the course of his judgment
Darling J. said at p. 71:

A constable ought not, if he has made up his mind that
whatever the answer may be he will arrest the person to whom he is speaking, to

[Page 276]

ask that person an incriminating question. The law does not
say that the answer must be excluded and that it is not evidence, but it has
been frequently held that if that rule is infringed then the judge in his
discretion may reject the evidence, and it is tolerably certain that if there
is any sign that the evidence was unfairly obtained he would reject it. The
true rule is that nothing must be done to hold out an inducement to a person,
and no threat must be used to induce a person, to make an incriminating
statement …

The last case to which Taschereau J. refers is Rex v.
Crowe and Myerscough 50, a decision of Sankey J., as he then
was. The question involved was as to the admissibility of a statement in answer
to questions put by the police made by the appellant Myerscough before arrest
and before the police had determined to arrest her. After she had made the
answers orally, the appellant signed a written statement in which she said that
""This statement has been read over to me. It is made quite voluntarily and
is true"". Sankey J. admitted the statement on the grounds, (1) that it had
been made when she was not under arrest; (2) before it had been decided to
arrest her; and (3) that she herself had said it had been made voluntarily. In
the course of his judgment Sankey J. said what is quoted by Taschereau J., viz:

If a police officer has determined to effect an arrest, or
if the person is in custody, then be should ask no questions which will in any
way tend to prove the guilt of such person from this own mouth.

It is to be noted that Sankey J. does not say that if this
rule is disobeyed and a statement is made, it is inadmissible as a matter of
law.

It is clear therefore that in none of the cases referred to
in the judgment of the majority in Gach's 51 case,
is it laid down that a statement made by a person in custody in answer to
questions but by a person in authority, is, as a matter of law inadmissible. On
the contrary, the question is in all cases as to whether the Crown, as stated
in Rev. Thompson, supra, has satisfied the onus that the statement has
in fact been made voluntarily. While there may be expressions in the judgment
of the majority in Gach's case, taken apart from the context, which
might appear to extend the decisions, as pointed out by Atkinson J. in Lorentzen
v. Lydden & Co. 52:

[Page 277]

Again and again judges have been told by the Court of Appeal
and the House of Lords that words used in previous oases must be interpreted
with reference to the facts before the court and the issues with which it was
dealing.

In Gach's case it is plain from the judgment of the majority
that the statement sought to be used in evidence had been made by the appellant
after the officers had said to him ""that it would be better for him to
hand them over."" In these circumstances all the members of the court were
of opinion that it could not be said that the statement was voluntary.

I do not consider therefore that it can be said that
anything said in Gach's 53 case can be taken as inconsistent with
the previous decision in Prosko's 54 case by which the court
was bound, even though it could be said that the court was not also bound to
follow what was termed by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim's 55 case
as a ""probable opinion of the present law, if it is not actually the
better opinion.""

In the case at bar the second statement, which included the
substance of the first, was held by the trial judge to have been voluntarily
made. I think therefore that the appeal must be dismissed.

Estey, J.
(dissenting):—The appellant's conviction for the murder of Joseph Laplante was
affirmed by a majority in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) in Quebec 56.
Mr. Justice Bissonnette dissented on the bases as set out in the formal
judgment:

1. L'illégalité dans l'obtention et la
production de la première confession;

2. L'illégalité dans l'obtention et la
production de la deuxième confession, particulièrement en raison de
l'illégalité de la première;

3. L'inadmissibilité de la preuve des aveux ou
confessions.

Mr. Justice Bissonnette was of the opinion that the first
statement or confession was not exculpatory as the learned trial judge has
construed it, and because no warning had been given it was in his opinion
improperly admitted. He summarized his conclusions relative to the second
statement under three headings, as follows:

Le premier, c'est que j'estime que la mise en
garde sur la deuxième confession, même si elle a été faite, ne constituait pas,
sous les circonstances de cette cause, un avertissement suffisant, car ce jeune
homme ne

[Page 278]

pouvait alors ignorer qu'il avait déjà fait
certains aveux et que tout ce qu'on lui demandait ce soir-là, c'était de
circonstancier ce qu'il avait déjà dit. II s'attache donc une présomption très
forte que l'appelant pouvait se croire tenu, obligé, contraint de parler.

Le deuxième motif c'est que les deux
confessions sont si intimement liées, que l'exclusion de l'une entraîne celle
de l'autre, car le jury ne pouvait certes pas se détacher complètement de
l'impression que la lecture de la première pouvait avoir dans son esprit, dans
la considération du mobile du crime.

Comme troisième motif, je dirai, à la suite de
M. le juge Anglin dans l'affaire Sankey, que si l'interrogatoire que l'on fait
subir à un prévenu n'est pas, per se, illégal, il faut, d'autre part, bien
s'assurer que la Couronne s'est acquittée de son 'obligation de prouver que les
aveux sont libres, nullement entachés d'une contrainte physique ou morale
quelconque. Et cette preuve, (ajoutait le juge en chef Anglin, ne peut
qu'exceptionnellement ressortir du seul fait du serment des officiers de police
que l'inculpé a parlé librement.

The murder occurred Thursday, May 29, 1947, at Lac
Castagnier about twenty-four miles from Amos in the Province of Quebec.

Detective Oggier arrived at Amos on Saturday, May 31st. He
acquainted himself with the information already gathered by the Provincial
Police and on Sunday he and Constable Lefebvre proceeded to Lac Castagnier. At
Mrs. Laplante's they found a number of people, including Boudreau. Detective
Oggier desired to question Boudreau ""sur ses allées et venues,"" and
""parce que j'avais des soupçons,"" and requested him to accompany them
to Amos. At Amos the coroner was communicated with and Boudreau detained at the
jail. On Monday morning, June 2nd, Detective-Sergeant Massue had Boudreau
brought into his office and there informed him 'that he was held as a material
witness. Boudreau said nothing when so informed and was taken back into
custody. In fact no questions were asked and no statement made by Boudreau
until Tuesday night, the reason for which is explained by Detective Oggier in
the course of his evidence:

Q. Vous avez pas jugé à propos de lui parler
de ses allées et venues?

R. Non, mon enquête était pas complète.

Q. Pourquoi pas commencer à le questionner?

R. J'avais pas assez d'informations sur la
cause et j'ai cru bon de continuer mon enquête.

Detective Oggier continued his inquiries at Lac Castagnier
and returned to Amos on Tuesday, June 3rd. That evening at about 8.30 Boudreau
was brought into the office of Detective-Sergeant Massue where Massue and
Oggier questioned him. No warning was given and the

[Page 279]

conversation lasted about an hour. The statements made by
Boudreau were in reply to questions, for the most part by Detective-Sergeant
Massue. Boudreau there admitted ownership of a 12 gun as well as a revolver and
told the police that he had left his home about midday on Tuesday, May 27th, to
go into the woods to check over his traps, and returned on Saturday, when he
heard of the murder of Laplante. He also stated that he had visited and worked
at Laplante's place. When questioned he admitted intimate relations with Mrs.
Laplante but when pressed with regard thereto ""il paraissait un peu
gêné.""

The officers acknowledged that his information relative to
his relations with Mrs. Laplante, apart from some details, but corroborated
that which they had already received. In fact as regards the entire interview
Oggier deposed that they had received no new information of consequence but
their suspicions were strengthened. As yet, however, they concluded that they
did not have sufficient to justify the laying of an information and complaint.

Boudreau, after making these verbal statements to the
officers, consented to make a statement in writing. Bacon, the secretary of the
provincial police, was called to take down the statement and when completed
Tessier, Deputy Prothonotary, was called. He ascertained that Boudreau could
read, handed to him a copy of the statement which he followed as Tessier read
it aloud. Boudreau thereafter signed it and pledged his oath thereto before
Tessier.

Detective Oggier returned on Wednesday and Thursday to Lac
Castagnier where he continued his investigation and returned again to Amos
Thursday evening about 8.00 or 8.30. He and Detective-Sergeant Massue had
further conversation and decided to again question Boudreau. Oggier's
own explanation is as follows:

R. On a décidé tous les deux ensemble. J'ai
rencontré le sergent Massue à son bureau et je lui ai fait part de mon enquête
additionnelle au Lac Castagnier et on a décidé de le faire venir, de le mettre
sur ses gardes et de voir s'il était décidé de nous donner d'autres
informations.

D. Vous croyiez avoir une preuve contre lui et
vous vouliez avoir une déclaration de lui?

R. Lui, parce que je voyais que sa premiére
déclaration était pas complète.

Boudreau was brought into Massue's office at about 11.00
o'clock that night and there remained until about 1.00 o'clock in the morning. On
this occasion prior to any

[Page 280]

questions being asked Massue warned Boudreau. As to why the
warning was given Massue deposed: ""Parce que nous étions plus convaincus
que le mardi soir."" Immediately he had given the warning Massue asked the
appellant ""s'il avait des informations nouvelles à nous donner."" Oggier deposed: ""Il s'est assis et il a pensé et il a commencé à
conter la même histoire que la fois d'avant."" He also deposed: ""Le
sergent Massue a posé plusieurs questions concernant les armes à feu et madame
Laplante."" The appellant's gun used in committing the murder, his
revolver and some cartridges were shown to him during this interview. The sack
and the box found near the scene of the murder may or may not have been shown
to him. It was at this interview that Boudreau stated:
""Messieurs, vous le savez pas combien que j'aime cette femme-là."" At
some time during the interview the appellant became and remained very nervous.
After about half an hour Massue left his office to obtain a glass of water. As to what happened in his absence Oggier deposed:

Je lui ai dit que j'avais vu son pére et sa
mère et là il a dit: ""J'aime autant vous le dire, c'est moi qui l'a
tué."" J'ai lâché un cri et j'ai dit: ""Viens t'en de suite.""

In reply to their further questions Boudreau gave them the
details of the murder and consented to give a written statement. Then, as on
Tuesday evening, Bacon was called, later Tessier, before whom the statement was
signed and appellant pledged his oath thereto.

The learned trial judge admitted the first statement in
evidence because, in his opinion, it did not implicate the appellant but was
rather exculpatory in character. It did contain an alibi and an admission that
appellant owned a · 12 gun. The greater part, however, described his relations
with Mrs. Laplante, from which the jury might well find the motive that
prompted the murder. In this aspect the statement implicated the appellant in
the commission of the offence.

If you have acts seriously tending, when reasonably viewed,
to establish motive for the commission of a crime, then there can be no doubt
that such evidence is admissible, not merely to prove intent, but to prove the
fact as well. Ped Duff, C.J. in The King v. Barbour 57.

See also Lord Atkinson in Rex v. Ball 58.

[Page 281]

Then when both statements are read together the alibi is but
a contradiction of his subsequent confession and to that extent is evidence
that would be prejudicial to the appellant should any question of credibility
arise in the mind of the jury. The learned trial judge, with respect,
misdirected himself as to the significance of this statement as evidence
against the appellant.

On Thursday evening Massue and Oggier again
had the appellant, who was still under arrest, brought into the former's
office, ""… de voir s'il était décidé de nous donner d'autres informations
… parce que je voyais que sa première déclaration était pas complète.""

The important issue the learned trial judge had to determine
was whether the confession ""J'aime autant vous le dire, c'est moi qui l'a
tué,"" made to Oggier was free and voluntary within the meaning of the
authorities. These words are not in the written statement that followed. It is,
however, what led up to the making of this confession that is vital in
determining the issue, was it freely and voluntarily made. If in determining
whether a confession is freely and voluntarily made the trial judge does not
misdirect himself in law his finding should be accepted by an Appellate Court.
It appears that in this case the learned trial judge, apart from his
misdirection with regard to the first statement already dealt with, has
misdirected himself in not considering the warning as given in relation to all
the circumstances leading up to the making of this confession, including those
before as well as those after the warning was given, and particularly as to
whether, under all the circumstances, the effect of the warning as given had
not been destroyed. It is the sufficiency of the warning under all the
circumstances, the association of or connection between the two statements and
the effect of the questions asked that are raised in the dissenting opinion of
Mr. Justice Bissonnette.

The oft-quoted statement of the law by Lord Sumner in Ibraham
v. Rex 59, reads as follows:

It has long been established as a positive rule of English
criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against
him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement,
in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice
or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority. The
principle is as old as Lord Hale.

[Page 282]

In the Ibrahim case the accused was in custody when
Major Barrett came up to him and without any thought of a prosecution asked,
""Why have you done such a senseless act?"" to which the accused
replied, ""some three or four days he has been abusing me; without a doubt
I killed him."" Nothing more was said and no warning or caution had been
given. This confession was held to have been freely and voluntarily made and
therefore 'admissible. In this connection it is important to observe the
remarks of Lord Sumner relative to the question as asked:

In truth, except that Major Barrett's words were formally a
question they appear to have been indistinguishable from an exclamation of
dismay on the part of a humane officer, alike concerned for the position of the
accused, the fate of the deceased, and the credit of the regiment and the
service.

In Rex v. Voisin 60, no
warning was given and yet the evidence was admissible. There the murdered party
had not been identified. The police had a parcel containing a portion of the
remains on which appeared the words ""Bladie Belgiam"". Several
persons, including the accused, were held for questioning. At the request of
the police the accused wrote the words ""Bladie Belgiam"" in
handwriting that resembled and spelling identical with that on the parcel. Lawrence,
J. at p. 94 stated:

In this case the appellant wrote these words quite
voluntarily. The mere facts that they were police officers, or that the words
were written at their request, or that he was being detained at Bow Street do
not make the writing inadmissible in evidence … if the writing had turned out
other than it did and other circumstances had not subsequently happened it is
certain that he, like others who were similarly detained, would have been
discharged.

In Prosko v. The King 61, the
accused was held in custody by the United States immigration officials who
explained to the accused that they were taking proceedings for his deportation
to Canada. The accused then said, ""I am as good as dead if you send me
over there."" A constable asked why and the accused in the course of his
explanation included the confession tendered and admitted at his trial. No
warning was given and yet the statement was held to be freely and voluntarily
made and admissible in evidence.

These cases are illustrative of the principle that the
statement must in every case be voluntary. The mere fact

[Page 283]

that the confession was made by one in custody in response
to a question by one in authority without a warning given does not make it
inadmissible.

Then there are the cases such as Rex v. Knight
& Thayre 62, where a detective after warning the
accused questioned him for nearly three hours. Throughout the first two hours
the accused denied any knowledge of the fraud but during the last hour made the
confession tendered as evidence. Channell, J. stated, at p. 714:

The questioning was continued for a very long period, the
man's denials were not accepted, and the impression conveyed by Shinner to the
prisoner's mind may well have been this: ""You will have to tell me that
you did this thing, because I shall not let you go till you do so."" This
certainly cannot be said to be making a statement voluntarily. It may well be
that an admission made immediately after a caution had been given by the person
in authority would be admissible, but it does not follow that a suspended
person can be cross-examined until the person putting the questions is
satisfied.

These cases emphasize that whether the warning has or has
not been given it must be determined under all the circumstances of each case
if in fact the statement has been freely and voluntarily made.

There has developed a rule of practice that when the police
or others1 in authority have either arrested the accused or made up
their minds that he is the party whom they will prosecute then before being
questioned he should be cautioned or warned in a manner that will explain his
position much as a justice of the peace or magistrate does to an accused at the
conclusion of the Crown's evidence at a preliminary inquiry under sec. 684(2).
In Gach v. The King 63, it was the view of the majority of
this Court that the warning under the circumstances of that case should have
been given. The general language used has been construed to effect a change in
the law. Rex v. Scory 64. The general language construed as
effecting a change in the law was unnecessary to that decision. Moreover, that
case does not purport to overrule Prosko v. The King, supra, nor
any of the cases in which a statement has been received as voluntary although
no warning had been given, nor does it purport to hold that a statement should
be held to be voluntary where the warning has been given. In each case the
confession must be affirmatively proven

[Page 284]

by the Crown to have been freely and voluntarily made before
it can be received in evidence. The fact a warning has been given as well as
its content is an important circumstance to be considered. The Queen v. Thompson
65.


The circumstances from the outset pointed to Boudreau and,
as the police stated, caused them to be suspicious that he had committed the
murder. He was taken into custody on Sunday but not questioned until Tuesday
evening, when in reply to their questions he explained that at the time of the
murder he was in the woods caring for his traps and did not hear of Laplante's
death until he returned Saturday morning. He admitted ownership of a .12
gun and his relations with Mrs. Laplante. The following Thursday evening the
appellant was again brought into Massue's office to see if he had decided to
give them further information and because, as Oggier stated, he did not think
his first statement was complete.

The events of Thursday evening in these circumstances cannot
be segregated from those of Tuesday evening. The questions asked on Tuesday
evening, his alibi, his admission to ownership of a .12 gun
and his relations with Mrs. Laplante, the reasons why he was again questioned
on Thursday evening, as well as the questions asked, and all the incidents of
that evening are important factors. At the outset Thursday evening appellant
was warned and immediately asked by Massue the question already stated,
""s'il avait des informations nouvelles à nous donner,"" which directed
the appellant's mind at once to what he had said Tuesday evening. Then what is
of the greatest importance in this issue—apart from this first question, the
showing of the equipment used in the commission of the murder to the appellant,
the reference to his parents, the fact that other questions relative to the gun
and his relations with Mrs. Laplante were asked, and the nervous condition of
the appellant—is the evidence does not disclose what further questions were
asked or what transpired in that office immediately prior to the appellant's
confession. The events prior to and of that evening, including the actual words
of the confession, ""J'aime autant vous le dire, c'est moi qui l'a
tué,"" were important factors in the circumstances.

[Page 285]

The passage already quoted by Lord Sumner in the Ibrahim case
is an indication of the importance of the nature and character of the actual
questions asked. The three authorities, Ibrahim, Voisin and Prosko,
supra, as well as Sankey v. The King 66, all
emphasize the importance of considering the details leading up to a confession.

I do not subscribe to the view pressed by counsel for the
appellant that the warning necessarily should have included such words as would
have informed the appellant that, notwithstanding that he had already made one
statement, no matter what it contained he need not now make another or any
statement. Had such words been included they, of course, would have been a
factor. It is not, however, desirable that separate and distinct requirements
should be specified designed to cover specific situations; rather the issue to
be determined should remain in all cases, was the confession freely and
voluntarily made. The existence of a previous statement and the circumstances
under which it had been made may well be important in determining the issue in
a particular case. It was important here because the same officers were present
on each occasion. Immediately the warning was given the question asked directed
the appellant's attention to his previous statement and appellant himself began
by repeating the same history he had related on Tuesday evening. It was from
this beginning on Thursday evening that events led up to the confession. A
warning under such circumstances, when already he had given information in reply
to questions and when immediately after the warning he is further questioned by
the same parties in a manner that directed his mind to the information already
given, is quite different in its effect from a warning given before any
questions are asked.

The events of the two evenings upon all the facts of this
case were intimately associated by the officers themselves as well as by the
appellant and cannot be separated in considering the admissibility of the
statements made on these respective occasions. The courts have under such
circumstances always insisted that such confessions be

[Page 286]

received with care and caution. The statement of Chief
Justice Anglin in Sankey v. The King, supra, at p. 441, is appropriate:

It should always be borne in mind that while, on the one
hand, questioning of the accused by the police, if properly conducted and after
warning duly given, will not per se render his statement inadmissible,
on the other hand, the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the court
that anything in the nature of a confession or statement procured from, the
accused while under arrest was voluntary always rests with the Grown. The
King v. Bellos 67; Prosko v. The King 68.
That burden can rarely, if ever, be discharged merely by proof that the giving
of the statement was preceded by the customary warning and an expression of
opinion on oath by the police officer, who obtained it, that it was made freely
and voluntarily.

The learned trial judge's misdirection relative to the first
statement caused him to eliminate and not to consider what transpired prior to
the warning on Thursday evening. That which took place after the warning should
have been placed before the learned trial judge in greater detail. As Chief
Justice Anglin stated in Sankey v. The King, supra, at p. 441:

We think (that the police officer who obtained that
statement should have fully disclosed all that took place on each of the
occasions when he ""interviewed"" the prisoner …

The learned trial judge in proceeding to find 'that the
Crown had discharged the onus of proof and established that the statement was
freely and voluntarily made without these further details, in particular the
questions asked, the incidents surrounding the showing of the equipment used in
the commission of the murder, as well as all the other incidents of that half
hour, constituted a failure to direct himself as to that caution and care with
which evidence in such cases should be scrutinized.

The appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Malicious prosecution—Malice—Reasonable
and probable cause—Evidence—Judge's charge—Misdirection—Criminal Code s. 542—British Columbia Supreme Court Act R.S.C. 1936, c. 56, s. 60.

In an action for malicious prosecution, the judge's charge
amounted to misdirection, when, after properly saying that a want of reasonable
and probable cause was a circumstance from which the jury might infer malice,
he concluded that if malice was to be found at all in this case it was not
because of lack of reasonable and probable cause, although, in addition to some
evidence from which the jury might have inferred malice, there was also
evidence upon which the jury might have found want of reasonable and probable
cause.

Brown v. Hawkes (1891) 2 Q.B. 718 referred to.

APPEAL from the decision of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] dismissing (Smith J.A. dissenting) appellant's
appeal from the decision of Macfarlane J. dismissing an action for malicious
prosecution.

Sydney Pickles in person for the appellant.

R. D. Harvey K.C. for the
respondent.

[Page 240] 

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

LOCKE J.:—This is an appeal by
the plaintiff in an action for malicious prosecution from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] dismissing his appeal from a judgment of Macfarlane,
J. by which, after findings made by a jury, the action was dismissed. In the
Court of Appeal Sydney Smith, J.A. dissented and would have directed a new
trial.

The defendants, with the
exception of the defendant Weeks, are the executive officers of the Victoria
Branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Weeks is
employed by the Victoria Branch of the Society as an inspector and on February 19, 1947,
laid an information charging the plaintiff and his employee, one Longdon, with
having wantonly neglected to provide proper care to a sheep, thereby causing
unnecessary suffering. The charge was laid under sec. 542 of the Criminal
Code and the magistrate issued a summons. On March 6, 1947, the appellant
appeared, represented by counsel, and counsel instructed by the Victoria Branch
of the Society appeared for the prosecution and obtained leave from the
magistrate to withdraw this charge and to substitute the following charge
against the appellant alone:—

That Sydney Pickles, between
the 27th day of January, 1947, and the 4th day of February, 1947, in the
Municipality of the District of Saanich, in the County of Victoria, being the
owner of four sheep, namely, one sheep destroyed on or about the 3rd day of
February, 1947, at Sunstead Farm by Inspector Weeks of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and three others found dead there by the said
Weeks on the same day, did unlawfully cause unnecessary suffering by
unreasonably omitting to care for such animals contrary to the Criminal Code.

At the conclusion of the evidence
for the prosecution this charge was dismissed. The evidence taken at this
hearing was made part of the record in the action and it is quite clear that no
other disposition of the matter could properly have been made.

As, in my opinion, there should
be a new trial, it is inadvisable that there should be any extended comment on
the evidence adduced at the hearing. Briefly stated, the facts were that
following an anonymous report received on February 3, 1947,
by the defendant Florence G. Barr, the corresponding secretary of the Victoria
Branch, that the

[Page 241] 

sheep on the farm of the
appellant in the Municipality of Saanich were in bad shape, Weeks in company with
an assistant inspector named Hamer was sent to the farm to investigate. They
found, according to their evidence, a flock of about a hundred sheep of which,
according to Hamer, all but ten or twelve were in good shape. In addition, they
found two dead sheep and a dead lamb in or near the barn and in the field
nearby a sheep lying on its side struggling and evidently in an extremity. The
appellant who lived in Victoria was not present but, with Longdon's consent, the inspectors
shot the sheep and a postmortem performed by a veterinary surgeon on the
following day disclosed that the animal was suffering from an infestation of
worms in its stomach and small intestines and fatty degeneration of the liver.
Certain further inquiries were made by the inspectors and written reports
submitted to a meeting of the members of the Executive on February 4, on which
date a resolution was passed instructing that the opinion of one McIntyre,
described in the resolution as a sheep expert, and that of Mr. C. L. Harrison,
the city prosecutor for Victoria, be obtained. A further report of the
veterinary surgeon made to the appellant on the day following the visit of the
inspectors to the farm, and a copy of which was made available to them, recommended
that the worming of the flock was necessary but, because of the inclement
weather, it would not be advisable to do so at the time and in the meantime
advised giving the animals free access to phenotiazine mixed with salt. On
February 12, following a further report from the defendant Weeks, the minutes
disclose that ""it was decided to lay a charge against Mr. Pickles in
regard to one sheep found in a suffering and dying condition."" It was not,
however, until the 17th of February that the defendant Weeks and Florence G.
Barr laid the matter before Mr. Harrison who gave evidence that, after
considering the facts and particularly noting that there was nothing to
indicate that the appellant knew anything about the sheep being ill which had
been found lying in the field and had been destroyed and that the veterinarian
had said it would not be apparent to the farmer that the sheep was sick until
it laid down to die, he advised them not to lay a charge without consulting
their solicitor and 

[Page 242]

getting advice on it and told
them that he (Harrison) would not lay the charge or recommend that it be laid.
On the day following, however, Weeks saw Harrison and showed him an information which had been
prepared charging the appellant with wantonly neglecting to provide proper care
to a sheep, thereby causing unnecessary suffering. On being asked by Mr.
Harrison whether he had got the advice of their lawyer Weeks replied in the
negative and was then advised not to swear the information. The charge was,
however, laid by Weeks on February 20 and the matter thereafter dealt with as
above stated.

It should be said that there was
a conflict as to what had actually transpired between Mr. Harrison and these
two defendants on February 17th and in his discussion with Weeks on the day
following. According to Mrs. Barr, Mr. Harrison had told them to go ahead and
prosecute and to have Mr. Harvey, K.C. handle the prosecution. According to the
defendant Weeks, Mr. Harrison had told them to go ahead and that when he had
shown the latter the information which had been drafted he had approved of it.
Upon this evidence the jury found that Mr. Harrison's evidence was true and
that the statements which the defendant Weeks and Florence G. Barr claimed to
have been made to them by him were not made. To these findings, however, a
rider was added to which further reference will be made.

In charging the jury the learned
trial judge informed them that he proposed to ask them to make certain findings
of fact and that, dependent upon the nature of their findings, he would decide
the question as to whether there was a want of reasonable and probable cause.
After reviewing the evidence the learned judge said in part:—

I think those, gentlemen,
are the things to which I will direct your attention when you come to consider
the questions I will put to you, and upon which I will direct you as to my
finding, as to reasonable and probable cause. If you find that Mr. Harrison
warned him not to take this prosecution without getting the advice of Counsel,
and that he did so without getting it, that evidence goes to show that they had
not reasonable cause.

On the other hand, you have
the evidence of Mr. McIntyre. Did Mr. McIntyre advise him that there was
evidence of neglect, or just what was the nature of his comments in connection
with that? Were they conditional only, or were they such as a reasonable person
would act upon in coming to the decision that the charge should be laid? Was it


[Page 243]

evidence of neglect, the
evidence of the existence of a state of circumstances which would reasonably
lead any ordinarily prudent and cautious man placed in the position of Weeks,
to come to the conclusion that the person charged was probably guilty of the
crime accused?

That is the extent of the
obligation, and I am asking you questions so I can find out whether or not that
is true. I am going to ask you a question with regard to Dr. Bruce, as to what
he told them, and with regard to Colonel Evans. When I have put before you
those questions and you have answered them, if you answer that Dr. Bruce's
evidence is the evidence to be accepted, that Mr. Harrison's evidence is the
evidence to be accepted, that Colonel Evans' is the evidence to be accepted
then I would instruct you that my verdict would be that the plaintiff has
established that there was want of reasonable and probable cause.

If, on the other hand, you
think that Mr. Weeks' evidence where it is contradicted by those other men, is
the evidence to be accepted, and that Mrs. Barr's evidence is the evidence to
be accepted; and that Mr. McIntyre gave them a firm opinion that there was
neglect under the circumstances, and in your opinion the circumstances were
properly described to him, then I would advise you that the plaintiff has not
satisfied the onus that was on him.

Upon the jury retiring a
discussion ensued between the learned trial judge and counsel as to certain
aspects of the charge and the jury was recalled. In the further charge then
delivered the following passage appears:—

Now I mentioned malice in my
charge this morning. There is a provision in law that you may infer malice from
want of reasonable and probable cause, but you are by no means bound to do so.
In determining the question of malice, the jury may, but are not bound to, find
malice in the absence of reasonable and probable cause. You are not obliged to
find malice, although both must be found in order that the plaintiff may
succeed; unless he proves both lack of reasonable and probable cause and
malice, he fails in the action. You may infer malice from some lack of
reasonable and probable cause, but there is evidence here directed to the
question of malice, which I have referred to in my charge, and I do not think
that question needs to arise here. If you find malice at all, you will find it,
not because of lack of reasonable and probable cause in this case, but because
of the fact that the prosecution was undertaken from motives other than those I
have described as proper.

and it was with this final
instruction that the jury retired and arrived at their verdict.

The questions asked and the
answers made were as follows:

Question 1: ""Were the
statements which Mr. Harrison says he made to Inspector Weeks and Mrs Barr in
fact made to them?"" Answer: ""Yes.""

Question 2: ""Were the
statements which Inspector Weeks and Mrs. Barr say that Mr. Harrison made to
them in fact made to them?"" Answer: ""No."" Rider: ""We feel
that there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation of Mr. Harrison's
instructions.""

Question 3: ""Did Mr.
Bruce make the statements which Weeks attributed to him on February 7th?""
Answer: ""Yes.""

[Page 244]

Question 4: ""Were the
statements attributed to Colonel Evans by Mrs. Barr and Inspector Weeks made to
them respectively by him?"" Answer: ""Yes.""

Question 5: ""Did Mr.
McIntyre give his opinion that there was neglect as a final opinion on the
facts stated by Weeks?"" Answer: ""No.""

Question 6: ""Did Mr.
McIntyre express the opinion subject to confirmation after he had seen the
sheep?"" Answer: ""Yes.""

Question 7: ""Was the
evidence on which Weeks acted reasonably apparent to him to be unreliable or
incomplete?"" Answer: ""No.""

Question 8: ""Did Weeks
honestly believe, taking into consideration all the statements as you find them
made on the evidence in this case, that Pickles was probably guilty of the
offence charged?"" Answer: ""Yes.""

Question 9: ""Did Weeks
lay the Information or either of them maliciously, that is, from any motive
other than an honest desire to bring a person (that is the plaintiff) whom he
believed to be a guilty person to justice?"" Answer: ""No.""

Question 10: ""Did any
of the remaining defendants authorize the prosecution of the plaintiff
maliciously?"" Answer: ""No.""

Question 11: ""If so,
which defendant?"" No answer.

Question 12:
""Regardless to your answers to the above questions, give total damages
suffered by the plaintiff: (a) 'for Special damages.' "" Answer:
""$403.94."" (b) ""for General damages."" Answer:
""Nil.""

As to the rider attached to the
answer to the second question it must, in my opinion, be rejected. It had not
been suggested either by the defendant Florence G. Barr or by the defendant
Weeks that they had misunderstood the advice given to them by Mr. Harrison on
February 17th; rather had they both attributed to him statements which the jury
found as a fact had not been made. There was in truth no possibility of
misunderstanding the advice given by Mr. Harrison to these two defendants or
that given by him to Weeks on the following day. The suggestion made in the
rider that there was a misunderstanding contradicts the jury's findings in
Question 1, that the statements which Mr. Harrison said he had made were in
truth made, since those statements were incapable of misinterpretation. The
jury had also found that the statements of Weeks and Mrs. Barr that Mr.
Harrison had told them ""to go ahead"" were untrue. As these findings
were made in response to direct questions, the rider which is inconsistent with
the answers should be rejected.

As to Questions 3 to 6 inclusive,
the learned trial judge had informed the jury that if they accepted the
evidence of Doctor Bruce, Colonel Evans and Mr. Harrison he would instruct them
that he would decide that the plaintiff had established that there was want of
reasonable and probable

[Page 245]

cause. He had said further that
if they believed the evidence of Weeks and Mrs. Barr in preference to that of
Bruce, Evans and Harrison, and if they found that McIntyre gave them a firm
opinion that there was neglect under the circumstances, he would advise them
that the plaintiff had not proven a want of reasonable and probable cause. The
jury, however, as has been pointed out, accepted the evidence of Mr. Harrison
and found that McIntyre had only expressed his opinion subject to confirmation
after he had seen the sheep, while accepting the evidence of Weeks and Mrs.
Barr where it contradicted that of Evans and Bruce. This contingency was not
provided for in the charge so that if in fact the jury interpreted the
concluding portion of the judge's charge as a direction that they were to
consider whether there was a want of reasonable and probable cause in answering
Questions 9 and 10 which were directed to malice, they were without any
instructions as to whether a want of reasonable and probable cause had been
shown. That question was one for the trial judge to determine and in the
situation created by the answers made to Questions 1 and 6 inclusive the jury
acted without instructions. In Brown v. Hawkes [3],
Cave, J. said in part:—

There may be such plain want
of reasonable and probable cause that the jury may come to the conclusion that
the prosecutor could not honestly have believed in the charge he made and in
that case want of reasonable and probable cause is evidence of malice.

It is impossible in the present
case to know whether this aspect of the matter was even considered by the jury
or, if it was, upon what basis they proceeded. This, I think, is a fatal
objection to the verdict and the judgment entered.

If it is wrong to assume that the
jury understood from the concluding portion of the charge that a want of
reasonable and probable cause was a circumstance from which they might infer
malice and accepted the concluding part of the direction that, if malice was to
be found at all, it was not because of lack of reasonable and probable cause,
there was misdirection. The plaintiff had, it is true, adduced some other
evidence from which the jury might have inferred that the prosecution had been
initiated

[Page 246]

maliciously but, in addition to
this, there was evidence upon which the plaintiff might properly contend that
there was a plain want of reasonable and probable cause.

The appeal should be allowed with
costs and a new trial directed. No objection was made to that portion of the
judge's charge which, in my view, was misdirection, though counsel for the
plaintiff had in the earlier discussion made it clear that he contended that
from a want of reasonable and probable cause malice could be inferred. Having
in mind the provisions of sec. 60 of the Supreme Court Act, cap. 56,
R.S.B.C. 1936, and in the exercise of the powers vested in this Court there
should be no costs to either party in the Court of Appeal. The costs of the
first trial should be in the discretion of the presiding judge at the new
trial.

Appeal allowed with
costs; new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Trial judge sitting alone
acquitting on reasonable doubt at close of Crown’s case—No election by accused
as to adducing evidence—Appeal on question of law—Criminal Code ss. 839, 944, 1013(4).

The accused, on a charge of unlawful
possession of a drug, was tried by a judge sitting without a jury under Part
XVIII of the Criminal

[Page 173]

Code. At the close of the case for the Crown,
the accused, before making his election to call or not to call evidence, moved
to dismiss for lack of “sufficient evidence which could legally and properly
support a conviction”. The trial judge thereupon dismissed the charge because
of reasonable doubt arising upon the evidence of the Crown. The majority in the
Court of Appeal upheld the acquittal.

Held: The
trial judge having the same power as to acquitting or convicting as a jury and
no more, could only have decided whether or not there was evidence upon which
the jury might convict. The question of reasonable doubt did not arise at that
stage.

Held: In the
light of the evidence which the Crown submitted, the case could not have been
withdrawn from the jury nor could it have been submitted to the jury until it
was known that the evidence had been completed.

Roach1, the appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.

TASCHEREAU J.:—I agree that this appeal should
be allowed and a new trial directed.

The judgment of Rand, Kellock and Locke JJ. was
delivered by

KELLOCK J.:—This appeal should, in my opinion,
be allowed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Roach[2] in his dissenting judgment in the court
below. The correctness of that judgment is emphasized by the position taken in
this court by counsel for the respondent who contended that, had he failed in
the application made by him to the trial judge, he considered that he still had
the right, should

[Page 174]

he so elect, to call evidence on behalf of the
defence. His argument, as presented to this court therefore, involved the
proposition that, at the close of the case for the prosecution, the trial judge
had the right to try the case on the evidence adduced by the Crown, and if he
came to the conclusion not that he could, but that he would convict, then there
should be another trial upon that evidence together with any further evidence
called on behalf of the accused. Needless to say, no authority was cited
in support of this contention.

In Metropolitan Rly. Co. v. Jackson[3], Lord Cairns said:

The Judge has a certain duty to discharge,
and the jurors have another and a different duty. The Judge has to say whether
any facts have been established by evidence from which negligence may be reasonably
inferred; the jurors have to say whether, from those facts, submitted to them,
negligence ought to be inferred. It is, in my opinion, of the greatest
importance in the administration of justice that these separate functions
should be maintained, and should be maintained distinct.

This statement of the law is, of course, not
limited to civil actions. It is equally applicable to a criminal as to a civil
proceeding; Regina v. Lloyd[4];
The King v. Hopper[5].

The learned trial judge did not, in my opinion,
keep these functions distinct. The fact that he was sitting without a jury made
no difference. He had the same power as to acquitting or convicting as a jury
would have had; section 835. He had no additional power. By
section 944(1) it is provided that if an accused person is defended by
counsel, such counsel “shall”, at the end of the case for the prosecution,
declare whether or not he intends to adduce evidence on behalf of the accused
and if he does not thereupon announce such intention, counsel for the
prosecution may make his address.

The learned trial judge, upon the conclusion of
the case for the Crown asked counsel for the defence if he were calling any
evidence. That question was not answered, but a motion to dismiss for lack of
“sufficient evidence which could legally and properly support a
conviction” was made. It is clear, I think, that no other application

[Page 175]

could have been made at that stage in the
absence of an election on the part of the defence to call or not to call
evidence. Had a jury been present, the learned trial judge could have done no
more, on the application of the defence, than have decided whether or not there
was evidence upon which the jury might convict; The King v. Comba[6]. Had he ruled adversely to the Crown in the
present case he would clearly, in my opinion, have been wrong in law in the
light of the evidence which the Crown had submitted; Girvin v. The
King[7]. He
would have had no right, as he in fact did, to proceed to weigh the evidence
until all the evidence was in. The decisions are uniform.

In Rex v. Perreault[8], counsel for the defence moved for a
non-suit at the conclusion of the case for the Crown and before declaring
that he had no witnesses, on the ground that a fact material to the Crown’s
case had not been proved. The Crown thereupon moved to reopen its case to
supply this lack. Langlais J. in the Superior Court of Quebec said at p. 237:

Counsel for the defence could have declared
that he had no evidence to offer and then he would have raised this question of
lack of an essential element in his pleading (argument),… and then I would have
been obliged to declare to the jury that this element was lacking.

In Perry v. The King[9], in the Supreme Court of Prince Edward
Island, on appeal from a summary conviction, Campbell C.J. said at p. 242:

On the conclusion of the evidence for the
respondent, counsel for the appellant has moved that the appeal be allowed, as
no prima facie case of guilt had been proved against the appellant. No
authorities were cited to indicate just what cogency of proof is required to
establish a prima facie case at that stage, and I have not run across
any case in which the point was settled. I presume, therefore, that, in order
to put the accused on his defence, a Judge or Magistrate sitting alone need
find only such evidence as would entitle the Crown, in a jury case, to have the
facts left to the decision of the jury. In other words, the criterion would be
whether the evidence is such as a jury might, in the absence of contradiction
or explanation, reasonably and properly convict upon. This view is supported by
the wording of the Code, s. 726, which provides that the Justice shall consider
the whole matter after hearing what each party has to say and the witnesses and
evidence adduced. The Justice or Judge, therefore, apparently does not exercise
the function of a jury until both sides have completed their case; and the
question of proof beyond reasonable doubt does not arise at this stage.

[Page 176]

I do not think, in view of section 944,
made applicable to the case at bar by section 839, that the lack of any
inference to be drawn from section 726 affects the relevancy of the above
decision.

Again in Rex v. Olsen[10], also an appeal from a summary conviction,
a magistrate had dismissed the charge at the conclusion of the case for the
Crown without calling upon the defence. The case, like that at bar,
involved a charge under sec. 4(1) (d) of the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act, 1929. The British Columbia Court of Appeal unanimously
set aside the acquittal. O’Halloran J.A. said at p. 66:

I am of opinion, with respect, that the
Crown in the circumstances here made out a case warranting conviction in the
absence of any defence which might have been disclosed if the defence had been
called upon. But the learned magistrate dismissed the case without calling upon
the defence. With respect the case ought not to have been dismissed as it was.
I must conclude there was no proper trial in the true legal sense.

To borrow the language of Viscount Sankey, L.C.,
in Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions[11]:

… it is not till the end of the evidence
that a verdict can properly be found…

In the words of section 944(2) it is only
when all the evidence is concluded that counsel for the defence, or the
accused himself, as the case may be, may sum up the evidence. The public has an
interest in the proper trial of accused persons and I do not think that the
fact that counsel for the Crown at the trial apparently failed to realize at
the time that the learned trial judge was going beyond the application made to
him should, in the circumstances, be allowed to influence the result, particularly
in view of the fact that the position of the respondent in this court, as
already mentioned, is that the stage had never been reached when he had elected
whether he would or would not call evidence. Had the question put to him with
respect to that matter been insisted upon, and evidence been called, the case
could only have been disposed of on the whole of the evidence; The King v.
Joseph Power[12]; Rex
v. Lenton[13].

The case on the Crown’s evidence could not have
been withdrawn from the jury nor could it have been submitted

[Page 177]

to the jury until it was known that the evidence
had been completed. Counsel for the respondent tells us he does not yet know
whether or not the evidence was complete. In my opinion there must be a new
trial.

Appeal allowed; new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM
THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal
law—Arson—Accessory—Aiding and abetting—Active part—Presence during commission
of crime—Failure to leave or protest—Charge to jury—Duty to review evidence—Comments
and suggestions by trial judge—Criminal Code, ss. 69, 511, 1014(2).

Appellant was charged with
having set fire to a school. At trial before a jury, the contention of the
Crown was that (a) he had actually set the fire, or (b) he had
formed a common intent with one Bryan to burn the school, or (c) he had
aided, abetted, counselled or procured Bryan to set the fire pursuant to
section 69 of the Criminal Code. On the offence of aiding and abetting, there
was evidence that they had a conversation respecting the burning of schools,
that he drove with Bryan to the scene of the crime, that some gasoline was
purchased and that accused made statements in a restaurant to the effect that
they were out to burn schools. Although accused was there when the crime was
committed, he alleged that he was unaware of the intention of Bryan to fire the
building, took no active part and remained in the car. The majority of the
Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction.

[Page 157]

Held, Kellock and Locke JJ. dissenting, that the trial
judge's charge, as a whole, properly directed the jury that they must find some
act of participation on the part of the accused before they can find him guilty
of aiding and abetting.

Held also, that the trial judge has a duty to review the
evidence in relation to the issues and he has the privilege of making such
comments and suggestions as will be of assistance to the jury, provided that he
does not seek to impose his views upon nor in any way relieve the jury of their
responsibility to find the facts.

Per Kellock and Locke JJ. (dissenting): The portion of
the charge dealing with aiding and abetting tended to lead the jury to
understand that mere presence at the scene of the crime, the failure of the
accused to get out of the car earlier in the evening when his companion had
made some general statements to the effect that he approved the burning of
schools and his failure to telephone the police, constituted aiding and
abetting and there should be a new trial.

Mohun's case (1693) Holt K.B. 479; Reg. v. Coney
(1882) 8 Q.B.D. 534 and Rex v. O'Donnell (1917) 12 Cr. App. R.
219 referred to.

APPEAL
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissing
(O'Halloran J.A. dissenting) the appellant's appeal from his conviction, at
trial before Manson J. and a jury, on a charge of having set fire to a school.

The
material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above
head note and in the judgments now reported.

Thomas
F. Hurley for the appellant.

George
R. McQuarrie for the respondent.

The
judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin and Estey, JJ. was delivered by:—

ESTEY
J.:—The appellant and Nick Bryan were charged jointly with having set fire to
the Queen Elizabeth School House on Lulu Island in New Westminster, January 31, 1948, contrary to sec. 511 of the Criminal Code. At their trial before a jury,
after a number of witnesses had been heard, the learned trial Judge directed
that the case be continued against the appellant only and that of Bryan adjourned. The appellant was convicted and upon his appeal to the Court of Appeal in
British Columbia the majority of the learned Judges in that Court affirmed the 

[Page 158]

conviction.
Mr. Justice O'Halloran dissented and by virtue thereof the appellant appeals to
this Court under sec. 1023 of the Criminal Code.

The
evidence left no doubt but that either appellant or Bryan set fire to the Queen Elizabeth School. There was evidence upon which the jury might have found that the
appellant actually set the fire. However, the main contention of the Crown was
that appellant and Bryan had formed a common intention, either in Vancouver or
prior to the setting of the fire, to burn one or more school houses; or
alternatively, if that common intention did not exist and Bryan set the fire
that the appellant had aided, abetted, counselled or procured Bryan to set the
fire and was, therefore, under the provisions of sec. 69 of the Criminal Code,
a party to the offence.

The
evidence established that the Queen Elizabeth School was set on fire about
11.30 Saturday night, January 31, 1948, by either the appellant or Nick Bryan.
These two had been together from the time they met in Vancouver, at the office
where Nick Bryan was employed, at about 4.40 that afternoon, until they were
apprehended in Bryan's automobile a few minutes after the burning of the Queen Elizabeth School. The contention on behalf of the appellant was that he knew Bryan
only as a real estate agent and that they had set out from Vancouver at about
8.45 that night in order that Bryan might show him some properties in or near
New Westminster that the appellant might accept at least in part payment for a
rooming house, which he deposed he owned in Vancouver and which he had listed
for sale with Bryan; that he was not in any way a party to setting fire to the
school house.

Appellant
in giving evidence on his own behalf stated that on the way to New Westminster they stopped at a filling station where Bryan purchased a can of gasoline.
This can, when purchased at the filling station, was by the attendant. placed
just behind the front seat in Bryan's two-door coach while the appellant was
sitting in the front seat. He deposed that he did not see that can so placed
nor the bottle of motor oil that the attendant said he saw either appellant or Bryan pass over the front seat. Eventually Bryan's car was parked opposite the Queen Elizabeth School, the can of gasoline purchased at the filling station

[Page 159]

taken
therefrom and the fire set. Hamilton, driving a taxi with three passengers,
came up in time to see the party who set the fire go from the school house, get
into the automobile and drive away at an increasing speed. Hamilton pursued
them and notified the police.

The
issues were defined and the evidence reviewed in relation thereto by the
learned trial Judge. The objections to his charge in the dissenting opinion of
Mr. Justice O'Halloran are set out in six paragraphs of the formal judgment.

First,
that the charge confused in the minds of the jury the evidence relating to the
appellant as the one who actually set the fire and that of one aiding and
abetting, as the learned trial Judge treated the case against the appellant as
if it were one of common intention from the outset and that it did not matter
whether Bryan or the appellant set the fire. The evidence upon which the jury might
have found the appellant guilty of having actually set the fire was very short
and will be more fully discussed later. It was reviewed by the learned trial
Judge but not in any way did he relate it to or discuss it in relation to the
appellant as one who was acting pursuant to a common intent (although if he did
set the fire it might have been in carrying out a common intent), or as one who
aided and abetted. More than once the learned trial Judge made it plain that
the appellant could be found guilty as one aiding, abetting, counselling and
procuring only if they found that Bryan actually set the fire. It is possible
in explaining and discussing aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring that
the learned trial Judge interposed remarks relative to the main contention of
the Crown, that the appellant and Bryan were acting pursuant to a common
intent, with such emphasis that the jury may have concluded, in order to find
the appellant did aid, abet, counsel or procure, they must find that he had a
common intention with Bryan up to and at the time of the setting of the fire.
Instructions to that effect would be in error. In order to find the appellant
guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring, it is only necessary to
show that he understood what was taking place and by some act on his part
encouraged or assisted in the attainment thereof. Re Bernard

[Page 160]

Albert Kupferberg [1].
In so far, however, as such confusion may have been created in this regard, it
favoured rather than prejudiced the appellant.

The
second ground is that the learned trial Judge did not put to the jury the
weaknesses of the evidence of the Crown witnesses relative to the appellant
starting the fire instead of Bryan. The only evidence indicating that the
appellant had set the fire was that of the two ladies in the back seat of Hamilton's taxi. They said the man who ran from the school entered the automobile on the
side opposite to that of the driver, or the side upon which appellant was
seated. The learned trial Judge in referring to this evidence not only stated
that it was suggested one of them had made a contrary statement at the
preliminary hearing, although that was not proved, but pointed out that
Hamilton's evidence was to the effect that the man had entered the driver's side,
and commented favourably on his credibility. He also referred to the other man
in the taxi who, while he had seen the man running, had not observed upon which
side he entered the automobile. It would appear that the learned trial Judge
not only indicated the possible weakness in the Crown's evidence, but rather
emphasized Hamilton's contrary evidence.

The
third ground of dissent is on the basis of the omission of the learned trial
Judge to instruct the jury that mere passive presence is not aiding and abetting.
In discussing the meaning of aiding and abetting the learned Judge plainly
indicated that in order to find the appellant guilty of aiding, abetting,
counselling or procuring they must find that he took some active part. He
emphasized this when dealing with the defence, which at one point he summarized
as follows: ""I'm not guilty. I hadn't anything whatever to do with this.
The other man was wholly responsible. I was just an unwilling passenger.""
Other statements to like effect in his charge are quoted in dealing with the
fifth ground. In referring to a slightly different matter, but also important
in this connection, the learned trial Judge pointed out that the Crown directed
the attention of the jury to the active acts rather than to the mere acts of
omission on appellant's part. Mere presence does not constitute aiding and
abetting but presence under

[Page 161]

certain
circumstances may itself be evidence thereof. Mohun's Case [2];
Reg. v. Young [3];
The Queen v. Coney [4].
In this case the appellant admitted and explained his presence. If the jury
accepted his explanation as above summarized then the effect of the learned
Judge's direction was that they should find the appellant not guilty. In
determining whether they would accept his explanation the jury would properly
take into account all the facts, including the conversations relative to
burning schools, first at the office in Vancouver and later in the evening, the
protests and threats which the appellant deposed he had made to Bryan, as well
as his assuring Bryan a short time before the fire was set that if the latter
did anything wrong he would tell the truth. Under the circumstances of this
case the jury would take into account appellant's conduct in relation to the
other events during the evening and it was the duty of the learned trial Judge
in reviewing the evidence to place before the jury both the contentions of the
appellant and of the Crown. If appellant's explanation was not believed by the
jury there was evidence in addition to his mere presence upon which they might
well conclude that he was guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring.
In this regard the charge to the jury read as a whole was to the effect that
before the jury could find the appellant guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling
or procuring they must be satisfied of some act of participation on his part.
In relation to the evidence and the issues the charge in this regard is not
subject to exception on the part of the appellant.

The
fourth ground of dissent is based upon the contention that the learned trial
Judge neglected to charge the jury that if they accepted the evidence of the
appellant he was entitled to be acquitted. These precise words were not used
but the charge as a whole, and particularly those portions contrasting the
evidence of appellant with that of the Crown, would leave but one impression
upon the minds of the jury that if they believed appellant's evidence to the
effect that he was throughout concerned only with a real estate deal and was
but a passenger who never realized what Bryan had in mind, then and in that
event

[Page 162]

he
was not guilty of the offence as charged. In this regard it is appropriate to
quote the language of the Lord Chief Justice speaking for the Court of Criminal
Appeal in Rex v. Stoddart [5]:

Every
summing-up must be regarded in the light of the conduct of the trial and the
questions which have been raised by the counsel for the prosecution and for the
defence respectively. This Court does not sit to consider whether this or that
phrase was the best that might have been chosen, or whether a direction which
has been attacked might have been fuller or more conveniently expressed, or
whether such topics which might have been dealt with on other occasions should
be introduced. This Court sits here to administer justice and to deal with
valid objections to matters which may have led to a miscarriage of justice.

The
charge upon this point left no doubt in the minds of the jury that they were to
find the appellant not guilty unless they were satisfied that he either set the
fire, acted throughout with a common intent or aided, abetted, counselled or
procured Bryan to commit the offence.

Counsel
for the appellant at the hearing of this appeal particularly stressed the fifth
ground of dissent—to the effect that the charge as a whole suggested the guilt
of appellant, discounted his evidence, minimized his real defence and did not
state his contention in a way that brought out the real force and effect of his
defence. The learned trial Judge defined the issues and reviewed the evidence
in relation thereto. He reviewed the appellant's evidence and concisely stated
the contention of the defence. In reviewing the latter's evidence he pointed
out that as a witness the appellant was an interested party and discussed his
evidence in relation to what might be expected under all of the circumstances.
The learned Judge was not apt in one of his comparisons, but he went on
immediately to state: ""Just because this man has an interest, you must not
for a moment say his story is untrue. It may be true, that is to say, apart
from other circumstances, the fact that he tells it doesn't render it
untrue."" He reviewed the history of the appellant as he, himself, had
stated it, which set forth a commendable record, including a reference to the
fact that the appellant did not adhere to the Dukhobor faith and was not a
member of the Sons of Freedom. The learned trial Judge concluded his review:
""Now, there is the summary of it. 'I had no common intent with Bryan to burn this school. I did not take any active part in

[Page 163]

setting
a fire.' That is the defence."" Then when giving further instructions, he
again stated that the appellant says: ""I'm entirely innocent. True, I was
there all the time and I made these statements in the restaurant and all that,
but despite all that, I wasn't in it. I was just an unwilling spectator of what
occurred."" Appellant's evidence was directed to two main points (1) Bryan set the fire and (2) that appellant did not realize the possibility of Bryan setting a fire and was in no way a party thereto. The foregoing summary briefly,
effectively and forcefully emphasizes the real defence. The learned trial Judge
unfortunately did state that the Crown could not have called Bryan as a
witness, but here again he went on to point out that they were not trying
Bryan, that Preston alone was before the Court and made it plain that it was
only the evidence before them that the jury could take cognizance of.

Counsel
for the appellant took exception to the fact that the learned trial Judge
expressed the view that Bryan in making the statement at appellant's rooming
house that ""the house is going to be sold tonight"" in the presence of
Mrs. Dodderidge sounded like liquor and thereby depreciated that evidence to
the prejudice of the appellant. The evidence disclosed that they had been
drinking whiskey and beer and this comment on the part of the learned trial
Judge was but an expression of his view, which the jury need not have accepted.

It
is the duty of a trial Judge to review the evidence in relation to the issues
and it is his privilege to make such comments and suggestions as will be of
assistance to the jury in arriving at their verdict, always subject to this,
that he must not seek to impose his views upon nor in any way relieve the jury
of their responsibility to find the facts. Rex v. O'Donnell [6].
Throughout he impressed upon the jury that the facts were to be found by them
and that in so doing they should not act upon any view he might express unless
they agreed therewith, and further, that if he neglected to mention any portion
of the evidence they should, nevertheless, take it into consideration in
arriving at their verdict.

The
sixth ground of dissent is to the effect that the learned trial Judge did not
instruct the jury that the

[Page 164]

evidence
against the appellant was inferential and entirely circumstantial, that his
defence was consistent with truth and that of aiding and abetting pointed to a
rational hypothesis of innocence. The learned trial Judge correctly pointed out
that the evidence of aiding and abetting was not inferential and entirely
circumstantial. Apart from any other item of evidence, the remarks in the
restaurant constituted direct evidence against the appellant. Notwithstanding
this, the learned trial Judge did instruct the jury with regard to
circumstantial evidence and that if their verdict depended upon circumstantial
evidence, he stated: ""Before you can find the prisoner 'guilty' on
circumstantial evidence, you must be satisfied not only that the circumstances
proved are consistent with his having committed the act, but you must also be
satisfied that the facts are such to be inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion than that the prisoner is the guilty person."" This language is
almost identical with that in Hodge's Case [7]
which has been repeatedly approved. McLean v. The King [8].

The
foregoing objections cannot, with respect, be supported. The charge of the
learned trial Judge read as a whole set forth the issues and reviewed the facts
in relation thereto in a manner that placed the case for the defence fully and
fairly before the jury.

The
appeal should be dismissed.

KELLOCK
J. (dissenting):—I desire to refer to two only of the grounds of the dissenting
judgment of O'Halloran J.A. The third, with which I shall first deal, is as
follows:

3.
The learned Judge did not instruct the jury upon the legal meaning of aiding
and abetting directed to the evidence presented by the Crown and the defence;
for example, he did not instruct the jury that passive presence is not aiding
and abetting.

The
jury, having deliberated some two hours after having been charged by the
learned trial judge, returned to the court room, the foreman stating that they
would like the court to explain to them the meaning of the word
""accessory"".

Thereupon
the learned trial judge told them that an accessory before the fact was a
person ""who does or omits

[Page 165]

an
act for the purpose of aiding anyone to commit the offence; abets, that is
assists or encourages any person in the commission of the offence; or who
counsels or procures any person to commit the offence.""

In
elaboration of that he said that if they were satisfied that Preston and Bryan
set out with a common intention of burning a school (subsequently he told them
it was not necessary that the two had had the common intention from the outset)
and that Preston ""assisted in any way either by active part or by omission""
he would be an accessory and as guilty as the man who actually lit the match.
The learned judge then said that he did not recall that there was anything in
the way of omission which had been suggested but that the Crown had directed
attention to Preston's ""active acts"". Very shortly after so stating,
however, he said:

Then
the Crown directs your attention to the fact that he didn't do anything about
it despite the statements of this man (Bryan) out across the bridge beside a
school, and that he didn't protest or do anything at the time of the actual
setting of the fire. They say, ""Look at his conduct. Is that the conduct
of an innocent man?""

In
his original charge he had referred to this matter as follows:

I
perhaps missed one thing in presenting the Crown's case. The Crown laid stress
on the point—that point was well enough taken by Mr. McQuarrie—The Crown says
""Well, why did this man not get out of the car and leave him, particularly
when they came back to Westminster from across the Fraser River bridge?""
Why in the world didn't he say ""Bryan, I don't like the way you are
behaving"". Or, why didn't he telephone the police? The Crown makes that
point. You will have it in mind.

While
it was perfectly in order for the learned trial judge to direct the jury's
attention to the appellant's conduct as a whole for the purpose of determining
what weight they should give to his evidence, I think that when it came to an
explanation of the meaning of abetting in relation to the evidence the jury may
well have been misled into an understanding that they might find in the things
the appellant did not do, and which were enumerated to them, evidence which in
itself amounted to abetting. In this I think there was error.

To
constitute a person a party to a criminal offence within the meaning of section
69 (1) (c) of the Criminal Code, it is necessary that there be
""participation"" in the crime and although a person is present while a
crime is 

[Page 166]

being
committed, yet if he takes no part in it and does not act in concert with those
who commit it, he is not a party merely because ""he does not endeavour to
prevent the felony or apprehend the felon""; per Cave J. in the Queen
v. Coney [9].
That learned judge quoted from ""Foster's Crown Law"", where the author
states that ""if A happeneth to be present at a murder, for instance, and
taketh no part in it, nor endeavoureth to prevent it, nor apprehendeth the
murderer, nor levyeth hue and cry after him, this strange behaviour of his,
though highly criminal, will not of itself render him either principal or
accessory"". I take it that the word ""criminal"" is here used in
the sense of ""morally reprehensible"".

Hawkins
J. in the same case (1) said at 557:

It
is no criminal offence to stand by, a mere passive spectator of a crime, even
of a murder. Non-interference to prevent a crime is not itself a crime.

The
omission of the appellant to do any of the things to which the learned trial
judge referred on his charge, were not, in themselves, evidence of abetting. In
my opinion the jury may well have understood the contrary from what was said
and have been influenced by it. I do not find it possible in the circumstances
of this case to apply the provisions of section 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code.

The
first ground of dissent is:

1.
The learned Judge's charge led naturally to confuse in the minds of the jury,
the evidence relating to the appellant setting the fire with the evidence
relating to his aiding and abetting, in that the learned Judge treated the case
against the appellant as if it were one of common enterprise and common
intention from the outset, and instructed the jury it did not matter whether
Bryan or the appellant started the fire.

With
respect to this what is said by A. T. Lawrence J. in giving the judgment of the
Court in Rex v. Kupferberg [10],
is relevant. That learned judge said:

To
prove conspiracy against the appellant, it is necessary that an agreement,
express or implied, should be proved to the satisfaction of the jury, but it is
quite unnecessary to prove such agreement where the charge is one of aiding and
abetting. In the latter case, it is only necessary to show that the appellant
appreciated what was going on and did something to further it.

I
do not repeat all that was said by the learned trial judge in the case at bar
with respect to ""common inten-

[Page 167]

tion"".
I think that the distinction above described was not very clearly explained to
the jury with relation to the facts as they might find them. Further, I think
that subsection 2 of section 69 of the Code was irrelevant and the repeated
references to it could only have tended to confuse. I would not however, having
regard to the charge as a whole, have thought a new trial necessary on this
ground alone.

I
would therefore allow the appeal and direct a new trial.

LOCKE
J. (dissenting):—The appellant was charged that ""he did on the 31st day of
January, 1948, with Nick Bryan, unlawfully and wilfully without legal
justification or excuse and without colour of right, set fire to a certain
building, to wit, the Queen Elizabeth School belonging to the Corporation of
the City of New Westminster."" The evidence enabled the prosecution to
contend that (a) it was Preston who had actually fired the building, or
(b) in advance of the commission of the offence he had conspired or
agreed with Bryan to fire the school and that it was the latter who had
actually set the blaze, or (c) he had, within the meaning of sec. 69 (c)
of the Criminal Code, abetted Bryan in committing the offence or conceivably as
a branch of this latter aspect of the case that he had done some act for the
purpose of aiding Bryan to commit the offence, or counselled or procured him to
do so within subss. (b) and (d) of sec. 69.

It
is sufficient to say without reviewing the evidence that there was some
evidence upon which the jury might have found under (a) that the
appellant had actually fired the building. There was also evidence upon which
they might have found that prior to the time when the offence was actually
committed he had conspired or agreed with Bryan to commit the indictable
offence of arson (an offence in itself under sec. 573 of the Code), and that
Bryan had fired the building in pursuance of such conspiracy or agreement. As
to (c) restricting it to subsec. (c) of sec. 69, the fact that
the appellant had proceeded to the place where the offence was committed with
Bryan and remained in the latter's automobile while he set fire to the school,
if unexplained, was some evidence from which the jury might have drawn the
inference that the 

[Page 168]

appellant
was abetting Bryan in committing the offence (The Queen v. Coney [11]).
As Cave, J. there expresses it, ""where presence may be entirely
accidental, it is not even evidence of aiding and abetting. Where presence is
prima facie not accidental it is evidence, but no more than evidence, for the
jury.""

From
the fact that the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury pointed out and
commented upon the evidence which might justify the jury in finding the accused
guilty under either headings (a) or (b) above and also defined
the term ""abet"", it is apparent that all three aspects of the matter
were submitted to the jury and, in my opinion, the real matter to be determined
in deciding the question raised by the first and third grounds of dissent
expressed in the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal is as to the
sufficiency of the charge in instructing the jury as to the law applicable to
the charge of abetting and its application to the evidence. I have come to the
conclusion that the dissent of Mr. Justice O'Halloran upon this ground is well
founded. The learned trial judge in explaining the meaning of the word
""abets"" said that it meant ""encourages, pushes them on, that is
about as good a way I think as I can put it—abets any person in the commission
of the offence or counsels or procures any person to commit the offence. You
must keep that section in mind here."" After summarizing the evidence for
the prosecution he then said:—

Now
that is the Crown's case. The Crown asks you to take all these circumstances
and the final fact that one or the other of them burnt the school or set it on
fire, and the Crown says to you, ""Don't worry who started the fire, but
come to the conclusion that they were engaged in a common enterprise and that
regardless of who set the match or lit the match, the other is guilty.""
The particular one before us today is Preston and the Crown says upon that
basis, ""We ask you to bring in a verdict of guilty against him.""

As
a summary this was not complete since it did not state fully the three
contentions of the Crown as mentioned above and it is clear that the jury
recognized this as after retiring and being out for some two hours they
returned and the foreman said that they would like the court to explain to them
the meaning of the word ""accessory"", which clearly related to the
charge of abetting Bryan in committing the offence or of aiding, counselling or
procuring him

[Page 169]

to
do so. In reviewing the evidence for the defence the learned trial judge said
that the evidence of the appellant was to the effect that he had no idea of
burning a school or being a party to burning a school and that while he had
been with Bryan in his car he did not grasp the seriousness of the situation,
saying in part:—

That
is the defence. I cannot elaborate on it anymore. It is very fresh in your
memory. His defence is this: ""While I was with this man I admit,
throughout the hours preceding, I did not have anything whatever to do with the
buying of the gasoline in preparation for the making of the fire, or the oil. I
didn't know that he seriously intended to burn a school. I didn't have any hand
in it and I didn't leave the car when the fire was set."" Now that is the
defence. He says: ""I had no common intent with this man to burn this
school"". Now there is the summary of it. ""I had no common intent with
  Bryan to burn this school. I did not take any active part in setting a
fire."" That is the defence.

Immediately
following the above quoted statement he said that the Crown laid stress upon a
point which he had theretofore failed to mention: that the Crown said:
""Well, why did not this man get out of the car and leave him and
particularly when they came back from Westminster from across the Fraser River
bridge? Why in the world didn't he say: 'Bryan, I don't like the way you're
behaving.' Or why didn't he telephone the police? The Crown makes that point.
You will have it in mind."" When the jury returned for further
instructions, after defining an accessory before the fact and saying:
""abets, that is, assists or encourages any person in the commission of the
offence,"" and again summarizing the evidence for the defence he said:—

Then
the Crown directs your attention to the fact that he didn't do anything about
it despite the statements of this man out across the bridge beside a school,
and that he didn't protest or do anything at the time of the actual setting of
the fire. They say, ""Look at his conduct. Is that the conduct of an
innocent man?""

The
learned trial judge had thus pointedly directed the attention of the jury to
the failure of the appellant to quit Bryan's company after the remarks made by
the latter when they were out at the property upon the Pacific Highway, his
failure to telephone the police and his failure to protest or do anything at
the time of the actual setting of the fire. These circumstances were perhaps
evidence from which the jury might infer that Preston had conspired or agreed
with Bryan to fire the building, but I think it

[Page 170]

much
more likely that the jury understood from the charge that it was suggested that
these facts afforded evidence upon which they might act in finding the
appellant guilty of abetting the commission of the offence. I think this was
peculiarly a case where after explaining the nature of the defendant's evidence
the trial judge should have explained to the jury the application of the law as
to aiding or abetting to the facts as they might find them. It was not
sufficient, in my opinion, to define the legal meaning of the term
""abet"", to state the nature of the evidence for the defence and to
leave it to the jury to decide whether, assuming the evidence of the appellant
was true, he was guilty of the offence. In the absence of a clear direction,
the jury was left to decide for themselves whether these various acts or
omissions amounted in law to abetting. As to the necessity of carefully
explaining to the jury the application of the law as to abetting to the facts
as the jury might find them, I agree with what was said by Robertson, C.J.O. in
Rex v. Dick [12].

In
Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law, 8th Ed. p. 17, the learned author,
summarizing the authorities, says that mere presence on the occasion when a
crime is committed does not make a person a principal in the second degree
(that is, as abetting the commission of the offence) even if he neither makes
any effort to prevent the offence or to cause the offender to be apprehended,
though his presence may be evidence for the consideration of the jury of an
active participation in the offence, and that when the existence of a
particular intent forms part of the definition of an offence, a person charged
with aiding or abetting its commission must be shown to have known of the
existence of the intent on the part of the person so aided. The appellant's
position was, assuming that his story was the truth, that he did not know that Bryan contemplated committing any offence. As expressed by Cave, J. The Queen v. Coney,
supra, at 539:

Now
it is a general rule in the case of principals in the second degree that there
must be participation in the act, and that, although a man is present whilst a
felony is being committed, if he takes no part in it, and does not act in
concert with those who commit it, he will not be a principal in the second
degree merely because he does not endeavour to prevent the felony, or apprehend
the felon.

[Page 171]

In
the same case Hawkins, J. said (p. 557):

In
my opinion, to constitute an aider and abettor some active steps must be taken
by word, or action, with the intent to instigate the principal or principals.
Encouragement does not of necessity amount to aiding and abetting, it may be
intentional or unintentional, a man may unwittingly encourage another in fact
by his presence, by misinterpreted words, or gestures, or by his silence, or
non-interference, or he may encourage intentionally by expressions, gestures,
or actions intended to signify approval. In the latter case he aids and abets,
in the former he does not. It is no criminal offence to stand by, a more
passive spectator of a crime, even of a murder. Non-interference to prevent a
crime is not itself a crime. But the fact that a person was voluntarily and
purposely present witnessing the commission of a crime, and offered no
opposition to it, though he might reasonably be expected to prevent and had the
power so to do, or at least to express his dissent, might under some
circumstances afford cogent evidence upon which a jury would be justified in
finding that he wilfully encouraged and so aided and abetted. But it would be
purely a question for the jury whether he did so or not.

The
onlookers at the prize-fight whose position was considered in Coney's case were
present and did not protest against the prize-fight being held and stayed at
the scene and did not inform the police but they were not guilty of any
offence, and, in my view, the learned trial judge should have instructed the
jury that these matters in themselves did not amount to abetting the commission
of the offence in the present case. In 9 Hals. p. 30, the effect of the
authorities is summarized as follows:—

All
who are present aiding and abetting, when a crime is committed, but who take no
part in the actual perpetration of it, are principals in the second degree.

To
constitute a principal in the second degree mere presence at the crime is not
enough; there must be a common purpose, an intent to aid or encourage the
persons who commit the crime and either an actual aiding or encouraging or a
readiness to aid and encourage them, if required.

The
evidence of the appellant was to the effect that he had left Vancouver that
evening in company with Bryan, in the latter's automobile, to examine some
property in the vicinity of New Westminster, and while the latter had made
various wild remarks about burning schools and expressed his sympathy with the
actions of a fanatical sect of the Doukhobors which engaged in such activities,
that he (Preston) did not realize at the time they stopped in front of the
Queen Elizabeth School, or at any time prior to the actual firing of the
building by Bryan, that the latter intended to set fire to that or any other
building

[Page 172]

and
that he had taken no part in committing the offence or done anything that might
be construed as abetting Bryan in its commission. If the jury accepted this as
the truth and if they had been properly instructed as to the application of the
law to these facts, I would assume they would have acquitted the appellant.
Upon the record as it is, I consider that it is impossible to say whether the
jury found the appellant guilty as having abetted the commission of the offence
or as having fired the building himself or as having been a party to an
agreement with Bryan to commit the offence, the latter being the one who
actually set the blaze. As was said by Lord Reading in Isaac Schama and
Jacob Abramovitch (1):

We
must not be too critical in dealing with the summing up of a judge after a
lengthy trial and speeches by counsel. Nevertheless, the Court must be
satisfied that when the jury find the prisoner guilty they have applied the
right principle of law to the facts before them.

The
prisoner was entitled as a matter of right to have the jury instructed as to
the application of the law to the facts as found by them and the failure to do
this was a substantial wrong. I think, therefore, sec. 1014 (2) of the Criminal
Code does not apply.

In
my opinion, this conviction should be set aside and a new trial directed.

Appeal
dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Evidence of accomplice—Corroboration—Nature
of evidence required for corroboration—Circumstantial evidence—Recent
possession—Remarks of trial Judge in passing sentence—Cr. Code s. 1002,
1014—Charge of retaining stolen goods under Cr. Code s. 399.

The Court of Appeal for Alberta affirmed the conviction of the
appellant who had been found guilty by a judge, presiding without a jury, of
retaining in his possession, knowing them to have been stolen, sixteen tires,
the property of the Government of Canada. These tires were stolen from the
R.C.A.F. in Edmonton by one L.A.C Ward. The accused agreed to sell them for
Ward and they were delivered by Ward to the accused at the Low Level Service Station
in Edmonton in a truck bearing the letters R.C.A.F. on the door. The six tires
sold by the accused were recovered and all the others were recovered either at
his house or at the service station.

Held: This was not a conviction on the uncorroborated
evidence of an accomplice.

Held: The conduct of the accused and the circumstances
under which he received and disposed of the tires established his guilt, and
even if the trial judge's direction lacked that precision which the law
contemplates, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred under
section 1014 Cr. Code.

[Page 221]

Held: The remarks made by the trial judge in the course
of his passing sentence, even if he had them in mind when considering his
verdict, would not, in the circumstances, warrant a setting aside of the
conviction.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Alberta, Appellate Division, affirming (Ford and Macdonald JJ. A. dissenting)
the conviction of the appellant on a charge of retaining in his possession,
knowing them to have been stolen, sixteen tires, the property of the Government
of Canada, contrary to section 399 of the Criminal Code.

The material facts of the case and the questions in
issue are stated in the judgment now reported.

A. W. Beament, K.C. for the appellant.

H. J. Wilson, K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Estey J.:—The
accused was convicted before a judge presiding without a jury of retaining in
his possession, knowing them to have been stolen, sixteen tires, the property
of the Government of Canada. The Appellate Division in Alberta affirmed the
conviction, Ford and Macdonald, JJ. A., dissenting.

The first ground of dissent is that the learned trial Judge
misdirected himself by disregarding the rule of practice that it is dangerous
to convict upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice.

It must be conceded that LAC Ward as a witness was in
relation to the accused an accomplice. He deposed that on September 16, 1947,
he and two others stole the tires from the R.C.A.F. in Edmonton, that on the
same day he made an arrangement with the accused to sell the tires for them,
and delivered the tires to him at the Low Level Service Station in Edmonton. Rex
v. Robinson 1; Rex v. Galsky 2;
Rex v. Joseph 3.

The accomplice is a competent witness but his implication in
the crime and the possible motives that may

[Page 222]

influence him in giving his evidence
are such that it is dangerous to found a conviction thereon unless it be
corroborated. It need not be corroborated, however, in every detail. It is
sufficient if there be found corroboration of a material fact in independent
evidence which implicates the accused in the commission of the crime.

In Rex v. Baskerville 4, Lord
Reading, C.J., in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in
England reviewed the authorities upon the corroboration of the evidence of an
accomplice and stated in part at p. 667:

We hold that evidence in corroboration must be independent
testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect him
with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which implicates him, that
is, which confirms in some material particular not only the evidence that the
crime has been committed, but also that the prisoner committed it.

This Court in Hubin v. The King 5,
followed Rex v. Baskerville (1) and stated at p. 444:

The corroboration must be by evidence independent of the
complainant and it ""must tend to show that the accused committed the crime
charged.""

In Regina v. David Birkett 6, the
accused was found guilty of receiving sheep knowing that they had been stolen.
One of the two persons involved in the theft deposed as to the theft and of the
delivery of one of the sheep by the other party involved in the theft to the
accused who had taken it into the house where he and his father lived. Evidence
as to the finding of a quantity of mutton in that house, which had formed parts
of two sheep corresponding in size with those stolen, and the finding of the
skins in the same place constituted corroboration. This case was approved in Rex
v. Baskerville (1).

Against the accused the Crown did not rely entirely upon the
evidence of Ward but called as witnesses Taylor, the investigator, and Congdon
who purchased six of the tires from the accused.

Flight Sergeant Taylor, R.C.A.F. investigator, on September
19th located some of these tires at the Low Level Service Station. He then
located the accused and with

[Page 223]

him went to the latter's house where three of the tires were
recovered. Then they went to the Low Level Service Station where six more tires
were recovered. Finally they went to Congdon's Transfer where six more were
recovered. The manner in which these tires were recovered leaves no doubt but
that they were the tires that two days before the accused had received from
Ward.

Moreover, before or on the morning of the 18th some of these
tires were removed from the Low Level Service Station to the home of the
accused. On that morning, Congdon deposed, the accused offered for sale some
tires which he inspected at the home of the accused. That afternoon the accused
took six of the tires (four new 900 x 20 and two used of the same size) to
Congdon's Transfer where a sale was concluded of these tires for $300,
approximately one-half of their market value.

The foregoing evidence of Taylor and Congdon corroborates
that of Ward, both as to the place of delivery of the tires, and the fact that
the accused had received and retained them for the purpose of effecting a sale.
This is not, therefore, a case in which a conviction has been made upon the
uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. Moreover, neither this corroborative
nor any other part of the evidence was contradicted.

The learned Judges who dissented were also of the opinion
that the learned trial Judge disregarded the rule of law as to the effect of
circumstantial evidence. This rule is set forth in the oft quoted passage in Hodge's
Case 7, where, in addressing the jury,
Alderson, B., stated that they must be satisfied:

… not only that those circumstances were consistent with
(his having committed the act, but they must also be satisfied that the facts
were such as to be inconsistent with any other national conclusion than that
the prisoner was the guilty person.

The accused was first approached with regard to these tires
by LAC Stubbart, who met the accused on the 17th at the Low Level Service
Station and as to that he stated:

When I got there I met Mr. Lopatinsky and asked him if he
was still interested in tires; he said he would like to see them.

Stubbart denied any knowledge of the theft but why he was
associating himself in the matter was left entirely a

[Page 224]

matter of conjecture. Stubbart then waited at the Low-Level
Service Station until Ward, driving a truck, arrived with the fifteen tires.
This truck had the letters ""R.C.A.F."" on the doors. Stubbart
introduced Ward to the accused and a conversation followed between them which
Stubbart did not hear. Ward deposed that he asked the accused ""if he could
sell the tires for me or buy them himself"", to which the accused replied
""he couldn't buy them himself, he didn't have the money; he said he would
try and sell them for me"". While the accused looked or glanced at the
tires as they remained in Ward's truck, he did not examine them, but as a result
of the conversation these tires were removed by Ward, Stubbart and another
airman, from the truck driven by Ward, and placed in part into another truck at
the service station and in part into the service station. These fifteen tires
were of different sizes, 1100 x 20, 1000 x 20 and 900 x 20, some were retreads
and some were new. Ward said he would like to get $600, and that appears to be
all that was said about the price. No questions were asked with regard to where
these tires came from. In cross-examination Ward did depose that the accused
had inquired about a bill of sale but accepted a statement that they would try
to give him one later. On that date the accused advanced to Ward $100 and the
next day he gave Stubbart $50, which Stubbart handed to Ward.

It is not suggested that any of the parties were engaged in
the business of selling tires nor was the transaction itself conducted as one
in the normal course of business. From the moment Stubbart met the accused and
asked ""if he was still interested in tires"", the matter proceeded
with a minimum of conversation and an absence of discussion as to Ward's
acquisition of the tires', the use and condition of the tires and the value of
them or other items that normally enter into such a transaction.

Under these circumstances, the disposition of the tires at
approximately one-half of their market value is significant. It was this fact,
or it together with the other circumstances that caused Congdon to take the
serial numbers of these tires and before concluding the purchase to communicate
with the police and ascertain if these tires were listed as stolen.

[Page 225]

Throughout the evidence of both Taylor and Congdon there is
no suggestion that any explanation was offered on the part of the accused as to
the circumstances under which he was in possession of these tires which had
been stolen but two or three days prior thereto.

The evidence of guilty knowledge in this as in so many cases
is not directly deposed to. The unexplained fact of recent possession is evidence
thereof.

Rex v. Schama 8.

Wills on Circumstantial Evidence, 7th Ed., 93.

Taylor on Evidence, 12th Ed. sec. 140.

In this case, however, the Crown had not relied upon the
mere fact of recent possession but has adduced evidence of conduct upon the
part of the accused, both with respect to his reception and disposition of the
tires and as to the sale of a portion thereof. These facts were all adduced in
evidence and no explanation tendered in regard thereto. As disclosed in this
record they admit of no doubt as to the guilt of the accused.

The learned trial Judge did not record the reasons upon
which he founded his verdict of guilty and it may be that he did not direct
himself upon the foregoing points with that precision which the law
contemplates. However, the facts and circumstances of this case are such that
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred within the
meaning of section 1014 of the Criminal Code.

The other ground of dissent was based upon the learned trial
Judge's reference to the thieves as ""children"" and that the accused
was a ""garageman"". All of the parties were before him and while there
is no evidence as to their respective ages, it was open to him to form his
opinion. The evidence indicates that the accused was driving a truck. But what
interest or association if any he had with the Low Level Service Station is
left a matter of conjecture. It was there he received delivery of the tires on
September 17th, and six of them were recovered from that station on the 19th by
Flight Sergeant Taylor. These remarks were made by the learned trial Judge in
the course

[Page 226]

of his passing sentence upon the accused, but even if he had
them in mind when considering his verdict they would not, in the circumstances,
warrant a setting aside of the conviction.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Conspiring to
defraud—Effect of reception of inadmissible evidence—Appeal from conviction—Onus
on Crown under section 1014 (2) of Criminal Code—Trial by judge alone—Trial
judge's report under section 1020 of Criminal Code—Substantial wrong and
miscarriage of justice—New trial—Section 444 of Criminal Code—Department of
Munitions and Supply Act, 1940 Statutes of Canada, c. 31 Interpretation Act,
R.S.C. 1927, c. 1.

 [Page 136]

The three appellants were convicted on a charge of conspiring
to defraud the Crown contrary to section 444 of the Criminal Code. The charge
was that they had entered into an unlawful agreement to evade payment of income
tax. At the trial, the Crown introduced statements made by the accused at an
inquiry held under the provisions of the Department of Munitions and Supply
Act, section 19 of which prohibited their disclosure as was unanimously decided
by the Court of Appeal. The majority of the Court of Appeal held that there had
been no miscarriage of justice notwithstanding the improper reception of the
statements. The accused appealed from this judgment.

Held: reversing the judgment appealed from ([1947] 2
W.W.R. 289), Kerwin J. dissenting, that the onus of the Crown to satisfy the
Court that there would without doubt have been a conviction had the illegal
evidence been excluded, has not been discharged.

Per Kerwin J. (dissenting):—The appellants had a fair
trial even though the inadmissible evidence was introduced and the trial judge
could not have failed to convict on the admissible evidence.

APPEAL and Cross-Appeal from
the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1]
, affirming (Sloan C.J. and Robertson J.A. dissenting) the conviction of the
appellants on a charge of conspiring to defraud His Majesty the King in the
right of the Dominion of Canada, contrary to section 444 of the Criminal Code.

Hon. J. W. deB. Farris,
K.C. and John L. Farris for the appellants.

G. L. Fraser, K.C. for the
respondent.

KERWIN J. (dissenting):—While
relying upon the disenting judgment of the Chief Justice of British Columbia[2]
, Mr. Farris preferred to state his proposition in a wider form and to treat
the cases referred to by the Chief Justice as mere examples. His argument was
that if the Wilson evidence, which the Court of Appeal[3]
unanimously held to be inadmissible, is put aside, the accused never really had
a fair trial because his counsel was in effect prevented from cross-examining
upon the balance of the evidence. I am unable to assent to that contention
because in circumstances such as are present here, counsel have to take the
responsibility as to cross-examination upon all the evidence adduced by the
Crown in respect of the charge.

[Page 137]

On the point as to whether there
was a miscarriage of justice, I have come to a conclusion without regard to the
report made by the trial judge although I am unable to say, as the Court found
it possible to decide in Baron v. The King[4]
, that this was not a report within section 1020 of the Criminal Code.
No report had been made by the trial judge and it was only after the case had
been argued for two days, and after the Court of Appeal[5]
had unanimously decided that the Wilson evidence had been improperly admitted,
that the Court[6] , at
the request of counsel for the accused, requested the trial judge to send in
his report. Some of the provisions of section 1020 may be considered
archaic as in practically all cases the evidence is now taken down and transcribed
by a shorthand reporter so that the direction in the section that the trial
judge shall furnish in the Court of Appeal his notes of the trial appears to be
meaningless. I quite agree that the proper time to comply with the section is
before any appeal from the judgment is heard but it seems rather strange that,
after the report had been furnished at the time and in the manner I have
indicated, complaint is now made to its reception and its contents.

In jury cases, the test is the
same where inadmissible evidence has been allowed as in cases of misdirection;
that is, could a reasonable jury have failed to convict on the remainder of the
evidence? I have not overlooked the decision in Allen v. The King[7]
, but each case must depend on its own facts. The present case was tried by a
judge without a jury and in my opinion he could not have failed to convict each
of the appellants on what the Court of Appeal decided was admissible evidence
and the appeal should be dismissed. The Criminal Code limits the cases in which
an Attorney-General or accused may come to this Court and there was therefore
no authority for the Cross-Appeal by the Crown, which is dismissed.

TASCHEREAU J.:—The appellants
were found guilty by His Honour Judge Lennox on a charge of conspiring together,
by deceit or falsehood or other fraudulent means, to defraud the Crown contrary
to section 444 of the Criminal

[Page 138]

Code. It is suggested that the appellants entered this
alleged unlawful agreement for the express purpose of evading the payment of
income and excess profit taxes.

In 1942, the West Coast
Shipbuilders Limited was engaged in building at Vancouver for the Dominion
Government, fifty-five 10,000 ton ships. The J. L. Northey & Sons Limited,
of which the principal officers and shareholders were the three appellants,
contracted for the construction of the ships' furniture, and during the same
year, this contract was assigned by J. L. Northey & Sons Company Limited,
to a newly formed company known as the Millwork Industries Limited, and of
which the appellants were also the only directors and shareholders.

It was the contention of the
Crown at the trial, that the appellants attempted to defraud the Dominion
Government by means of falsification of invoices. Each of the appellants had
other companies in which they were interested and which they owned and
controlled. For instance, appellant J. L. Northey, father of the two other
appellants, was particularly interested in J. L. Northey Company Limited and in
Millout Homes & Lumber Company. An other appellant, Paul Northey, was
president of Paul Northey Homes Limited, and the third appellant, Archibald
Northey, was the owner of Northey Construction Company Limited. These three
companies were indebted to other companies for merchandise sold.

It is the Crown's submission that
the appellants paid some of their personal accounts and also some of the
accounts of the companies they controlled out of the funds of the Millwork
Industries Limited. Invoices would be falsified so that in the books of the Millwork
Industries Limited, the amounts of the cheques were charged to the costs of the
operation of that company. As a result of this procedure, the debts of the
other companies would be reduced and the profits of Millwork Industries Limited
would be diminished, with the result that the Crown would lose income and
excess profit taxes.

Before the charges were laid
against the appellants, a Dominion investigator, Mr. James C. Wilson, conducted
an inquiry under the provisions of the Department of Munitions and Supply
Act —1940, Statutes of Canada, 

[Page 139]

chap. 31. He interviewed the three appellants, and the
statements made by them were introduced at the trial before His Honour Judge
Lennox. The Court of Appeal[8] , the
Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Robertson dissenting, dismissed the appeal, but
during the hearing, the Court unanimously decided that the ""Wilson
evidence"" had been improperly received by the trial judge, because of the
prohibition against its disclosure found in section 19 of the Department
of Munitions and Supply Act. Notwithstanding the fact that this evidence
was ruled out, the majority of the Court held in effect that there had been no
miscarriage of justice, affirmed the conviction and denied to the accused a new
trial.

The dissent of the Chief Justice,
in which Mr. Justice Robertson concurred, is based on the ground that the
improper reception of the ""Wilson evidence"" was so prejudicial, that
the accused did not have a fair trial. They held that with the evidence that
was left, it was not for the Court of Appeal to determine the guilt or
innocence of the appellants, and that it would be to assume the role which is
reserved to the jury or to the trial judge, if they attempted to weigh that
evidence and to come to any conclusion.

During the argument before this
Court, Mr. G. L. Fraser, K.C., counsel for His Majesty the King, who has filed
a Cross-Appeal, argued that the Court of Appeal[9] , was
wrong in excluding the evidence given by Mr. Wilson. It seems quite unnecessary
to deal with the right which the Crown may have to Cross-Appeal, or with its
right to ask without Cross-Appeal that the judgment of the learned trial judge
be affirmed, even for reasons other than those given by the Court of Appeal, as
I come to the conclusion that on this point, the decision of the Court below
was sound.

Section 19 of the Department
of Munitions and Supply Act, as amended by section 12 of Chap. 31, Statutes of
Canada, 1940, says:—

19. (1) No information with
respect to an individual business which has been obtained under or by virtue of
this Act shall be disclosed without the consent of the person carrying on that
business:—

[Page 140]

Provided that nothing in
this subsection shall apply to the disclosure of any information—

(a) to a government
department, or any person authorized by a government department, requiring such
information for the purpose of the discharge of the functions of that
department; or

(b) for the purposes of any
prosecution for an offence under this Act, or, with the consent of the
Minister, for the purposes of any civil suit or other proceeding at law.

(2) If any person discloses
any information in contravention of this section, he shall be guilty of an
offence under this Act.

As the present prosecution is
under section 444 of the Cr. Code and not under the Department
of Munitions and Supply Act, the proviso contained in section 1 (b)
does not apply.

Moreover, the contention of the
Crown is that the power of the Minister of Munitions and Supply, to direct that
an inquiry be held, was not given until 1943, when the Department of
Munitions and Supply Act was amended to so provide. Therefore the
prohibition against disclosure of information would apply only to information
obtained under the provision of the Act as it was enacted in 1940, and not to
information obtained at an inquiry held by vintue of the 1943 amendment.

I believe that this proposition
is unsound in view of the provisions of section 22 of the Interpretation Act
of 1927, R.S.C. Chap. 1. This section is as follows:—

22. An amending Act shall,
so far as is consistent with the tenor thereof, be construed as one with the
Act which it amends.

It seems clear, that the
prohibition contained in section 19 against disclosure of information
obtained by virtue of the Act, applies to all information obtained by
virtue of any section of the Act, whenever passed.

The grounds of appeal are stated
as follows in appellants' factum:—

1. It is submitted that the
majority of the Court of Appeal were wrong in refusing a new trial based on the
ground that no miscarriage of justice was caused by the wrongful admission of
the Wilson evidence because in their Lordships' opinion the remaining
admissible evidence conclusively established the guilt of the appellants. It is
submitted that the decision has denied to the accused a fair trial because a
conviction following improperly admitted evidence of a confession of guilt is
no trial at all, and a conviction without a trial necessarily constitutes a
miscarriage of justice.

[Page 141]

2. In the alternative, it is
submitted that the majority of the Court of Appeal were wrong in finding that
the trial judge was bound to convict on the evidence which remained after
excluding the Wilson evidence and the hearsay evidence wrongfully admitted.

When evidence has been improperly
admitted, as in the present case, the Court of Appeal, in view of section
1014 of the Criminal Code, may dismiss the appeal if,
notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the appeal might be decided in
favour of the appellant, it is also of opinion that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. This section of the Criminal Code
has been examined by the courts in England where the law is similar, and by
many courts in this country.

In Allen v. Rex[10]
, Chief Justice Sir Charles Fitzpatrick said at page 336:—

The underlying principle of
both (the English and Canadian Section) is that, while the Court has a
discretion to exercise in cases where improper evidence has been admitted, that
discretion must be exercised in such a way as to do the prisoner no substantial
wrong and to occasion no miscarriage of justice; and what greater wrong can be
done a prisoner than to deprive him of the benefit of a trial by a jury of his
peers on a question of fact so directly relevant to the issue as the one in
question here—the existence of previous threats—and to substitute therefor the
decision of judges who have not heard the evidence and who have never seen the
prisoner? It may well be that our opinion sitting here in an atmosphere very
different from that in which the case was tried the evidence was quite
sufficient, taken in its entirety, to support the verdict, but can we say that
the admittedly improper questions put by the Crown prosecutor and the answers
which the prisoner apparently very reluctantly gave did not influence the jury
in the conclusion they reached? We must not overlook the fact that it is the
free unbiased verdict of the jury that the accused was entitled to have.

And further[11]
at page 339 he also expressed the following views:—

It was argued that the
Section of our Code, upon which the Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal
relied, specially provides that the appeal shall be dismissed even where
illegal evidence has been admitted, if there is otherwise sufficient legal
evidence of guilt. I cannot agree that the effect of the section is to do more
than, as I said before, give the judges on an appeal a discretion which they
may be trusted to exercise only where the illegal evidence or other
irregularities are so trivial that it may be safely assumed that the jury
was not influenced by it. If there is any doubt as to this the prisoner
must get the benefit of that doubt propter favorem vitae. To say that we
are in this case charged with the duty of deciding the extent to which the improperly
admitted evidence may have influenced some of the jurors would be to hold, as I
have already said, that Parliament authorized us to deprive the accused

[Page 142]

in a capital case of the
benefit of a trial by jury. The law on this express point was laid down by the
Privy Council in Makin v. A.G. for New South Wales[12]
(citing therefrom).

And in Makin v. Attorney-General
for New South Wales[13]
, the Lord Chancellor said at page 69:—

The point of law involved
is, whether where the judge who tries a case reserves for the opinion of the
Court the question whether evidence was improperly admitted and the Court comes
to the conclusion that it was not legally admissible, the Court can
nevertheless affirm the judgment if it is of opinion that there was sufficient
evidence to support the conviction, independently of the evidence improperly
admitted and that the accused was guilty of the offence with which he was
charged.

It is obvious that the
construction contended for transfers from the jury to the Court the determination
of the question whether the evidence established the guilt of the accused. The
result is that in a case where the accused has the right to have his guilt or
innocence tried by a jury, the judgment passed upon him is made to depend not
on the finding of the jury, but on the decision of the Court. The judges are in
truth substituted for the jury, the verdict becomes theirs and theirs alone,
and is arrived at upon a perusal of the evidence without any opportunity of
seeing the demeanour of the witnesses and weighing the evidence with the
assistance which this affords.

And again at page 70, he said:—

Their Lordships do not think
it can properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice, where on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused
the jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge to consider
in arriving at a verdict matters which ought not to have been submitted to
them.

In their Lordships' opinion
substantial wrong would be done to the accused if he were deprived of the
verdict of the Jury on the facts proved by legal evidence, and there were
substituted for it the verdict of the court founded merely upon a perusal of
the evidence. It need scarcely be said that there is ample scope for the
operation of the proviso without applying it in the manner contended for.

Their Lordships desire to
guard themselves against being supposed to determine that the proviso may not
be relied on in cases where it is impossible to suppose that the evidence
improperly admitted can have had any influence on the verdict of the jury, as
for example where some merely formal matter not bearing directly on the guilt
or innocence of the accused has been proved by other than legal evidence.

The same principles were
reaffirmed by this Court in Gouin v. The King[14]
, in Brooks v. The King[15] ,
and recently in Schmidt v. Rex[16]
.

It is also a well established
principle that the burden is upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the
verdict would necessarily have been the same, if the charge had been
correct, or if no evidence had been improperly admitted. (Schmidt v.
Rex[17]
).

[Page 143]

The principles enunciated in the
above cases must be applied and govern the present case. Illegal evidence of a
very damaging character was admitted at the trial, which was highly prejudicial
to the accused. It is quite problematical to value all the effects of the
admission of this illegal evidence, but it may safely be said, I think, that it
may have seriously affected the cross-examination of the Crown witnesses, held
out other evidence, and possibly changed the whole strategy of the defence. It
may also, and this is quite natural and understandable, have seriously
influenced the learned trial judge, in the reaching of his conclusions, as it
would have undoubtedly impressed unfavourably upon the minds of twelve jurors.

The learned trial judge made his
report to the Court of Appeal[18] during
the argument, only after the ""Wilson Evidence"" had been ruled
inadmissible. In view of the decision of this Court in Baron v. The
King[19]
, this report cannot be considered as having been given within the meaning of section
1020 of the Cr. Code, and should therefore be ignored.

It is possible for this Court to
dismiss the present appeal, only if the irregularities are so trivial that
it may be safely assumed that the trial judge was not influenced by them, or as
it was said in the Schmidt case[20]
, ""that the verdict would necessarily have been the same"", if
the illegal evidence had not been admitted.

With deference, I cannot come to
that conclusion without entering the field of hypothesis and conjecture. As
there will be a new trial, I shall not attempt to discuss the evidence given,
but I may say that it is not sufficiently convincing to allow me to think, that
had this evidence not been introduced, the result would have been the same.
This Court is not the proper forum where the guilt or the innocence of the
appellants is to be determined.

I entirely agree with the
following statement of Chief Justice Sloan in his dissenting judgment: 

The
function of this Court is not to retry the accused and to decide upon his guilt
or innocence. This Court is a Court of Review, and the issue before us, in this
case, is not the guilt or innocence of the accused, but whether or not the
accused has had a fair trial on proper evidence.

[Page 144]

If we did come to one conclusion
or another, after weighing the evidence that remains, we would substitute
ourselves to the trial court, and deprive the accused of his indisputable right
to be tried by a jury or a trial judge who have the advantage of seeing and
hearing the witnesses.

I agree that the appeal should be
allowed, the conviction quashed, and a new trial directed. The Cross-Appeal
should be dismissed.

RAND J.:—The accused, father and
two sons, were charged with conspiracy to defraud the Dominion Government in
relation to income tax. They were interested in the furniture and housing
industries. A company wholly controlled by the father had obtained a contract
which ultimately involved the supply of furnishings to fifty-five 10,000-ton
ships constructed in British Columbia. To carry out this work the three
organized a company named ""Millwork Industries Limited"" to which for
a commission the contract was assigned. At this time two other companies,
controlled one by each of the two sons, were being pressed by their creditors.

It was established by a mass of
evidence that in the course of the operations of the Millwork Company and in
several hundred items, the moneys of that company paid out by cheque were
applied to debts of these outside companies as well as to private debts of the
three shareholders; and, in certain cases, they were alleged to have been used
to pay accounts owing by a third brother who was not interested in the Millwork
Company.

As it was a family company, this
use of the company's funds, as such, certainly so far as the Crown was
concerned, would be unobjectionable. But it did not end there. These
disbursements were represented in the company's records either by altered
invoices originally directed to the other companies or to the individuals or by
fictitious invoices and the whole charged against one or more of the expense
accounts of the Millwork Company. It is, therefore, in a conspiratorial
connection in one form or another between the accused and these manipulations
that guilt lies.

[Page 145]

Prior to the prosecution, an
inquiry had been held under section 22 of The Department of Munitions
and Supply Act as enacted in 1943 which gives the Minister the power to cause
such an inquiry to be made ""into and concerning any matter relating to or
incidental to a contract for the manufacture or production of munitions of war
or supplies or for the construction or carrying out of a defence project, and
may appoint a person or persons by whom the inquiry shall be conducted.""
Under section 19 (1) passed in 1940 ""No information with respect to
an individual business which has been obtained under or by virtue of this Act
shall be disclosed without the consent of the person carrying on that
business."" Certain exceptions to that prohibition are not material here.
Before the commissioner, all three of the accused made statements self-incriminatory
which, over objection, were admitted in evidence by the trial judge.

On an appeal from conviction, the
Court of Appeal[21] during
the argument unanimously decided that the admission of this evidence had been
improper. They then proseeded to deal with the appeal under ss. (2) of
section 1014 of the Criminal Code and a majority, O'Halloran,
Smith and Bird, JJ. A. with Sloan, C.J. and Robertson, J.A. dissenting, came to
the conclusion that ""no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice""
had actually occurred; and the case comes here on the point of that dissent.

The finding of guilt was preceded
by a short statement of the trial judge in the course of which he made these
remarks:

It is true that the law of
conspiracy is somewhat difficult to prove, and it is also true that in the
proof of conspiracy, one act or two acts taken out of the general practice
would not, of course, prove or allow the court to infer conspiracy on those
isolated acts. But this is also true, that the general practice shown by those
individual examples might, with the congregation of those items, be sufficient
and properly sufficient in law, and in every other way, to come to the
conclusion that the conspiracy is proved. *** I find that I cannot come to any
other conclusion on the evidence before me but that the charge is proved.

The ""evidence before
me"" included the admissions that had been improperly accepted, and the
question is whether in that situation it can be said that no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice can have taken place.

[Page 146]

The Crown relies on the
interpretation laid down in Stirland v. Director of Public
Prosecutions[22] ,
that the proviso ""assumes a situation where a reasonable jury, after being
properly directed, would, on the evidence properly admissible, without doubt
convict"", language that was quoted with approval in Schmidt v.
The King[23]
. It was pointed out by Lord Simon that the trial judge, in his summing up,
advised the jury to disregard entirely the impeached questions, but the words
""after being properly directed"" seem rather to refer to a direction
than to advice.

Assuming that view has been
accepted by this Court and applying it to the facts here, I think it impossible
to say that on the evidence bearing upon the connection of the father and the
son Paul with the tainted invoices and book entries, together with any
inferences that could possibly be drawn from the payment transactions
themselves, the trial judge, rejecting the objectionable evidence, must have
come to the same decision of guilt, or that, conversely, a verdict of acquittal
would have been perverse.

I would, therefore, allow the
appeal and direct a new trial.

ESTEY J.:—The three accused, J.
L. Northey, father, and his two sons, P. M. Northey and A. J. Northey, were the
principal shareholders and officers in Millwork Industries Limited which,
during the period in question, manufactured ship furnishings at Vancouver.

The three accused were charged
that between January 1, 1942, and December 31, 1944, they conspired to defraud
His Majesty The King in the right of the Dominion of Canada, contrary to section
444 of the Criminal Code. The three accused were tried under the
speedy trial provisions of the Criminal Code and found guilty.

The evidence divides itself into
two parts: (a) that given by the three accused as witnesses at an
inquiry with respect to the business of Millwork Industries Limited before Jas.
C. Wilson under the Department of Munitions & Supply Act, 1939 (2nd
Sess.) S. of C., c. 3, and amendments thereto. This evidence was put in at
the trial by calling Mr. Wilson,

[Page 147]

and it is hereafter referred to
as the ""Wilson evidence"". (b) That of the bookkeeper of
Millwork Industries Limited with respect to the practice in that office,
particularly dealing with certain items showing alterations of actual invoices
and writing up of fictitious invoices, the proceeds of which benefited one or
other of the three, and which were under one heading or another charged up to
cost of supplies and expenses, with the result that the net revenue and
consequent income taxes were greatly reduced. The balance of the evidence was
that of indivduals outside of this company relative to the invoices and credits
given for cheques received and drawn upon the accounts of Millwork Industries
Limited.

The Court of Appeal[24]
unanimously decided that under section 19 of the Department of
Munitions & Supply Act, 1939, as amended by section 12, 1940 S. of C., c.
31, the evidence taken at the inquiry was at the trial improperly received.
The majority of the learned Judges were of the opinion that, notwithstanding
the improper reception of this evidence no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice had actually occurred within the meaning of section 1014 (2) of
the Criminal Code and affirmed the conviction. The minority of the
learned Judges were of the opinion that there was a substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice and that a new trial should be had.

1014. (2) The Court may also
dismiss the appeal if, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that on any of the
grounds above mentioned the appeal might be decided in favour of the
appeallant, it is also of opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has actually occurred.

The Wilson evidence was important
and material in that it constituted admissions by each of the accused parties
of complicity in the offence of conspiracy to defraud His Majesty as charged.
The learned trial Judge, in the course of his brief reasons, made no reference
to the Wilson evidence and concluded:

I find that I cannot come to
any other conclusion on the evidence before me but that the charge is proved.

In Allen v. The King[25]
, the accused was charged with murder. Evidence suggesting a motive was
improperly introduced during the cross-examination of the accused. The majority
of the learned Judges in the Appellate Court

[Page 148]

held this evidence inadmissible
but that it was not more than a trivial irregularity and under section 1019 (as
it then read—now section 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code
affirmed the conviction. In this Court a new trial was directed. Sir Charles
Fitzpatrick, C.J., (with whom Duff, J., later Chief Justice, agreed), at p. 335
stated:

My difficulty is to say to
what extent the jury, or any one of them, may have been influenced by the
questions put to the prisoner on cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor.

Then at p. 339, referring to
section 1019:

I cannot agree that the
effect of the section is to do more than, as I said before, give the judges on
an appeal a discretion which they may be trusted to exercise only where the
illegal evidence or other irregularities are so trivial that it may safely be assumed
that the jury was not influenced by it. If there is any doubt as to this the
prisoner must get the benefit of that doubt propter favorem vitae. To
say that we are in this case charged with the duty of deciding the extent to
which the improperly admitted evidence may have influenced some of the jurors
would be to hold, as I have already said, that Parliament authorized us to
deprive the accused in a capital case of the benefit of a trial by jury.

At p. 363 Anglin, J. (later Chief
Justice) stated:

""A substantial
wrong"" is ""occasioned thereby on the trial"" when counsel for the
Crown improperly places before the jury, as having been sworn to, statements
which may influence them adversely to the accused upon a material issue.

In Gouin v. The King[26]
, the learned trial Judge misdirected the jury. In this Court, after commenting
upon Allen v. The King[27]
, my lord The Chief Justice (then Rinfret, J.) in writing the judgment of the
Court stated at p. 544:

In the circumstances of this
case we cannot come to any other conclusion but that the jury may have been
influenced by the improper direction and therefore the conviction cannot stand.

In Schmidt v. The King[28]
, the accused was convicted of murder. Two items of misdirection were
considered. With respect to the first the learned trial Judge had failed to
comply with ""advisable practice"" but had not violated any absolute
rule. As to the second, while his illustrations ""were not apt"", it
was pointed out ""that later in his charge the trial Judge stated the law
correctly but he did not apply the law to the evidence as fully as he might
have

[Page 149]

done."" It was under these
circumstances held that the conviction should be affirmed. Mr. Justice Kerwin,
writing the judgment of the Court[29] ,
stated:

In this case a reasonable
jury on a proper direction would have undoubtedly convicted Schmidt and the
appeal is therefore dismissed.

Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions[30]
: In this case certain questions were asked relative to credibility in cross-examination.
Counsel for the appellant did not object to the questions and in his summing up
the Common Serjeant advised the jury to take the appellant as being of good
character. The House of Lords held the evidence inadmissible but that it
occasioned no substantial miscarriage of justice. Viscount Simon, with whom the
other lords concurred, stated at p. 320:

Apart altogether from the
impeached questions (which the Common Serjeant in his summing-up advised the
jury entirely to disregard), there was an overwhelming case proved against the
appellant. When the transcript is examined it is evident that no reasonable
jury, after a proper summing up, could have failed to convict the appellant on
the rest of the evidence to which no objection could be taken. There was,
therefore, no miscarriage of justice, and this is the proper test to determine
whether the proviso to s. 4, sub-s. 1, of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, should
be applied.

Then in Kelly v. The
King[31]
, Duff, J. (later Chief Justice) discussed section 1019 (now as amended 1014
(2)):

In these circumstances there
was obviously no ""miscarriage""; and assuming there was some technical
""wrong"" there can be in my judgment no ""substantial
wrong"" from the admission of inadmissible evidence if it must be affirmed
that relatively to the whole mass of admissible evidence that which is open to
exception is merely negligible and that in the absence of it the verdict could
not have been otherwise. This conclusion is in no way inconsistent with the
acceptance of the criterion suggested in Makin's Case,[32]
. In such a case the impeached evidence cannot in any practical sense be
supposed ""to have had any influence upon the verdict.""

The Wilson evidence improperly
received was neither ""trivial"" nor ""merely negligible"" when
considered ""relatively to the whole mass of admissible evidence"". On
the contrary it was, relative to the whole, important and implicated each of
the accused parties in the offence charged to a degree that it would be
impossible to conclude but that it may have influenced the decision. Indeed,
having regard to its content, it may well have been a determining factor. It is
therefore not a case in which

[Page 150]

it can be concluded ""that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice"" has actually occurred as that
statement has been construed in the Allen[33] and
other cases, supra.

The reasons of the learned trial
Judge in finding the accused guilty indicate that he so concluded upon all the
evidence before him. There is no suggestion that any part thereof was
disregarded, and in so far as his report under section 1020, made some
time later and after an illness, suggests otherwise, the former should be
accepted.

In any event, under the
circumstances of this case it appears to be impossible to conclude that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred, and
therefore a new trial must be had.

The appeal should be allowed and
a new trial directed.

LOCKE J.:—In this matter the
dissent of the Chief Justice of British Columbia and of Mr. Justice Robertson
is expressed in the formal judgment[34] as
being upon the ground that as a matter of law the provisions of section 1014
(2) of the Criminal Code ought not to be applied in the
circumstances of this case. The Court of Appeal[35]
had during the hearing unanimously decided that what has been called the Wilson
evidence, which had been taken during an enquiry under the provisions of the Department
of Munitions and Supply Act, had been improperly admitted at the trial, and
the reasons for judgment of the learned Chief Justice refer to the fact that
part of the other evidence received had been inadmissible as hearsay. In
consequence of the admission of this evidence the learned Judges who dissented
were of the opinion that the accused had not had a fair trial and that
accordingly the powers conferred upon the Court by the Code, section 1014
(2), should not be exercised.

I agree with the finding of the
Court of Appeal[36] as to
the Wilson evidence and I am further of the opinion that a considerable amount
of the evidence tendered by the Crown for the purpose of proving that goods
paid for by Millwork Industries Limited had in fact been purchased by and
delivered to one or other of the accused, or to the companies controlled by one
or other of them, was

[Page 151]

inadmissible as hearsay. Eliminating
the evidence so improperly admitted, the matter to be decided is as to whether
upon the remaining evidence the verdict would necessarily have been the same (Schmidt
v. The King (1), Kerwin, J. at 440). Since there is to be a new
trial it is undesirable that there should be any extended comment on the
evidence. The onus is upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that there would
without doubt have been a conviction had this evidence been excluded and, in my
opinion, that onus has not been discharged in this case. I have come to this
conclusion upon consideration of the evidence alone as I think the report of
the learned trial Judge which, owing to his unfortunate illness, was not made
until some months had elapsed from the date of the trial and at a time when the
appeal had been partly heard cannot be considered.

The conviction should be quashed
and there should be a new trial.

Appeal
allowed, conviction quashed and new trial directed. Cross-Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal Law—Accused charged
of murder entitled to have all his defences adequately put to jury by trial
judge—Appellant conspired with two others to hold up and rob bank, when block
away turned back, were intercepted by police and appellant disarmed—Companion
attempting to escape killed policeman—Whether appellant party to offence of
murder within meaning of S. 69 (2) Criminal Code, or had abandoned common
intention to prosecute unlawful purpose—Whether such common intention was (a)
attempt to rob bank; (b) to resist arrest by violence and assist each other in
doing so; or (c) conspiracy to rob bank—Whether trial judge erred in charging
jury appellant guilty of an attempt to rob bank within meaning of S. 72 (2) of
Criminal Code.

The appellant together with one M and C, each having provided
himself with a revolver and ammunition, proceeded in a motor car to hold up and
rob a bank. The police having learned of the plot had parked a police car near
the bank. When the trio were a short distance from it they turned the car
about, abandoned it about a mile away, and walked to some railway tracks. They
were there intercepted by two policemen in plain clothes who escorted them back
to a detective also in plain clothes. The latter after asking the appellant his
name and receiving no reply, noticed the appellant's revolver and took it from
him without resistance, objection or protest. At this moment the suspects, who
were standing in line, sprang in different directions, the police giving chase.
M in his flight turned and shot his pursuer. The police returned the fire. As a
result of the shooting, C and the two policemen were killed, M and the

[Page 227]

detective, wounded. The appellant took no part in the shooting
but in his flight joined M and was subsequently arrested while hiding with him.
M and the appellant were charged jointly with the murder of the policeman shot
by M, but were tried separately, and both found guilty. M was executed and the
present appeal is from the conviction of the appellant.

Held: The appellant was entitled to have each of his
defences adequately put to the jury by the trial judge, and since this was not
done with regard to his principal defence, that of abandonment (Kerwin J.
dubitante), there should be a new trial.

Per Kerwin, Estey and Locke JJ.: There was evidence
upon which the jury might properly find that there had been an attempt to
commit an offence within the meaning of S. 72 of the Criminal Code.

Per Kerwin J.: Such offence constituted an attempt to
rob the bank and in leaving the question to the jury, the trial judge did not
prejudice the accused.

Per Taschereau and Kellock JJ.: The question was,
whether on the evidence the trio had sufficient reason for thinking they had
rendered themselves liable to arrest and had determined to resist to the extent
of using violence if necessary. It was open to the jury on the evidence to
conclude that the appellant at the time of the shooting was a party to the
prosecution of an unlawful purpose; it was also open to them to come to a
contrary conclusion, if they were of opinion that even had there been an
earlier unlawful intention, it had, so far as the appellant was concerned, been
abandoned. Before the appellant could be convicted it was essential that these
alternatives should have been put to the jury by the trial judge from the
standpoint of the Defence as well as the Crown, which was not done.

Per Taschereau J.: The conspiracy to rob the bank was
complete and this in itself was a crime, but the subsequent facts revealed by
the evidence did not show the essential ingredients of an attempt to rob the
bank within the meaning of S. 72 of the Criminal Code. An intent, an act
of preparation, and an attempt, must not be confused. A mere intent is not
punishable in criminal law, even if coupled with an act of preparation. Reg.
v. Eagleton, Dears C.C. 515; It cannot be held that the mere fact of
going to a place where the contemplated crime is to be committed, constitutes
an attempt. There must be a closer relation between the victim and the author
of the crime; there must be an act done which displays not only a preparation
for an attempt, but a commencement of execution, a step in the commission of
the actual crime itself.

The trial judge erred in charging the jury that ""they
could be prosecuted for attempting to rob a bank"" and ""the attempt is
complete when they take any steps in connection with it."" This confused
the issue and was prejudicial to the accused. The question of whether the
bandits were guilty of an attempt is foreign to the case. Their common unlawful
purpose to hold up and rob the bank and to assist each other in the prosecution
of that purpose, having been frustrated, was obviously not pursued, and it was
not therefore in the prosecution of such purpose that the murder was committed.

[Page 228]

It was for the jury to say, if in view of the evidence the
appellant had been a party to a conspiracy, if such conspiracy was ever formed;
and it was also within their exclusive province to find, after having been
properly instructed, that he had detached himself from any further association
with the other conspirators.

APPEAL by the accused from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia[1] (O'Halloran J. dissenting) dismissing his appeal
from his conviction, at a trial before Manson J. and a jury, on a charge of
murder. The appeal was on the grounds of dissent taken by O'Halloran J.A. (who
held that there should be a new trial.)

John Groves Gould
for the appellant.

Alfred Bull K.C. for the
respondent.

KERWIN J.:—Attention should first
be directed to the question as to whether in law what was done with the intent
to rob the bank was, or was not, only preparation for the commission of that
offence and too remote to constitute an attempt to commit it as provided by
subsection 2 of section 72 of the Criminal Code. This subsection sets
forth the considerations that are to govern in deciding this question of law
and, with respect, I find very little assistance in considering the circumstances
in other reported cases and I do not find it conducive to the solution of the
problem to attempt to paraphrase the wording of the subsection. It is necessary
to determine this point first, because if the proper conclusion be that there
was no attempt, then Mr. Bull admitted that as the case was put to the jury by
the trial judge on the basis of their being an attempt as well as on the basis
of his wider proposition, it would be impossible to say upon what ground the
jury proceeded and, therefore, for that reason there would have to be a new
trial. In leaving the question to the jury, the trial judge certainly did not
prejudice the accused because the circumstances in this case satisfy me that as
a matter of law what was done falls within the provisions of the subsection so
as to constitute an attempt. I do not detail these circumstances because on
another ground there is to be a new trial.

If upon such new trial there is
evidence of a common intention to rob and to escape with violence, the question

[Page 229]

should specifically be left to
the jury as to whether the accused had desisted from participation in such
common intention. And if it be claimed by the Crown that, irrespective of any
agreement to rob, there was a common intention to flee from the police officers
using force, then a defence that Henderson was not a party to such common
intention should also be put to the jury. These defences were raised by the
accused at his trial and while in discussing the Crown's case the trial judge
did refer to those features, he did not specifically deal with them when he
came to charge the jury as to what the defences were. With some hesitation I am
unable to dissent from the view of those members of this Court who find that
these defences were not adequately put to the jury.

TASCHEREAU J.:—The appellant
Henderson and one Harry Medos were jointly indicted at Vancouver,
B.C. for the murder of Charles Boyes, a police officer. The two accused were
given separate trials, as a result of which Medos was found guilty and
executed, and Henderson who was tried before Manson, J. was also convicted.

It appears from the evidence that
the appellant, Medos, and one Carter conspired together to commit a holdup at
the premises of the Royal Bank of Canada, on the east side of Renfrew Street,
directly opposite the Java Inn at Vancouver. The next day, the three men were
seen in a maroon Mercury car, coming west, on 2nd Avenue. It was observed that
the car turned into the first lane facing south, and backed out to 2nd Avenue
again, and then went east, from whence it had come, and proceeded to the stop
sign at Renfrew Street, and turned north on Renfrew Street in the direction of
the bank, but proceeded only about two car lengths when it swerved to the
right, making a U turn and proceeded at a fast rate of speed east on 2nd
Avenue. The bandits who were on their way to the bank to commit the intended
hold-up, had obviously detected a Police car that was parked in front of the
Java Inn facing south, and found that the occasion was not favourable to carry
out their plot. After having made this U turn, they proceeded in their car for
about a mile and a half, and then abandoned it on Kitchener Street, and walked west towards the Great Northern Railway yards.

[Page 230]

They had admittedly been under
close observation by the police, for when they arrived in the yards, Officers
Boyes and Ledingham drove their car into the yards near the roundhouse, and
accosted them on the railway track where all five crossed the line of tracks
they were on, to another set of tracks. A few seconds later, Detective Sergeant
Hoare arrived, and standing directly opposite the appellant, he said: ""Who
are you fellows anyway?"" and coming nearer the appellant, Hoare said:
""What is your name?"" These two questions remained unanswered, and
looking at the appellant, Hoare saw a gun tucked in the top of his overalls
which he pulled out. He had just taken this gun, when the whole line of men
broke up and the appellant, Medos and Carter sprang in different directions.
Medos who was the first to move was pursued by Officer Boyes, Ledingham going
after Carter. Medos had hardly ran six or seven steps whe he turned and shot
Boyes, and Carter fired at Ledingham. Medos then aimed at Hoare. Unfamiliar
with appellant's revolver, and therefore unable to use it, Hoare moved rapidly
towards a pile of steel plates, trying to reach for his gun, but a bullet
struck him in the left thigh and he fell to the ground. He however tried to get
his gun out of the holster, but was at that same moment struck by another
bullet in the upper part of his right arm, and another shot passed by the left
side of his face. He succeeded in sitting up, and he saw Boyes lying dead on
the ground, and Medos still running. He then raised his gun on his right knee,
and aimed at Medos, but seeing Carter running in a north-westerly direction, he
transferred his aim to Carter and shot him to the ground. He then aimed at
Medos who fell. He fired another shot which killed Carter, and a second shot at
Medos.

As a result of the shooting,
Officer Boyes and Ledingham and Carter were killed. Medos succeeded in escaping
with the appellant, but both were discovered soon after in the basement of a
house on 5th Avenue where they were arrested. In the interval, appellant
had changed his outer clothing, and later Medos' gun was found in the basement
containing one live shell. The gun taken from Henderson by Detective Sergeant
Hoare was fully loaded with live shells, and in appellant's pocket were found
also five other live shells which fitted his gun.

[Page 231]

It is the contention of the Crown
that Henderson, together with Medos and Carter, formed a common intention to
commit a crime by violence, viz. to hold up and rob the Royal Bank of Canada on
Renfrew Street, and to assist each other therein, and that it was a part of the
common intention to overcome all resistence by force of arms, either in the
bank or outside the bank, and to resist lawful apprehension by the police, and
if pursued to shoot if necessary. The Crown further states that such common
intention was at no time abandoned by appellant, that the common design
was frustrated by the police and that it was only the presence of a Police car
immediately across the street from the bank, which caused the bandits to change
their mind, so that instead of continuing their unlawful purpose, they then
directed their attention to resisting lawful apprehension.

The Crown further submits that in
view of section 69 (2) of the Criminal Code, which reads as follows:—

2. If several persons form a
common intention to prosecute any unlawful purpose, and to assist each other
therein, each of them is a party to every offence committed by any one of them
in the prosecution of such common purpose, the commission of which offence was,
or ought to have been known to be a probable consequence of the prosecution of
such common purpose.

the jury being properly
instructed by the learned trial judge, could find that such a common intention
was formed, and that in the prosecution of such common purpose one or more
of the trio shot and killed Officer Boyes, and that the commission of that
offence was or ought to have been known to be a probable consequence of the prosecution
of such common purpose.

The Crown also submits and it was
put to the jury by Crown counsel, that even if the jury could not find that the
common purpose was as comprehensive as was put to them, there was another view
which could be taken, namely, that when the trio abandoned the motor car on
Kitchener Street, they had already committed a crime, that is to say, they had attempted
to hold up and rob the bank, within the meaning of section 72 of the Code
which is in the following words:—

72. Every one who, having an
intent to commit an offence, does or omits an act for the purpose of
accomplishing his object is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence intended
whether under the circumstances it was possible to commit such offence or not.

[Page 232]

2. The question whether an
act done or omitted with intent to commit an offence is or is not only preparation
for the commission of that offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt to
commit it, is a question of law.

It is said that these three men,
when their attempt to hold up the bank was frustrated, formed a common
intention to resist lawful apprehension, which is in itself an unlawful purpose
within the meaning of section 69, and that during the prosecution of
such common purpose, murder was committed by one of their number.

The Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissed Henderson's appeal, Mr. Justice O'Halloran dissenting [2].
The points of dissent are the following:—

(1) The jury were left in a
state of confusion by three inconsistent directions given by the learned judge
apparently in purported compliance with Code S. 72 (2).

(2) The jury were not
instructed under Code S. 72 (2) upon the distinction in law between acts of
preparation as such and acts which could constitute an attempt to hold up the
bank; and further, following what the learned judge ought to have instructed
them in law upon the distinction between ""preparation"" and
""attempt"" (but which he did not do), the jury were not instructed
that it was for them to find whether there was evidence to support an attempt
or merely acts of preparation within the meaning of what the learned judge
ought to have told them constituted ""attempt"" and
""preparation"" respectively. Instead the learned judge decided the
facts as well as the law and instructed the jury an attempt in law had
occurred;

(3) The learned judge
misdirected both himself and the jury upon the legal meaning of attempt;

(4) The learned judge erred
in law in directing the jury that what occurred constituted an attempt in law
to hold up the bank;

(5) The learned judge in
legal effect took away from the jury Henderson's defence of abandonment of the
common intention under S. 69 (2) to hold up the bank;

(6) Alternatively, the
learned judge erred in law in directing the jury that an attempt to hold up the
bank excluded any defence of abandonment of the common intention to hold up the
bank;

(7) Alternatively, the
learned judge did not leave it to the jury to decide whether any common
intention under S. 69 (2) existed after the virtual arrest of Henderson et
al by officers Boyes and Ledingham;

(8) Alternatively, the
learned judge did not leave it to the jury to decide whether Henderson,
disarmed before the gun battle in which he took no part, had any common
intention with Medos within the meaning of S. 69 (2), to take part in the gun
battle in which the murder occurred;

(9) The learned judge,
having put the Crown's case to the jury with great power, did not present Henderson's
case so as to bring out its full force and effect. Read as a whole, the charge
points always to guilt and nothing but guilt;

[Page 233]

(10) The learned judge, in
the course of presenting Henderson's defence, did not bring to the jury's
attention the importance of reasonable doubt when related to (a) common
intention regarding abandonment of the hold-up; (b) absence of any
common intention in Henderson to escape after his virtual arrest by officers
Boyes and Ledingham; and (c) absence of any common intention in
Henderson to take part in the gun battle in which the murder occurred;

(11) The learned judge ought
to have instructed the jury the Crown had not made out a case in law to convict
Henderson of constructive murder.

I would like first to deal with
the contention that the three conspirators while on their way to the bank, were
guilty of an attempt to commit a hold-up and rob the Royal Bank of Canada. With
deference with other views expressed, I cannot agree with this submission. Of
course, the conspiracy to rob the bank was complete and this in itself was a
crime, but I do not believe that the subsequent facts revealed by the evidence
show the essential ingredients of an attempt, within the meaning of section 72
of the Criminal Code.

An intent, an act of preparation,
and an attempt must not be confused. A mere intent is not punishable in
criminal law, even if coupled with an act of preparation. As it was said in Regina v.
Eagleton [3] at p.
538:—

The mere intention to commit
a misdemeanour is not criminal. Some act is required, and we do not think that
all acts towards committing a misdemeanour are indictable. Acts remotely
leading towards the commission of the offence are not to be considered as
attempts to commit it, but acts immediately connected with it are ***

It was Sir James Stevens in his Digest
of the Criminal Law, who defined an attempt as follows:—

An attempt to commit a crime
is an act done with intent to commit that crime, and forming part of a series
of acts which would constitute its actual commission if it were not
interrupted.

In Principles and Practice of
the Criminal Law 14th ed., Harris at page 11 says:—

Through a mere intention is
not punishable if no steps are taken to carry it into effect, an attempt
to commit either a felony or a misdemeanour is itself a crime, and therefore
the subject of punishment. An attempt may be said to be the doing of any of the
acts which must be done in succession before the intended object can be
accomplished, with the limitation that it must be an act which directly approximates
to the offence, and which, if the offence were committed, would be one of
its actual causes, as distinct from a mere act of preparation.

[Page 234]

Mr. Justice Blackburn once
observed (Roscoe's Criminal Evidence, 15th ed., p. 415):—

There is no doubt a
difference between the preparation antecedent to an offence and the actual
attempt, but if the actual action has commenced which would have ended in the
crime if not interrupted, there is clearly an attempt to commit the crime.

In Roberts Case [4]
Jervis, C.J. says:—

It is difficult and perhaps
impossible *** to define what is, and what is not such an act done, in
furtherance of a criminal intent, as will constitute an offence *** Many acts,
coupled with the intent, would not be sufficient. For instance, if a man
intends to commit a murder, and is seen to walk towards the place of the
contemplated scene, that would not be enough.

In Rex v. Harry
Robinson [5] which I
believe is the leading case, the accused was convicted of the offence of
attempting to obtain money by false pretence. The Court of Criminal Appeal held
that there was no attempt to commit the offence, but only a preparation for the
commission thereof, and quashed the conviction. At page 1152, Lord Reading
said:—

Now in this case the real
difficulty consists in this, that there is no evidence that anything done by
the appellant ever reached the ears of the underwriters. They were the persons
whose minds must be induced to part with the moneys payable under the policy;
they were the persons from whom the money was to be obtained… There must,
however, be some further act on the part of the appellant before it can be said
that the attempt to commit the offence for which he has been indicted is
complete. Applying the test laid down by Baron Parke, (In Regina v. Eagleton)
we come to the conclusion that, in order to constitute an attempt to commit the
offence, the act relied on must be an act directly connected with the
commission of the complete offence.

I entirely agree with what Mr.
Justice O'Halloran says in his dissenting judgment [6]:—

For an act to be an attempt,
it must take place between the attemptor and the attemptee and be proximate to
the crime about to be committed.

Here, the trio were seen in an
automobile in the direction of the bank; but the plot was frustrated by the
presence of the police. There was nothing done by the trio, no overt act immediately
connected with the offence of hold-up and robbing. Although it may be said
that no one could doubt the express purpose of the bandits, I do not believe
that it can be held that the mere fact of going to the place where the
contemplated crime is to be committed, consti-

[Page 235]

tutes an attempt. There must be a
closer relation between the victim and the author of the crime; there must be
an act done which displays not only a preparation for an attempt, but a
commencement of execution, a step in the commission of the actual crime itself.

If any further authority is
needed on this question, vide: Rex v. Rump [7]
at p. 40; Rex v. Labourdette [8]; Rex
v. Woods [9]; Rex
v. Singh [10]; Rex
v. Linneker [11]; Rex
v. Punch [12].

Section 72, para. 2 of the Criminal
Code says that the question whether an act done or omitted with intent to
commit an offence, is or is not only preparation for the commission of that
offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt to commit it, is a question of
law.

The jury were told by the learned
trial judge that:

they (trio) could not be prosecuted
for robbing a bank, but they could be prosecuted for attempting to rob a bank
*** the attempt is complete when they take any steps in connection with it.

This statement of law, is, I
think, erroneous. The jury might have thought that it was while trying to
escape, after having committed an act, which they were told was a crime,
that the bandits started the shooting as a result of which the killing ensued.
This obviously confused the issue and was prejudicial to the accused.

I further believe, however, that
the question whether or not the bandits were guilty of an attempt, is entirely
foreign to the case.

There is no possible doubt that
the three accused in view of the evidence produced, were guilty of conspiracy.
The common unlawful purpose was to hold up and rob the Royal Bank of Canada, and
it is also common ground that they intended to assist each other in the
prosecution of that purpose. But, their common purpose having been frustrated,
was obviously not pursued, and it was not therefore in the prosecution
of such common purpose that Officer Boyes was killed.

[Page 236]

To my mind the real issues are
the following:—

Was there at any moment a
concerted plot formed by Medos, Carter and Henderson to resist legal
apprehension with violence? It may well be that this plot if it did exist, was
made originally when it was agreed to rob the bank, or it may be that it was
formed after the bandits were frustrated in the prosecution of the hold-up. If
such a plot did exist, the shooting being the result of a conspiracy, the two
of course might be guilty of murder. The common intention would then be to
resist legal apprehension; that would be the unlawful purpose. Each one of the
trio would be a party to any other offence, committed by any one of them, in
the prosecution of the common purpose, if he had known, or ought to have known,
that it was a probable consequence of the original common purpose. It may
happen, however, and this was for the jury to determine, that Henderson had
ceased to be a party to the conspiracy, and that the shooting which started
after he had been disarmed and under virtual arrest, was the spontaneous act of
Medos. Then, the act of one, would not have been the act of all.

In order that section 69 (2) may
find its application, the co-conspirators must form not only a common intention
to prosecute an unlawful purpose, but they must agree also ""to assist each
other therein"", and therefore, if a man is disarmed and made incapable of
furnishing the promised assistance, the situation is obviously changed. It is
settled law that a person who has been a party to prosecute a common illegal
purpose, may disassociate himself with his original co-conspirators. As early
as in 1828, in Rex v. Edmeads, Baron Vaughan said at the
Berkshire Assizes (Carrington & Paynes Reports, Vol. 3):—

If it could be shown that
either of them separated himself from the rest, and shewed distinctly that he
would have no hand in what they were going, the objection would have much
weight in it.

In Rex v. Whitehouse
[13]
Mr. Justice Sloan, now Chief Justice of British Columbia, said:—

After a crime has been
committed and before a prior abandonment of the common enterprise may be found
by a jury there must be, in my view, in the absence of exceptional
circumstances, something more than a mere mental change of intention and
physical change of place by those associates who wish to disassociate
themselves from the con-

[Page 237]

sequences attendant upon
their willing assistance up to the moment of the actual commission of that
crime. I would not attempt to define too closely what must be done in criminal
matters involving participation in a common unlawful purpose to break the chain
of causation and responsibility. That must depend upon the circumstances of
each case but it seems to me that one essential element ought to be
established in a case of this kind: where practicable and reasonable there must
be timely communication of the intention to abandon the common purpose from
those who wish to dissociate themselves from the contemplated crime to those
who desire to continue in it. What is ""timely communication"" must be
determined by the facts of each case but where practicable and reasonable it
ought to be such communication, verbal or otherwise, that will serve
unequivocal notice upon the other party to the common unlawful cause that if he
proceeds upon it he does so without the further aid and assistance of those who
withdraw. The unlawful purpose of him who continues alone is then his own and
not one in common with those who are no longer parties to it nor liable to its
full and final consequences.

In Rex v. Croft [14]
it was held that the agreement may be expressly determined and that if it comes
to an end before the crime is committed, the party who has put an end to the
agreement is not guilty. The question whether the agreement has been put to an
end, must be judged in view of all the circumstances revealed by the evidence,
and I have no doubt that it is a question for the jury. It was for them to say,
if in view of the evidence the appellant had been a party to the conspiracy, if
such a conspiracy was ever formed, and it was also within their exclusive
province to find, after having been properly instructed, that he had detached
himself from any further association with the other conspirators.

Unfortunately, all these aspects
of the case were not dealt with, and these omissions were, I believe, highly
prejudicial to the accused. The defence was not presented so as to give it all
its force and effect. It is true that no witnesses were called on behalf of the
appellant, but it is nevertheless the duty of the trial judge, in his charge to
the jury, to explain the exculpatory effect of the evidence, whether it is
given by the witnesses for the Crown or for the accused. Wu. v. The
King [15]. It was
the fundamental right of the appellant, who has been charged of murder, purely
by construction of the law, which in this particular case creates a presumptive
guilt, to have all the features of his defence adequately put to the jury.

[Page 238]

I have to come to the conclusion
that this has not been done, and that the Crown has not established to my
satisfaction that the verdict would have been the same, if the proper direction
had been given.

The appeal should be allowed, the
conviction quashed and a new trial directed.

KELLOCK J.:—The appellant not
having himself taken part in the actual shooting, being unarmed at the time,
the Crown rested its case against him upon section 69, subsection 2, of the Code.

With respect to the common
intention to prosecute an unlawful purpose the Crown put forward two theories.
The one, to which Mr. Bull referred as the more comprehensive, was that the
three participants, Medos, Carter and the appellant, had planned the armed
robbery of the Renfrew Street branch bank and resistance of arrest by violence if
necessary. The second theory was that when the would be robbers retreated from
the vicinity of the bank upon sighting the police car parked across the street
they formed a new agreement of the same character to escape or resist arrest.
He contended that such common intention was still operating at the moment of
the shooting, and that there was nothing in the evidence indicating any
abandonment of such common intention on the part of the appellant, but rather
that the evidence indicated the contrary.

The important thing for the Crown
to establish to the satisfaction of the jury beyond reasonable doubt, was that
at the time of the shooting which resulted in the deaths of the two constables,
Boyes and Ledingham, the one having been killed by Medos and the other by
Carter, the appellant was a party to a common intention with the other two to
escape or resist arrest by the use of violence and to assist each other
therein, and that the murder which resulted was or ought to have been known to
the appellant to have been a probable consequence of the prosecution of the
common purpose.

The state of mind of the three
men was therefore the matter to which the attention of the jury had to be
directed 

[Page 239]

on the evidence. Whether or not
the three had actually committed a crime or crimes when they turned away in
their approach to the bank was to my mind not the basic question, but rather
whether the evidence furnished sufficient ground for the jury to conclude that
the three had formed a common unlawful intention of the character mentioned
above, an important element in which would be the view which the three might
reasonably be taken to have entertained as to whether their conduct up to that
time had amounted to the commission of a crime or crimes. No doubt they had
been guilty of a breach of section 573 of the Code. Whether or not it
was likely that they realized that and for that reason had determined not to be
taken and to use violence to prevent being taken, was for the jury. The same
may be said with respect to the offence described in section 464 (b) or
any others which might be suggested on the evidence including the offence of
attempted robbery while armed. The question after all was whether the jury
would conclude on the evidence that the men had sufficient reason for thinking
they had rendered themselves liable to arrest for matters involving
sufficiently unpleasant consequences that they had determined to resist arrest
to the extent of using violence if that should prove necessary.

While it was open to the jury on
the evidence to conclude that the appellant at the time of the shooting was a
party to the prosecution of such an unlawful purpose, it was also, in my
opinion, open to them to come to a contrary conclusion if they were of opinion
that even had there been an earlier unlawful intention it had, so far as the
appellant was concerned, been abandoned. With this Mr. Bull agrees. Before the
appellant could be convicted therefore, it was essential that these
alternatives should have been adequately presented to the jury by the learned
trial judge from the standpoint of the defence as well as from that of the
Crown. With great respect I think that was not done.

The learned judge in his summing
up, after instructing the jury on matters of general application and the
relevant law, laid before them first, the case for the prosecution, then the
substance of what had been said by the various

[Page 240]

witnesses and, finally, the case
for the defence. On reaching the case for the defence, the learned judge
proceeded as follows:

Now, Mr. Foreman, I have
reviewed the evidence pretty fully and it is my duty now to put to you the
defence. I gave you the Crown's case as they put it forward; I have reviewed
the evidence. Now the defence says this ***

The learned judge then told them
that the defence contended that the Crown had not proved, beyond a reasonable
doubt, that the appellant was one of several persons who had formed an
intention to prosecute an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein
during the prosecution of which the offence occurred which the appellant knew,
or ought to have known, was a probable consequence; that the Crown had failed
to establish such common intent affirmatively and that, in addition, the
evidence negatived it. He then said that the defence had pointed out that the
appellant did not resist; that the movement in the line of the five men,
consisting of the three confederates and the two police officers, (which
immediately preceded the shooting) had commenced at the end of the line
farthest away from the appellant; that it was said that the latter could have
done nothing else than run in order to get out of the line of fire; and that
immediately prior to his ultimate apprehension he had given himself up. The learned
judge also referred to the fact that the confederates had walked slowly on the
Flats and that there was no shooting when the two policemen came up with them.
I find nothing else material in the charge dealing with the case for the
defence.

In my opinion this was not
adequate to put before the jury what the appellant was entitled to have put,
namely, that should the jury come to the conclusion that any unlawful purpose
which they might find to have existed at an earlier time had been abandoned
prior to the shooting in such a way that the appellant was no longer involved
and that what occurred had arisen without any common unlawful intention to
which the appellant was a party, as to which they should give him the benefit
of any reasonable doubt, they should acquit. I am not saying that it was
necessary that this should have been said in so many 

[Page 241]

words but the jury should have
been clearly instructed on this aspect from the standpoint of the defence.

In Wu v. The King [16]
Lamont, J., in delivering the judgment of this court said at page 616:

There is no doubt that in
the trial court an accused person is ordinarily entitled to rely upon all
alternative defences for which a foundation of fact appears in the record, and,
in my opinion, it makes no difference whether the evidence which forms that
foundation has been given by the witnesses for the Crown or for the accused, or
otherwise. What is essential is, that the record contains evidence which, if
accepted by the jury, would constitute a valid defence to the charge laid.
Where such evidence appears it is the duty of the trial judge to call the
attention of the jury to that evidence and instruct them in reference thereto.

It is a paramount principle of
law that when a defence, however weak it may be, is raised by a person charged,
it should be fairly put before the jury; Rex v. Dinnick [17].

In my opinion, therefore, with
respect, there is no escape from the conclusion that there should be a new
trial.

ESTEY J.:—The accused Henderson's
conviction of the murder of Charles Boyes was affirmed by the Appellate Court
of British Columbia [18]. Mr.
Justice O'Halloran, who dissented, was of the opinion that the learned trial
Judge had erred in not instructing the jury with regard to the defence of
abandonment and in instructing the jury that the accused and his associates
were guilty of an attempt to rob the Royal Bank of Canada.

The evidence disclosed that in
the evening of February 25th the accused, Medos and Carter agreed that on the
following morning they would rob the Royal Bank of Canada on Renfrew Street
in the City of Vancouver. About noon on the 26th of February they proceeded
to do so but as they approached the bank they observed the presence of the
police, turned back and in a short time abandoned their automobile and walked
to the Great Northern railway yards where they were met by the police who had
pursued them. There the shooting occurred which resulted in the death of two
policemen, Boyes and Ledingham, and one of the three parties, Carter.

The evidence established that
Medos fired the shot that killed Boyes, but the Crown contends that Henderson,
within the provisions of section 69 (2) was a party to, and

[Page 242]

with Medos guilty of the offence
of that murder. It is provided by section 69 (2) of the Criminal Code
that:

69. (2) If several persons
form a common intention to prosecute any unlawful purpose, and to assist each
other therein, each of them is a party to every offence committed by any one of
them in the prosecution of such common purpose, the commission of which offence
was, or ought to have been known to be a probable consequence of the
prosecution of such common purpose.

The Crown's contention is that
Henderson, Medos and Carter had formed a common intention to prosecute the
unlawful offence of robbing The Royal Bank of Canada on Renfrew Street,
to assist each other in the course thereof, and after its commission to escape
and to do whatever was necessary under the circumstances to effect that escape.

Counsel for Henderson submits
that, upon the evidence for the Crown (no evidence was given on behalf of the
defence), granting the three parties had a common design to rob the bank, the
evidence warranted a conclusion that prior to the shooting the three, or at
least Henderson, had abandoned any intention to prosecute an unlawful purpose,
that therefore at the time of the shooting each of the three parties was acting
upon his own and not pursuant to any previously agreed upon plan or design. The
common intention had been abandoned and the conduct of the one did not then
involve the others in any responsibility therefor. This defence of abandonment
was the principal contention of the accused and was supported by references to
specific portions of the evidence upon which, because a new trial must be had,
I make no comment.

The learned trial Judge in his
charge to the jury reviewed the submissions of the Crown and the evidence.
Several times in the course thereof he referred to abandonment, but as
incidental to his presentation of the Crown's case and the review of the
evidence. Then, having completed that review, the learned Judge stated:

Now Mr. Foreman, I have
reviewed the evidence pretty fully and it is my duty now to put to you the
defence. I gave the Crown's case as they put it forward; I have reviewed the
evidence.

In what followed the learned
Judge referred to certain portions of the evidence particularly stressed by
counsel for the accused, but omitted any reference to the defence of
abandonment, nor at any point throughout the charge did he discuss abandonment
as a defence in relation to the 

[Page 243]

evidence in support thereof. This
was the principal defence raised on behalf of the accused. It is the right of
every accused to have his defence fairly presented by a trial judge in his
charge to the jury.

A majority of the Court is
of the opinion that, in view of the unfortunate failure of the learned trial
judge to present to the jury the principal ground of defence put forward by the
appellant, his conviction cannot be sustained. Brooks v. The King
[19]

See also MacAskill v. The
King [20].

With deference to the learned
trial judge, and to the learned judges who have expressed a contrary opinion,
in view of the omission to so present the defence of abandonment a new trial
must be had.

Medos had fired the fatal shot. Henderson
would only be a party thereto if the evidence established the presence of a
common intention within the meaning of section 69 (2) between Henderson and
Medos up to and at the moment of the shooting. Among the alternative bases for
this common intention the Crown contended that the three parties had gone so
far that they had in law committed an attempt to rob the bank, had a common
intention to escape and to do whatever was necessary in order to effect that
escape, and that such intention had persisted up to and was their intention at
the time of the shooting. The learned trial judge held, and the majority of the
Court of Appeal, that what the three parties did in this case was beyond
preparation and not too remote to constitute an attempt in law.

The evidence is all to the effect
that the three parties had concluded their plan to rob the bank in question on
the previous night. They had obtained the equipment they deemed necessary,
including each a revolver and ammunition, and on the morning in question had
set out in an automobile to accomplish their purpose, that they proceeded to
the block of Renfrew Street upon which the bank was located and where
immediately they would have completed their robbery had the presence of the
police not frustrated their effort.

An attempt is defined in section
72 of the Criminal Code:

72. Every one who, having an
intent to commit an offence, does or omits an act for the purpose of
accomplishing his object is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence intended
whether under the circumstances it was possible to commit such offence or not.

[Page 244]

(2) The question whether an
act done or omitted with intent to commit an offence is or is not only
preparation for the commission of that offence, and too remote to constitute an
attempt to commit it, is a question of law.

Counsel for the accused referred
to a number of cases in which the attempted crime was either against the person
or that of obtaining by false pretences. He contended that any act not
""immediately connected with"" the completed crime would be too remote
to constitute an attempt. Even under the cases which he cited the accused may
still have one or more acts to do, and these be separated by an intervening
period of time, in order to complete the offence and yet may be guilty of an
attempt. This is illustrated with respect to false pretences by Rex v. John
Laitwood [21] and in
a case of murder Rex v. White [22]. In
the latter Bray J., in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal,
stated at p. 129:

*** that the completion or
attempted completion of one of a series of acts intended by a man to result in
killing is an attempt to murder even although this completed act would not,
unless followed by the other acts, result in killing.

Counsel for the accused further
submitted that in order to constitute an attempt there must be ""some
direct association or link between the attemptor and the attemptee"", and
referred to the case of Rex v. Robinson [23]
where Lord Chief Justice Reading stated at p. 349:

We think the conviction must
be quashed, *** upon the broad ground that no communication of any kind of the
false pretence was made to them.

Robinson, with the intention of
obtaining money by false pretences from his underwriters, was engaged in
procuring the evidence upon which he hoped eventually to induce them to pay him
a sum of money. Lord Chief Justice Reading stated that such was preparation and
""only remotely connected with the commission of the full offence"".

A false representation is one of
the essentials in the offence of obtaining by false pretences, but there is
nothing comparable to such nor its communication in a robbery such as Henderson and
his associates were here engaged

[Page 245]

upon. No case has been cited with
respect to this type of offence by which the parties had in any practical sense
covered the distance and in effect reached their objective only to be
frustrated by the police. In the type of offence with which we are here
concerned, it is the sudden and unexpected show of violence that makes the
commission of the crime possible. It seems only proper that such factors should
be taken into account when considering the question of remoteness.

In the Robinson case Lord
Chief Justice Reading quoted at p. 348 as a safe guide the language of Baron
Parke in Rex v. Eagleton [24] at p.
538:

The mere intention to commit
a misdemeanour is not criminal. Some act is required, and we do not think that
all acts towards committing a misdemeanour are indictable. Acts remotely
leading towards the commission of the offence are not to be considered as
attempts to commit it, but acts immediately connected with it are.

Then there is the oft quoted
statement of Blackburn, J. in Rex v. Cheeseman [25].

There is, no doubt, a
difference between the preparation antecedent to an offence, and the actual
attempt. But, if the actual transaction has commenced which would have ended in
the crime if not interrupted, there is clearly an attempt to commit the crime.
Then, applying that principle to this case, it is clear that the transaction
which would have ended in the crime of larceny had commenced here.

In that case the accused was
found guilty of an attempt to steal meat. He had used a false 14-lb. weight in
weighing same, which was discovered before the meat had actually been taken
away. Notwithstanding that fact, he was found guilty of an attempted larceny.

Henderson and his associates had,
with a common intention to rob the Royal Bank, perfected their plan, acquired
the equipment they deemed necessary, including their respective revolvers and
ammunition. All that completed, they had entered upon a course of conduct for
the purpose of immediately accomplishing their object. They had proceeded so
far that within sight of the bank they were frustrated by the presence of the police.
These circumstances in relation to the nature and character of the offence
intended constitute an attempt.

[Page 246]

With deference to those who hold
a contrary view, I am of the opinion that within the meaning of section 72 the
accused Henderson and his associates had committed an attempt to rob
the bank.

The appeal should be allowed and
a new trial directed.

LOCKE J.:—I agree with Mr.
Justice Robertson [26] that
the evidence disclosed that what was done by Henderson, Medos and Carter went
beyond mere preparation for the robbery and that there was evidence upon which
the jury might properly find that there had been an attempt to commit the
offence within sec. 72 (1) of the Code. I also agree with his conclusion
that in spite of the misdirection on this aspect of the matter there was no
prejudice to the accused.

I am, however, of the opinion
that there should be a new trial on the ground that what appears to me to have
been the principal defence of the accused was not adequately put to the jury by
the learned trial Judge. It was conceded in argument before us that Henderson,
with Medos and Carter, formed a common intention to rob the Renfrew Street
branch of the Royal Bank with the aid of firearms and that they were on their
way to the bank to carry out this unlawful purpose when they detected the
presence of the police car in front of the bank whereupon they left the
vicinity. Counsel for the accused, however, disputes the theory of the Crown
that it was part of the original unlawful purpose to resist arrest by violence
after robbing the bank, or that Henderson was a party to such an unlawful
purpose in connection with the attempt, and alternatively contends that if such
had been the purpose it was abandoned by the three men prior to or at the time
they were taken in charge by the police officers: further it is said that in
the case of Henderson his submitting to being disarmed by Detective Hoare and
his conduct after Medos and Carter started to run away indicated that, if there
was then a continuing unlawful purpose on the part of the others to resist
apprehension or to escape from custody by violence, he had disassociated
himself from that purpose in such manner that he was no longer responsible in
law for the unlawful acts of his former confederates. With

[Page 247]

great respect for the learned
trial Judge, I have come to the conclusion that his charge to the jury was
inadequate to put these vital issues clearly before them. It is true that in
the course of dealing with the case for the Crown comment was made on the
question of the abandonment of any unlawful purpose by Henderson and that in
dealing with the defence the matter was mentioned in the following words:—

It was pointed out that Henderson did
not resist, that the movement started at the south end of the line. It was
suggested that Henderson could not do anything else because he was in the
line of fire except to run. It was pointed out that he said: ""I will not
run away, I will give myself up. This is not my gun, it is his."" That was
at the very end of the chapter. It was pointed out that they were walking
slowly on the Flats. It was pointed out that they did not shoot, if they had
such common intention, when Boyes and Ledingham came up, that they did not all
move together, and that by way of explanation of Henderson's conduct
immediately after the shooting you are entitled to take into consideration the
fact he is of tender years, that is to say he is a boy of seventeen.

It was, however, of vital concern
to the accused that the attention of the jury should have been directed to the
actions relied upon by him as evidence of the abandonment of the original
unlawful purpose by the three conspirators and of the acts on his part which it
was contended indicated that he had so disassociated himself from any unlawful
purpose as to relieve him from any criminal responsibility. While no objection
was made at the conclusion of the Judge's charge it was the prisoner's right to
have the jury instructed upon this feature of the case MacAskill v. The
King [27] Duff, J.
at 335.

There should be a new trial.

Appeal allowed,
conviction quashed, and new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Incest—Brother and sister—Trial
by jury—Evidence of consanguinity—Admissions by accused—Hearsay—Criminal Code
section 204.

The accused was found guilty on a charge of
having committed incest with his sister. At the trial, the proof of
consanguinity was based mostly on two letters which the complainant said she
had received

[Page 334]

from the accused, in one of which he
addressed her as “Sis.” and the other in which he had signed “Brot. Chris.
Smith.” The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction on the ground that there was
no evidence as to the relationship between the accused and the complainant.

Held: A person
accused of incest may admit the relationship and the jury was entitled to treat
both letters as admissions against him and to say that a blood relationship was
meant by the expressions used.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1],
quashing (Roach J.A. dissenting) the conviction of the respondent on a charge
of incest with his sister, contrary to section 204 of the Criminal Code.

The material facts of the case and the questions
at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.

W.B. Common, K.C. for the appellant.

H.W. Allen for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin
J. was delivered by

KERWIN J.:—The accused was found guilty on a
charge that he, well-knowing the complainant Elsie Schmidt to be his sister,
did unlawfully commit incest with her contrary to section 204 of the Criminal
Code. Subsection 1 thereof, so far as applicable,
provides:—“... every brother and sister,... who cohabit or have sexual
intercourse with each other shall each of them, if aware of their
consanguinity, be deemed to have committed incest”. By subsection 2
“brother” and “sister”, respectively, include half-brother and half-sister. The
Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] quashed
the conviction, Roach, J.A., dissenting. The two points upon which there is a
difference of opinion in that Court are: First, whether there was an admission
by the accused of the alleged relationship between him and Elsie Schmidt and,
second, even if that be so, whether that admission was evidence upon which the
jury might convict. These are the sole points for determination in this appeal.

What is relied upon as admissions appears in two
letters written by the accused. The first is dated July 15, 1947, and written
from some place in Saskatchewan to Elsie,

[Page 335]

commencing “Dear Sis” and signed “Chris”. The
second is dated August 6th, 1947, on the letter-head of the Waterloo County
gaol where the accused was at the time incarcerated, having been charged with
the crime of which he was subsequently convicted. This letter is addressed
“Dear Elsie” and is signed “Brat. Chris Smith”. No point is made as to the
surname, either “Schmidt” or “Smith” apparently having been used
indiscriminately. The majority of the Court of Appeal2 were willing
to assume that the abbreviation “Brot” meant brother but were of opinion that
there was no evidence to show in what sense that term and “Dear Sis” were used.
Mr. Justice Aylesworth, speaking for himself and Mr. Justice
Henderson, put the matter thus:

“Sister” and particularly “sis or “Brot”
(if by the latter is meant brother) are not terms by any means restricted to
use between blood relatives. These expressions land themselves with equal
facility to many other relationships for example, an adopted child, or a child
merely taken into a family and raised therein as a family member, readily turns
to their use.

Mr. Justice Roach was of opinion that in
view of the background, to which reference will be made later, the jury were
entitled to accept these terms as evidence of a blood relationship between the
two.

On the second point the majority of the Court of
Appeal2 took the view that if the accused believed he was a brother
of the complainant, there was nothing to show that such a belief was founded on
anything except hearsay. On the other hand, the dissenting judge believed that
what was written by the accused was an admission entitled to be relied upon in
the same way, although not necessarily with the same force, as if the accused,
while in the witness box and while denying the act of intercourse, had under
oath stated that he and Elsie were brother and sister.

The two points may conveniently be considered
together. The background referred to by Mr. Justice Roach appears in his
reasons and in those of Mr. Justice Aylesworth. What follows is taken from
the latter:—

The complainant, Elsie Schmidt, testified
that accused was twenty years her senior and her eldest brother; that neither
of the parents (Sophie and Phillip Smith) had “remarried”; that accused was not
at home very much; that she saw him for the first time when she was at the home
in Saskatchewan and six years of age and for the second time, again in the
home, in 1942 when she was twelve or thirteen years of age; that he

[Page 336]

returned about September, 1944, some two
weeks before she left to attend school in Alberta; that he came again to the
home in the spring of 1946 and stayed there until July 1947 when she came
to her sister in Kitchener; that the accused came to Kitchener where the
offence is alleged to have taken place.

Martha Doherty gave evidence that she was
the sister of the complainant and of the accused; that she was sixteen years
younger than accused; that she lived at home with her parents in Saskatchewan
until 1942 and that up to that time she and all of her sisters and brothers
except the accused, (that is to say, Martha, George, Olga and Elsie) lived at
home; that the first time she remembered the accused coming to the home she was
about ten years of age and that thereafter he was home “off and on” for two or
three months at a time; that “our parents told us he was our brother” and “we
always felt towards him like he was our brother”; that the attitude of the
parents was the same towards the accused as to “The rest of us” that neither of
the parents had married “previously”; that all of the children were children of
the same parents; that her parents came from Russia and that the accused was
born in Russia.

Ordinarily an admission of a fact made by a
party is evidence against him of that fact. The statement in section 1053
of the third edition of Wigmore on Evidence that admissions are not subject to
the rule for testimonial qualifications of personal knowledge is borne out by
the decision, referred to by the author, of the Court of Appeal of Alberta in Stowe
v. Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co.[3],
affirmed in this Court[4]. In
such a case as this there is no reason why a statement by the accused of his
relationship with the complainant is not evidence any more than if he had
stated it in the witness box, as referred to by Roach, J. Certainly the accused
could have pleaded guilty to the charge and in principle and logic I can find
no reason for saying that an admission out of Court is not admissible and
relevant evidence. In Evan Jones[5] the
Court of Criminal Appeal in England decided that an admission, in writing, of a
person charged with incest with his daughter was sufficient to prove the
relationship. In argument before us stress was laid on the fact that in that
case the accused in his notice of appeal at first asked for leave to appeal
against sentence only. That, however, could have had no effect upon the
question as to whether at the time of the trial the father’s evidence, which
was the only evidence, was sufficient to permit the case to go to the jury. The
decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in The King v. Smith[6], where the only evidence as to the

[Page 337] 

relationship of parent and child in a case of
incest was that of the girl, herself, aged eleven years, must be taken as a
decision that in the particular circumstances of that case, the Judge in the
County Court Judge’s Criminal Court was right when he decided that there was
not sufficient proof of relationship.

It should be held that a person accused of this
offence may admit the relationship. It is suggested that there are reasons why
an admission might be taken from a father that would not operate in the case of
brother and sister but circumstances may be imagined where some objection might
in theory be raised even as to the evidence of the mother who at the time of
confinement was in a large hospital. While the guilt of an accused must be
proved beyond reasonable doubt, juries are properly charged not to let fanciful
ideas take possession of their minds in coming to a conclusion as to whether
that onus has been satisfied. With respect, that remark applies to the suggestion
in the present case that the terms “Dear Sis” and “Brot” might have been used
by the accused even if no blood relationship existed.

In the light of all the circumstances detailed
above, the jury were entitled to say that a blood relationship was meant by the
expressions used, and the charge of the trial judge being unobjectionable, the
appeal should be allowed. However, as other questions were raised by the
accused before the Court of Appeal, the proper order is that the case should be
remitted to that Court for further consideration as was done in The King v.
Boak[7] and The
King v. Duer[8].

The judgment of Taschereau, Rand and Kellock JJ.
was delivered by

KELLOCK J.:—The point of dissent upon which this
appeal comes to us is that in the view of the majority there was no evidence as
to the relationship between the accused and the complainant, while the view of
Roach, J.A., dissenting, was that there was both oral and written evidence upon
which the jury properly convicted.

The complainant and her sister, Martha, called
on behalf of the Crown, testified in the first place to treatment of

[Page 338]

the accused as a member of the family and the
sister testified also to statements made to her by her parents that the accused
was their brother. In the third place, there were the two letters which the
complainant said she had received from the accused, in one of which he had
addressed her as “Sis” and the other in which he had signed “Brot. Chris.
Smith”.

Dealing first with the letters, I think the
abbreviation “Brot.” is to be interpreted as having been used as an
abbreviation of the word “brother” and the jury were entitled to treat both
letters, if they considered the handwriting of the accused to have been proved,
as admissions against him.

In Woods v. Woods[9], there was in question a criminal
proceeding for incest against the accused in having intermarried with the
daughter of his own sister. The relationship involved in the present case was
therefore involved in that case, that is, whether the accused and the mother of
the person he had married were brother and sister. Evidence was given as to an
admission made by the accused that the person he had married was his own niece.
Doctor Lushington at page 521 said:

The next point is that we have the
acknowledgment of George Woods himself of the existence of the relationship
between the parties. This is evidence against himself, and similar evidence has
been admitted in criminal cases, even where life has been at stake,...

As to the evidence secondly referred to above, it
is plain that the parents are still alive and living within the jurisdiction.
Accordingly, while it was competent for the sisters to testify as to their
observation of the treatment of the accused in the family, it was not open to
Martha to testify as to statements made to her by her parents when they are
still living, there being no explanation for their not having been called. Pendrell
v. Pendrell[10];
Taylor on Evidence, 12th Ed., 410.

The situation, therefore, is that the jury have
convicted upon a record which contains inadmissible evidence although its
admission was not objected to. The lack of objection, however, is immaterial; Rex
v. Farrell[11]. I do
not think it would be right to allow the conviction to stand on the basis of
the admissible evidence including the admissions in view of the nature of the
admissions in all the

[Page 339]

circumstances. Both the words “Sis” and
“Brother” are used at times in circumstances where there is no blood
relationship and it is for the jury to estimate the weight to be given to them
against the background of the other evidence: Newton v. Belcher[12].

In my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be
allowed and we should make the order which the Court of Appeal ought to have
made, namely, direct a new trial; Northey v. The King[13] and cases cited; Manchuk v. The King[14]; Savard and Lizotte v. The King[15].

Appeal allowed and new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Possession of a firearm capable
of being concealed upon the person while committing any criminal offence—Whether
the words “any criminal offence”, The Criminal Code, s. 122, includes any criminal offence the
essential element of which is the possession of a firearm—The Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1927, c. 36, s. 122 as re-enacted by S. of C., 1938, c. 44, s. 7.

Held: (Kerwin
J. dissenting)—To avoid the absurdities, inconsistencies or repugnancies which
a perusal of other sections of the Code would otherwise give rise
to, the words “any criminal offence” as used in s. 122 are restricted to an
offence of which the possession of a firearm capable of being concealed upon
the person, is not an essential element. In the result Rex. v. Maskiew
(1945) 53 Man. R., 281, overruled.

Per Kerwin J.
(dissenting)—By themselves the words “any criminal offence” do not admit of two
interpretations and therefore the applicable rule is that set out in Grey v.
Pearson 6 H.L. Cas. 61 at 106; Victoria City v. Bishop of
Vancouver Island, [1921] A.C. 384 at 387.

Another principle in the construction of
statutes applicable to s. 122 is: “If the words of an Act are clear, you must
follow them, even though they lead to a manifest absurdity”—Reg. v. Judge
of City of London Court, (1892) 1 Q.B. 273, 290; Cook v. Charles A.
Vogaler Co., [1901] A.C., 102, 107. The remedy lies with Parliament and not
with the Courts—Canadian Performing Right Society v. Famous Players Canadian
Corp. [1929] A.C. 456 at 460.

APPEAL by leave granted under
section 1025 of the Criminal Code, from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1]
quashing a conviction of the respondent. The respondent was charged on two
counts. The first laid under section 446 (c) of the Code, alleged
robbery while armed; the second, laid under section 122 of the Code, alleged
possession of a firearm capable of being concealed upon the person while
committing a criminal offence. The accused pleaded guilty to the first charge
and not guilty to the second. He was convicted on both and sentenced to two
years imprisonment on the first, and to an additional two years on the second.
He appealed his conviction on the second charge.

W.P. Common, K.C. for the appellant.

Arthur E. Maloney for the respondent.

[Page 509]

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Estey, J.
was delivered by:

ESTEY J.:—The accused, Peter Quon, on the early
morning of the 30th of March, 1947, entered a restaurant in the City of Toronto
and there, armed with a revolver, intimidated and robbed the proprietor, Sam
Lun, of $75. In the proceedings that followed he pleaded guilty to an offence
contrary to section 446(c) of the Criminal Code, and was
found guilty of an offence of having on his person a revolver, contrary to
section 122 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced under
sec. 446(c) to a term of two years in the penitentiary and to a
further term of two years under sec. 122.

The Crown appeals from a judgment of the
Appellate Court for Ontario quashing the conviction under the second count on
the basis that the words “any criminal offence” in sec. 122 “do not
include any criminal offence an essential element of which is the possession
upon the person of a pistol, revolver or any firearm capable of being concealed
upon the person.”

The learned Judges of the Appellate Court while
of the opinion that the words “any criminal offence” standing by themselves
were exhaustive and would include every offence created by the Code, were
of the opinion that Parliament did not intend these words as used in
sec. 122 should be given that exhaustive meaning but rather the restricted
meaning above indicated. In this regard the learned Judges disagreed with the
decision of Rex v. Maskiew[2] a
decision of the Appellate Court in Manitoba.

Sec. 122 reads as follows:

122. Everyone who has upon his person a
rifle, shotgun, pistol, revolver or any firearm capable of being concealed upon
the person while committing any criminal offence is guilty of an offence
against this section and liable to imprisonment for a term not less than
two years in addition to any penalty to which he may be sentenced for the first
mentioned offence, and an offence against this section shall be punishable
either on indictment or summary conviction in the same manner as the first
mentioned offence.

(2) Such imprisonment shall be served after
undergoing any term of imprisonment to which such person may be sentenced for
the first mentioned offence.

Sections 118 to 129 of the Criminal Code
were repealed in 1933 and as re-enacted embody several material changes.

[Page 510]

Sec. 122, prior thereto sec. 120, was
one of these sections. As amended it applied only to a pistol, revolver or
other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person (the rifle and shotgun
were added in 1938). At the same session Parliament enacted sec. 118 and
provided that “every one * * * who not having a permit in
Form 76, has upon his person, elsewhere than in his own dwelling house,
shop * * * a pistol, revolver, or other firearm, capable of
being concealed upon the person” is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. The identical
weapons are dealt with in 1933 in both secs. 118 and 122. The learned
Judges of the Appellate Court point out that a literal construction of the
language used in 1922 would result in that one found guilty under 118 is also
guilty of an offence under sec. 122 and liable to a further minimum term
of two years imprisonment. The learned Judges also referred to secs. 115, 116,
117, 123 and 124, and pointed out that with respect to these a similar
absurdity or repugnancy would result.

Then with respect to the offence of burglary
under sec. 457, paragraph (2) thereof provides:

457. (2) Every one convicted of an offence
under this section who when arrested, or when he committed such offence,
had upon his person any offensive weapon, shall, in addition to the
imprisonment above prescribed, be liable to be whipped.

This subsection covers with respect to
burglary all that sec. 122 provides for if the latter be given the meaning
contended for by the Crown. It cannot be that Parliament intended sec. 122
should apply to burglary in view of the provisions of sec. 457(2).

The foregoing absurdities, inconsistencies or
repugnancies are such as to justify a Court adopting that construction of the
language in sec. 122 as may avoid them, In Grey v. Pearson[3] at p. 104, Lord Wensleydale stated:

I have been long and deeply impressed with
the wisdom of the rule, now, I believe, universally adopted, at least in the
Courts of Law in Westminster Hall, that in construing wills and indeed
statutes, and all written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of
the words is to be adhered to, unless that would lead to some absurdity, or
some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which case
the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified, so as to avoid
that absurdity and inconsistency, but no further.

This passage has been repeatedly approved.

[Page 511]

The construction given to this section by
the learned Judges of the Appellate Court avoids these absurdities and
repugnancies. Moreover, that construction seems to be supported by a perusal of
many sections of the Code. The group of sections such as 115
to 129 deal in the main with custody and possession of the specified weapons
under certain circumstances; then the offences such as sec. 264 (attempts
murder); sec. 273 (wounding with intent); sec. 446 (robbery) cover
those cases in which the weapons are used in the manner as therein described.
In all of these latter offences the maximum punishment provided is life
imprisonment. In those sections where possession or custody is the basis
of the offence, Parliament has in mind the mischief or risk to the public
occasioned by the possession of one of these firearms. Apart from 122 there is
no section that deals with the having, with or without a permit, the
firearms specified in 122 upon the person of one while committing a criminal
offence. A firearm upon the person of a criminal while committing an offence is
fraught with the greatest possible danger to the public, when detected, he
resorts to his firearm with usually serious and sometimes fatal consequences to
one or more of the public. It is in sec. 122, as in the other
sections with which it is associated under the heading “Offensive Weapons”,
that Parliament seeks to punish and to that extent to protect the public
against the possession or custody of these firearms and thereby avoid the
consequences already suggested.

The construction adopted by the Court of Appeal
removes the absurdities, inconsistencies and repugnancies, and in my opinion is
consistent with the position of sec. 122 in the Code in relation to
the other offences.

The appeal should be dismissed.

KERWIN J. (dissenting):—By leave granted under
section 1025 of the Criminal Code, the Attorney-General of Ontario
appeals to this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for that province[4] quashing a conviction of the respondent
Quon. The basis of the reasons for that decision, delivered by Mr. Justice
Roach on behalf of the Court, is that the words “any criminal offence” in
section 122 of the Code do not include a criminal offence an
essential element

[Page 512]

of which is the possession upon the person of a
pistol, revolver or any firearm capable of being concealed upon the person.
Section 122 at the relevant time was as follows:—

122. (1) Every one who has upon his person
a rifle, shotgun, pistol, revolver or any firearm capable of being concealed
upon the person while committing any criminal offence is guilty of an offence
against this section and liable to imprisonment for a term not less than
two years in addition to any penalty to which he may be sentenced for the first
mentioned offence, and an offence against this section shall be punishable
either on indictment or summary conviction in the same manner as the first
mentioned offence.

(2) Such imprisonment shall be served after
undergoing any term of imprisonment to which such person may be sentenced for
the first mentioned offence.

Quon was convicted of an offence under this
section and it was that conviction that was set aside. He had already
pleaded guilty to a charge that at the City of Toronto on or about the 30th day
of March, 1947, being armed with an offensive weapon, to wit, a pistol, he
robbed Sam Lun of the sum of $75 in money, which charge was laid under
section 446(c) of the Code:—

446. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for life and to be whipped who

* * *

(c) being armed with an offensive weapon or
instrument robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any person.

It is common ground that the pistol mentioned in
this charge is the same pistol referred to in the charge under
section 122.

The reasoning of the Court of Appeal applies
even though an accused has never been convicted or even charged under
section 446 and, as pointed out by Roach J.A., the decision is in conflict
with the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba in Rex v. Maskiew [5]. Chief Justice Macpherson in that case
gives the history of the two sections of the Code set out above and
in my view that history emphasizes the all inclusiveness of the words “any
criminal offence” in section 122. Even though some of the results set out
by Mr. Justice Roach may in certain circumstances ensue, I am unable, with
respect, for that reason, to cut down the meaning of those plain unambiguous
words.

By themselves the words do not admit of two
interpretations and therefore the applicable rule is set out by Lord

[Page 513]

Atkinson, speaking for the Judicial Committee,
in Victoria City v. Bishop of Vancouver Island[6] in the second paragraph of the
following extract at 387-388:—

In the construction of statutes their words
must be interpreted in their ordinary grammatical sense, unless there be
something in the context, or in the object of the statute in which they occur,
or in the circumstances with reference to which they are used, to show that
they were used in a special sense different from their ordinary grammatical
sense. In Grey v. Pearson[7] Lord
Wensleydale said: “I have been long and deeply impressed with the wisdom of the
rule, now I believe, universally adopted, at least in the Courts of Law in
Westminster Hall, that in construing wills, and indeed statutes, and all
written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be
adhered to, unless that would lead to some absurdity, or some repugnance or
inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which case the grammatical
and ordinary sense of the words may be modified, so as to avoid that absurdity
and inconsistency, but no farther.” Lord Blackburn quoted this passage with
approval in Caledonian Ry. Co. v. North British Ry. Co.[8], as did also Jessel M.R. in Ex parte
Walton[9].

There is another principle in the
construction of statutes specially applicable to this section. It is thus
stated by Lord Esher in Reg. v. Judge of the City of London Court[10]:

“If the words of an Act are clear, you must
follow them, even though they lead to a manifest absurdity. The Court has
nothing to do with the question whether the legislature has committed an
absurdity. In my opinion, the rule has always been this:—If the words of an Act
admit of two interpretations, then they are not clear; and if one interpretation
leads to an absurdity, and the other does not, the Court will conclude that the
legislature did not intend to lead to an absurdity, and will adopt the other
interpretation.” And Lord Halsbury in Cooke v. Charles A. Vogeler Co.[11] said: “But a court of law has nothing to
do with the reasonableness or unreasonableness of a provision, except so far as
it may help them in interpreting what the legislature has said.” Which
necessarily means that for this latter purpose it is legitimate to take into
consideration the reasonableness or unreasonableness of any provision of a
statute.

Again a section of a statute should,
if possible, be construed so that there may be no repugnancy or inconsistency
between its different portions or members.

I have quoted these three paragraphs because
Lord Wensleydale’s statement in Gray v. Pearson, referred to in the
first paragraph, has been relied upon by the Court of Appeal in coming to its
conclusion but since there is no ambiguity in the words themselves, “any
criminal offence”, the relevant rule in my opinion, as I have stated, is that
set forth in the second paragraph. It is true that there are cases in the books
where the meaning of a word of general import

[Page 514]

has been restricted. Examples of such cases are River
Wear Commissioners v. Adamson[12] and Cox
v. Hakes[13], but
no decision of authority can be found to say that where, as here, two offences
are created by the same Act, a general expression found in one section is
to be cut down because a Court may think such construction would lead to some
inconvenience or absurdity. The remarks of Lord Chief Justice Reading, speaking
for the Court of Criminal Appeal in Frederick Miles[14], at 15, are appropriate: “But it is
perfectly plain that in such a case as this, if a jury have given a verdict for
one offence, a jury can give a verdict for another offence.” Here, there is a
separate and distinct offence created by section 122 and what I consider,
with deference, to be the plain intent of Parliament must be given effect to.
The remedy lies with Parliament and not with the Courts, as pointed out in the
judgment of the Judicial Committee in Canadian Performing Right Society v. Famous
Players Canadian Corp.[15] at
460:—

Strenuous efforts, however, have been made by
counsel for the appellants to induce their Lordships to accept a
construction other than the literal one, and it is necessary therefore to
consider whether such a construction is the correct one. Great stress is laid
by the appellants on the extreme inconvenience of a literal construction. It
may, it is said, be practically impossible, when occasion arises to register an
assignment, to obtain a duplicate without which, as it would appear,
registration is impossible.

One answer to this argument is that it
ought to be addressed to the legislature and not to the tribunal of
construction, whose duty it is to say what the words mean, not what they should
be made to mean in order to avoid inconvenience or hardship.

Counsel for the accused argued that he was
entitled to uphold the order setting aside the conviction upon the ground of res
judicata. The members of the Court of Appeal were unanimous and, if they
really decided the point against the accused, the latter has not the right to
ask us to determine it as that would in effect permit him to appeal to this
Court in a case not provided for by the Code. In an early part of his
judgment, Mr. Justice Roach states: “In my opinion it is clear that the
appellant has a complete defence to the second charge but it is not the defence
of res judicata” but, towards the end, after referring to a
number of cases cited on behalf of the accused, he continues: “On my
interpretation of section 122, neither

[Page 515]

the defence of autrefois convict or res
judicata has any application.” I take it from these two extracts that the
Court of Appeal did not consider the defence of res judicata and, if
that be so, the proper order is that the case be remitted to that Court in
order that it may pass upon that defence: The King v. Boak[16]. On the other hand, if the Court of Appeal
decided the point against the accused, the result will be that his conviction
will be affirmed.

TASCHEREAU J.—The Attorney General for Ontario
appeals from a judgment of the Court of Appeal, unanimously quashing the
conviction of the respondent Quon. Special leave to appeal was granted by the
Honourable Mr. Justice Estey, on the ground that this judgment conflicts
on a question of law with a judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Province of
Manitoba, Rex v. Maskiew[17].

The respondent was charged on two counts:

1. That at the City of Toronto on or about
the 30th day of March, 1947, being armed with an offensive weapon, to wit: a
pistol, he robbed Sam Lun of the sum of $75 in money, the property of Melody
Lunch and Sam Lun, contrary to the Criminal Code.

2. And further, at the City of Toronto on
or about the 30th day of March, 1947, he had upon his person a pistol or
revolver or firearm, capable of being concealed upon the person while
committing a criminal offence, contrary to the Criminal Code.

The respondent pleaded guilty to the first count
and not guilty to the second. He was sentenced on the first charge to two years
in the Penitentiary, and having been found guilty on the second charge, he was
sentenced to a further term of two years consecutive.

The charge under the first count was laid
pursuant to the provisions of section 446(c) of the Criminal Code
which reads as follows:

446 (c). Robbery while armed.—Being
armed with an offensive weapon or instrument robs, or assaults with intent to
rob, any person.

The charge under the second count was made
pursuant to section 122, which is as follows:

122. Armed while committing offence.—Everyone
who has upon his person a rifle, shotgun, pistol, revolver or any firearm
capable of being concealed upon the person while committing any criminal
offence is guilty of an offence against this section and liable to
imprisonment for a term not less than two years in addition to any penalty to
which he may be

[Page 516]

sentenced for the first mentioned offence,
and an offence against this section shall be punishable either on
indictment or summary conviction in the same manner as the first mentioned
offence.

(2) Such imprisonment shall be served after
undergoing any term of imprisonment to which such person may be sentenced for
the first mentioned offence.

It is common ground that on the 30th day of
March, 1947, the respondent entered a restaurant of which the proprietor was
Sam Lun, at the south-west corner of Carleton and Jarvis Streets in the City of
Toronto. The respondent had a revolver in his hand and intimidated the
proprietor and robbed him of about $75. It is to be noted that the charge on
the first count relates to the 30th day of March, 1947, and that the charge on
the second count also relates to the same date. It is admitted that the
revolver which Quon had in his hand and the possession of which is an essential
element of the crime committed under the first count, is the same offensive
weapon which can be concealed, and which is mentioned in the second count.

This section 122 which is an amendment to
the Criminal Code (1938), was enacted in order to increase the
punishment when certain crimes are committed while the authors are bearers of
arms which may be concealed, and which give to the offences a more dangerous
character. It has however very far reaching consequences which the draftsman
obviously did not all foresee. It applies to anyone who while committing any
criminal offence has on his person a weapon which may be concealed. It
would therefore apply to a man who, while writing a defamatory libel, has a
revolver in his pocket, or to a person for example who, while violating the
provisions of sections 221 and 222 of the Criminal Code relating to
common nuisances, is in possession of an arm which may be concealed. But,
fortunately, we have not to decide these cases, and they are matters to be
dealt with by the proper legislative authorities, and not by the judiciary.

The question put before this Court is:

Does section 122 of the Criminal
Code find its application, when it is an essential element of the “criminal
offence”, that the guilty person be the bearer of an offensive weapon? (a
revolver in the present case).

It is submitted that the plain grammatical
interpretation of section 122, is that the section applies to any
person who, while committing any criminal offence, has upon his

person a rifle, shotgun, pistol, revolver or any
firearm capable of being concealed upon the person. It is argued that the
language of this section is plain and unambiguous and that the judgment of
the Court of Appeal is wrong in that the principles applied by that Court in
its reasons for judgment are to be applied, only when the language of the
statute to be interpreted, is ambiguous and capable of more than one meaning.

I do not think that this reasoning applies here.
If the Crown’s contention is adopted, it will mean that the respondent is to be
punished for a robbery of $75 when armed with a revolver, and that he will
receive an additional punishment because he had on his person that very same
revolver, which was an element of the first criminal offence.

I have had the occasion of reading the reasons
for judgment of my brother Kellock, and I agree with him that Parliament never
contemplated such an unreasonable and shocking result. Words are primarily to
be construed in their popular sense unless such a construction would lead to a
manifest absurdity. If they lead to an absurdity, the words may be modified so
as to avoid it. (Halsbury’s Laws of England, 2nd Ed. Vol. 31, at pages 480, 482
and 483).

I believe that this rule must be applied here,
and that it should be held that the words “any criminal offence”, found in
section 122 mean an offence, where the possession of a firearm susceptible
of being concealed, is not an element.

I think that the Court of Appeal of Ontario was
right in its conclusion, and I would therefore dismiss this appeal.

KELLOCK J.:—The respondent was charged in the
County Court Judge’s Criminal Court on two counts as follows:

1. That at the City of Toronto on or about
the 30th day of March, 1947, being armed with an offensive weapon, to wit a
pistol, he robbed Sam Lum of the sum of $75 in money, the property of Melody
Lunch and Sam Lun, contrary to the Criminal Code.

2. And further that at the City of Toronto
on or about the 30th day of March, 1947, he had upon his person a pistol or
revolver or fire-arm capable of being concealed upon the person while
committing a criminal offence contrary to the Criminal Code.

He pleaded guilty to the first count and not
guilty to the second count. Evidence was submitted on the second count and he
was found guilty. The sentence on the first count was two years in the
penitentiary and on the second

[Page 518]

count a further term of two years. The charge
under the first count was laid under the provisions of section 446(c)
of the Criminal Code and that under the second under section 122.

The facts are not in dispute. In the early
morning of the 30th of March, 1947, the respondent entered a restaurant in the
City of Toronto, the proprietor of which was one Sam Lun. Respondent had a
revolver in his hand and with it intimidated Lun, and effected the robbery. It
is common ground that both charges arise out of these circumstances and that
the pistol referred to in the second charge is the same pistol as is referred
to in the first charge.

On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario the
appeal was allowed and it was held that the words “any criminal offence” in
section 122 do not include an offence an essential element of which is the
possession of a firearm capable of being concealed upon the person. The Crown
now appeals pursuant to leave granted, on the ground of conflict between the
judgment here in question and the decision of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba
in Rex. v. Maskiew[18].

The relevant sections of the Code are
as follows:

445. Robbery is theft accompanied with
violence or threats of violence to any person or property used to extort the
property stolen, or to prevent or overcome resistance to its being stolen.

446. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for life and to be whipped who

(c) being armed with an offensive
weapon or instrument robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any person;

447. Every one who commits robbery is
guilty of an indictable offence and liable to fourteen years’ imprisonment and
to be whipped.

Section 122, as enacted by 2 Geo. VI, cap.
44, section 7, reads as follows:

122. (1) Every one who has upon his person
a rifle, shot-gun, pistol, revolver or any firearm capable of being concealed
upon the person while committing any criminal offence is guilty of an offence
against this section and liable to imprisonment for a term not less than
two years in addition to any penalty to which he may be sentenced for the first
mentioned offence, and an offence against this section shall be punishable
either on indictment or summary conviction in the same manner as the first
mentioned offence.

(2) Such imprisonment shall be served after
undergoing any term of imprisonment to which such person may be sentenced for
the first mentioned offence.

[Page 519]

On the view of the appellant as to the effect of
these two sections, the possession of the revolver by the respondent in the
commission of the robbery took the respondent out of section 445 and
raised the offence to one within section 446(c), while at the same
time, the same fact, i.e., the possession of the revolver constituted an
additional and separate offence within section 122.

In approaching the question as to the proper view
to be taken of the meaning of the statute, I think there are well settled
principles to be kept in mind. The first is illustrated by Wemys v. Hopkins[19]. In that case a complaint was preferred
against the appellant under 5 and 6 Wm. IV, c. 50 (1), s. 78, for that being
the driver of a carriage on a highway, by negligence or wilful misbehaviour,
viz., by striking a certain horse ridden by the respondent, caused her hurt and
damage. The appellant was convicted on this charge and fined. Subsequently a
complaint was preferred against him under 24 and 25 Vict., c. 100, s. 42, for
that he did on the same date as that in question on the first complaint and by
reason of the same conduct, unlawfully assault, strike, and otherwise abuse the
respondent. On this charge he was also convicted and fined. The question for
the court was whether, the appellant having been convicted on the first, could
also be convicted on the second complaint. It was held he could not. Blackburn,
J., at p. 381 said:

The defence does not arise on a plea of
autrefois convict, but on the well established rule at common law, that when a
person has been convicted and punished for an offence by a court of competent
jurisdiction, transit in rem judicatam, that is, the conviction shall be
a bar to all further proceedings for the same offence, and he shall not be
punished again for the same matter; otherwise there might be two different
punishments for the same offence * * * It is necessary in
the present case to have it proved * * * that on a former
occasion the appellant was charged with the same assault, although not in the
same words, yet in terms the same, and that he was then convicted and punished.

The above principle is embodied in
section 14 of the Code. The common law principle is as applicable,
in my opinion, in the case of two sections of the same statute as in the
case of separate statutes.

There is also to be borne in mind the second
principle, as stated by Cockburn, C.J., in Queen v. Elrington[20] at 696, viz.: “the well established
principle of our criminal

[Page 520]

law that a series of charges shall not be
preferred and, whether a party accused of a minor offence is acquitted or
convicted, he shall not be charged again on the same facts in a more aggravated
form”. Section 907 embodies this latter principle.

It is obvious of course that Parliament may, if
it sees fit, constitute two separate offences out of the same act or omission
or make part of an act or omission or one or more of a series of acts or
omissions a separate offence additional to that constituted by the complete act
or omission or the whole series.

In the light of the principles referred to,
which are fundamental principles of the criminal law, one asks one’s self
whether Parliament has in fact as to the statutory provisions here in question,
departed from these principles and shown the intention that the possession of a
firearm in the commission of the offence of robbery, which thereby raises the
offence to that of armed robbery, shall also constitute a separate and distinct
offence under section 122. In other words, does the statute, taken as a
whole, indicate that the words “any criminal offence” in section 122 are
used in other than their literal all inclusive sense?

The argument for the appellant is based squarely
upon the literal interpretation of this phrase. Where statutory language admits
of only one meaning, then, of course no other meaning may be applied but it is
the intention of the legislature upon the whole statute that is the determining
factor. The matter is put thus in Maxwell, On the Interpretation of
Statutes, 7th Ed. p. 2.

The first and most elementary rule of
construction is that it is to be assumed that the words and phrases of
technical legislation are used in their technical meaning if they have acquired
one, and; otherwise, in their ordinary meaning; and, secondly, that the phrases
and sentences are to be construed according to the rules of grammar. From these
presumptions it is not allowable to depart where the language admits of no
other meaning. Nor should there be any departure from them where the language
under consideration is susceptible of another meaning, unless adequate grounds
are found, either in the history or cause of the enactment or in the context or
in the consequences which would result from the literal interpretation, for
concluding that that interpretation does not give the real intention of the
Legislature. If there is nothing to modify, nothing to alter, nothing to
qualify, the language which the statute contains, it must be construed in the
ordinary and natural meaning of the words and sentences. The great fundamental
principal is:—

“In construing wills and, indeed, statutes
and all written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is
to be adhered to,

[Page 521]

unless that would lead to some absurdity,
or some repugnancy or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which
case the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified so as to
avoid that absurdity and inconsistency, but no farther.”

However, the mere use of a general word, even
the “any” does not end the matter. In Cox v. Hakes[21] Lord Halsbury, L.C., at p. 517 said:

* * * it is impossible to
contend that the mere fact of a general word being used in a statute precludes
all inquiry into the object of the statute or the mischief which it was
intended to remedy.

While it was in that case admitted that the case
with which the House was dealing fell within the literal meaning of the statute
this meaning was rejected. In the words of Lord Bramwell at p. 526:

* * * if the result would be
futile, or lead to an absurdity, the right way of dealing with those words is
to put a limit on them;

In River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson[22] where the House had to deal with a similar
question, Lord Blackburn said at page 763:

In all cases the object is to see what is
the intention expressed by the words used. But, from the imperfection of
language, it is impossible to know what that intention is without inquiring
farther, and seeing what the circumstances were with reference to which the
words were used, and what was the object, appearing from those circumstances,
which the person using them had in view; for the meaning of words varies
according to the circumstances with respect to which they were used.

And at page 764 he said:

* * * and I believe that it
is not disputed that what Lord Wensleydale used to call the golden rule is
right, viz., that we are to take the whole statute together, and construe it
all together, giving the words their ordinary signification, unless when so
applied they produce an inconsistency, or an absurdity or inconvenience so
great as to convince the Court that the intention could not have been to use
them in their ordinary signification, and to justify the Court in putting on
them some other signification, which, though less proper, is one which the
Court thinks the words will bear.

In Astor v. Perry[23] the principle of the above authorities was
applied again to the word “any” and additional words were implied by the House
to give a limiting meaning to the general language used in the statute.

What is meant by “absurdity” is well explained
by Lord Blackburn in Rhodes v. Rhodes[24]
at 205, where he said, quoting Lord Cranworth in Thelluson v. Rendlesham[25]:

[Page 522]

The rule on which the appellant relies is
that universally recognized and acted on, namely, that words are to be
construed according to their plain ordinary meaning unless the context shows
them to have been used in a different sense, or unless the rule, if acted on,
would lead to some manifest absurdity or incongruity; indeed, the latter branch
of the rule is, perhaps, involved in the former, for, supposing that the rule,
if acted on, would lead to manifest absurdity or incongruity, the context must
be considered to shew that the words could not have been used in their ordinary
sense.

Lord Blackburn continued:

Lord Wensleydale once more repeated the
rule as laid down in Warburton v. Loveland[26] but it is worth observing that by “an
absurdity” can hardly be meant a result which the Court who construe the will
thought ought not to have been the intention of the testator. If that had been
so, the Thelluson will itself would have been upset. LordSt. Leonards
says, p. 509, that much thought and learning had been bestowed for the purpose
of endeavouring “to counteract, and properly too, if it could be done, the
ambitious views of the testator,” but the intention was too clearly expressed.
Lord Cranworth, therefore, seems quite correct when he says that the latter
branch of the rule is but a means by the context of shewing that the words were
not used in their ordinary sense, as it is not to be presumed that the testator
meant an absurdity; but that if it is shewn that it was intended to use them so
as to work this absurdity, that intention, if it be not illegal, must be
carried out.

It is necessary to see therefore whether there
is anything to indicate the sense in which the words here in question were
used.

The ancestor of section 122, so far as I
have been able to trace it back, is section 2 of 40 Victoria, (1877), cap.
30: “An Act to make provision against the improper use of Firearms.”
Sections 2 and 3 of that statute read as follows:

2. Whosoever, when arrested either on a
warrant issued against him for an offence or whilst committing an offence, has
upon his person a pistol or air gun, shall be liable on conviction thereof to a
fine of not less than twenty dollars or more than fifty dollars, or to
imprisonment in any gaol or place of confinement for a term not exceeding three
months.

3. Whosoever has upon his person a pistol
or air gun, with intent therewith unlawfully and maliciously to do injury to
any other person, shall be liable on conviction thereof, to a fine of not less
than fifty or more than two hundred dollars, or to imprisonment in any gaol or
place of confinement for a term not exceeding six months:

(2) The intent aforesaid may be prima
facie inferred from the fact of the pistol or air gun being on the person.

It is evident that the question which is
involved in the present appeal arose in 1877 on the enactment of the original
legislation. If the argument for the Crown is sound, the proper construction of
these two sections is that you take the conduct described by
section 3 as constituting the

[Page 523]

offence therein provided for, and automatically
you also take a part of that same conduct and, by adding it to its whole, make
out the additional offence under section 2. In my opinion statutory
language which produces such a result should be very clear and free from all
indication of a contrary intent. I think the language here under consideration
does indicate such a contrary intent.

Parliament has, in my opinion, provided in
section 3 that the totality of the conduct there described shall
constitute one offence punishable by a fine of not more than two hundred
dollars or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months. How can
effect be given to this clear and unambiguous expression of intention in
section 3 except by construing section 2, as Roach, J.A., has
construed the present section 122, as applying only to offences which do
not include as an element thereof any of the conduct described in
section 3, or more specifically, the possession upon the person of a
pistol or air gun?

Again, to read the two sections together in
accordance with the contention of the appellant they would read somewhat as
follows:

Whosoever when arrested whilst having upon
his person a pistol or air gun with intent etc., which intent may be inferred
from the fact of possession, has upon his person, a pistol or air gun shall be
liable to conviction * * *

To so read the sections is to reduce them
to the merest tautology and to render them absurd. I think therefore that the
statute provides the necessary internal evidence that these sections are
to be read in accordance with the principle applied by Roach, J.A.

Coming to the Code as it now stands, one
finds that section 122 is embodied in a group of sections commencing
with section 115. When these are examined the same consideration appears
as in the case of sections 2 and 3 of the Act of 1877. For instance,
section 118, as enacted by 23-24 Geo. V., cap. 25, section 1,
is as follows:

118. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years,
who, not having a permit in form 76,—

(a) has upon his person, elsewhere
than in his own dwelling house, shop, warehouse, counting house, or premises, a
pistol, revolver, or other firearm, capable of being concealed upon the person;

[Page 524]

If a person is without the statutory permit he
is guilty of the offence described by this section if he has upon his
person in the circumstances mentioned, a firearm capable of being concealed.
For the totality of this conduct the penalty prescribed by Parliament is
a term not exceeding five years. If the appellant’s argument be sound,
the existence of one element of this very conduct would subject the defendant
to an additional penalty of two years merely by the process of a separate
charge being laid against him under the provisions of section 122. It
seems to me that Parliament, in the use of the phrase “not exceeding” in
section 118, has clearly indicated that that section is exhaustive as
far as the conduct to which it relates is concerned, and that therefore
section 122 is to be confined in its operation, notwithstanding the use of
the words “any offence”, to offences of which the possession of a firearm
capable of being concealed upon the person is not an element.

The same situation arises under many of the
sections in the group and I think they are to be construed in the same
manner. Section 129, however, as enacted by 23-24 Geo. V., cap. 25,
section 1, does not include in the offence thereby created the possession
or use of offensive weapons and the above reasoning would therefore not apply
to it.

The force of the considerations above set out is
enhanced when section 457 is referred to. The section reads as
follows:

457. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for life who

(a) breaks and enters a dwelling-house
by night with intent to commit any indictable offence therein; or

(b) breaks out of any dwelling-house
by night, either after committing an indictable offence therein, or after
having entered such dwelling-house, either by day or by night, with intent to
commit an indictable offence therein.

2. Every one convicted of an offence under
this section who when arrested, or when he committed such offence, had
upon his person any offensive weapon, shall, in addition to the imprisonment
above prescribed, be liable to be whipped.

In my opinion it would be absurd to say that a
person liable to conviction under the provisions of subsection 2 is also
liable to be convicted under the provisions of section 122, if the
offensive weapon is a firearm. The absurdity

[Page 525]

of such a construction is heightened by the fact
that the penalty provided by section 457, subsection 1, is
imprisonment for life.

Coming to section 446(c), Parliament
has by this provision, declared that for that offence, involving as one of its
main elements, the presence on the offender of an offensive weapon, the penalty
may be imprisonment for life and whipping. That is expressly the penalty for
the totality of that conduct. I do not think therefore, that there is to be
attributed to Parliament the intention that one part of that conduct (where the
weapon in question is a firearm) may be made the subject of a separate charge
under section 122, a procedure which would be ineffective and absurd where
the maximum penalty had been imposed. In any case where the maximum is not
imposed, it is to be taken that it is because the trial tribunal did not
consider that the conduct involved merited such a penalty. Surely it cannot be
said that in such a case Parliament has expressed the intention, nonetheless,
that the same tribunal may be called upon to impose an additional penalty for
the same conduct under the guise of a separate charge. While it is the fact
that in the case of the offences provided for by clauses (a) and (b)
of section 446, the penalty is the same as in the case of an offence under
clause (c), an offensive weapon is not there in either case involved.
The same considerations therefore do not apply as in a case under clause (c).

It is quite true that under the provisions of
section 122, subsection 1, a conviction for the offence thereby
provided does not depend upon a conviction for the other offence to which the
subsection refers but it does depend upon such offence being proved to
have been in fact committed. I do not think, therefore, that this situation has
any bearing upon the construction of the section from the standpoint above
set forth.

In my opinion, therefore, Roach, J.A., was right
in the conclusion to which he came.

In Rex v. Maskiew[27], the following, which is the ratio decidendi
of the judgment of the Chief Justice, occurs at p. 143:

Section 122 is for the purpose of
governing the carrying of firearms. In its original form, in 1886, the
section was comparatively simple and

[Page 526]

the punishment not severe; but conditions and
the increase of crime having made it necessary to amend same for the protection
of the public, the amendments of 1932 and subsequent years indicate the
importance of prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons and that there
should be a certainty of additional punishment imposed upon a convicted
criminal found in such possession. If it had been the intention of the
Legislature to have made a special exemption of a conviction under s. 446(c),
it would have been quite easy to have done so; but the section does not
make any exception.

This appears to say that because a general word
has been used without any express exception, the literal interpretation must be
applied. With respect, the authorities to which I have referred establish that
that is not the law.

I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

Present: The Chief Justice and Taschereau, Rand, Estey and

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal Law—Evidence—Corroboration—Unsworn testimony of
child of tender years—Offence, under section 301 (2) of Criminal Code, of
carnally knowing girl between the ages of 14 and 16 years—Canada Evidence Act,
section 16 (2)—Criminal Code, sections 301 (2), 1002, 1003, 1023.

Held: The corroboration required by section 301 '(2) of
the Criminal Code cannot be found in the unsworn testimony of a child of tender
years, unless this unsworn testimony is corroborated by some other material
evidence.

[Page 350]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming (Letourneau C.J. and Casey
J.A. dissenting) the conviction of the appellant on a charge of carnal knowledge
of a girl between the ages of 14 and 16 years.

A. Chevalier, K.C. and J. J. Bertrand for the appellant.

P. E. Delaney, K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau, Estey
and Locke JJ. was delivered by

Estey J.:—The
accused was convicted of having carnal knowledge of a girl between the ages of
fourteen and sixteen, contrary to section 301 (2) of the Criminal Code. The
latter part of the foregoing subsection reads as follows :

… no person accused of any offence under this subsection
shall be convicted upon the evidence of one witness, unless such witness is
corroborated in some material particular by evidence implicating the accused.

The Court of King's Bench in Quebec (Appeal Side) 2
affirmed the conviction, but:

Messieurs les juges en chef Létourneau et Casey
sont dissidents et feraient droit à l'appel, par le motif que le
témoignage de la plaignante, Emélie Gauvin, n'est pas corroboré suivant les
exigences des articles 301 et 1002 du
Code Criminel du Canada.

The appellant, on the basis of this dissent, appeals to this
Court under the provisions of section 1023 of the Criminal Code.

The Magistrate presiding in the Court of Sessions of the
Peace in finding the accused guilty found the required corroboration of the
girl's evidence in that of her brother, a boy at the time of the alleged
offence about ten years of age, whose evidence was received without oath (at
the trial about three years after the date of the alleged offence) under
section 16 of the Canada Evidence Act.

The Magistrate in the course of his reasons for finding the
accused guilty stated:

It is true that the boy's evidence was unsworn, but in a
case of Rex v. Hamlin, (52 C.C.C. 149) it was decided :—
""corroborative evidence of the complainant's evidence on a charge
of carnal knowledge, may be found in the evidence of another girl of
tender age tendered as a witness, although such evidence was given NOT under
oath.""

[Page 351]

If a child of tender years does not understand the nature of
an oath, it is provided in section 16 of the Canada Evidence Act that
the evidence of such child may be received if, in the opinion of the judge
trying the case, such child is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify
the reception of the evidence and understands the duty of speaking the truth. Subsection
(2) of section 16 provides:

16. (2) No case shall be decided upon such evidence alone,
and such evidence must be corroborated by some other material evidence.

This statutory provision in section 16(2) and that in
section 301(2) requiring corroboration of the evidence of the complainant, as
well as the rule of practice requiring corroboration of the evidence of an
accomplice, are all based upon the experience that long ago established the
danger of accepting the evidence of any of these parties unless it be
corroborated. The essentials of corroboration were considered in Rex v. Baskerville
3,
where at p. 667 it is stated :

We hold that evidence in corroboration must be independent
testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect him
with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which implicates him, that
is, which confirms in some material particular not only the evidence that the
crime has been committed, but also that the prisoner committed it. The test
applicable to determine the nature and extent of the corroboration is thus the
same whether the case falls within the rule of practice at common law or within
that class of offences for which corroboration is required by statute.

See also Hubin v. The King 4.

It is unnecessary to here consider the difference in the
language of section 16(2) and sections 301(2) and 1002, as well as 1003, in
which there is the identical provision for the reception of the evidence of a
child of tender years, more than to observe that it has been held that the
language of these sections should be construed to the same effect: Rex v.
Silverstone 5. The rule of practice with respect to
accomplices was stated in Rex v. Noakes 6, and has been
consistently approved and followed. It has been repeatedly held that the
unsworn evidence of a child of tender years will not constitute corroboration
of the evidence of another child of tender years whose evidence

[Page 352]

is also given without oath. Rex v. Whistnant 7
; Rex v. McInulty 8; Rex v. Lamond 9;
Brule v. Regem 10; Rez v. Drew 11, 12;
Rex; v. Manser 13.

In Great Britain, where the statutory provisions, (1908— 8
Edw. VII, c. 67, sec. 30(a), as amended 1914—4 & 5 Geo. V, c. 58, sec. 28
(2)), are similar to section 1003 (2), the unsworn evidence of a child of
tender years if not corroborated is entirely disregarded. As stated by Lord
Chief Justice Isaacs:

… it ought to be pointed out to the jury that they must not
act on the evidence of the child alone, but that there must be corroboration of
it before they are entitled to regard the child's evidence at all. Rex v.
Murray, 14.

And as stated by Lord Chief Justice Hewart :

In truth and in fact the evidence of the girl Doris ought to
have been obliterated altogether from the case, inasmuch as it was not
corroborated. Rex v. Manser 15.

Any suggestion that the corroboration of the brother might
be found in that of the complainant was referred to as ""mutual
corroboration"" and rejected in Rex v. Manser 16.
The evidence of each of these parties is possessed of the same inherent danger.
The purpose of corroboration is to remove that danger and this cannot be
accomplished by evidence which itself cannot alone be acted upon because it is
subject to the same danger and objection.

In this case section 301(2) requires that the evidence of
the complainant must be corroborated ""by evidence implicating the
accused."" This provision in section 301(2) is identical with that of
section 1002 as applied to section 301, where:

The corroboration must be by evidence independent of the
complainant; and it ""must tend to show that the accused committed the
crime charged.""

Hubin v. The King 18.

Such independent evidence must possess probative value,
which is the very quality section 16 denies to the unsworn and uncorroborated
evidence of a child of tender years. Such is the effect of the specific
provision that ""such evidence must be corroborated."" It follows that
if it is not corroborated it does not possess probative value and

[Page 353]

should be ignored. The decision in Rex v. Hamlin 19
fails to give effect to this express provision and does not appear to be in
accord with the principles underlying the authorities already mentioned.

The Magistrate, in so far as he adopted the statement of the
law contained in that decision, misdirected himself and therefore the case
should go back for a new trial.

In view of the fact that this case is to be retried, it may
not be inappropriate to draw attention to the fact that the record discloses
that when Willie Gauvin was called as a witness his evidence was accepted as a
matter of course without oath. It does appear that counsel for the Crown at the
outset of his examination elicited that he was thirteen years of age, attended
school, knew he should not tell a lie in Court and if he did he would be
punished, but he did not know what it was ""to swear to something.""
The record however does not disclose that the Magistrate made either one of the
two findings required by section 16. The procedure followed was not in accord with
the requirement of that section, as explained in Sankey v. The King 20
where at p. 439 Anglin, C.J., writing the judgment of the Court, stated:

Now it is quite as much the duty of the presiding judge to
ascertain by appropriate methods whether or not a child offered as a witness
does, or does not, understand the nature of an oath, as it is to satisfy
himself of the intelligence of such child and his appreciation of the duty of
speaking the truth. On both points alike he is required by the statute to form
an opinion; as to both he is entrusted with discretion, to be exercised
judicially and upon reasonable grounds. The term ""child of tender
years"" is not defined. Of no ordinary child over seven years of age can it
be safely predicated, from his mere appearance, that he does not understand the
nature of an oath.

Some of the learned Judges in the Court of Appeal found the
necessary corroboration in the evidence of Mayor Cousins, who deposed as to a
conversation at his home with the accused when he came there the same day the
child was born. It contains statements made by the accused from which,
depending largely upon the conduct and attitude at the time he made same,
certain inferences might be drawn therefrom, but that is a matter more
particularly for a trial Judge who has an opportunity of hearing the evidence. The
Magistrate, however, having

[Page 354]

directed himself as already indicated, did not find it
necessary to consider or make any finding based on the evidence of Mayor
Cousins.

The position is therefore similar to that in Hubin v.
The King 21, where Anglin, C.J., at p. 450 states:

Unfortunately, however, the trial judge appears not to have
considered this evidence or passed upon its sufficiency … There is no finding
by the trial judge as to the inference to be drawn from the conduct of the
accused, already adverted to, nor any adjudication that it affords the
requisite corroboration. We cannot, without usurping the exclusive function of
the tribunal of fact, make such an adjudication.

The conviction should be set aside and a new trial directed.

Rand J.—The
accused appeals from his conviction under section 301(2) of the Criminal
Code. By that section

no person accused … shall be convicted upon the evidence of
one witness, unless such witness is corroborated in some material particular by
evidence implicating the accused.

The evidence for the prosecution was given by the girl
against whom the offence was charged to have been committed. Her testimony was
followed by that of a young brother admitted under section 16 of the Canada
Evidence Act. No further evidence of the circumstances of the offence was
presented.

Subsection (2) of section 16 provides that ""no case
shall be decided upon such evidence alone, and such evidence must be
corroborated by some other material evidence."" The trial Judge, treating
the unsworn evidence of the brother as corroboration of that of the
prosecutrix, convicted the accused, and on appeal and on the same ground the
conviction was affirmed with Létourneau, C.J. and Casey,
J. dissenting 22. There was other evidence given by the
mother of the prosecutrix and the mayor of the village which together might
have been found to furnish corroboration, but the trial Judge did not deal with
it.

The first question is, therefore, whether the corroboration
required by section 301 is furnished by the unsworn testimony alone of a
witness admitted under section 16. Before the enactment of that section, the
only evidence admissible was that given under the sanction of an oath or its
equivalent. The introduction of an unsworn state-

[Page 355]

ment must then be
taken with the conditions annexed to it before it can be looked upon as
evidence in the full sense of the term. When under section 301(2) corroboration
is required by ""evidence"" the word is used in that sense and it calls
for testimony possessing the essential sanction.

Under section 16 the statement as a condition of its
completeness requires like corroboration which means corroboration by evidence
satisfying the basic requirement. In the present case that subsidiary
corroboration is discovered in the evidence of the prosecutrix itself; but the
fallacy involved is perfectly obvious; it would mean that the evidence of the
prosecutrix which must be corroborated by testimony formally complete can
itself be used to corroborate imperfect testimony necessary to its own
corroboration: that it can be used, in other words, to corroborate its own
corroboration. That circular treatment is dealt with specifically in The
King v. Manser 23, where the Lord Chief Justice examines
""mutual corroboration"", as it has apparently been called, and in
rejecting it he expresses the view that ""in truth and in fact the evidence
of the girl Doris ought to have been obliterated altogether from the case,
inasmuch as it was not corroborated. It clearly was not corroborated by the
evidence of the girl Barbara (the prosecutrix).""

The question was considered in Rex v. Cowpersmith 24,
where Smith, J.A., observing that he was not overlooking Rex v. Manser
25 says:—

I think the Court there treated the evidence of the
complainant in all respects as if it had been unsworn evidence and would appear
to have drawn no distinction between the evidentiary value of sworn evidence
corroborated by unsworn evidence and that of unsworn evidence corroborated by
unsworn evidence.

That judgment followed Rex v. Hamlin 26
in which the Supreme Court of Alberta came to the like conclusion. The
reasoning in both of these decisions does not, in my opinion, pay sufficient
regard to the specific requirement, under section 301 (2), of corroboration by
evidence carrying the necessary ritualistic obligation. If section 16, in
creating a new mode by which evidentiary matter could be introduced into a
trial, had intended the statement so presented to be sufficient for corroborative
purposes without

[Page 356]

its own corroboration, it must, I think, have declared so; I
can see no intention of Parliament to stamp the unsworn statement as sanctioned
evidence per se and then to require its corroboration for
a certain use only, leaving all other use at large. If the statement is
competent to corroborate so as to satisfy section 301(2), how can it logically
be rejected for the same purpose under section 16? What difference in
implication as to the quality of the corroborative evidence can be found
between them? And yet the courts have uniformly held that such statements
cannot support each other: Rex v. Whistnant 27; Rex
v. Lamond 28; Rex v. Drew 29.
The two sections must be so read as to render the statement admissible as
corroboration only upon the independent performance of the condition annexed to
it.

The remaining question arises from the failure of the trial
Judge to deal with other evidence which might have furnished the basis of
corroboration. I find that in Hubin v. The King 30, this
Court had before it a similar situation, and it was decided that as no finding
had been made by the trial Judge as to the ""inference to be drawn from the
conduct of the accused … nor any adjudication that it affords the requisite
corroboration"" this Court could not, without usurping the exclusive
function of the tribunal of fact, make such an adjudication.

The conviction, therefore, should be set aside and a new
trial directed.

Appeal allowed, conviction set aside and new trial
directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Theft—Goods valued at less than $25—Summary
conviction—Deputy Recorder—Jurisdiction—Magistrate—Cities and Towns Act of
Quebec, c. 233 R.S.Q. 1941, sections 647, 648—Summary Convictions Act of Quebec,
c. 25 R.S.Q. 1941, section 6—Criminal Code, section 771 (a) (i).

The appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of theft of goods
valued at $19 laid under Part XVI of the Criminal Code and was sentenced to six
months imprisonment by the Deputy Recorder of the City of West-mount, Quebec.
It was argued in appeal that the Deputy Recorder had exceeded his jurisdiction
as he was not a magistrate within the meaning of section 771 (a) (i) of
the Criminal Code. The Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirmed the conviction.

Held: The Deputy Recorder having been clothed with the
jurisdiction of two justices of the peace by the provisions of the Summary
Convictions Act of Quebec, was within the definition of ""other
functionary"" in section 771 (a) (i).

[Page 370]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming (Pratte J.A. dissenting) the
conviction of the appellant by the Deputy Recorder of Westmount, Quebec, on a
charge of theft of an object valued at less than $25.

The material facts of the case and the questions at
issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.

J. A. Budyk, K.C. for the appellant.

Rene T. Hebert, K.C.
for the respondent.

The Chief Justice: The appeal should be
dismissed.

The judgment of Taschereau and Locke JJ. was delivered by

Taschereau, J.—The appellant was charged with the theft of
an object of 2 value of less than $25. He elected a summary trial under the
provisions of Part XVI of the Criminal Code, and after having pleaded guilty
was sentenced to six months imprisonment by Mr. A. E. Laverty, Deputy Recorder
of the City of Westmount.

The Court of King's Bench 2, Mr. Justice Pratte
dissenting, confirmed the conviction, and the appellant now appeals to this
Court.

Section 771 of the Criminal Code says:—

(a) ""magistrate"" means and includes,

(i) in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and
Manitoba, any recorder, judge of a county court if a justice of the
peace, commissioner of police, judge of the sessions of the peace, and police
magistrate, district magistrate, or other functionary or tribunal, invested
by the proper legislative authority with power to do alone such acts as are
usually required to be done by two or more justices, and acting within the
local limits of his or of its jurisdiction.

It is argued that Mr. Laverty, being a deputy recorder, is
not a magistrate within the meaning of this section and that, therefore, he
exceeded his jurisdiction when he sentenced the appellant.

Under the Cities and Towns Act, chap. 233, R.S.Q.
(1941), section 647, the recorder may appoint under his hand a deputy recorder,
who must be an advocate of five years standing, and, the person so appointed,
says section 648,

[Page 371]

shall possess, for and during the time limited in the instrument
containing his appointment, or, if no time be therein limited, then from the
date of the registration as aforesaid, until the revocation thereof, the
jurisdiction, and be vested with all the rights, powers and privileges, and
shall discharge all the duties of the Recorder, to the exclusion, for the time
being, of the person so nominating him.

Mr. Laverty was duly appointed ""deputy recorder""
by the recorder of the City of Westmount, and he was therefore invested with
all the powers of the recorder himself. But it is argued, that section 771 Cr.
C. gives power only to a ""recorder"" to hear cases under Part XVI,
that the ""recorder"" is a ""persona designata"" by the Code,
and that therefore a ""deputy recorder"" although invested with the
same powers by the provincial authority, is not a ""magistrate""
included in paragraph (1) of section 771.

I find it quite unnecessary to determine this point for the
reason that Mr. Laverty being a ""deputy recorder"", has the
jurisdiction of two justices of the peace. Section 6 of The Summary
Convictions Act of the Province of Quebec, chap. 25, R.S.Q. (1941) reads as
follows:

Any Judge of the Sessions of the Peace, Police Magistrate,
District Magistrate or Recorder, appointed for any territorial division,
and any Magistrate authorized to perform acts usually required to be done by
two or more Justices of the Peace, may do alone whatever is authorized by an
act of this Province to be done by any two or more Justices of the Peace.

Mr. Laverty having the same powers as the recorder himself
is a person, as section 771 says, ""invested by the proper legislative
authority with power to do alone such acts as are usually required to be done
by two or more justices"". He was, therefore, competent to convict the
appellant as he did.

The appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Rand and Estey JJ. was delivered by

Rand J.—The
appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of theft of goods valued at $19 laid under
Part XVI of the Code before the Deputy Recorder of the City of West-mount,
Quebec and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. An appeal was taken on
the ground that the Deputy was without jurisdiction under that Part but the
Court 2, Pratte, J. dissenting, interpreted the
words ""any

[Page 372]

Recorder"" in section 771 (a) (i) defining
the word ""Magistrate"", to include a Deputy Recorder, and rejected the
appeal.

Section 771 (a) (i) in addition to ""any
Recorder"", designates as Magistrate, ""any other functionary or
tribunal, invested by the proper legislative authority with power to do alone
such acts as are usually required to be done by two or more Justices""; and
as I find the Deputy Recorder in this case to be such an ""other
functionary"", it is unnecessary to examine the ground on which the Court
of Appeal proceeded.

The charter of Westmount incorporates the provisions of the Cities
and Towns Act, chap. 233, R.S.Q. (1941) dealing with a Recorder's Court,
sec. 648 of which defines the powers of the Deputy Recorder :—

648. The person so appointed shall possess, for and during
the time limited in the instrument containing his appointment, or, if no time
be therein limited, then from the date of the registration as aforesaid, until
the revocation thereof, the jurisdiction, and be vested with all the rights,
powers and privileges, and shall discharge all the duties of the Recorder, to
the exclusion, for the time being, of the person so nominating him.

The Summary Convictions Act of the Province, chap.
25, R.S.Q. (1941) by sec. 6 enacts:—

Any Judge of the Sessions of the Peace, Police Magistrate,
District Magistrate or Recorder, appointed for any territorial division, and
any Magistrate authorized to perform acts usually required to be done by two or
more Justices of the Peace, may do alone whatever is authorized by an act of
this Province to be done by any two or more Justices of the Peace.

And the expression ""territorial division"" is
defined to include a city.

From the foregoing, it is clear that the powers of the
Recorder embrace that scope of authority aimed at in section 771 (a) (i),
and with these, in turn, the Deputy Recorder has been clothed; the latter
is, therefore, such a functionary as is described in the paragraph and is
invested with the jurisdiction of a magistrate for the purposes of Part XVI.

The appeal must be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA

Criminal law—Murder—Withdrawal of accused's counsel
because postponement refused—Appointment of another counsel by Court—Refusal of
Court to hear another counsel retained by accused's family—Illness of
juror—Discharge of jury—New jury containing some members of original
jury—Criminal Code ss. 929, 942, 960, 1014 (2).

The accused was arrested and charged with murder on August 8,
1947, and within a few days retained the services of counsel W. After many
adjournments, the preliminary hearing started on October 8 and he was committed
for trial on October 21. On that same day he was brought up for arraignment.
His counsel W. moved to have the trial adjourned to the next assize and said that
he was contemplating an application for a change of venue. The presiding judge
refused the motion to traverse and set the date for the trial at November 10.
Counsel W. then withdrew from the case and the judge stated that he would
appoint someone if the accused did not appoint counsel within a day or two. The
following day, accused's sister addressed the Court in accused's presence and
asked for an adjournment, saying that they did not want W. to withdraw and that
they wanted their own counsel and not one appointed by the Court. However the
presiding judge appointed R. as accused's chief counsel and postponed the trial
for a week beyond the date previously fixed; the arraignment was also postponed
to the day of trial. When the trial opened, R. appeared for accused but before
arraignment M., a counsel, addressed the Court, saying
""I am appearing on behalf of the accused, retained by his family"".
The trial judge informed M. that the Court had appointed counsel and refused to
hear M. as to the nature of the application which he proposed to make. On
arraignment, accused pleaded not guilty but when asked if he was ready for
trial answered ""No Sir"". Thereupon R. said that this was accused's
answer and not his and that he was prepared to go on.

During the trial, when the jury was recalled to the courtroom
after a trial within the trial, one member was found to be absent because of
illness. The jury was then discharged but instructed to remain on the panel,
and a new jury was drawn. Nine members of the new jury had been on the previous
jury, which had sat for two days. The trial judge admitted the evidence which
was the subject of the trial within the trial.

The majority of the Court of Appeal having affirmed the
conviction, appellant raised two grounds of appeal in this Court, (a)
that he was not permitted to make full answer and defence by counsel of his
choice and (b) that the jury was not properly constituted.

Held: that, by his conduct, the accused has ratified
the choice of counsel made by the Court.

[Page 140]

Even if the trial judge should not have declined to hear M.,
as it was shown that the proposed application was for a further postponement of
the trial, the accused suffered no prejudice and the incident taints in no way
the fairness of what has been done. There was no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice.

Held: also, that when discharged, the jury cease to be
the jury in that case, their functions are terminated and consequently they
were free to act again in the new trial.

Rex v. Luparello 25 C.C.C. 24 approved.

Rex v. Chong Sam Bow (1925) 1 W.W.R. 240
overruled.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba 1 dismissing (Dysart and Adamson JJ.A.
dissenting) the appellant's appeal from his conviction, at trial before
Williams C.J. K.B. and a jury, on a charge of murder.

H. Walsh for the appellant.

O. M. M. Kay for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Taschereau
and Estey JJ. was delivered by

Taschereat J.:
Michael Angelo Vescio, the appellant in the present case, was charged with the
murder of one George Robert Smith, and on the 25th day of November, 1947, was
found guilty by a jury at the City of Winnipeg, at the Fall Assizes. The
Honourable Chief Justice Williams imposed the death penalty.

The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for the
Province of Manitoba, and the appeal 2 was dismissed Dysart and Adamson, JJ.
dissenting.

The grounds of dissent in the judgments of Dysart and
Adamson, JJ. may be summed up in one general statement, that the accused was deprived
of his right to make a full answer and defence to the charge laid against him,
by counsel of his own choice, that there was consequently a mistrial of such a
fundamental nature, that section 1014(2) of the Criminal Code does not apply.

The first Notice of Appeal to this Court based on the above
dissenting judgments was served on the 27th of April, 1948, and was followed on
the 28th of May by a second Notice, pursuant to an order of the Honourable Mr.
Justice Rand, made under section 1025 of the Criminal

[Page 141]

Code. Leave to appeal to this Court was
granted on the ground that the judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province
of Manitoba conflicts as to the constitution of the jury, with a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (Rex v. Chong Sam Bow 4).

The information on which the accused was charged was laid on
the 7th day of August, 1947, the warrant was executed the next day, and the
preliminary hearing which commenced on the 8th of October came to an end on the
21st of the same month, on which date the accused was committed for trial.

The Fall Assizes of the Eastern Judicial District opened at
two P.M. on the same day with Mr. Justice Major presiding. Mr. C. W. Tupper
appeared for the Crown and immediately asked that Vescio be arraigned on the
indictment charging him with the murder of George Robert Smith. This
application was strenuously opposed by Mr. Harry Walsh who appeared for Vescio,
and who asked that the case be traversed to the next Assizes in February, on
the ground that he was not ready to proceed. The next day, on the 22nd of
October, Mr. Justice Major refused the application and set the date for trial
for the 10th of November. It is then that Mr. Walsh made the following
declaration:—

in which case I must withdraw from the defence. I would ask
in fairness to the accused that your Lordship should defer arraignment until he
has an opportunity to consult counsel.

After a brief argument between the Court and Mr. Walsh, Mr.
Justice Major said:—

I will give two days for decision in the matter. If I do not
hear anything by Thursday I will appoint counsel to represent him. I will
adjourn this until Thursday. I expect the Crown counsel to advise me what has
been done.

 On Thursday no counsel appeared for Vescio, but his sister
Mrs. Bernhardi who was in the audience, applied for an adjournment of three or
four months. She insisted that she did not want Mr. Walsh to withdraw; ""we
want to keep him"", said she. Mr. Justice Major adjourned the case until
the 17th of November and explained to Mrs. Bernhardi that in view of the fact
that Mr. Walsh had declined to continue to act, it was the duty of the Court to
appoint counsel for him.

[Page 142]

On Friday, the 24th of October, at the opening of the Court
Mr. Justice Major appointed Mr. Ross, K.C. as ""chief counsel"" to
defend the accused and the case stood adjourned until the 17th of November for
trial.

On that date the case came for trial before Chief Justice
Williams, Mr. 0. M. M. Kay appeared for the Crown and Mr.
J. L. Ross for the accused. It was then, that Mr. E. J. McMurray, K.C. who is
the senior partner of Mr. Walsh said at the opening of the Court: ""I may
say my Lord that I am appearing on behalf of the accused, retained by his
family"". The Chief Justice then said that he could not recognize Mr.
McMurray in that capacity, that a counsel had been appointed for the accused 3½
weeks before, that he was in Court and prepared to go on. Mr. McMurray offered
to tell the Court the nature of the application which he intended to make, but
the Chief Justice replied that he ""did not think it was advisable to do
so, because he regretfully declined to hear him"". Mr. McMurray
then-withdrew, the accused was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. The trial
lasted seven days and a verdict was given on the 24th of November.

It is the contention of the appellant that a gross and
substantial miscarriage of justice was occasioned to the accused and a mistrial
took place, when Major, J. denied the accused counsel of his own choice, thus
denying him his right to ""make full answer and defence by counsel learned
in the law"", and forced upon the accused counsel whom he was not willing
to accept and through whom he did not wish to speak. It is also submitted that
the refusal of the learned trial judge to hear Mr. McMurray, was a refusal of
the accused of counsel of his own choice or of additional counsel to Mr. J. L.
Ross.

It is a fundamental principle of our criminal law that the
choice of counsel is the choice of the accused himself, that no person charged
with a criminal offence can have counsel forced upon him against his will, and
that it is the paramount right of the accused to make his own case to the jury
if he so wishes, instead of having it made for him by counsel (Rex v. Woodward
5).
Mr. Kay acting for the respondent did not challenge this, but submitted that in
the present case the appellant accepted Mr. Ross as his counsel. With this
proposition I agree.

[Page 143]

The appellant had selected Mr. Walsh as his counsel, but
unfortunately Mr. Walsh withdrew leaving the appellant without counsel. It
might have been advisable for the learned trial judge to ask the appellant if
he desired a counsel, or if he wished to defend himself, and thus the situation
would have been made clearer; but I do not think that under the circumstances,
the failure to ask this preliminary question had the effect of vitiating the
whole trial, as suggested by the appellant. By his conduct the accused has
ratified the choice which he now says has been forced upon him.

Immediately after the withdrawal of Mr. Walsh, Mr. Justice
Major adjourned the arraignment to allow the accused to appoint a new counsel.
When the Court resumed on the 24th, Mrs. Bernhardi who was present, objected to
the voluntary withdrawal of Mr. Walsh, but the accused remained silent. Mr.
Ross cross-examined the witnesses, addressed the jury, was in Court during six
days, and during 3½ weeks had the opportunity of conferring with the appellant,
and we cannot of course assume that he did not. During all these proceedings not
a word was said by the appellant that can lead us to believe that he even ever
thought of repudiating the choice made by the Court. It is then that the
accused should have done so, if he had any idea of conducting his own case or
of selecting a new counsel, and not now. In dealing with this matter I have
kept in mind the case of Reg. v. Yscuado 6 but with
due deference, I do not agree with all the statements made by Erle, J. as to
the inferences which may be drawn from the silence of an accused when the Court
requests a member of the Bar to give his services to a prisoner.

The conduct of the accused is to my mind a sufficient
sanction of what has been done, and is a bar to his tardy claims of unfair
trial and miscarriage of justice.

As to the refusal of the learned trial judge to hear Mr.
McMurray on the date of the opening of the trial, I would like to make the
following observations. For 3½ weeks, Mr. Ross had been acting as counsel for
Vescio, and on the 17th of November, he appeared on his behalf and was ready to
proceed. There had already been three different applica-

[Page 144]

tions made to traverse the case to the Winter Assizes which
had all been refused, and it is now clearly established by the Crown and
uncontradicted by the appellant, that when Mr. McMurray appeared in Court,
""retained by the family"", ' he wished to make a new application to
postpone the case, and we know that this application would have been refused.
It has also been made clear that neither Mr. McMurray nor Mr. Walsh intended to
proceed with the case and defend the accused. Vescio suffered therefore no
prejudice, and this incident taints in no way the fairness of the trial that
has been held.

There now remains the last question concerning the
constitution of the jury. After eighteen Crown witnesses had given their
evidence, ""a trial within the trial"" was held to determine the
admissibility of certain statements made by the accused to Port Arthur Police
Officers, in Port Arthur and Fort William. During these proceedings the petit
jury was excluded, and the Chief Justice reserved his judgment on the
admissibility of this evidence until the 19th of November. On that morning the
petit jury was recalled and only eleven jurymen took their places in the box,
one of them having been taken to hospital during the night. The Chief Justice
then discharged the balance of the petit jury, the jury panel was brought back
into the Court, and the cards of the petit jury placed back in the jury box. A
new petit jury was empanelled and when sworn it comprised nine former petit
jurors and three new members. It is submitted by the accused that this new jury
was improperly constituted and that a mistrial and a miscarriage of justice
occurred, when nine of these jurors who had been sworn and empanelled on November
17th, and who had heard evidence on November 17th and 18th and were discharged
on November 19th, were permitted to be sworn and empanelled on the new jury on
November 19th. The law on this point is quite clear. Section 929 of the
Criminal Code states:—

The twelve men, or in the Province of Alberta the six men,
who in manner aforesaid are ultimately drawn and sworn shall be the jury-to try
the issues of the indictment, and the names of the men so drawn and sworn shall
be kept apart by themselves until such jury give in their verdict or until they
are discharged; and then the names shall be returned to the box there to be
kept with the other names remaining at that time undrawn and so loties
quoties as long as any issue remains to be tried.

[Page 145]

Section 945 of the Criminal Code provides:—

The trial shall proceed continuously subject to the power of
the court to adjourn it.

2. The court may adjourn the trial from day to day, and if
in its opinion the ends of justice so require, to any other day in the same
sittings.

3. Upon every adjournment of a trial under this section, or
under any other section, the court may, if it thinks fit, direct that during
the adjournment the jury shall be kept together, and proper provision made for
preventing the jury from holding communication with any one on the subject of
the trial.

4. Such direction shall be given in all cases in. which the
accused may upon conviction be sentenced to death.

5. In other oases, if no such direction is given, the jury
shall be permitted to separate.

6. No formal adjournment of the court shall hereafter be
required, and no entry thereof in the Crown book shall be necessary. R.S., c.
146, s. 945.

I fail to see that the law as it then was, has not been
strictly complied with in the present proceedings. In a murder case, the jury
must be kept together as long as the trial lasts, and as it is stated
""upon every adjournment"", but when they are discharged, as they have
been in the present case, the application of the law comes to an end. They cease
to be the jury in that case and their functions are terminated, pursuant
to section 929 already cited. The jurors after having been discharged were
consequently free to act again in the new trial, and if the accused thought
that one or many of them, on account of what they have heard or seen,
""were not indifferent between the King and the accused"", he could
challenge him or them ""for cause"" pursuant to section 935 of the
Criminal Code. It was also his right to challenge peremptorily twenty jurors,
but as the record shows, he used only eighteen of these challenges. I agree
with what has been said on this point by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 7
and also with the judgment of the same Court rendered in 1925 in Rex v. Luparello
8
which has been followed.

The British Columbia case of Rex v. Chong Sam Bow
9
conflicts with the Luparello case 10 and it is overruled. It
is useless to deal with the case of Rex v. Wong O Sang 11
because there, the procedure was governed by section 960 of the Criminal Code,
which is not the case here.

On the whole, the appeal fails and should be dismissed.

[Page 146]

The judgment of Kerwin, Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered
by

Rand J.: Two
grounds are taken in this appeal and I will deal with that of the constitution
of the jury first. The contention is this: that where, in a capital case, after
part of the evidence has been offered, the jury, because of the illness of a
juror, is discharged, the second panel must not include any member of the
first. It is put on two considerations: one, that the purpose underlying
section 945, which provides against the separation of the jury in certain
circumstances, would be defeated; and the other that the effect on the minds of
the jurors made by the evidence given must be taken to be of the same
objectionable character as if they had heard the case in full, had disagreed
and been discharged, in which case section 960 directing a ""new"" jury
would in principle govern.

On the point there is a conflict of authority. In Rex v.
Chong Sam Bow 12, the Appeal Court of British Columbia
acted on the latter ground and following Rex v. Wong Sang 13,
held the jury defective. In Rex v. Luparello 14, the
contrary view was taken by the Court of Appeal of Manitoba, Richards, J. A.
dissenting, which in the case before us was followed. The point seems to have
been similarly dealt with in Rex v. Gaffin 15, by
the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.

It is indisputable that at common law in such circumstances
the remaining members of the jury were competent to serve on the second jury: Rex
v. Edwards 16, in which before all of the judges
except Lawrence, J., (1812), the rule was assumed: and for the same point only,
Rex v. Lawrence 17. The analogy of a disagreement,
whatever may be the true interpretation of section 960, therefore disappears.
The one, if not the primary, object of section 945 is to keep the jurors free
from being tampered with, but obviously that ends when they have ceased to be
jurors. No doubt it may be desirable also that their minds be clear of all
matter except what is laid before them in court; but the remaining members of
the array summoned are free to read and listen at large; and to concede the

[Page 147]

competency of the latter to the second panel and to deny it
to the remaining members of the first would be wholly illogical. And where, as
here, the discharge and the reconstitution of the jury
took place within a period of fifteen minutes, any substance in the point
vanishes.

The next ground is of some difficulty. I agree with the
dissenting judgments of Adamson, J.A. and Dysart, J.A. 18 that
the Chief Justice at trial should have heard Mr. McMurray. There seems to have
been an initial misconception both of the nature of the action of appointing
counsel for an accused and of the right of the accused thereafter in relation
to him. To speak through counsel is the privilege of the client, and such an
appointment is made in circumstances in which for various reasons the accused,
assuming him to be of sufficient understanding, though he desires the benefit of
counsel, is not in a position to obtain it; and in the interest of justice
counsel should and will be assigned for his assistance. The desire of the
accused if not expressly indicated can ordinarily be presumed, but if there is
any doubt about it, the court should inquire: Reg. v. Yscuado 19,
where Erle J. said at page 387: ""I do not think I have any authority to
assign counsel to a prisoner without his consent. I should be very glad if I
could do so but by allowing counsel to appear without any communication with
the prisoner and without his sanction, I might be authorizing a defence which
the prisoner himself would never have made and yet for which he must be
responsible."" And certainly there is no statutory rule that defence by
counsel is a necessary part of the machinery of trial. In fact the contrary
appears from what is contemplated by section 944(2) of the Criminal Code where
it uses the language ""… or the accused, if he is not defended by counsel,
shall be allowed.""

Here, the accused, before Major, J., was represented by
counsel who had already conducted on his behalf the preliminary inquiry. There
was nothing so far to indicate any obstacle to his defence in the ordinary way.
But immediately on the withdrawal of Mr. Walsh—because of the refusal of his
motion to traverse the trial to the next sittings —Major, J., without reference
to the accused, intimated his duty and intention, should Mr. Walsh persist in
his

[Page 148]

withdrawal, to appoint counsel. Surely in that situation
nothing could be clearer than that the wishes of the accused should have been
consulted.

Then, when the arraignment was moved, Mr. Walsh's partner,
Mr. McMurray, K.C. rose, stating that ""he was appearing for the accused,
having been retained by the family."" The Chief Justice answered that he
could not hear him because counsel had already been appointed by the court.
That I cannot but think was both unfortunate and erroneous. The appearance of
Mr. McMurray was an unmistakable intimation that for some purpose at least he
had been retained by the accused and that so far Mr. Ross, K.C., who had been
appointed ""senior"" counsel had not been accepted as sole counsel. If
Mr. McMurray under his retainer, which I accept as having been made with the
consent and approval of the accused, had intended to proceed for all purposes
of the defence, I should have had great difficulty in finding that the refusal
to hear him had not vitiated all the subsequent proceedings. It is argued that
we must infer a general retainer to defend and that we cannot for any purpose
go behind the language ""I appear for the accused""; but with such a
plea as that the latter was deprived of his right to make full defence, we must
deal with the realities of what took place and not merely with the formality of
the external circumstances: we are therefore entitled to inquire into the
extent of the retainer, and into the intention of Mr. McMurray.

We have the undisputed statement of Mr. Kay that Mr.
McMurray stated to him immediately before he rose that he was making a motion to
traverse the trial, and that if he were not successful, Mr. Walsh would not act
with Mr. Ross. Mr. Kay states further, and again without challenge, that
nothing indicated in the slightest degree that Mr. McMurray would himself in
any circumstances have gone on with the defence; and Mr. Walsh very frankly in
the course of his able argument placed himself on the bare formal fact of the
refusal to hear Mr. McMurray, regardless of the nature of the motion Mr.
McMurray intended to make or of his intention in case of an adverse decision or
of the extent or purpose of his retainer. Mr. McMurray's appearance, therefore,
appears to have been in fact, as the Chief Justice says he understood it, to
make the motion

[Page 149]

for postponement and that only. But even if the facts do not
compel us so to interpret his intervention, there can be no doubt whatever that
his participation in the proceedings would have ended with the motion, if it
had been refused. If this were not so, we would have the assurance of another intention
on Mr. McMurray's part.

We know likewise, beyond any doubt, that a motion for
traverse would in fact have been refused. It had been denied by Major, J. at
the opening of the sittings: immediately after the abortive trial and when the
circumstances were most favourable, on the application of Mr. Ross, it had been
rejected by the Chief Justice; and we have both the statement of the latter
made immediately afterwards, that ""this case is going on"", and in his
report, that he should have refused the motion had it been made by Mr.
McMurray.

Now, in these circumstances, what appears externally as an
error of cardinal importance, is seen to be in reality of an entirely different
character; and it must be taken as beyond doubt that upon the conclusion of the
motion, the accused would have been in precisely the same position as when Mr.
Walsh withdrew. No suggestion has been made either that other counsel would
have been engaged or that the accused, aged twenty-one years, would have
defended himself; and although the ruling of the Chief Justice was no doubt a
coercive circumstance on the mind of the accused, yet in fact it played no part
in denying him the assistance of counsel of his choice. The contention is that
the trial in fact was what it was because of the refusal to hear Mr. McMurray.
The circumstances show conclusively that that was not so; the circumstances of
the trial would have been precisely the same had the motion been heard; and the
effective cause of the trial as it was carried out was the voluntary withdrawal
of counsel chosen by the accused. There was no suggestion either of any failure
or inability in confidential co-operation between the accused and Mr. Ross, an
experienced counsel, and no intimation of any sort before the Chief Justice at
any time during the trial that he was unwanted.

As against this error, there are in the case unchallengeable
facts so convincing and conclusive that it would seem a mockery of the
practical administration of justice to require

[Page 150]

their repetition in a new trial. Notwithstanding that,
however, had the actualities not been as indubitably they were, the vital
importance of administering the criminal law not only according to the
procedure laid down by law, but so that it would not only be but appear to
be in accordance with our basic conceptions of justice, would have
compelled me to conclude that that repetition must be made. But the facts,
properly understood, satisfy that fundamental obligation.

I should add that no point is made connected with any ground
on which the withdrawal of Mr. Walsh was based. In fact all grounds mentioned
in the Notice of Appeal— and there were twenty-nine of them—other than those
against the charge dealing with accident, drunkenness and provocation and as to
intent, and those with which I have dealt, were abandoned in the court below.
The appeal must therefore be dismissed.

Locke J.:—The
facts in connection with the withdrawal of Mr. Walsh, the appointment of Mr.
Ross, K.C. and of the appearance of Mr. McMurray, K.C. before the Chief Justice
at the opening of the Assizes, have been stated in the dissenting judgments in
the Court of Appeal. There are, in my opinion, some additional facts to be
considered in deciding the issues raised on this appeal.

The appellant, a convict serving a sentence for robbery in
the Stony Mountain Penitentiary, was taken in charge by the Police authorities
on the charge of murdering the boy George Robert Smith on August 8, 1947, and
within a few days thereafter retained Mr. Walsh to defend him. Mr. Walsh was
thus engaged on the matter for something more than two months before the
accused was brought before Major, J. on October 21st, and during that time had
represented the accused at the lengthy preliminary hearing during the course of
which the confession was admitted in evidence, and was thoroughly familiar with
the matter and had had ample time to make whatever preparations were necessary
for the defence. When the case was spoken to before Major, J. at the opening of
the Fall Assizes on October 21st, counsel for the prisoner asked that it be
traversed to the next Assizes on the ground that widespread publicity had been
given by the Winnipeg newspapers to

[Page 151]

the fact that the prisoner had made a confession and to a
statement made by the Chief of Police of Winnipeg that the bullet which had
killed the boy had been fired from a revolver found in the possession of the
accused, that counsel expected that the evidence of the ballistic expert called
at the preliminary by the Crown would be refuted by an expert on behalf of the
defence, and that he would require two or three months to prepare the defence.
Mr. Walsh then stated that unless the trial Judge adjourned the case until the
following January he would withdraw from the defence. The learned Judge's
decision on the motion for a traverse was given on the following morning
whereupon Mr. Walsh announced that he must withdraw from the defence and when
the trial Judge questioned his right to do so insisted that he had the right to
withdraw and proceeded to do so. I think it must be assumed that Mr. Walsh who
had been paid a retainer by the accused and apparently undertaken to defend him
withdrew with the consent of his client. In England the employment of a
barrister is a purely honourary one in the sense that it confers on him no
legal right to remuneration for his services but in Manitoba, by virtue of
section 72 of The Law Society Act, R.S.M. 1940, cap. 111, a barrister
may sue for his fees on the footing that an enforceable contract exists between
him and his client. On October 22nd when Mr. Walsh announced his withdrawal,
Major, J. stated that if the accused did not appoint counsel within a day or
two the Court would appoint someone and it was on the day following, when a
sister of the accused stated in Court that they did not want any other counsel
than Mr. Walsh, that he informed the accused that he had appointed Mr. Ross,
K.C. to act as counsel for him and on the following morning Mr. Ross appeared
and on behalf of the accused asked that the arraignment be deferred until the
17th of November, the day fixed by the presiding Judge for the commencement of
the trial. While the sister of the accused had said on October 23rd in the
presence of the prisoner that they did not want to have any other counsel but
Mr. Walsh, when the trial opened twenty-four days later Mr. Ross appeared and
stated that the defence was prepared to proceed. In the interval since his
appointment Mr. Ross had on the prisoner's behalf asked that he be examined by

[Page 152]

a psychiatrist to determine whether he was sane and this had
been done. Either on the evening of November 16th or the following morning
before Court Mr. McMurray informed Mr. Ross that he proposed to make an
application at the opening of the trial, and on that morning he also spoke to
counsel for the Crown in Court informing him that he had been retained by the
family of the accused and wished to make another application for a traverse of
the case to the next Assizes. According to Mr. Kay's statement he thereupon asked
Mr. McMurray if in the event of the application being refused he intended to
have his partner, Mr. Walsh, act with Mr. Ross as second counsel: the answer
was in the negative and Mr. Kay understood that neither Mr. McMurray nor Mr.
Walsh intended to take any part in the proceedings if the application was
refused. Nothing was said by the prisoner or by Mr. McMurray on his behalf to
the effect that he did not desire the services of Mr. Ross, of which he had
already availed himself, and during the ensuing trial which lasted seven days
Mr. Ross actively conducted the defence, apparently with the prisoner's
approval and consent.

The Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 20
stated twenty-six grounds of objection, these including a contention that a
miscarriage of justice occurred ""when counsel was appointed on my behalf
that I did not wish and whose services I did not desire and whose appointment I
did not sanction"", and further that ""I insisted that a witness should
be brought to my trial from Verdun, Que. but my desires were constantly
overridden by the said counsel appointed by the Court."" It was open to the
accused under section 27(3) of The Court of Appeal Act, R.S.M. 1940,
cap. 40, to have obtained the leave of the Court of Appeal to prove by affidavit
or otherwise the truth of the contention that he had not in fact accepted the
services of Mr. Ross, or to support his complaint as to the witness, but
nothing of this nature was done and the complaint against the manner in which
the defence had been conducted was abandoned in that Court 21.

It is of course fundamental that a person accused of a crime
is entitled to make full answer and defence either personally or by counsel of
his choice and that an accused

[Page 153]

may decline the services of counsel nominated by the Court.
While Mr. Justice Major had announced his intention of appointing counsel, I
have no doubt that the accused was made aware by Mr. Walsh, in whose presence
the announcement had been made on October 22nd, that this meant that the
services of a counsel nominated and paid by the Crown would be made available
to him and that he might reject the services of anyone so nominated. If he was
not then so advised I would assume that this information was given to him by
his family after they consulted Mr. McMurray, K.C. No doubt had the appellant
informed Mr. Ross1 that he did not desire his services the latter
would have withdrawn at once. Had the appellant so informed Mr. Ross I would
assume that the experienced counsel who represented him before the Court of
Appeal 22 would have obtained leave to prove
that fact by affidavit before that Court 23 and the fact that this
was not done indicates to me that nothing of the kind occurred. Apart from the
fact that, as shown by the trial judge's report, Mr. Ross acted for the
appellant in arranging that he be examined as to his sanity, to assume that he
stated to the Court that the defence was prepared to proceed when the trial
opened in the Assizes without having thoroughly discussed the matter with the
accused and made all proper preparations for the defence, would be to draw an
inference which I consider to be directly contrary to the fact. While the
prisoner when asked by the clerk whether he was ready for his trial said that
he was not, it was for his counsel, so long as he retained his services, to say
whether the defence was ready. The prisoner had apparently been a consenting
party to the withdrawal of Mr. Walsh some twenty-four days earlier after the
application to traverse the case to the next Assizes had been refused and the
answer made by him was apparently merely another attempt on his part to obtain
a further adjournment. Apart from the fact that Mr. Ross stated that the
defence was ready to proceed, an examination of the evidence makes it apparent
that ample time for preparation had been given. The prisoner had signed a
confession in which he admitted having accosted the boy on the street at night,
pointing a gun at him, forcing him into a back lane and shooting the

[Page 154]

child when he attempted to escape. The signed statement,
however, attributed the discharge of the gun to accident, claiming that the
accused had slipped on some clay in the lane when the boy attempted to get away
from him and pulled the trigger by mistake. Medical evidence given at the trial
showed that in addition to the fatal wound caused by the bullet which passed
through his body the boy had been struck a heavy blow on the head fracturing
his skull, the evidence indicating that this blow had been struck after the bullet
wound had been inflicted. The confession had been made voluntarily by the
accused and had been admitted in evidence at the preliminary hearing and it
must have been apparent to counsel for the accused that it would be admitted at
the trial. It is to be noted that while one of the grounds of appeal was that
evidence had been improperly admitted at the trial the point was not considered
worthy of argument in the Court of Appeal 24 and, when counsel for
the Crown stated at the commencement of his argument in that Court 25
that he understood this ground of appeal had been abandoned, there was no
dissent by counsel for the accused. In addition to this evidence a statement
made by the accused to his brother and sister while he was in custody in the
Winnipeg Police Station, to the effect that he had confessed and had done so
voluntarily, which had been overheard, was given in evidence both at the
preliminary and at the trial. While in view of the evidence afforded by the
confession and this statement it would appear the evidence was unnecessary, the
Crown called a ballistic expert, both at the preliminary hearing and at the
trial, who gave evidence that the bullet found in the ground near the boy's
body had been fired from a revolver found in the possession of the prisoner
when he was arrested in Port Arthur on the charge of robbery. It is apparent
that even if there were a ballistic expert who would have given evidence
contradicting this Crown witness it would have been pointless to call him. The
sanity of the prisoner had been enquired into at the instance of Mr. Ross and
he had been found sane. The crime had been committed at night and there were no
eye witnesses. In these circumstances it cannot, I think, be seriously
contended that twenty-four days was

[Page 155]

not ample time for counsel to prepare the defence. In my
opinion there can be no well founded criticism of the course followed by Mr.
Justice Major in making the services of Mr. Ross available to the prisoner and
in directing that the trial proceed twenty-four days after that date, or by
Chief Justice Williams in accepting the answer of Mr. Ross on November 17th
that the defence was ready and directing that the trial proceed.

When Mr. McMurray appeared at the opening of the trial he
stated that he was appearing ""on behalf of the accused, retained by his
family"" and asked to be permitted to state the nature of the application
he proposed to make. In the report made by the Chief Justice to the Court of
Appeal 26 he states that he did not understand
that Mr. McMurray was seeking to defend the prisoner and that he took from this
statement that counsel was appearing for the clients who had retained him and
not for the accused. I think it was unfortunate, assuming as I do that Mr.
McMurray had been retained to make the application by the accused, that he did
not make this clear to the learned trial Judge. Counsel may speak on behalf of
a prisoner only if authorized by him to do so but the retainer would be none
the less that of the prisoner if it had been made on his behalf by some member
of his family on his direction, which presumably was the case here. Had the
question been asked whether Mr. McMurray was authorized by the prisoner the
position would have been made perfectly clear and the only matter then to be
decided would be whether, in view of the fact that an application to traverse
the case had been made and dismissed by Major, J., the Chief Justice would
entertain another motion to be made apparently without filing any material to
support it. If Mr. McMurray had said that he proposed to undertake the defence
of the accused and either dispense with the services of Mr. Ross or to act with
him, he would no doubt have been heard. It has been made quite clear that the
only application which he proposed to make was that the case be traversed to
the next Assizes and that he did not intend to take any part in the defence if
the motion was refused and we are informed by the judge's report that any such
motion would have been refused. In my opinion, if

[Page 156 ]

it was error on the part of the learned Chief Justice in
declining to permit Mr. McMurray to make this motion, it has been shown
affirmatively by the Crown that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
has actually occurred and the provisions of section 1014(2) of the Criminal
Code should be applied.

A further ground of appeal urged on behalf of the appellant
is that the jury was not properly constituted. As to this I agree with my
brother Rand.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL UNDER SECTION 1025 (1), (NEW) OF
THE CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA.

Criminal Law—Appeal—Jurisdiction—Statute giving new
right of appeal not retrospective—11–12 Geo. VI c. 39, s. 42, enacting s. 1025
(1) Criminal Code.

By 11–12 Geo. VI, c. 39, s. 42, s. 1025 (1) of the Criminal
Code was repealed and the following substituted therefor: ""Either the
Attorney General or any person convicted of an indictable offence may appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of any court of appeal setting
aside or affirming a conviction or verdict of acquittal in respect

[Page 90]

of an indictable offence, on any question of law, if leave to
appeal is granted by a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty-one
days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced, or within such extended
time thereafter as the judge to whom the application is made may for special
reasons allow; in an appeal by the Attorney General the judge may impose such
terms, if any, as he may see fit.""

Held: that the enactment creates a new right of appeal,
where none existed before, on any question of law raised in the Court of
Appeal.

Held: also, that legislation conferring a new
jurisdiction on an appellate court to entertain an appeal cannot be construed
retrospectively, so as to cover cases arising prior to such legislation, unless
there is something making unmistakeable the legislative intention that it
should be so construed. (Singer v. The King), [1932] S.C.R. 70,
approved and followed.

Semble: that if the new legislation does not apply to a
case which arose prior to its coming into force, the old legislation, by virtue
of s. 19 of the Interpretation Act, continues to apply.

MOTION by appellant before the Chief Justice of
Canada in Chambers, for leave to appeal to this Court under s. 1025 (1) Criminal
Code, from the judgment rendered by the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side)
of the Province of Quebec on November 30, 1948 1, confirming the jury's
verdict rendered against him on December 6, 1947, by which he was found guilty
of the crime of conspiracy.

The motion was made under s. 1025(1) of the Criminal
Code (R.S.C. 1927, c. 36), as enacted by 11–12 Geo. VI c. 39, s. 42. By the
said amending Act, (s. 42), the following was substituted for s. 1025:

1025 (1) Either the Attorney-General or any person
convicted of an indictable offence may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
from the judgment of any court of appeal setting aside or affirming a
conviction or dismissing an appeal against a judgment or verdict of acquittal
in respect of an indictable offence, on any question of law, if leave to appeal
is granted by a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty-one days
after the judgment appealed from is pronounced, or within such extended time
thereafter as the judge to whom the application is made may for special reasons
allow; in an appeal by the Attorney General the judge may impose such terms, if
any, as he may see fit.

Lucien H. Gendron K.C. for the motion.

Philippe Brais K.C. contra.

The Chief Justice:—The
petitioner prays that permission be granted him to appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada from the judgment rendered by the Court of

[Page 91]

King's Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of Quebec,
confirming the verdict rendered against him, by which he was found guilty of
the crime of conspiracy.

The petition is based exclusively on the new subsection one
of section 1025 of the Criminal Code of Canada, which came into force on
the 1st of November, 1948.

The petitioner does not allege, nor was it a fact, that, in
the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), affirming his
conviction, there was any question of law on which there was dissent in the
Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) (Criminal Code, s. 1023). He
does not allege, either, that the judgment of the Count of King's Bench (Appeal
Side) conflicts with the judgment of any other Court of Appeal in a like case
(former ss. 1 of s. 1025 of the Criminal Code). He relies
entirely and exclusively, as above mentioned, upon the new ss. 1 of s. 1025,
being Chap. 39, 11–12 George VI, s. 42, which has only acquired the force of
law since the 1st day of November, 1948.

The preliminary question which it is essential to consider
and to decide is, therefore, whether the petitioner, against whom the
information was laid long before this new amendment became effective—the jury's
verdict was rendered on the 6th of December, 1947 and judgment delivered
accordingly by the presiding judge; notice of appeal was dated the same day and
lodged in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) on December 9, 1947—may invoke,
in his favour, the new ss. 1 of s. 1025 in order to ask a judge of the Supreme
Court of Canada to grant him leave to appeal to that Court on the questions of
law debated and decided by the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side).

The judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) was
delivered on the 30th of November, 1948; and the contention of the petitioner
is that, since the judgment from which he wishes to appeal was posterior to the
coming into force of the new amendment, that is sufficient to enable him to
take advantage of the law.

The point to be decided is, therefore, one concerning the
jurisdiction of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada to grant leave in the
circumstances; and it is of great and general importance, because it stands, of
course, for the first time to be decided and will likely govern the applica-

[Page 92]

bility of that new section to all petitions for leave to
appeal which may come from all parts of the Dominion in the future, or at least
for as long as that section remains part of the Criminal Code.

The argument of the petitioner in support of his contention
is that, as the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) was
delivered after the new subsection became effective, the date of that judgment
is the material one to be considered for the purpose of deciding whether the
section is applicable or not.

It is said that the right of appeal accruing to the
petitioner, or to any convicted prisoner, was only eventual prior to the
judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), and that the right of
appeal which the petitioner now seeks to exercise only arose when that judgment
was rendered. It is contended the fact that a man committed an indictable
offence and was brought before the Courts did not vest a right in the Crown as
against him, nor vest in the accused person an immediate right of appeal either
to the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), or to the Supreme Court of Canada;
that the date of the commission of the offence cannot be the date upon which
the prisoner's rights should be decided, because, if that were so, as the
former ss. 1 of s. 1025 has been repealed by the new legislation and if the new
ss. 1 of s. 1025 does not apply to him, he would be deprived of any right of
appeal.

Of course, I do not agree that, if the new subsection one of
s. 1025 does not apply to the present petitioner in the circumstances of his
case, he is deprived of the right of appeal as was provided by the former ss. 1
of s. 1025. It would seem to me in that case that s. 19(c) of the Interpretation
Act would come to his relief, and that, if the new legislation does not
apply to a case which arose prior to its coming into force, by force of s. 19
of the Interpretation Act the old legislation continues to apply to the
cases that are not governed by the new ss. 1 of s. 1025.

Alternatively, the petitioner contends that the right to
apply for leave to appeal in virtue of the new subsection is not a new right,
because the right to apply existed under

[Page 93]

the repealed ss. 1 of the former s. 1025 in cases where
there was a conflict of authority, and that the new subsection merely changes
the procedure.

Further, when confronted with a number of decisions rendered
in civil cases, he sought to distinguish between those cases and informations
brought under the criminal code and asked that the rule in the civil
cases should not be applied.

There are, of course, a series of decisions in this Court,
dating back to almost the beginning of the time when the judicial functions of
the Court took effect and could be exercised, whereby this Court is without
jurisdiction when the judgment intended to be appealed from was signed, or
entered, or pronounced previous to the date when, by proclamation issued by
order of the Governor in Council, the right of appeal to this Court was brought
into being. Taylor v. The Queen 2, contains a long
exposition of the law as then interpreted by the full Court (Richards, C.J.C.,
Ritchie, Strong, Taschereau and Fournier, JJ.). All the members of the Court
gave reasons on the point now before me and they were unanimous in reaching the
conclusion that the provision of the law coming into force subsequent to the
date when the judgment sought to be appealed from had been signed, pronounced,
or entered, cannot be given a retrospective effect and operate in order to give
jurisdiction to the Supreme Court of Canada to hear an appeal from the judgment
so signed, pronounced, or entered prior to the date when the new law became
effective.

In 1891, in the case of Hurtubise v. Desmarteau 3,
again the Court was unanimous in denying the right of appeal in a case where
the judgment sought to be appealed from was delivered on the same day on which
the amending Act came into force. It was decided that the Court had no
jurisdiction, the appellant not having shown that the judgment was delivered
subsequent to the passing of the amending Act.

In 1893 in Williams v. Irvine 4, the
decision of the Court was that a new right of appeal did not extend to cases
standing for judgment in the Superior Court prior to the passing of the Act.
Fournier J. expressed the view that

[Page 94]

the statute was not applicable to cases already instituted,
or pending, before the Courts, where no special words to that effect had been
used in the statute. Taschereau J. merely stated that he would have been of the
opinion that the Court had jurisdiction, but he said that he would not take
part in the judgment. Sedgewick J. stated that in his opinion the appeal should
be dismissed upon the authority of the case of Couture v. Bouchard 5,
decided by this Court in December, 1892.

In Hyde v. Lindsay 6, the
Court decided that the Act 60 and 61 Victoria, chap. 34, which restricted the
right of appeal to the Supreme Court in oases from Ontario as therein
specified, did not apply to a case in which the action was pending when the Act
came into force, although the judgment directly appealed from may not have been
pronounced until afterwards. The judgment of the Court was delivered by
Taschereau J. who referred to Hurtubise v. Desmarteau, Couture v.
Bouchard and Williams v. Irvine supra; and to Cowen v.
Evans 7, Mills v. Limoges 8
and The Montreal Street Railway v. Carrière 9, where a
footnote at that page states that an appeal in an action for $5,000 damages was
dismissed by the Superior Court prior to the passing of 54 and 55 Victoria,
chap. 25, but maintained by the Court of Queen's Bench on the 26th of April,
1893, for $600, was also quashed for want of jurisdiction, following the case
of Cowen v. Evans (supra).

In Hyde v. Lindsay supra, Taschereau J. at p.
103, said:—

Here we have the question presented under a statute taking
away the right of appeal in cases where it existed previously. ***If the
statute in former cases does not apply to pending cases, I do not see upon what
principle we could hold that the statute in the present case does apply to
pending cases.

In 1914 in Doran v. Jewell 10 it was
held that an Act of Parliament enlarging the right of appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada did not apply to a case in which the action was instituted
before the Act came into force. In that case the motion was referred to the
Court by the registrar for an order to have the jurisdiction of the Court to
hear the appeal affirmed and it was unanimously dismissed on the ground that
the motion was concluded

[Page 95]

adversely to the appellant by the authority of the several
judgments previously delivered in this Court on the same point and also as a
result of the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the
case of Colonial Sugar Refining Co. v. Irvine 11. This
judgment of the Privy Council may be immediately referred to. The Judicial
Committee was composed of Lord Macnaghten, Lord Davey, Lord Robertson, Lord
Lindley, Sir Ford North and Sir Arthur Wilson. The judgment of their Lordships
was delivered by Lord Macnaghten and it was held that, although the right of
appeal from the Supreme Court of Queensland to His Majesty in Council, given by
the Order in Council of June 30, 1860, had been taken away by the Australian
Commonwealth Judiciary Act, 1903, s. 39, sub-s. 2, and the only appeal
therefrom now laid to the High Court of Australia, yet the Act was not
retrospective, and the right of appeal to the King in Council in a suit pending
when the Act was passed and decided by the Supreme Court afterwards was not
taken away. At p. 372 Lord Macnaghten said:—

As regards the general principles applicable to the case
there was no controversy. On the one hand, it was not disputed that if the
matter in question be a matter of procedure only, the petition is well founded.
On the other hand, if it be more than a matter of procedure, if it touches a
right in existence at the passing of the Act, it was conceded that, in
accordance with a long line of authorities extending from the time of Lord Coke
to the present day, the appellants would be entitled to succeed. The Judiciary
Act is not retrospective by express enactment or by necessary intendment. And
therefore the only question is: Was the appeal to His Majesty in Council a
right vested in the appellants at the date of the passing of the Act, or was it
a mere matter of procedure? It seems to their Lordships that the question does
not admit of doubt. To deprive a suitor in a pending action of an appeal to a
superior tribunal which belonged to him as of right is a very different thing
from regulating procedure. In principle, their Lordships see no difference
between abolishing an appeal altogether and transferring the appeal to a new
tribunal. In either case there is an interference with existing rights contrary
to the well-known general principle that statutes are not to be held to act
retrospectively unless a clear intention to that effect is manifested.

In 1920, in Upper Canada College v. Smith 12,
the Court had before it the statute 6 George V, c. 24, s. 19, amended by 8
George V, c. 20, s. 58, by which s. 13 of the Ontario Statute of Frauds, R.S.O.
1914, c. 102 was enacted as follows:—

No action shall be brought to charge any person for the
payment of commission or other remuneration for the sale of real property
unless

[Page 96]

the agreement upon which such action shall be brought shall
be in writing separate from the sale agreement and signed by the party to be
charged therewith or some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.

It was held that this enactment was not retrospective and
did not bar an action to recover commission under a contract made before it
came into force. The majority of the Court agreed with Anglin J., as he then
was, who, in his reasons, referred to a great number of authorities. Duff J.,
as he then was, at p. 417 recalled the well-known passage of Lord Coke (2 Inst.
292) in which it is laid down that it is a ""rule and law of Parliament
that regularly nova constitutio futuris formam imponere debet non
praeteritis"". And Mr. Justice Duff continued:—

and the rule that statutory enactments generally are to be
regarded as intended only to regulate the future conduct of persons is, as
Parke B. said in Moon v. Durden, in 1848 13,
""deeply founded in good sense and strict justice"", because speaking
generally it would not only be widely inconvenient but ""a flagrant
violation of natural justice"" to deprive people of rights acquired by
transactions perfectly valid and regular according to the law of the time.

At p. 419 of the same judgment Mr. Justice Duff said:—

And even more numerous instances might be adduced of dicta
enunciating the doctrine that the intention must appear from the words of the
statute itself. ""The principle is one of such obvious convenience and
justice that it must always be adhered to in the construction of statutes
unless in cases where there is something on the face of the enactment putting
it beyond doubt that the legislature meant it to operate retrospectively.""

Mr. Justice Duff referred to the Midland Rly. Co. v. Pye,
in 1861 14, where there is a passage in the
judgment of Erle C.J. approved by the Privy Council in Young v. Adams
15, at p. 476, in these words:—

Those whose duty it is to administer the laws very properly
guard against giving to an Act of Parliament a retrospective operation unless
the intention of the legislature that it should be so construed is expressed in
plain and unambiguous language; because it manifestly shocks one's sense of
justice that an act legal at the time of doing it should be made unlawful by
some new enactment.

Speaking on the point that the change in the Upper Canada
College case was only one of procedure, Mr. Justice Duff, at p. 423, said:—

The last mentioned rule (about procedure) rests upon the
simple and intelligible reason stated by Mellish L.J. in Republic of Costa
Rica v. Erlanger in 1876 16 at p. 69, in these words:—

[Page 97]

""No suitor has any vested interest in the course of
procedure, nor any right to complain if during the litigation the procedure is
changed provided, of course, that no injustice is done.""

Mr. Justice Duff then referred to the passage in the
judgment of Lord Macnaghten in Colonial Sugar Refining Co. v. Irving
supra above quoted.

At p. 429 of the same judgment Mr. Justice Duff refers to Moon
v. Durden and states that in that case Helmore v. Shuter 17,
was accepted expressly by three of the judges, Platt, Rolfe and Parke BB., as
being unquestionably a sound decision; and Rolfe and Parke BB. explicitly
treated it as an example of the application of the rule that prima facie
statutes are to be construed as prospective, which indeed is the ratio upon
which the decision was in terms put by the Court that pronounced it.

In Singer v. The King 18, the
Court held that: ""Legislation conferring a new jurisdiction on an
appellate court to entertain an appeal cannot be construed retrospectively, so
as to cover cases arising prior to such legislation, unless there is something
making unmistakeable the legislative intention that it should be so construed.
The matter is one of substance and of right."" Doran v. Jewell 19
and Upper Canada College v. Smith 20 were
relied upon. In the Singer case it was held that 21–22 George V, c. 28,
s. 15 (amending s. 1025 of the Criminal Code) did not give a right to
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the sustaining of the appellant's
conviction by a judgment of the Appellate Division of Ontario rendered prior to
such legislation.

Singer had been convicted on the 23rd of March, 1931, and
his conviction was sustained by the Appellate Division on the 26th of June,
1931. The statute, in virtue of which Singer sought to appeal to this Court,
became law on the 1st of September, 1931. Anglin C.J.C., delivering the
judgment of the Court, at p. 72 stated:—

It is common ground that, unless there is something making
unmistakeable the intention of the Legislature that a retrospective
construction should be put upon the legislation so that it may cover cases
arising prior thereto, no clause, conferring a new jurisdiction an an appellate
court to entertain an appeal, can be so construed. The matter is one of
substance and of right.

[Page 98]

The decision in Doran v. Jewell 21
is binding upon us and is conclusive to that effect. If further authority be
required on this point, it may be found in Upper Canada College v. Smith
22.

I wish to underline the following words in this decision of
the Court:—

Unless there is something making unmistakeable the intention
of the Legislature that a retrospective construction should be put upon the
legislation so that it may cover cases arising prior thereto, no clause,
conferring a new jurisdiction on an appellate court to entertain an appeal, can
be so construed. The matter is one of substance and of right.

This decision assumes an added importance from the fact that
the amendment there considered was one enacted to modify the same section 1025
as is invoked in the present case, and the Court there said that legislation
conferring a new jurisdiction on an appellate court to entertain an appeal
cannot be construed retrospectively so as to cover ""cases arising prior to
such legislation""—words which might refer either to the institution of the
case, or at least to the actual beginning of the trial in the original Court,
but surely not to the mere incident of the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

Further, the decision in Doran v. Jewell (a
civil case) is there stated to be ""binding upon us and is conclusive to
that effect""; and the decision in Upper Canada College v. Smith (another
civil case) is also stated as being ""a further authority on this
point"".

The question is not whether the case is civil or criminal.
No distinction is made in that respect in the jurisprudence. The question is
solely: What is the character of the legislation? If, in terms or by necessary
intendment, it is retrospective, then, of course, it produces retroactive
effects; but otherwise, it is prospective only and becomes applicable only for
the future.

It would appear from the judgment in the Singer case
that not only is legislation conferring a new jurisdiction upon an Appellate
Court to entertain an appeal—which is the very case that we have in the present
petition—not to be construed retrospectively so as to cover cases arising prior
to such legislation, but also, although the Singer case was a criminal
case, it was put exactly on the same footing

[Page 99]

in that respect as Doran v. Jewell and Upper
Canada College v. Smith, both civil cases which were declared
binding upon this Court and conclusive to that effect.

I cannot see any distinction that can be made between the Singer
case and the present one. It covers exactly the situation that we have as a
result of the petition which I now have before me; and I would say that it is a
fortiori binding upon this Court and conclusive, because, although the two
cases cited by Anglin C.J.C. were civil cases, the Singer case was not
only a criminal case but it came before this Court precisely on the application
of a new amendment to section 1025 of the Criminal Code, which was practically
to the same effect as the new subsection one of section 1025 which is now
invoked by the petitioner.

Further reference might be made to the judgment of the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta in Rex v. Rivet 23,
where it is stated:—

Legislation creating or abolishing a right of appeal does
not relate merely to procedure and will not be given a retrospective effect in
the absence of an apparent intention to the contrary. Therefore, sub-para. (k)
of para. (7) of s. 2 of the Criminal Code (am. 1943, c. 23, s. 1), designating
a Court of Appeal in criminal matters for the Northwest Territories, is
ineffective to confer jurisdiction upon the Alberta Court of Appeal in respect
of appeals from convictions, made prior to the enactment of such legislation.

I might add that I do not agree with the contention of
Counsel for the petitioner that the new subsection one of section 1025 does not
create a new right of appeal. Up to the coming into force of that new
subsection, there existed only two rights of appeal in favour of the person
convicted, whose conviction had been affirmed by the Court of Appeal. One was
under section 1023: ""On any question of law on which there has been
dissent in the Court of Appeal""; the other was under the former subsection
one of section 1025: ""If the judgment appealed from conflicts with the
judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case"".

Under the new subsection one of section 1025 ""any
person convicted of an indictable offence may appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada from the judgment of any court

[Page 100]

of appeal setting aside or affirming a conviction or
dismissing an appeal against a judgment or verdict of acquittal in respect of
an indictable offence, on any question of law"". The only requirement is
that leave to appeal must be granted by a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada.

It is quite clear and evident that a new right of appeal is
created where none existed before; that is, while section 1023 was left as it
was, the new subsection one of section 1025, now substituted for the former
one, has done away with the need of showing a conflict between two courts of
appeal and a new right of appeal is created ""on any question of law"".
It does not even require that there should be a dissent in the Court of Appeal,
nor that any of the judges who took part in the judgment in that Court should
have entertained the question of law upon which the convicted person may ask
for leave to appeal. It is now sufficient that the person convicted may have
raised a question of law in the Court of Appeal and, although every one of the
judges in that Court refused to accept that proposition of law as being sound,
the mere fact that the said question of law was raised by the convicted person
in the Court appealed from is sufficient to give him a ground upon which he may
ask a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada to grant leave to appeal on that
question to this Court.

For these reasons I am of opinion that the petitioner herein
cannot invoke the new subsection one of section 1025 in his case; that, as a
consequence, since he does not allege either dissent or conflict and as, in
fact, no dissent exists and no conflict has been shown, I am without
jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal in the present instance.

Having come to that conclusion, I have nothing to say about
the other questions raised by the petitioner.

The petition is dismissed.

Leave to appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Trial—Evidence—Trial, with jury, of
actions for damages caused by collision of motor cars—Questions by cross-examining counsel
to party as to convictions on previous occasions under Highway Traffic Act—New trial—Right to jury.

The actions, tried
together, with a jury, were for damages caused by a collision between a motor
car owned and driven by appellant and one owned and driven by respondent S. The
jury found negligence in each driver contributing to the accident, and
apportioned the fault, against said respondent 75 per cent. and against
appellant 25 per cent.; and, accordingly, judgments were given for damages, to
appellant against said respondent, and to a passenger in the latter’s car, now also a
respondent, against appellant. On appeal by said respondents, the Court of
Appeal for Ontario ordered a new trial ([1945] 4 D.L.R. 450). That order was
now affirmed by this Court on the ground that, at the trial, appellant’s counsel, in
cross-examining the respondent driver (and following some explanatory remark by
the latter that it was his “first occasion in court”, and counsel indicating
intention to attack credibility) elicited from him that on certain charges of
speeding in previous years he had paid fines; but it was not established that
he had himself committed the offences (he might, as owner of a car driven by
others, have “incurred penalties” under The Highway
Traffic Act, Ont., without having himself “violated” the Act; he stated that on none of
the occasions had he appeared in court); and, assuming evidence as to the
convictions was admissible at all, such evidence could only have been adduced
if counsel were in a position to show that the witness had himself committed
the offences; respondents had met the onus under s. 27(1) of The Judicature
Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 100 (of showing a “substantial wrong or miscarriage”). But this Court held that
the direction by the Court of Appeal that the new trial should be without a
jury should be set aside; as a jury is an eminently proper tribunal for trial
of the matters in issue, sufficient ground had not been shown to deprive
appellant, by said direction, of that right. (The Court found it unnecessary to
decide whether, in view of s. 55 of The Judicature Act, and the
authority thereby and by the Rules conferred upon the trial judge, the
direction could be supported.)

APPEALS from judgments of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which set aside judgments
of Barlow J. on the findings of a jury, and ordered a new trial, to be had
before a judge without a jury.



There
were two actions, tried together before Barlow J. with a jury. They arose out
of a collision on February 12, 1944, on Highway No. 2, near Highland Creek,
Ontario, between a motor car owned and driven by the appellant and one owned
and driven by the respondent Secord. The appellant sued Secord for damages for
personal injuries and damage to her car, and the respondent Nasmith, a
passenger in Secord’s car, sued the appellant
for damages for personal injuries. The jury found negligence on the part of
both drivers causing or contributing to the cause of the accident, found the
degrees of such negligence to be: respondent Secord 75 per cent., and appellant
25 per cent., and assessed appellant’s
total damages at $3,000 and respondent Nasmith’s total damages at $5,000. In
accordance with such findings, judgment was given in favour of the appellant
for $2,250 against the respondent Secord and judgment was given in favour of
the respondent Nasmith for $1,250 against the appellant. The said Secord and
Nasmith appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which gave judgments as
above stated (Laidlaw J.A. dissented, except that he would direct a new trial
as between Nasmith and the present appellant, but confined to the ascertainment
of the quantum of damages sustained by Nasmith). Appellant appealed to this
Court.

D.L. McCarthy K.C. (in one
appeal) and J.R. Cartwright K.C. (in the other appeal) for the appellant.

F.J. Hughes K.C. for the
respondent Secord.

J.J. Robinette K.C. for the
respondent Nasmith.



The judgment of the Court was
delivered by



KELLOCK
J.—These appeals are taken
from orders of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dated 6th July, 1945, which
allowed appeals by the respondents from judgments of Barlow J., dated 24th
February, 1945, entered pursuant to the verdict of a jury. The two actions arose
out of a

[Page 279]










collision
on 12th February, 1944, between automobiles owned and driven by the appellant
and the respondent Secord, respectively, the appellant Nasmith being a
passenger in the Secord car. The actions were tried together. By the order in
appeal a new trial was directed, Laidlaw J.A. dissenting. The view of the
majority was that the trial was unsatisfactory by reason of conduct on the part
of counsel representing the appellant at the trial and also on the ground that
a jury acting judicially and with a proper appreciation of its duties must
necessarily have arrived at a greater amount of damages than was awarded
Nasmith. The majority were also of the view that the damages, in the absence of
other explanation, might also be the result of the conduct of counsel already
referred to. Laidlaw J.A. dissented on the ground that no sufficient or any
objection had been made at trial and that the present respondents had failed to
show any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. While a new trial was
directed, that trial was directed to take place without a jury.



In our
opinion, the appeal should be dismissed but the direction that the new trial
shall take place without a jury must be deleted. We do not consider it
necessary to deal with all the matters of which the respondents complain with
regard to the conduct of the trial. We think it is sufficient to refer to one
matter only which, in our opinion, makes it necessary that a new trial should
be had.



Immediately
before commencing his cross-examination of the respondent Secord, counsel for
the appellant, in the absence of the jury, said, basing himself upon the
provisions of section 18(1) of The Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1937, Chap.
119, that he proposed to cross‑examine the witness with respect to
previous convictions under The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1937, Chap.
288. He said: “I submit I have that right
on purely a question of credibility; I am not submitting it on any other
ground, it is on the ground of credibility.” And again: “I am not trying to put the convictions
in as evidence to show he is a bad driver on previous occasions or because he
was convicted of speeding on previous occasions that he was speeding on this
occasion, I am submitting it on credibility, * * *”

[Page 280]



Objection
was made by counsel for both respondents and at the conclusion of argument with
regard to the point the learned trial judge ruled as follows:










His
Lordship: Mr. Levinter put his application for leave to introduce by way
of cross‑examination questions as to previous convictions of the
defendant Dr. Secord, on the ground that he is entitled to cross-examine as to
those by way of attacking the credibility of the witness; well, that might be
so from a certain standpoint, yet in an action of this kind before a jury it
would have a very different effect entirely, and for that reason alone,
regardless of any other reasons that there may be, I must rule that the
questions cannot be asked. If I am wrong and this goes farther, it will have to
be corrected elsewhere. Bring the jury back.



The
cross-examination proceeded and in the course of it the witness, in excusing
himself for the way in which he had given some answers on discovery, made the
statement: “This is my first occasion
in court. I am not familiar with the proceeding.” The following then occurred:



Mr. Levinter:
It is your first occasion in court?



A.
Yes, with the exception of giving expert evidence.



Q.
Have you never been in court before?



A.
No.



Q.
Never in police court before?



A.
No, sir.



Mr. Levinter:
Am I entitled to now on the question of credibility?



His
Lordship: No, I don’t think so.



Mr. Walker:
I object to these innuendoes my friend is constantly making.



Mr. Hughes:
Do you mind if I say that after Your Lordship’s ruling my friend has directly gone
through it; now, My Lord, may I withdraw any objection and let the jury have
whatever he has got in his head so that there will be no questions said to the
jury afterwards that we endeavoured to keep anything back, let him put it in.



His
Lordship: Very well.



Cross-examining
counsel then elicited from the witness that on certain charges of speeding in
1938, 1939, 1940 and 1943 he paid fines, but the witness said that other
persons drove his car as well as himself and he was unable to say whether on
any of the occasions he himself had been driving. He also said that on none of
the occasions had he appeared in court.



Somewhat
inadvisedly counsel for the respondent Nasmith, who preceded counsel for the
appellant, said in the course of his address to the jury:



By
innuendo he gets it across to you people that this man is a speed fiend, a
terrible fellow—just by innuendo—that he is full of
convictions, that he must have been in court many times; then my learned friend
fortunately brings out, “Well, let us hear all about

[Page 281]



this”, I had not heard about it,
and we find over a period of driving as many miles as he does in a year, we
find over the period of those years a certain number of fines for speeding; my
friend does not bring forward and indicate who is fined.



Appellant’s counsel followed in due
course and the following occurred:










My
friend bitterly complains that I brought out these convictions for speeding;
gentlemen, I would have laughed, just as you laughed yesterday, if I had
brought out that in 1938 he was speeding so much, we all laugh sometimes
when these things happen, but you do not have two in 1938, and one in 1939, and
you don’t have another in 1940, you
don’t have another in 1943—



His
Lordship: Mr. Levinter, just a moment; you brought that evidence as to
credibility and nothing else, now you are using it for exactly the other
purpose—



Mr. Levinter:
My friend raised it in his argument at great length, and surely I am entitled
to respond to my learned friend’s argument.



His
Lordship: Proceed.



Mr. Levinter:
Those are the only times that he was convicted apparently, now was he putting
on speed on this occasion?



By
section 26 of The Highway Traffic Act it is provided that no
vehicle shall be driven upon any highway within a city, town or village at a
greater speed than thirty miles an hour except in certain special localities,
and at fifty miles per hour outside such municipalities. By sub‑section (4),
any person “who violates” any of the provisions of
the section is rendered liable to certain penalties, including certain
fines.



By
section 46 it is provided that the owner of a motor vehicle shall “incur the penalties” provided for any violation
of the Act unless at the time of such violation the motor vehicle was in the
possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffeur, without the
owner’s consent, and the driver
not being the owner is also made liable for such penalties.



Accordingly,
even assuming that a breach of the speed limit laid down by the statute would
constitute a “crime” within the meaning of
sub-section (1) of section 18 of The Evidence Act, which we do
not consider it necessary to decide, the appellant did not establish, as to any
of the convictions, that it was the witness who had “violated” the statute.



We are
of the opinion that, assuming evidence as to these convictions was admissible
at all, such evidence could only have been adduced if counsel were in a
position to

[Page 282]



show
that the witness had himself committed the offences. We think that the
withdrawal of objection on the part of counsel for the respondents must be
deemed to have proceeded on the assumption that this would be done. On this
ground alone we think that the order for a new trial must be affirmed. We do
not think it open to the appellant to contend that the course pursued did not
have its intended effect. We therefore think that the onus resting upon the
respondents under section 27 of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1937,
Cap. 100, has been met.










With respect to the direction that the
new trial should be without a jury, we think that, as a jury is an eminently
proper tribunal for the trial of the matters that are in issue between the
parties, sufficient ground has not been shown to deprive the appellant of that
right. Whether, in view of the right to a jury given by section 55 of The
Judicature Act, and the authority thereby and by the Rules conferred upon
the trial judge, the order in appeal can be supported, need not be decided.
There rests with the trial judge sufficient power and authority to conduct the
trial as it should be conducted, and, should he see reason to try the action
without a jury or to dispense with the jury at any stage, his discretion is not
subject to review; Currie v. Motor Union Insurance Co.[2]; Wilson v. Kinnear[3]. We think that the course
followed in Reiffenstein v. Dey[4] should be followed here
and the direction complained of must therefore be set aside.



The
appeal will therefore be allowed in part as indicated. The right to a trial by
jury is a substantial right, and, as success is divided, we think there should
be no costs of this appeal. The costs below will not be interfered

Appeals allowed in part.

ON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA

Negligence—Crown—Workmen’s
compensation—Damages—Death through accident caused by negligence of servant of
the Crown (Dom.)—Action on behalf of dependents of deceased under Families’
Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1986, c. 98, claiming damages against the
Crown—Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 8A (as amended), ss. 19(c),
50A—Claim and acceptance, prior to the action, of compensation from the
Workmen’s Compensation Board of British Columbia—Question as to effect thereof
on right of action or extent of recovery—Workmen’s Compensation Act, R.S.B.C.
1986, c. 812, s. 11—Subrogation of the Board—Board a co-suppliant in the
action.

The husband of S, while working in the course
of his employment by one D, in the province of British Columbia, was the victim
of an accident through which he died, which accident was caused by the
negligence of a member of the Canadian military forces while acting within the
scope of his duties or employment. S was awarded compensation for herself and
her infant son by the Workmen’s Compensation Board of British
 Columbia under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, R.S.B.C.
1936, c. 312. She brought the present action (by petition of right) for the
benefit of herself and her son under the Families’ Compensation Act, R.S.B.C.
1936, c, 93, claiming damages against the Crown by virtue of ss. 19 (c) and 50A
of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34 (as amended in 1938, c.
28, and 1943, c. 25). S. 11 of said Workmen’s Compensation Act provide
for cases where an accident happens in such circumstances as entitle the
workman or his dependents “to an action against some person other than his
employer”, and subs. 3 thereof provides in effect that, if a workman or
dependent claims compensation from said Board, the Board shall be subrogated to
the rights of the workman or dependent as against such other person. In the
present action the Board was a co-suppliant, pleading its statutory right of
subrogation, and also an equitable assignment in writing from S to it.

Held: The
claiming and acceptance by S of compensation under said Workmen’s
Compensation Act did not bar her right to recover, nor affect the amount
recoverable, from the Crown in the present action. S. 11(3) of that Act only
affected rights as between the dependents and the Board. The direction by the
Exchequer Court that the amount it awarded as damages to S should be payable to
the Board and the amount it awarded as damages to her son should be paid into
court to abide the Court’s order, with liberty to the Board to apply for a
declaration as to its rights, was unobjectionable.

Judgment in the Exchequer
 Court, [1945] Ex. C.R. 250, affirmed. 

[Page 220]

APPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of the
Honourable Mr. Justice Sidney Smith, Deputy Judge of the Exchequer Court of
Canada [1], in
favour of the suppliants against the Crown (in right of the Dominion of Canada)
for damages.

The action was brought (by petition of right)
for damages by reason of the death through accident of Bertram, Snell who was,
at the time of the accident, working in the course of his employment as a
servant of one Dines, in the province of British Columbia. The accident was
caused by negligence of a member of the Canadian military forces while acting
within the scope of his duties or employment. The action was brought on behalf
of the widow of the deceased and her infant son, under the Families’
Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 93, and amendments thereto. Prior to
the action the widow had claimed and been awarded compensation for herself and
her son by the Workmen’s Compensation Board of British
 Columbia under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, R.S.B.C.
1936, c. 312. The said Board was a co-suppliant in the action, pleading that it
was subrogated, pursuant to provisions of s. 11 of the said Workmen’s
Compensation Act, to the claims of the dependents, and also pleading an
equitable assignment in writing from the widow to it.

On behalf of the Crown it was alleged that in
consequence of the election by the widow to claim compensation, and payment to
and acceptance by her of the monthly award of the Board for herself and her son
as compensation for the death of her husband, she had suffered no loss or
damage in law which would entitle her to maintain an action against the Crown
under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 24 (an
alternative submission in the present appeal was that she had no claim except
to the extent that the award to her under the Workmen’s Compensation Act had
not fully compensated her); that she had assigned her right of action and, as a
result, was not entitled to maintain an action; that the provisions of the said
Workmen’s Compensation Act were not applicable

[Page 221]

to the Crown and that the suppliant Board
could acquire no right of action against the Crown by subrogation under that
Act.

The contentions of the parties are further
stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported.

By the formal judgment in the Exchequer Court
it was ordered that the suppliants were entitled to recover from the Crown, as
damages suffered by the widow the sum of $13,500 payable to the Board and by
them to be dealt with in due course, and as damages suffered by the son the sum
of $3,500 to be paid into court to the credit of the suppliants to abide the
order of the Court, and that the Board be at liberty to apply to the Court for
a declaration that the Board is by subrogation entitled to the said sum of
$3,500 and to payment out to them of said sum.

W. R. Jackett for
the appellant.

F. A. Sheppard, K.C. for the respondents.

Kerwin, J.—On September 29, 1943, Bertram Snell died in consequence of a
collision between two motor trucks on a highway in the Province
 of British Columbia. The collision was occasioned by
the negligence of Sapper Neufeld, a member of the military forces of His
Majesty in the right of Canada,
which negligence occurred while Neufeld was acting within the scope of his
duties or employment. At the time, Snell was engaged in the course of his
employment in driving a truck of his employer, one Dines, and the collision
occurred between that truck and one owned by the Dominion Crown and driven by
Neufeld. This Court has not had occasion to pass upon the judgment of the Exchequer Court in McArthur v. The
King [2],
where it was decided that a member of the Non-Permanent Active Militia of
Canada on active service was not an officer or servant of the Crown within
section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, and it is not now necessary to
do so as section 50A of that Act, as enacted by chapter 25 of the Statutes of
1943, provides:

50A. For the purpose of determining
liability in any action or other proceeding by or against His Majesty, a person
who was at any time since the twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand nine
hundred and

[Page 222]

thirty-eight, a member of the naval,
military or air forces of His Majesty in right of Canada shall be deemed to have been at such time a servant of the Crown.

For another reason the date, June 24, 1938, is
of importance, as it was then that chapter 28 of the statutes of that year was
assented to, by which section 19(c) was repealed and re-enacted but with the
omission of the words “on any public work” at the end thereof.

It has been authoritatively determined that
section 19(c) not only conferred jurisdiction upon the Exchequer Court to
adjudicate the classes of claims described but also that in such cases
liability is imposed upon the Crown to respond in damages for the negligence of
its officers or servants where, in like circumstances, such a liability would
rest upon a subject corporation or individual according to the law of the
province in which the claim arose as that law existed at the time when the Exchequer
Court Act began to operate: Canadian National Railway Co. v. Saint
John Motor Line Limited [3].
Prior to June 24, 1938, even if Neufeld were an officer or servant of the
Crown, a petition of right for, such an occurrence as the one here in question
could not have succeeded, since the negligence was not committed during
Neufeld’s presence on a public work: The King v. Dubois [4]; The King v.
Moscovitz [5].
June 24, 1938, must, therefore, be taken as the date as of which the question
must be determined whether in like circumstances a liability would rest upon a
subject. At that time there was in force in British
 Columbia the Families’ Compensation Act, R.S.B.C.
1936, chapter 93, whereby an action for damages for the death of Snell might be
brought against the wrongdoer by and in the name of the widow for the benefit
of herself and infant son. There was also in force the Workmen’s
Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, chapter 312.

A petition of right was accordingly brought
against the Crown by the widow for damages for Snell’s death. The accident
having happened in such circumstances as entitled a workman’s dependent to an
action against some person other than the workman’s employer, and the widow
having claimed under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, the

[Page 223]

Workmen’s Compensation Board of British Columbia established thereby is, by
virtue of subsection 3 of section 11, “subrogated to the rights of the workman
or dependent as against such other person for the whole or any outstanding part
of the claim of the workman or dependent against such other person.” The Board
also took an equitable assignment in writing from the widow. The Board was
joined as a co-suppliant, not as a necessary party,—since the claim is that of
the widow on behalf of herself and her infant son—but as a proper party.

The dispute of the claim is founded upon the
facts that the widow had a right to claim compensation under the provisions of
the Workmen’s Compensation Act although she might choose not to exercise
it; that she did make such a claim; that the Board ordered that certain monthly
sums be paid to her for herself and for the son; and that these sums have been
and are being paid. Although it is doubtful if the point is open on the
pleadings, it was also argued that even if these circumstances did not defeat
the present claim, the compensation awarded under the Workmen’s Compensation
Act should lessen pro tanto the sum awarded by the trial judge.

If the appellant’s arguments were sound, they
would apply as well between subjects as between the Crown and subject. It is
well settled that it is only pecuniary loss for which compensation is to be
paid under Lord Campbell’s Act and legislation similar thereto, such as the British Columbia Families’ Compensation
Act, and that any pecuniary advantage a dependent has received from the
death must be set off against her probable loss. In Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v.
Jennings (1), the Privy Council decided, in an action under the Ontario Fatal
Accidents Act as it then stood, that while the total amount of a life
insurance policy need not as a matter of law be deducted from what would
otherwise be payable as the pecuniary loss contemplated by the Act, the receipt
of the insurance money was a proper circumstance to be taken into
consideration. This has since been changed by statute in Ontario but not in British
 Columbia. In litigation between subjects, an action by
the dependent of a workman whose (1) (1888) 13 App. Cas. 800.

[Page 224]

death was caused by a third party would not be
defeated by reason merely of the dependent’s right to claim compensation under
the Workmen’s Compensation Act. If the dependent had claimed
compensation, the Board, by subsection 3 of section 11, would have been
“subrogated to the rights of the workman or dependent as against such other
person for the whole or any outstanding part of the claim of the workman or
dependent against such other person.” It is not necessary to determine
precisely to what the words “or any outstanding part” refer, but I am satisfied
that they would not apply so as to reduce the claim of the dependent against a
subject wrongdoer. The Board is subrogated to the dependent’s rights against
the third party and the Board’s rights would not be defeated or curtailed by
anything done by the dependent. That is, as between subjects, it seems clear
that the wrongdoer could not successfully contend that the legislature intended
that the receipt by a dependent of compensation under the Workmen’s
Compensation Act should be deducted from the sum otherwise payable under
the Families’ Compensation Act. If that were so, the subrogation of the
Board to the dependent’s rights would be illusory. Liability to the same extent
attaches to the Crown.

Mrs. Snell is therefore entitled on behalf of
herself and her infant son to damages. No question was raised as to the amounts
allowed by the trial judge and nothing is said, therefore, as to the manner of
their compilation. The petition of right being carried on at the instance of
the Board, even if it were not a party, the judgment would still be in favour
of the widow and infant. As between the Board and the widow and her son, the
former is entitled to the amounts awarded and I think there is ample power in
the Exchequer Court to direct, as has been done in this case, that the damages
suffered by the widow should be payable to the Board, and that the damages
suffered by the infant should be paid into Court for the benefit of all the
suppliants to abide the order of the Court, with liberty to the Board to apply
for a declaration that it is entitled by subrogation to the same sum and to
payment out to the Board thereof.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

[Page 225]

The judgment of Taschereau and Estey JJ., was
delivered by

Estey J.—The late husband of the respondent, Bessie May Snell, was killed
in a collision between a truck driven by himself, in the course of his
employment, and an army vehicle driven by a soldier. Mrs. Snell applied for and
received compensation under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, R.S.B.C.
1936, c. 312.

This action is brought by the Workmen’s
Compensation Board of British Columbia and Mrs. Snell against the Crown in the right of the Dominion. The
Board pleads an equitable assignment from Mrs. Snell to it and its right to
subrogation under section 11(3) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act.

The pleadings admit that the late Mr. Snell’s
death was caused by the negligence of the driver of the army vehicle and
therefore that Mrs. Snell had an action against the Crown in the right of the
Dominion by virtue of her position under the Families’ Compensation Act, R.S.B.C.
1936, c. 93, and her consequent rights tinder section 19(c) and section 50A of
the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, e. 34, as amended 1938 S.C., c.
28, and 1943 S.C., c. 25.

The Crown, however, contends that so far as Mrs.
Snell is concerned, having received compensation under the Workmen’s
Compensation Act, she has either suffered no pecuniary loss, or
alternatively has been fully compensated therefor and therefore has no cause of
action, or in the further alternative that she is entitled to only the
difference between what she has been awarded under the Workmen’s
Compensation Act and what may be found to be full compensation.

So far as the Workmen’s Compensation Board is
concerned, the Crown sets up a number of defences which may be summarized thus:
that the Board suffered no pecuniary damage; the assignment is ineffective as
against the Crown; and section 11(3) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act does
not give any remedy to the Board against the Crown in the right of the
Dominion.

An examination of Mrs. Snell’s position under
the provincial Workmen’s Compensation Act and under the sections of the Exchequer
Court Act already referred to indicates

[Page 226]

that she had both a claim under the provincial
Act and under the Exchequer Court Act. The contention here is that,
having exercised her right and having accepted compensation under provincial
legislation, that election on her part has barred her right to recover from the
Crown in the right of the Dominion, if not completely, then to the extent that
she has recovered compensation under that Act.

The position of one who elects under the Workmen’s
Compensation Act of Ontario
was determined by this Court in Toronto Railway Company v. Button [6], where Mr. Justice Duff (later Chief Justice) stated at p. 421 :

If he elects to claim compensation, the
employer becomes subrogated to the claimant’s rights against the third person;
in other words, he becomes entitled to enjoy the benefit of them and may
enforce them in the name of the claimant. But all this is intended to be and is
a disposition as to the rights of the employer and the claimant inter se.

And at p. 422:

It follows, of course, that the
transactions between the Board and the plaintiff are transactions to which for
the purpose of this litigation the appellant company is a stranger and that
they do not afford any answer to the respondent’s claim in the action.

The material provisions of the Workmen’s
Compensation Act of British Columbia here under consideration are to the same effect as those of the
Ontario Act in Toronto Railway Company v. Hutton, supra. It
follows, therefore, that the position of the party whose negligence caused the
injury is unaffected by the provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation Act.

The compensation under the statute is in no way
a settlement of Mrs. Snell’s claim for damages arising out of the negligence of
the appellant. The basis for the compensation under the statute, that of
“injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment”, is a much
wider and different basis from that of a claim founded in negligence. A
computation of the claim is also, as set out in the statute, quite different
from that which would be followed in a negligence action. Moreover, the Workmen’s
Compensation Act provides in effect that the claim of Mrs. Snell at common law
for damages continues and may be enforced. It therefore follows that the
contention of the

Crown that whatever damages Mrs. Snell may have
suffered have been recovered and because thereof she has no further claim, is
not tenable.

The statute does provide that, in the event of
the party entitled to compensation accepting same, the Board is subrogated to
or stands in the position of the party receiving compensation as against the
party whose negligence caused the action. These are matters entirely between
the party entitled to compensation and the Board. In this case both of these
are parties to the action. It therefore becomes unnecessary to determine
certain of the issues raised had the action been brought in the name of the
Board only.

Both were parties to the action as framed and
tried in the Exchequer Court.
There the learned trial judge in his judgment directed how the funds received
should be dealt with as between the Board, Mrs. Snell and her infant son. If
the appeal otherwise failed, this disposition of the funds was not objected to.

The appeal should be dismissed and the judgment
of the Exchequer Court
affirmed.

Rand J.—In this case, the Dominion Crown, liable for the tort of its
servant, claims a deduction from damages recoverable by the widow and child
under the Families’ Compensation Act of British
 Columbia, of the sums payable to them under the Workmen’s
Compensation Act. The contention is that the death statute is intended
merely to maintain to the dependents the benefits they would have received if
death had not ensued the accident, and that there must be taken into account
all benefits that arise to them by reason of the death.

There is no doubt a distinction has been
established between the effect on damages of such benefits in the case of
injuries not causing death and those that result fatally. In Bradburn v.
Great Western Ry. Co. [7],
the court excluded evidence of moneys received under a policy of accident
insurance, on the ground concisely stated by Pigott, B. in these words:

He does not receive that sum of money
because of the accident, but because he has made a contract providing for the
contingency; an accident must occur to entitle him to it, but it is not the
accident, but his contract, which is the cause of his receiving it.

[Page 228]

A different rule in death cases was first
applied by Lord Campbell in Hicks v. Newport, etc., Ry. Co. [8], where he directed the jury to deduct from the aggregate sum found
the amount of accident insurance accruing to the persons claiming. In Grand
Trunk Ry. Co. v. Jennings [9], a further
distinction was recognized between life and accident insurance, and it was held
that the former should be regarded only to the extent that its payment may have
been accelerated. This seems to rest on the view that the benefit of the
accident insurance was a legal consequence of the act of the wrongdoer, that as
death might never happen from accident, the act brought about, in a legal
sense, not only the loss but the mitigation; but that in an insurance against
death alone, only time separates the beneficiary from the benefit. The ruling
as to accident insurance has been superseded, however, by an amendment to the
English Act passed in 1908.

The question, then, is whether the rule applies
to such a right as that to compensation under the Workmen’s Act, and in my
opinion it does not.

Section 11 of that Act is as follows:

11. (1) Where an accident happens to a
workman in the course of his employment in such circumstances as entitle him or
his dependents to an action against some person other than his employer, the
workman or his dependents, if entitled to compensation under this Part, may
claim such compensation or may bring such action.

(2) If the workman or his dependents bring
such action and less is recovered and collected than the amount of the
compensation to which the workman or dependents would be entitled under this
Part, the workman or dependents shall be entitled to compensation under this
Part to the extent of the amount of the difference.

(3) If any such workman or dependent makes
an application to the Board claiming compensation under this Part, the Board
shall be subrogated to the rights of the workman or dependent as against such
other person for the whole or any outstanding part of the claim of the workman
or dependent against such other person.

(4) In any case within the provisions of
subsection (1), neither the workman nor his dependents nor the employer of the
workman shall have any right of action in respect of the accident against an
employer in any industry within the scope of this Part; and in any such case
where it appears to the satisfaction of the Board that a workman of an employer
in any class is injured owing to the negligence of an employer or of the
workman of an employer in another class within the scope of this Part, the
Board may direct that the compensation awarded in such case shall be charged
against the last-mentioned class.

[Page 229]

It will be seen that the section deals
specifically with the right of dependents under the Families’ Act so as to
create in effect a quasi indemnity and to subrogate the Board to the
rights of the dependents when they have accepted compensation. But it is
obvious that if such moneys can be deducted from the amount recoverable on the
tort, the subrogation would be nullified. It would in fact reverse the plain
purpose of the section and place upon the compensation fund pro tanto a
primary liability. In the result, the Board at most would be entitled only to
the excess of the claim against the wrongdoer over the compensation, the
portion which equitably belongs to the dependents. The intention is clearly to
preserve in full the cause of action, including damages, against the wrongdoer
and to create a legal right in the Board to enforce it in the name of the dependents
for the benefit of the compensation fund. Now the insurances held deductible
were absolute in obligation; but the section, by importing that quality of
indemnity, invests the right to compensation with a character outside of the
category of benefits within the rule.

The Board is a co-petitioner and the judgment
provides for the payment to it of the moneys recovered for the benefit of the
widow. In the case of the child, the direction is to pay the sum recovered into
Court with liberty to the Board to apply for a declaration of interest.

The effect of the statutory subrogation, a
matter solely between the dependent and the Board, is to constitute the
dependent a trustee of the right of action for the Board. The petitioners are,
therefore, trustee and cestui que trust.

Whether or not that relationship raises in the
Board an equitable right against the Crown, I do not find necessary to decide.
The defence in this respect alleges simply that the Workman’s Act is not
applicable to the Crown, and that the Board “can acquire no right of action
against the respondent by subrogation under the said Act”, which I take to mean
can create no legal right and to deny the competency of provincial legislation
to affect a claim against the Crown given by a Dominion Act. But that leaves
untouched the question whether the Crown is bound to recognize the beneficial
ownership of such a claim. There

[Page 230]

is no doubt that many petitions of right have
been presented and determined in chancery without challenge to the jurisdiction
of the court to entertain them. The consideration that the remedies used by
equity to enforce its decrees could not, by their nature, operate against the
Crown is not present in a relation which permits the coercion of the court to
be exercised upon a private person. The question is examined in chapter 11 of
Clode on Petition of Right, where the instances in which petitions have been
actually dealt with are enumerated. In an analogous case, In re Rolt [10], the petitioners were
the assignees of a bankrupt contractor with the Crown, and I see no ground in
principle why an interest of this nature should not be admitted against the
Crown where it can be made effectual by a remedy operating upon the trustee: The
Queen v. Smith [11],
Strong J., at p. 66:

Had the proof borne out this case, and had
it appeared that the assignment was so limited, the suppliants would have been
undoubtedly entitled to recover in respect of work actually performed by the
original contractors, for such an equitable assignment would have been entirely
free from objection, either upon the general law, or upon any provision
contained in the contract, and the record would have been properly framed for
relief upon such a state of facts.

Its convenience is obvious; to the Crown, the
result is indifferent; it conforms to the equitable rule of concluding all
features of. a controversy in the one proceeding; and it secures the interest
of a semi-public body.

I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with
costs.

Kellock J.—The contention of the Crown is that the dependents of the
deceased, being entitled to compensation under the Workmen’s Compensation
Act, have no right of action under section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court
Act, and alternatively, have no claim except to the extent that the amount
awarded under the Compensation Act has not fully compensated them in respect of
their claim under the Families’ Compensation Act. It is further
submitted in any event that the respondent Board has no claim at all under
section 19(c) and that the Workmen’s Compensation Act is ineffective to
give it any.

[Page 231]

It is, of course, well settled that the damage
awarded under statutes of the nature of the Families’ Compensation Act are
limited to the pecuniary benefit which the dependents might reasonably have expected
from the continuance of the life of the deceased. By reason of the provisions
of section 19(c), the Crown becomes liable to pay such damages when the death
has been caused in circumstances such as are here admittedly present.

Turning to the Workmen’s Compensation Act, section
11 is as follows:

(1) Where an accident happens to a workman
in the course of his employment in such circumstances as entitle him or his
dependents to an action against some person other than his employer, the
workman or his dependents, if entitled to compensation under this Part, may
claim such compensation or may bring such action.

(2) If the workman or his dependents bring
such action and less is recovered and collected than the amount of the
compensation to which the workman or dependents would be entitled under this
Part, the workman or dependents shall be entitled to compensation under this
Part to the extent of the amount of the difference.

(3) If any such workman or dependent makes
an application to the Board claiming compensation under this Part, the Board
shall be subrogated to the rights of the workman or dependent as against such
other person for the whole or any outstanding part of the claim of the workman
or dependent against such other person.

It is the submission of the Crown that the
compensation provided by the above section is full compensation equivalent by
the law of the province to the pecuniary value of the support the widow and her
son would have received from the deceased and that consequently no loss has been
sustained. The Crown further says that if the award is not by law full
compensation, the Crown is liable only for any deficiency. The contention in
effect is that the provision by way of Workmen’s Compensation operates in ease
of the tort-feasor. The Crown further says that section 11(3) cannot confer any
right upon the respondents as against the Crown.

It is said in answer by the respondents that
while it is true that provincial legislation may not bind the Crown in the
right of the Dominion ex proprio vigore, nonetheless the Crown may not
take the benefit of the provisions entitling the dependents to compensation
without reference

[Page 232]

to the terms upon which compensation is awarded,
namely, the statutory subrogation of the Board to the rights of the dependents
as against the wrong-doer.

It is said that where statutory rights are in
question, as distinct from common law rights, Crooke’s Case [12] is authority for the
view that if the Crown, in order to establish rights it claims, must invoke the
very statute which conditions those rights, the Crown is bound by the
derogation, and reference is made to Re Excelsior Electric Dairy Machinery
Ltd. [13]
and to Attorney General for British Columbia v. Royal Bank of Canada [14], per Macdonald, J. A.,
at 294 and 297.

I do not find it necessary to pass upon the
soundness of this contention, as I think the respondents are entitled to
succeed upon the basis of their further contention, namely, that the relevant
sections of the Workmen’s Compensation Act are to be construed as
affecting inter se the rights of the dependents and the Board only; Toronto
Railway Company v. Hutton [15];
and has no effect upon the liability of the Crown under section 19(c) to the
person injured or his dependents.

In Workmen’s Compensation Board v. Canadian
Pacific Railway Co. [16],
it was held that the rights given by section 8 of the then Act, 6 Geo. V, Cap.
77, constituted a statutory contract made with the workman for his benefit and
for the benefit of members of his family dependent upon him. I think the
principle of this decision is not limited to a case within section 8 where the
accident happens outside the province, but applies equally to cases in which
the accident takes place within the province. The relevant provisions of the
statute here in question, R.S.B.C, cap. 312, are not materially different from
the Act of 1916.

Hutton’s case[17] was decided under the Ontario statute of which the corresponding
provisions are not in essence dissimilar from those of the British Columbia statute. It was held in
that case that an election to claim compensation under the Act did not bar the
claim of the injured workman against the tort-feasor. In the language of

[Page 233]

Mignault J., with whom the Chief Justice and
Brodeur J. agreed, at p. 426, the subrogation effected by the statute “gives
the * * * Board the control of the action”, but does not divest the right of
action from the workman or his dependents. The main contention of the
appellant, therefore, in my opinion, fails.

The formal judgment directs recovery by both the
Board and Bessie May Snell, payment to be made to the Board. It is objected
that:

(a) the provincial legislation is
incompetent to give the Board any right of action in its own name against
appellant, and that,

(b) the assignment by Bessie May Snell to
the Board is equally ineffective, as the right of action is ex delicto and
therefore not the subject of assignment.

Mignault J., in dealing with a similar
contention in Hutton’s case (1), said at pp. 427-428:

* * * the appellant appears to me to be
without interest to complain of this modification of the judgment. By paying
the damages according to the judgment it will be discharged from any possible
claim either by the respondent or by the Board.

In the present case, as in Hutton’s case [18], the essential ground of the appeal and of
the defence to the action was that the election of the respondent Snell to
claim compensation barred the action. In my opinion, what happens with respect
to the proceeds of the judgment as between the respondents in view of the
discharge involved in payment, is a matter which, at this stage of the action,
does not concern the appellant.

I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

Solicitor for the appellant: F. P. Varcoe.

The King v. Raymond Quinton., [1947] S.C.R. 234

Date: 1947-04-18

His Majesty The
King Appellant;

and

Raymond Quinton
Respondent.

1947: Mar 13, 14; 1947: Apr 18

Present:—Rinfret CJ. and Kerwin, Taschereau,
Kellock and Estey JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO

Criminal law—Indictment for attempted
rape—Verdict of assault causing
bodily harm—Appellate court substituting conviction of common assault—Appeal to this Court by the Crown—Conviction to be changed to that of indecent assault—Conviction for
“included” offences under section 951 Cr. C—Sections 72, 292(c), 800, 1016 Cr. C.

A jury, upon an indictment for attempted
rape, returned a verdict of assault upon a female, causing actual bodily harm.
Upon an appeal by the accused, the Court of Appeal held that an indictment for
attempted rape did not include the offence for which he was found guilty, and
the Court then substituted a conviction for common assault. The Crown appealed
to this Court, asking that the substituted conviction be changed to that of
indecent assault.

Held that the
appeal should be dismissed.

Per the Chief
Justice and Kerwin, Kellock and Estey JJ.:—The offence of indecent assault may
be included in a count of attempted rape under section 951 Cr. C; but, in this
case, it was not open to the appellate court, in view of the finding of the
jury, to substitute a conviction of indecent assault.

Per The Chief
Justice and Estey JJ.:—The jury, in finding the accused not guilty as charged
on the count of attempted rape, negatived the existence of the element of
indecency and in effect found the accused not guilty of indecent assault.
Therefore, the appellate court, so far as substituting one conviction for
another under section 1016 (2) Cr. C, had no other course open to it than to
substitute that of common assault.

Per Kerwin and
Kellock JJ.:—Section 1016 (2) Cr. C. requires it to appear to the Court of
Appeal on the actual finding that the jury “must” have been satisfied of facts
which proved the respondent guilty of indecent assault.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1947] O.R.
1) affirmed.

APPEAL by the Crown, upon leave to appeal
granted under section 1025 Cr. C, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, allowing in part an appeal by the respondent from a conviction of
having committed an assault upon a female causing bodily harm and substituting
a conviction of common assault.

W. B. Common K.C. for the appellant.

Vera L. Parsons K.C. for the respondent.

[Page 235]

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Estey
J. was delivered by

Estey J.:—The accused was indicted for attempted rape under section 300 of
the Criminal Code. The learned trial judge instructed the jury that included in
the count of attempted rape were the other offences of indecent assault,
assault on a female occasioning actual bodily harm (sec. 292(c)), and common
assault.

The jury returned a verdict of assault on a
female occasioning actual bodily harm.

Upon an appeal by the accused the appellate
court in Ontario held that an
indictment for attempted rape did not include the offence of assault on a
female occasioning actual bodily harm within the meaning of section 951. The
learned judges of that court then substituted under sec. 1016(2) a verdict of
common assault and imposed sentence of one year in reformatory.

The accused does not appeal but the Crown
appeals to this court and asks that the substituted verdict of common assault
be changed to that of indecent assault.

Leave to appeal was granted to the Crown on the
basis that Rex v. Stewart (1) in which the Appellate Division in
Alberta held that the offence of indecent assault is by virtue of the
provisions of section 951 included in a count of attempted rape and, therefore,
is in conflict with the decision of the appellate court of Ontario in this
case.

The commission of the offence of rape includes
an act of indecency, as stated by my Lord the Chief Justice in Wright v.
The King 2:

No doubt in a crime such as the one (rape)
under consideration, the initial step might be stated to be an indecent
assault, followed by the subsequent step which might be described as an attempt
to rape * * *

Section 72 of the Criminal Code defines an
attempt:

Every one who, having an intent to commit
an offence, does or omits an act for the purpose of accomplishing his object,
is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence intended whether under the
circumstances it was possible to commit such offence or not.

This section requires that one to be guilty of
an attempt must intend to commit the completed offence and to have done some
act toward the accomplishment of that

[Page 236]

objective. That act must be beyond preparation
and go so far toward the commission of the completed offence that but for some
intervention he is prevented or desists from the completion thereof.

Acts remotely leading towards the
commission of the offence are not to be considered as attempts to commit it but
acts immediately connected with it are. Parke B. in Reg. v. Eagleton3,
quoted by Lord Reading C.J. in Rex v. Robinson 4.

It is the existence of both the intent and the
act in such a relationship that the former may be regarded as the cause of the
latter. The intent unaccompanied by the act does not constitute a criminal
offence.

In the early case of Rex v. Scofield 5,
Lord Mansfield stated at p. 403:

So long as an act rests in bare intention,
it is not punishable by our laws: but immediately when an act is done, the law
judges, not only of the act done, but of the intent with which it is done; and,
if it is coupled with an unlawful and malicious intent, though the act itself
would otherwise have been innocent, the intent being criminal, the act becomes
criminal and punishable.

This case is commented upon in Broom’s Legal
Maxims, 6th Ed. p. 305:

It is a rule, laid down by Lord Mansfield,
and which has been said to comprise all the principles of previous decisions
upon this subject, that so long as an act rests in bare intention, it is not
punishable by our laws; but when an act is done, the law judges not only of the
act itself, but of the intent with which it was done; and if the act be coupled
with an unlawful and malicious intent, though in itself the act would otherwise
have been innocent, yet, the intent being criminal, the act likewise becomes
criminal and punishable.

It appears from the foregoing that the intent
may determine the criminal quality of the act. There is present in the offence
of rape the intent to commit an indecent act. The same intent is required in
the offence of attempted rape. In the latter that intent may be found from the
nature of the act or from the conduct of the accused immediately associated
with the commission of that act or indeed both. If such an intent be not
present the offence of attempted rape is not committed. The act cannot be dissociated
from the intent as evidence which caused the accused to do such act.

[Page 237]

In Rex v. Louie Chong6,
the magistrate found the accused guilty of indecent assault and stated a case
for the opinion of the appellate division in Ontario as to whether he was justified in finding the accused guilty of
indecent assault, where the accused in taking hold of the girl did so in a
manner that did not import indecency. At the same time, however, he offered her
money to go with him for an immoral purpose. The judgment of the court written
by Middleton J. affirmed the magistrate’s conviction. His Lordship in
delivering the judgment stated:

It appears to me that an act in itself
ambiguous may be interpreted by the surrounding circumstances and by words
spoken at the time the act is committed * * *. It is in each case a question of
fact whether the thing which was done, in the circumstances in which it was
done, was done indecently. If it was, an indecent assault has been committed.

His spoken words which were part of his conduct
evidenced the intention of the accused and determined the criminal quality of
his act.

It would, therefore, appear that a count
charging an attempt to commit rape would include the offence of indecent
assault under section 951.

Though the offence of indecent assault is
included in a count of attempted rape under section 951 it was not in this
case, because of the finding of the jury, open to the appellate court to
substitute a verdict of indecent assault. Section 951 provides that the

accused may be convicted of any offence so
included which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not proved * *
*

The learned trial judge explained to the jury
the ingredients essential to find the accused guilty upon one or other of the
four counts. Those of attempted rape and indecent assault require a finding of
indecency, while that of actual bodily harm to a female does not. The jury in
finding the accused not guilty as charged on the count of attempted rape
negatived the existence of the element of indecency and, therefore, in effect
found the accused not guilty of indecent assault.

Where an indictment contained three counts: (1)
that the accused did unlawfully kill, under section 268; (2) grievous bodily
harm, sec. 284; and (3) wanton or furious

[Page 238]

driving, sec. 285, the jury found the accused
guilty of wanton or furious driving. Chief Justice Anglin stated at p. 47:

In a case such as that at bar, that the
jury had found that neither the whole offence charged in count No. 1 nor the
whole offence charged in count No. 2 had been proved, is an intendment which we
must make in support of the verdict.

And at p. 48:

It was within the province of the jury to
find that the offence charged in the third count was satisfactorily proven, but
that, for reasons which we can only surmise and as to the validity or the
adequacy of which we are not at liberty to inquire some essential element of
each of the offences charged in the first and second counts respectively was,
in their view, not established beyond reasonable doubt. Barton v. The
King7.

The jury in finding the accused guilty of
assault occasioning actual bodily harm to a female negatived the existence of
the element of indecency essential to the finding of a verdict of indecent
assault. Therefore, the appellate court could not conclude “that the jury * * *
must have been satisfied of the facts which proved him guilty of” indecent
assault as required by section 1016(2) before it can substitute a verdict of
guilty of that other offence. Rex v. Hayes and Pallante8;
Rex v. Collins9.

In a case where the accused was found guilty of
murder this court so satisfied was in a position to and did reduce the verdict
to one of manslaughter. At p. 350 Chief Justice Duff:

The finding makes it clear that the jury
must have been satisfied of the facts necessary to constitute manslaughter, and
we are, consequently, of opinion that the Court of Appeal would have authority
under s. 1016 to substitute a verdict of manslaughter for the verdict of the
jury and to pronounce sentence upon the prisoner. Rex v. Hopper10;
Manchuk v. The King11.

The learned judges in the appellate court,
because of the verdict of the jury, so far as substituting one verdict for
another under section 1016(2), had no other course open to them than to substitute
that of common assault.

The appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 239]

The judgment of Kerwin and Kellock J.J. was delivered by

Kellock J.:—This is an appeal by the Attorney General of Ontario, pursuant to
leave granted under section 1025 (1) of
the Criminal Code, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dated December 13, 1946.

The present respondent was charged with
attempted rape and on his trial before Schroeder J. and a jury was convicted of “assault upon a female
occasioning actual bodily harm”. The learned trial judge had charged the jury
that they might convict as charged, or of indecent assault, or assault upon a
female occasioning actual bodily harm or common assault or not guilty.

The respondent appealed in writing to the Court
of Appeal and on the hearing of the appeal the court raised the question
whether it was competent for the jury to return the verdict they had returned.
It was held that such a verdict was not open to the jury and the court
substituted a conviction of common assault, being of opinion that the jury by
their verdict, in view of the learned judge’s charge, had negatived indecent
assault. Roach J.A., who
delivered the judgment of the court, expressed disagreement with the decision
of the appellate division of Alberta in Rex v. Stewart12, by which it was held that, on a
charge of attempting to have carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of
fourteen, the accused might be convicted of indecent assault, under section 951 (1).

The Attorney General now appeals on the ground
that the Court of Appeal was in error in holding that indecent assault is not
an included offence in a charge of attempted rape. He asks that a conviction
for indecent assault be substituted. We are not called upon otherwise to
consider the judgment in appeal. Counsel for the respondent agrees with the
submission of the appellant that the Court of Appeal was in error in the view
taken with respect to indecent assault being included in the charge of the
indictment here in question.

If common assault be an included offence in a
charge of attempted rape as held by the Court of Appeal, and there can be no
question but that such an assault would

[Page 240]

be an act within section 72, then such an act,
though in itself ambiguous, may, interpreted by the surrounding circumstances,
including words spoken at the time, amount to indecent assault; Rex v. Louie
Chong13. It is not necessary that the act
constituting the assault be in itself indecent in its nature. If the assault,
coupled with the intention required by section 72, is of such a nature as to
constitute an attempt within the rule as laid down in Rex v. Robinson14,
such assault must necessarily be indecent; Rex v. Louie Chong13.
In other words, the crime of attempted rape progresses from assault through indecent
assault to the complete crime. If the facts of the suppositious case referred
to by Roach J.A. amount to the offence of attempted rape, the assault itself
necessarily becomes indecent. This would appear to have been the view of the
majority in Wright v. The King15.

However, I agree with the Court of Appeal in the
view that it was not open to that court, in view of the learned trial judge’s
charge and the verdict of the jury, to substitute a conviction for indecent
assault. Section 1016 (2) requires it to appear to the Court of Appeal on the
actual finding that the jury “must” have been satisfied of facts which proved
the respondent guilty of indecent asault. The highest that Mr. Common puts his
argument, and properly so, is that:

It is quite possible that the jury might be
under the erroneous impression that a conviction for assault occasioning actual
bodily harm on a female was more serious than that of indecent assault.

That is not sufficient. I do not think that the
Court of Appeal were required, in the circumstances here present, to come to
the conclusion the statute requires.

I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

Taschereau J.:—I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

Present: Mr. Justice Taschereau in Chambers.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Accused convicted of murder—New
trial ordered by appellate court—Misdirection—Wrongful admission of statements
by accused—Alleged conflict of decisions on latter ground—Accused still
entitled to new trial on ground of misdirection—Section 1025, Cr. C.

The respondent, convicted of murder, appealed
to the Court of Appeal, which, by an unanimous judgment, granted a new trial on
two grounds: misdirection by the trial judge and statements by the respondent,
while in custody, wrongly admitted in evidence. On a petition by the Crown for
leave to appeal to this Court under section 1925 Cr. C.

Held that the
application should be refused.—Even if the Crown had shown that the judgment to
be appealed from, on the question of admissibility of the alleged confessions,
conflicted with the judgment of any other court of appeal, and this Court came
to the conclusion that the Court of Appeal were wrong, the respondent would
still be entitled to a new trial on the ground of misdirection by the trial
judge, on which point no conflict had been shown. Ouvrard v. Quebec
Paper Box Co. Ltd. ([1945] S.C.R. 1) approved.

[Page 212]

MOTION by the Crown, before the Honourable
Mr. Justice Taschereau in Chambers, for leave to appeal to this Court under
section 1025 Cr. C. from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
granting a new trial to the respondent[1].

W.B. Common K.C. and C.R. Magone K.C. for
the motion.

J.J. Robinette K.C. contra.

TASCHEREAU J.:—The respondent was convicted of
murder and sentenced to hang, at the Assizes at Hamilton on the 16th of
October, 1946.

She appealed to the Court of Appeal of Ontario,
and a new trial was granted on two grounds, (1) that the learned trial judge
made errors of non-direction and misdirection in his charge to the jury and (2)
that certain statements alleged to have been made by the respondent to police
officers, while in custody, had been wrongly admitted in evidence against her.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario
having been unanimous[2], the
Crown now asks for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada under
section 1025 of the Criminal Code. It is of course necessary, before I
grant leave, that I should be satisfied that the judgment of the Court of
Appeal conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case.
If such a conflict cannot be found, it is not within my jurisdiction to grant
such a leave.

Counsel for the appellant have cited many
judgments and endeavoured to show that the ruling of the Court of Appeal on the
admissibility of the confessions, conflicts with the views adopted by other
courts of appeal. No judgments of other courts of appeal have been cited that
would conflict with the Court of Appeal of Ontario, on the point that there was
non‑direction and misdirection by the trial judge, in his charge to the
jury.

I am of opinion that this application must be
refused.

By the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal
the respondent has obtained a new trial on two grounds. Even

[Page 213]

if a conflict could be found on the question of
the admissibility of confessions, and this Court came to the conclusion that
the Court of Appeal were wrong, the respondent would still be entitled to a new
trial on the ground of misdirection. In any event, the appeal of the Crown is
bound to be dismissed, and it is not the function of this Court to give
advisory opinions on matters which cannot affect the final outcome of the
appeal.

Even if I had any doubts on the matter, they
would be cleared by the recent decision of this Court in the case of Ouvrard
v. Quebec Paper Box Co. Ltd.[3] where,
speaking for the Court, my Lord the Chief Justice said:

The appellant, in view of the fact that
there has been no dissent and that no conflict is alleged, is unable to ask
this Court to reverse the judgment of the court of appeal on this fundamental
question, and it means, therefore, that, even assuming there is a conflict on
the other points raised in the appeal and even if he should succeed in getting
this Court to reverse the judgment of the court of appeal on these other
points, the respondent would, nevertheless, remain acquitted. The appeal would
be devoid of any possible practical result and the Court would be asked only to
pass upon an academic question.

The application is dismissed.

Leave to appeal refused.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Indictment for attempted rape—Verdict
of assault causing bodily harm—Appellate court substituting conviction of
common assault—Appeal to this Court by the Crown—Conviction to be changed to
that of indecent assault—Conviction for “included” offences under section 951
Cr. C.—Sections 72, 292(c), 300, 1016 Cr. C.

A jury, upon an indictment for attempted
rape, returned a verdict of assault upon a female, causing actual bodily harm.
Upon an appeal by the accused, the Court of Appeal held that an indictment for
attempted rape did not include the offence for which he was found guilty, and
the Court then substituted a conviction for common assault. The Crown appealed
to this Court, asking that the substituted conviction be changed to that of
indecent assault.

Held that the
appeal should be dismissed.

Per the Chief
Justice and Kerwin, Kellock and Estey JJ.:—The offence of indecent assault may
be included in a count of attempted rape under section 951 Cr. C.; but, in this
case, it was not open to the appellate court, in view of the finding of the
jury, to substitute a conviction of indecent assault.

Per The Chief
Justice and Estey JJ.:—The jury, in finding the accused not guilty as charged
on the count of attempted rape, negatived the existence of the element of
indecency and in effect found the accused not guilty of indecent assault.
Therefore, the appellate court, so far as substituting one conviction for
another under section 1016 (2) Cr. C., had no other course open to it than to
substitute that of common assault.

Per Kerwin and
Kellock JJ.:—Section 1016 (2) Cr. C. requires it to appear to the Court of
Appeal on the actual finding that the jury “must” have been satisfied of facts
which proved the respondent guilty of indecent assault.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1947] O.R.
1) affirmed.

APPEAL by the Crown, upon leave to appeal
granted under section 1025 Cr. C., from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario[1],
allowing in part an appeal by the respondent from a conviction of having
committed an assault upon a female causing bodily harm and substituting a
conviction of common assault.

W.B. Common K.C. for the appellant.

Vera L. Parsons K.C. for the respondent.

[Page 235]

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Estey
J. was delivered by

ESTEY J.:—The accused was indicted for attempted
rape under section 300 of the Criminal Code. The learned trial judge instructed
the jury that included in the count of attempted rape were the other offences
of indecent assault, assault on a female occasioning actual bodily harm (sec.
292(c)), and common assault.

The jury returned a verdict of assault on a
female occasioning actual bodily harm.

Upon an appeal by the accused the appellate
court in Ontario held that an indictment for attempted rape did not include the
offence of assault on a female occasioning actual bodily harm within the
meaning of section 951. The learned judges of that court then substituted under
sec. 1016(2) a verdict of common assault and imposed sentence of one year in
reformatory.

The accused does not appeal but the Crown
appeals to this court and asks that the substituted verdict of common assault
be changed to that of indecent assault.

Leave to appeal was granted to the Crown on the basis
that Rex v. Stewart[2] in
which the Appellate Division in Alberta held that the offence of indecent
assault is by virtue of the provisions of section 951 included in a count of
attempted rape and, therefore, is in conflict with the decision of the appellate
court of Ontario in this case.

The commission of the offence of rape includes
an act of indecency, as stated by my Lord the Chief Justice in Wright v. The
King[3]:

No doubt in a crime such as the one (rape)
under consideration, the initial step might be stated to be an indecent
assault, followed by the subsequent step which might be described as an attempt
to rape * * * 

Section 72 of the Criminal Code defines an
attempt:

Every one who, having an intent to commit
an offence, does or omits an act for the purpose of accomplishing his object,
is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence intended whether under the
circumstances it was possible to commit such offence or not.

This section requires that one to be guilty of
an attempt must intend to commit the completed offence and to have done some
act toward the accomplishment of that

[Page 236]

objective. That act must be beyond preparation
and go so far toward the commission of the completed offence that but for some
intervention he is prevented or desists from the completion thereof.

Acts remotely leading towards the
commission of the offence are not to be considered as attempts to commit it but
acts immediately connected with it are. Parke B. in Reg. v. Eagleton[4], quoted by Lord Reading C.J. in Rex v. Robinson[5].

It is the existence of both the intent and the
act in such a relationship that the former may be regarded as the cause of the
latter. The intent unaccompanied by the act does not constitute a criminal
offence.

In the early case of Rex v. Scofield[6], Lord Mansfield stated at p. 403:

So long as an act rests in bare intention,
it is not punishable by our laws: but immediately when an act is done, the law
judges, not only of the act done, but of the intent with which it is done; and,
if it is coupled with an unlawful and malicious intent, though the act itself
would otherwise have been innocent, the intent being criminal, the act becomes
criminal and punishable.

This case is commented upon in Broom’s Legal
Maxims, 6th Ed. p. 305:

It is a rule, laid down by Lord Mansfield,
and which has been said to comprise all the principles of previous decisions
upon this subject, that so long as an act rests in bare intention, it is not
punishable by our laws; but when an act is done, the law judges not only of the
act itself, but of the intent with which it was done; and if the act be coupled
with an unlawful and malicious intent, though in itself the act would otherwise
have been innocent, yet, the intent being criminal, the act likewise becomes
criminal and punishable.

It appears from the foregoing that the intent
may determine the criminal quality of the act. There is present in the offence
of rape the intent to commit an indecent act. The same intent is required in
the offence of attempted rape. In the latter that intent may be found from the
nature of the act or from the conduct of the accused immediately associated
with the commission of that act or indeed both. If such an intent be not
present the offence of attempted rape is not committed. The act cannot be
dissociated from the intent as evidence which caused the accused to do such
act.

[Page 237]

In Rex v. Louie Chong[7], the magistrate found the accused guilty of
indecent assault and stated a case for the opinion of the appellate division in
Ontario as to whether he was justified in finding the accused guilty of
indecent assault, where the accused in taking hold of the girl did so in a
manner that did not import indecency. At the same time, however, he offered her
money to go with him for an immoral purpose. The judgment of the court written
by Middleton J. affirmed the magistrate’s conviction. His Lordship in
delivering the judgment stated:

It appears to me that an act in itself
ambiguous may be interpreted by the surrounding circumstances and by words
spoken at the time the act is committed * * *. It is in each
case a question of fact whether the thing which was done, in the circumstances
in which it was done, was done indecently. If it was, an indecent assault has
been committed.

His spoken words which were part of his conduct
evidenced the intention of the accused and determined the criminal quality of
his act.

It would, therefore, appear that a count
charging an attempt to commit rape would include the offence of indecent
assault under section 951.

Though the offence of indecent assault is
included in a count of attempted rape under section 951 it was not in this
case, because of the finding of the jury, open to the appellate court to
substitute a verdict of indecent assault. Section 951 provides that the

accused may be convicted of any offence so
included which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not
proved * * * 

The learned trial judge explained to the jury
the ingredients essential to find the accused guilty upon one or other of the
four counts. Those of attempted rape and indecent assault require a finding of
indecency, while that of actual bodily harm to a female does not. The jury in
finding the accused not guilty as charged on the count of attempted rape
negatived the existence of the element of indecency and, therefore, in effect
found the accused not guilty of indecent assault.

Where an indictment contained three counts:1
that the accused did unlawfully kill, under section 268; (2) grievous bodily
harm, sec. 284; and (3) wanton or furious

[Page 238]

driving, sec. 285, the jury found the accused
guilty of wanton or furious driving. Chief Justice Anglin stated at p. 47:

In a case such as that at bar, that the
jury had found that neither the whole offence charged in count No. 1 nor the
whole offence charged in count No. 2 had been proved, is an intendment which we
must make in support of the verdict.

And at p. 48:

It was within the province of the jury to
find that the offence charged in the third count was satisfactorily proven, but
that, for reasons which we can only surmise and as to the validity or the
adequacy of which we are not at liberty to inquire some essential element of
each of the offences charged in the first and second counts respectively was,
in their view, not established beyond reasonable doubt. Barton v. The King[8].

The jury in finding the accused guilty of
assault occasioning actual bodily harm to a female negatived the existence of
the element of indecency essential to the finding of a verdict of indecent
assault. Therefore, the appellate court could not conclude “that the
jury * * * must have been satisfied of the facts which
proved him guilty of” indecent assault as required by section 1016(2) before it
can substitute a verdict of guilty of that other offence. Rex v. Hayes and
Pallante[9]; Rex
v. Collins[10].

In a case where the accused was found guilty of
murder this court so satisfied was in a position to and did reduce the verdict
to one of manslaughter. At p. 350 Chief Justice Duff:

The finding makes it clear that the jury
must have been satisfied of the facts necessary to constitute manslaughter, and
we are, consequently, of opinion that the Court of Appeal would have authority
under s. 1016 to substitute a verdict of manslaughter for the verdict of the
jury and to pronounce sentence upon the prisoner. Rex v. Hopper[11]; Manchuk v. The King[12].

The learned judges in the appellate court,
because of the verdict of the jury, so far as substituting one verdict for
another under section 1016(2), had no other course open to them than to
substitute that of common assault.

The appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 239]

The judgment of Kerwin and Kellock J.J. was
delivered by

KELLOCK J.:—This is an appeal by the Attorney
General of Ontario, pursuant to leave granted under section 1025 (1) of the
Criminal Code, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dated
December 13, 1946.

The present respondent was charged with
attempted rape and on his trial before Schroeder J. and a jury was convicted of
“assault upon a female occasioning actual bodily harm”. The learned trial judge
had charged the jury that they might convict as charged, or of indecent
assault, or assault upon a female occasioning actual bodily harm or common
assault or not guilty.

The respondent appealed in writing to the Court
of Appeal and on the hearing of the appeal the court raised the question
whether it was competent for the jury to return the verdict they had returned.
It was held that such a verdict was not open to the jury and the court
substituted a conviction of common assault, being of opinion that the jury by
their verdict, in view of the learned judge’s charge, had negatived indecent
assault. Roach J.A., who delivered the judgment of the court, expressed
disagreement with the decision of the appellate division of Alberta in Rex v.
Stewart[13], by
which it was held that, on a charge of attempting to have carnal knowledge of a
girl under the age of fourteen, the accused might be convicted of indecent
assault, under section 95113.

The Attorney General now appeals on the ground
that the Court of Appeal was in error in holding that indecent assault is not
an included offence in a charge of attempted rape. He asks that a conviction
for indecent assault be substituted. We are not called upon otherwise to
consider the judgment in appeal. Counsel for the respondent agrees with the
submission of the appellant that the Court of Appeal was in error in the view
taken with respect to indecent assault being included in the charge of the
indictment here in question.

If common assault be an included offence in a
charge of attempted rape as held by the Court of Appeal, and there can be no
question but that such an assault would

[Page 240]

be an act within section 72, then such an act,
though in itself ambiguous, may, interpreted by the surrounding circumstances,
including words spoken at the time, amount to indecent assault; Rex v. Louie
Chong[14]. It is
not necessary that the act constituting the assault be in itself indecent in
its nature. If the assault, coupled with the intention required by section 72,
is of such a nature as to constitute an attempt within the rule as laid down in
Rex v. Robinson[15], such
assault must necessarily be indecent; Rex v. Louie Chong14.
In other words, the crime of attempted rape progresses from assault through
indecent assault to the complete crime. If the facts of the suppositious case
referred to by Roach J.A. amount to the offence of attempted rape, the assault
itself necessarily becomes indecent. This would appear to have been the view of
the majority in Wright v. The King[16].

However, I agree with the Court of Appeal in the
view that it was not open to that court, in view of the learned trial judge’s
charge and the verdict of the jury, to substitute a conviction for indecent
assault. Section 101615 requires it to appear to the Court of Appeal
on the actual finding that the jury “must” have been satisfied of facts which
proved the respondent guilty of indecent asault. The highest that Mr. Common
puts his argument, and properly so, is that:

It is quite possible that the jury might be
under the erroneous impression that a conviction for assault occasioning actual
bodily harm on a female was more serious than that of indecent assault.

That is not sufficient. I do not think that the
Court of Appeal were required, in the circumstances here present, to come to
the conclusion the statute requires.

I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

TASCHEREAU J.:—I am of opinion that this appeal
should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Offence of indecent
assault—Judge sitting without a jury—Self-misdirection—Judge’s report—No
finding as to statements by complainant or accused—Acquittal based on evidence
of a witness—Reversal of acquittal by court of appeal—New
trial—Evidence—Witnesses—Credibility of—Application by court of appeal of
section 1014(2) Cr. C.—“No substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice”—Reasonable doubt as to guilt of accused—Whether verdict be the same if
proper self-direction by trial judge—Sections 1013(4), 1013(5) and 1014(2)
Cr. C.

The appellant was charged with the offence of
indecent assault upon C, alleged to have taken place at a dental clinic while C
was under examination. Complete discrepancy is disclosed between the testimony
of the complainant and that of the accused. A witness, B, working in the
clinic, gave evidence that he passed the open door of the room upon two
occasions, without stating the time and the intervals of time between them, and
that he had noticed that the accused was then writing at a table. The
magistrate acquitted the accused, and, in his judgment, said that the case was
one to be decided entirely on the credibility of the witnesses, that there
should be a conviction or a dismissal of the charge whether the evidence of the
complainant or that of the accused was accepted; and he added that, if the

[Page 269]

evidence of B was accepted, “there must be a
dismissal of the charge,” stating later that he was “bound in law to accept his
evidence”. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the Crown and directed
that the accused be retried upon the same charge. Upon an appeal by the accused
to this Court,

Held that the
judgment appealed from should be affirmed.

Per the Chief
Justice and Kellock and Estey JJ.:—The evidence of B does not go so far as to
contradict the evidence of the complainant nor corroborate the evidence of the
accused upon the points that are material to the determination of the issue;
and, even if B’s evidence was believed, it was still necessary for the
magistrate to consider all the evidence and the credibility and the weight to
be given to the statements made by the respective witnesses. The magistrate has
not considered the evidence upon any such basis, but rather has founded his
decision upon a misdirection that if B’s evidence was believed “there must be a
dismissal.” Comments as to the issue of credibility of witnesses.

Per Kerwin
J.:—The proposition upon which the magistrate proceeded cannot be supported: he
does not state whether he believed the evidence of the complainant or of the
accused, and, in proceeding to discuss the evidence of B apart from that of the
complainant and accused, he failed to perform the responsibility resting upon
him.

The appellant also contended that, under s.
1014(2) Cr. C, the Court of Appeal should have dismissed the appeal by the
Crown, as “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually
occurred”.

Per the Chief
Justice and Kellock and Estey JJ.:—The appellate court, when there has been no
decision arrived at upon a consideration of the evidence, particularly in a
case where the evidence is so restricted to a few facts and where any
adjudication must depend so largely upon the credibility and the weight to be
given to the evidence of the respective parties, is unable to conclude that,
under s. 1014(2) Cr. C., “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
actually occurred.”

Per Kerwin
J.:—The appellant’s claim should be dismissed. Effect must be given to the will
of Parliament in permitting appeals by the Crown from acquittals (s. 1013(4)
Cr. C.) and to the provisions of s. 1014(2) Cr. C. by which, according to s.
1013(5) Cr. C., the powers of a court of appeal are, mutatis mutandis, to
be similar to the powers given by the former. Applying those provisions to this
case, the proper rule to be followed by the Court of Appeal was that the onus
was on the Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would not necessarily
have been the same if the magistrate had properly directed himself. But,
without in any way weakening the salutary rule that an accused is entitled to
the benefit of a doubt as to his guilt, when a court of appeal has to apply the
provisions of s. 1014(2) Cr. C., it must be concluded in the present case that
the magistrate would not necessarily have acquitted the appellant if he had
given himself the proper direction.

Rex v. Covert
(28 C.C.C. 25), Rex v. Bourgeois (69 C.C.C. 120), Rex v.
Probe (79 C.C.C. 289) and Rex v. O’Leary (80 C.C.C. 327)

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario, allowing an appeal by the Attorney General for
Ontario against the acquittal by Magistrate James B. Garvin on a charge of
indecent assault and directing that the accused be retried upon the same
charge.

G. Arthur Martin K.C. for the appellant.

W.B. Common K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kellock
and Estey JJ. was delivered by

ESTEY J.—The magistrate found the accused not
guilty of the offence of indecent assault. The facts material to the offence
were deposed to by the complainant and contradicted by the accused. The
complainant stated that the offence took place at a dental clinic while she was
under an examination by the accused, a qualified dentist in the Dental Corps. A
witness Black gave evidence that he was at the time working in the same clinic
and that upon two occasions he passed the room where he saw the complainant and
the accused. The door of the room was open and upon each occasion he noticed
that the accused was writing at a table. Just when or at what intervals of time
he passed the room is not disclosed, nor does the evidence disclose either the
plan or size of the clinic.

At the conclusion of the hearing the magistrate
reserved judgment and later acquitted the accused, his judgment reading in part
as follows:

The case is one that must be decided
entirely on the credibility of the witnesses. If the evidence of the
complainant is accepted, there must be a conviction. On the other hand, if the
evidence of the accused is accepted, there must be a dismissal of the charge.
Also, in my judgment, if the evidence of the witness Black is accepted, there
must be a dismissal.

An examination of the evidence of the witness
Black, while relevant in determining the credibility of both the complainant
and the accused, is upon the main issue restricted to his observations upon two
occasions as he passed the door. It does not go so far as to contradict the
evidence of the complainant nor corroborate the evidence of the accused upon
the points that are material

[Page 271]

to the determination of the issue. If therefore
Black’s evidence was believed, it was still necessary for the magistrate to
consider all of the evidence, the credibility and the weight to be given to the
statements made by the respective witnesses and to determine whether the
accused was guilty or not guilty.

It is clear that the magistrate has not
considered the evidence upon any such basis but rather has founded his decision
upon a misdirection that if Black’s evidence was believed “there must be a
dismissal.”

The appellate court, when there has been no
decision arrived at upon a consideration of the evidence, particularly in a
case where the evidence is so restricted to a few facts and where any
adjudication must depend so largely upon the credibility and the weight to be
given to the evidence of the respective parties, is unable to conclude that
under section 1014(2) Cr. C. “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has actually occurred.”

It would appear also that the magistrate
misdirected himself relative to the determination of Black’s credibility. He
stated:

In my judgment the evidence of Black
substantially meets all the above tests and I feel that I am bound in law to
accept his evidence.

He based his statement upon Rex v. Covert[1]. In that case the accused was charged that
he did unlawfully keep intoxicating liquor in a place other than a dwelling
house. The prosecution adduced evidence that the accused had upon his premises
a bar or a counter and was in possession of intoxicating liquor and then relied
upon the statutory provision that placed upon the accused the burden of proving
that he had not committed the offence. The accused in giving his evidence gave
an explanation which, if believed, discharged the statutory burden placed upon
him and entitled him to an acquittal. Notwithstanding this and apparently
without indicating a reason there for the magistrate found the accused guilty.
Mr. Justice Beck, with whom the majority of the court concurred, condemned
the decision which he described as made “arbitrarily and in disregard of the
evidence.” When the learned judge stated: “It cannot be said without limitation
that a judge

[Page 272]

can refuse to accept evidence,” he no doubt had
in mind the failure on the part of the magistrate to act judicially rather than
arbitrarily. Certainly the tests he suggests do not deprive the magistrate of
any of his powers but would rather seem to emphasize that he discharge his duty
and not only determine the question of credibility but indicate that he has
done so.

The issue of credibility is one of fact and
cannot be determined by following a set of rules that it is suggested have the
force of law and, in so far as the language of Mr. Justice Beck may be so
construed, it cannot be supported upon the authorities. Anglin J. (later Chief
Justice) in speaking of credibility stated:

by that I understand not merely the
appreciation of the witnesses’ desire to be truthful but also of their
opportunities of knowledge and powers of observation, judgment and memory—in a
word, the trustworthiness of their testimony, which may have depended very
largely on their demeanour in the witness box and their manner in giving
evidence. Reymond v. Township of Bosanquet[2].

The foregoing is a general statement and does
not purport to be exhaustive. Eminent judges have from time to time indicated
certain guides that have been of the greatest assistance, but so far as I have
been able to find there has never been an effort made to indicate all the
possible factors that might enter into the determination. It is a matter in
which so many human characteristics, both the strong and the weak, must be
taken into consideration. The general integrity and intelligence of the witness,
his powers to observe, his capacity to remember and his accuracy in statement
are important. It is also important to determine whether he is honestly
endeavouring to tell the truth, whether he is sincere and frank or whether he
is biassed, reticent and evasive. All these questions and others may be
answered from the observation of the witness’ general conduct and demeanour in
determining the question of credibility.

The judgment of the appellate court directing a
new trial should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed.

KERWIN J.—The appellant was acquitted by a
magistrate of a charge that he did unlawfully indecently assault one Emily
Cumming, a female, contrary to section 292

[Page 273]

of the Criminal Code. The Attorney General of
Ontario appealed to the Court of Appeal for that province against the acquittal
on the grounds that the magistrate misdirected himself in stating that he was
bound in law to accept the evidence of one Black, a witness at the trial, and
that the magistrate was wrong in coming to the conclusion that he could
exercise no discretion in weighing the credibility of that evidence. The Court
of Appeal allowed the appeal and directed that the accused be retried upon the
same charge.

In giving judgment, the magistrate said:

The case is one that must be decided
entirely on the credibility of the witnesses. If the evidence of the
complainant is accepted, there must be a conviction. On the other hand, if the
evidence of the accused is accepted, there must be a dismissal of the charge.
Also, in my judgment, if the evidence of the witness Black is accepted, there
must be a dismissal.

After stating that Black was to some extent an
independent witness and that if his evidence was to be accepted, he, the
magistrate, did not see how there could be a conviction, he continued:

I think the evidence of Black should be
examined having regard to the principle of law laid down in Rex v. Covert[3].

This was a judgment of Beck J. on behalf of the
majority in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and the
magistrate quoted therefrom the following paragraphs:

We are bound to presume the accused was
innocent, until proved guilty; he gave all the available evidence and that
evidence, if true, explained away the inference or presumption against him.

It will be objected, of course, that the
magistrate may have disbelieved entirely the evidence on behalf of the accused,
and that it was open to him to do so; but in my opinion it cannot be said
without limitation that a judge can refuse to accept evidence. I think he
cannot, if the following conditions are fulfilled:

(1) That the statements of the witness are
not in themselves improbable or unreasonable;

(2) That there is no contradiction of them;

(3) That the credibility of the witness has
not been attacked by evidence against his character;

(4) That nothing appears in the course of
his evidence or of the evidence of any other witness tending to throw discredit
upon him; and

(5) That there is nothing in his demeanour
while in Court during the trial to suggest untruthfulness.

[Page 274]

To permit a trial judge to refuse to accept
evidence given under all these conditions would be to permit him to determine
the dispute arbitrarily and in disregard of the evidence, which is surely not
the spirit of our system of jurisprudence.

The Covert case[4] arose in connection with an application by
way of certiorari to quash a summary conviction under the Liquor Act of
Alberta and was decided before the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Rex
v. Nat Bell Liquors Limited[5]. There
a number of judgments in various courts were overruled and it was decided that
a conviction by a magistrate for a non‑indictable offence could not be
quashed on certiorari on the ground that the depositions show that there
was no evidence to support the conviction. The Covert case4
is mentioned at page 141 of the report.

What the Court of Appeal had before it in the
present case was an appeal and the proposition upon which the magistrate
proceeded cannot be supported. Nowhere does he say whether he believed the
evidence of the complainant or of the accused, and to proceed to discuss the
evidence of Black apart from that of the complainant and accused is really to
shirk the responsibility resting upon him. Unless, therefore, there is some
other valid ground of attack, the order of the Court of Appeal ordering a new
trial cannot be impugned.

It was contended, however, that, under
subsection 2 of section 1014 of the Criminal Code, the Court of
Appeal should have dismissed the appeal. This subsection reads:

2. The court may also dismiss the appeal
if, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that on any of the grounds above
mentioned the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is also of
opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually
occurred.

We do not know if the point was argued nor,
since no written reasons were delivered, whether it was considered, in the
Court of Appeal. The test in applying subsection 2 in the case of an
appeal by an accused from a conviction is well known and was reiterated in this
Court in Schmidt v. The King[6].
But it is said that on an appeal by an Attorney General from an acquittal a
different rule is to be followed and reliance is placed upon two decisions in

[Page 275]

the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, Rex v. Bourgeois[7], and Rex v. Probe[8]. The effect of these decisions is that upon
an appeal by an Attorney General from an acquittal, even if substantial error
has been shown, the Court should not grant a new trial where doubt could be
entertained by the tribunal of fact as to the guilt of the accused. This
conclusion was based upon a consideration of the rule that the accused is
entitled to the benefit of a doubt as to his guilt. While not referred to on
the argument of this appeal, it was decided in Rex v. O’Leary[9], by the British Columbia Court of Appeal,
that when the appellate court was satisfied from the report of the magistrate
that he would have convicted in the particular case without corroboration of an
accomplice, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had actually
occurred because, even if the trial judge had not misdirected himself, he must
have reached the same conclusion as he actually did.

The first two cases, of course, go much further
than the last, and the reasoning upon which they proceeded cannot be justified.
The dissenting opinion of Martin J., now Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, in the
first case is to be preferred. As he points out, Chief Justice Anglin, speaking
for this Court in Belyea v. The King[10], refers to subsection 5 of
section 1013 of the Criminal Code as enacted in 1930 by which the
procedure upon an appeal by an Attorney General and the powers of the Court of
Appeal shall mutatis mutandis, and so far as the same are applicable to
appeals upon a question of law alone, be similar to the procedure prescribed
and the powers given by sections 1012 to 1021 Cr. C. inclusive. Chief
Justice Anglin stated

that the effect of the words “mutatis
mutandis” is that clause (a) (of subsection 3 of
section 1014 Cr. C.) must be made to read, on an appeal (by an Attorney
General) being allowed, to

(a) quash the acquittal and
direct a judgment and verdict of conviction to be entered.

That in fact was what was done in the Belyea case10.

The point with which we are concerned under
subsection 2 of section 1014 Cr. C. was apparently not argued in

[Page 276]

Pitre v. The
King[11], so
that the remarks at the end of the judgment of Smith J. may properly be
considered as obiter dicta but to give to this subsection the
meaning ascribed in the judgments in Saskatchewan where a court of appeal has
before it an appeal by the Attorney General from a conviction would be to
permit an appellate court to encroach upon the field of the tribunal of fact.
Without in any way weakening the salutary rule that an accused is entitled to
the benefit of a doubt as to his guilt, effect must be given to the will of
Parliament in permitting appeals from acquittals and to the provisions of
subsection 2 of section 1014 Cr. C. by which, according to the terms
of subsection 5 of section 1013 Cr. C., the powers of a court of
appeal are mutatis mutandis and so far as the same are applicable to
appeals upon a question of law alone, to be similar to the powers given by the
former. Applying those provisions to the present case, the proper rule to be
followed by the Court of Appeal was that the onus was on the Crown to satisfy
the Court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the
magistrate had properly directed himself. No doubt there will be circumstances
such as arose in Rex v. O’Leary[12]
where not only that cannot be shown but the opposite is true, but that
situation does not arise here. In the present case it must be concluded that
the magistrate would not necessarily have acquitted the appellant if he had given
himself the proper direction.

The appeal should be dismissed.

TASCHEREAU J.:—I am of opinion that this appeal
should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.
