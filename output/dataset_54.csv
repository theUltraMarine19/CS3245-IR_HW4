JUDGMENT
The facts
The plaintiffs are a Singapore company and are associated with a Californian company called Waskita USA Inc (Waskita) in that Waskita's president Khing S Ong (Ong) is a director and shareholder of the plaintiffs. Waskita would source and buy American materials required by the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs would finance the purchase. The defendants, an American company, were at the material time the charterers of a vessel called Zephunter (the vessel) under a charterparty which commenced on 24 September 1990 at Houston (AB12) for one voyage to Asia between Hong Kong and Dumai/Indonesia.
Ong (PW2) testified that some time in April 1990 Waskita (through an Indonesian company) bid and was awarded the tender (see AB1-6), for the supply of gravel pack/drill sand (the cargo) to PT Caltex Pacific Indonesia (Caltex). In turn Waskita ordered the cargo from Texas Mining Company. Ong then arranged for an Illinois freight forwarder US Carriage International (USC) to ship the cargo from Texas to Dumai since Waskita had sold the same to Caltex on a C & F basis. He testified that the reason he used the services of USC was because he had previously supplied the same type of sand to Caltex from another company called US Silica and US Silica had used the services of USC for land as well as sea transportation. Payment to USC in the sum of US$336,000 was made by a letter of credit (the letter of credit) issued by the plaintiffs on the understanding that the proceeds would be apportioned between Texas Mining Company (for the rail transport) and USC (for the loading stevedoring and shipping charges); a separate letter of credit was issued to Texas Mining Company for the value of the cargo.
In September 1990 Ong was informed by Texas Mining Company that the cargo was at a warehouse at Houston ready for inspection and shipment. As required by the Indonesian government Ong arranged for an inspection to be done by surveyors after which he received from USC a copy of a bill of lading issued by Trident Marine (the Trident b/l) dated 20 September 1990 which had been handed to the surveyors. He understood from USC that the Trident b/l (AB14-15) was a house bill of lading issued by a non vessel operated carrier. In the Trident b/l it was stated that freight was prepaid.
On or about 22 October 1990 Ong was contacted for the first time by David Keller (Keller) the president of Project Carriers Inc (PCI) who informed him that PCI were the Houston agents of the defendants, there was a discrepancy in the description of the volume of the cargo and freight had not been received from USC. Keller (DW1) then sent Ong a fax (AB25) to confirm that:
(i) he had arranged a contract between USC and the defendants to ship the cargo; 
(ii) USC had no authority to issue bills of lading on behalf of the Master, only the port agent had the authority; 
(iii)he had been informed by NBD Bank (the Bank) the negotiating bank for the letter of credit (AB9) that payment had been effected on 5 October 1990 even though he had been assured by William Marston (Marston) of USC that the letter of credit would be assigned to the defendants;
(iv) the cargo would only be released against presentation of an original bill of lading issued by the authorised agent General Maritime Agency Inc (which was faxed to Ong); 
(v) since completion of loading of the cargo on 28 September 1990 he had telephoned Marston every other day for payment of the freight and despite Marston's promises that it would be made, no payment had been received;
(vi) PCI were entitled under the bill of lading issued by General Maritime Agency (the defendants' bill of lading) to a lien on the cargo for the freight and they intended to exercise such right if they were not paid that week.
Ong testified that in his conversation with Keller he had asked whether PCI had obtained an assignment of the letter of credit as he (Ong) understood from Marston that USC would assign a portion of the letter of credit to the carrier. After receiving Keller's fax Ong contacted USC and questioned them on the defendants' bill of lading (AB27) and the assignment of the letter of credit. He was told USC had missed the shipping date for a vessel on the Hoegh Line upon which USC had based their quotation to Waskita, USC therefore had to look for and chose the vessel as, an alternative; the Trident b/l was a house bill of lading whereas the defendants' bill of lading was the shipping agents' bill of lading. On the letter of credit Ong was told that because of the dispute on the cargo's volume discrepancy, no payment could be released until the dispute was resolved. In view of the seriousness of the situation Ong handed the fax documents to his lawyers.
Subsequently Ong received by mail three original copies of the defendants' bill of lading (AB20-21) and he noted that it differed from the copy faxed to him by Keller in that it stated 'cargo not to be released unless all freight charges are paid' whereas the fax copy stated 'ocean freight prepaid'. He forwarded the originals thereof to the plaintiffs as they were the notify party on the defendants' bill of lading and gave copies to his lawyers.
Ong then pressurised USC to pay the freight as they had been paid on the letter of credit. USC responded that they would release the freight provided the defendants' misdescription claim on the cargo (of US$86,450) was resolved/waived. Ong understood from USC that the cargo was based on weight, Keller had inspected the cargo, knew the volume and when the vessel could not load all of it, Keller was instructed to purchase two 20 foot containers to complete loading the cargo which price was agreed to be included in the freight (see AB18).
The dispute was not resolved and Waskita commenced proceedings to recover the payment made to USC which proceedings were still pending at the hearing of this suit; in the interim USC had gone bankrupt.
Keller in his evidence said his company was appointed by the defendants to procure cargo for the charterparty and USC had booked space on the vessel with PCI through a liner booking note (the booking note) on 17 July 1990 (AB7-7A). It was the first time PCI and the defendants had dealt with USC. The terms of the booking form were also stated on the reverse side of the defendants' bill of lading and the conditions relevant to this claim are as follows:
Box 9 -- Description of Goods:
1,000 pallets of drilling sand in bags each pallet 2 metric tons 48''x40''x 36'' each total shipment 3200 metric tons/1812 cbm bags are wrapped/strapped on the pallets, with a masonite top pallets are stackable 3 high.
Box 10 -- Freight rate (also indicate whether prepayable or payable at destination):
US$74 per cbm/mt whatever the greater to merchant. Freight is prepaid on signing/releasing bills of lading via wire transfer see attached.
clause 11 -- Freight and charges:
(a) Prepayable freight whether actually paid or not shall be considered as fully earned upon loading and non-returnable in any event. The carrier's claim for any charges under this contract shall be considered definitely payable in like manner as soon as the charges have been incurred. 
(c) The carrier is entitled in case of incorrect declaration of contents, weights, measurements or value of the goods to claim double the amount of freight which would have been due if such declaration had been correctly given...
clause 12 -- Lien:
The carrier shall have a lien for any amount due under this contract and costs of recovering same and shall be entitled to sell the goods privately or by auction to cover any claims.
Keller testified that
a. when the vessel commenced loading the cargo at Houston on 24 September 1990 the packing was found to be inadequate as the pallets broke loose whilst being taken from the warehouse by forklift. He was informed by the pier owner as well as by the port captain that there were many more pallets of the cargo than had been contracted for and the dimensions of the pallets also differed from those stated in the booking note. The result was that the cargo occupied an additional 910 cu m of space on the vessel necessitating some of the cargo being stored on deck together with approximately another 400 cu m of other cargo. He notified USC of the inadequate packing by fax the same day (AB22) and followed up with another fax to Marston on 25 September 1990 on the volume discrepancy;
b. subsequently the defendants on 1 October 1990 faxed to USC an invoice (AB22) for the freight payable on the cargo totalling US$350,650,65 including the volume misdescription claim of $86,450 which was calculated at US$95 per cu m for 910 cu m based on freight charged ex-Singapore which the vessel would otherwise have earned if not for the additional space occupied by the cargo; 
c. his numerous attempts to contact Marston were unsuccessful and it was only after the vessel had sailed that he finally managed to speak to Marston on 15 October 1990. Marston informed him that no monies had been received from Singapore yet and the freight could not be paid; 
d. after further unsuccessful attempts to contact Marston, Keller called the Bank on 22 October 1990 and was informed that payment had been effected to USC on the letter of credit on 5 October and the letter dated 28 August 1990 (the assignment letter) whereby USC purported to assign the proceeds of the letter of credit to the defendants had never been received by the Bank even though it had been faxed to PCI (AB10) by USC when PCI asked for a credit reference on Waskita. He did not check with the Bank after 28 August 1990 and before 22 October 1990 whether it had received the assignment letter although on hindsight he should have; 
e. as he was concerned that some bill of lading other than the defendants' may have been used to negotiate the letter of credit and Marston had mentioned to him that Ong was the person in charge for the shipper which he knew was Waskita, Keller obtained Waskita's number from the Californian telephone operator and contacted and spoke to, Ong and followed up with his fax to Waskita of the same date; 
f. he then conveyed to the defendants as well as to the vessel's Protection and Indemnity Club (P & I Club) his discussion with Ong; g. as at 23 October 1990 he did not know of the existence of the Trident b/l and the first time he saw it was when a copy was received from H E Schurig & Co Pte Ltd (Schurig) who were the defendants' port agent in Singapore. Since the notify party on the Trident b/l was in Singapore the defendants requested Schurig to contact the plaintiffs. On the advice of the P & I Club, all parties including the plaintiffs, Waskita and the issuing bank (NMB Postbank Group NV Singapore) for the letter of credit were put on notice (see AB 29-30) that the Trident b/l was unauthorised and the cargo would only be released against the defendants' bill of lading and against payment of freight. The defendants' bill of lading was then issued and couriered to Waskita; 
h. the signatory of the Trident b/l was Cindy Zimay an employee of USC with whom he spoke on several occasions to ensure that the cargo was delivered to the pier on time; 
i. although it was PCI's responsibility to book cargo for the vessel, it was not their duty to collect the freight which was left to the defendants.
A director of the defendants K Nielsen (Nielsen) confirmed Keller's testimony. Nielsen (DW2) further said:
a. the actual space occupied by the cargo of 3237.52mt/2722 cu m was verified by the defendants' surveyor; 
b. the vessel loaded at Houston cargo which included construction materials, oil drilling equipment and drill sand and the same was stored in such a manner that the vessel would call at South Korea, Singapore and Dumai in that order; 
c. the additional space (910 cu m) occupied by the cargo did not cause other cargo to be shut out but it did result in loading on deck cargo which was supposed to be loaded below deck; 
d. the assignment letter meant very little to him and he merely took it as a sign of good faith from the shipper's agent USC since there was no confirmation of the same by either the Bank or PCI. It was for the Bank not the defendants to confirm that the letter of credit had been assigned to the defendants;
e. as far as the defendants were concerned USC was a freight forwarder acting for a principal which was Waskita; he denied that USC acted as agents for the defendants;
f. in November 1990 (AB35) USC through their lawyers Hodes & Pilon offered to pay the defendants US$259,360 in exchange for the delivery of the cargo to the plaintiffs in Singapore which payment comprised of contractual freight at US$74 weight/measure, terminal charge and wharfage but the offer was rejected by the defendants as it was not the full sum claimed; 
g. instead the defendants' lawyers Keck Mahin & Cate counter-proposed (see AB38) that USC pay the defendants' invoice at AB22 in full and the sum of US$86,450 representing the misdescription claim would be placed in an interest bearing escrow account pending arbitration or settlement. Otherwise a maritime lien would be placed on the cargo at Dumai, it would be sold and the proceeds used to satisfy the outstanding claim;
There was further correspondence exchanged between both parties' lawyers as well as with Waskita's counsel (Hart & Mieras) in November/December 1990. However nothing fruitful emerged therefrom as no party was prepared to compromise its position and the deadline of 23 November 1990 imposed by Waskita's counsel to resolve the impasse came and went. Suffice it to say that despite their repeated requests, the defendants' lawyers never received any explanation from USC's lawyers as to, the role of Trident Marine and how its bill of lading came to be issued and why despite the assignment letter no assignment of the proceeds of the letter of credit was ever effected to the defendants. In the event the defendants did not receive a single cent in payment of freight. Meanwhile the vessel had arrived at Singapore and the cargo had been discharged into a warehouse by Schurig after they had notified the plaintiffs on 14 November 1990 (AB47) that the same would be released to the plaintiffs on presentation of the defendants' original bill of lading.
The plaintiffs' manager Jeffrey Tan (Tan) testified that by October 1990 he had received the Trident b/l followed by Schurig's fax dated 26 October 1990 (AB34) informing him that the Trident b/l was not valid. Subsequently he received the defendants' original bill of lading from Waskita. Prior to the vessel's arrival in Singapore which was on or about 4 December 1990 Tan (PW1) left it to Waskita to resolve the problem of the two bills of lading issued for the cargo as at that time the plaintiffs did not know who PCI and Schurig were. Indeed he left the entire matter to Waskita/Ong to handle until after the cargo had been discharged in Singapore when, on Ong's instructions, the plaintiffs' lawyers commenced this suit on 27 December 1990 and on the same day they obtained an order of court for the cargo to be released after Schurig's demand for payment of freight was rejected by the plaintiffs.
The court order was subsequently varied on the defendants' application and the cargo was released to the plaintiffs upon their furnishing security to the defendants by way of a banker's guarantee for US$244,000 to preserve the defendants' lien for freight and for damages. Under cross-examination Tan said he believed the plaintiffs tendered the Trident b/l to Schurig to obtain delivery of the cargo and not the defendants' bill of lading as the latter was not endorsed by the plaintiffs' banker.
The plaintiffs eventually transhipped the cargo to Dumai, Indonesia in January 1991 at a cost of S$105,536.92.
The claim
In the statement of claim the plaintiffs inter alia pleaded:
(i) they were at all material times the holders of and/or endorsees of the Trident b/l by reason whereof they were the owners of the cargo;
(ii) the Trident b/l evidenced the contract of carriage for the cargo from Houston to Dumai, Indonesia and so did the defendants' bill of lading; 
(iii)in breach of the contract evidenced in the Trident b/l alternatively in the defendants' bill of lading (the validity of which was disputed), the defendants did not carry or deliver the cargo to Dumai but instead landed it in Singapore in the purported exercise of their lien for unpaid freight;
(iv) by reason of the defendants' breach the plaintiffs had suffered loss and damage as follows: 
(a) repair of damaged cargo before transhipment S$3,101.00 
(b) port charges and freight cost to Dumai S$105,536.92
(c) liquidated damages payable to Clatex for late delivery Pending 
(d) commission paid on banker's guarantee US$1,230.00
The plaintiffs inter alia prayed for 
(i) a declaration that the defendants were not and are not entitled to exercise a lien on the cargo 
(ii) the return and cancellation of the banker's guarantee for US$224,000 and
(iii) damages to be assessed by the Registrar. No evidence was adduced by the plaintiffs to show that they had to pay damages to Caltex for late delivery of the cargo although Waskita's counsel had indicated to their counterpart for USC (see AB41) that Caltex would suffer US$10,000-$20,000 per day as downtime for the consequential delay in Caltex's drilling operations.
In the defence and counterclaim the defendants admitted that the plaintiffs were the endorsees and holders of the Trident b/l but contended:
(i) the Trident b/l was issued fraudulently and without the authority of the defendants who were the disponent owners of the vessel; 
(ii) the contract of carriage was that evidenced in the booking note dated 17 July 1990 made between the defendants and USC which expressly provided for freight at the rate of US$74 per cu m/mt 'whatever the greater to the merchant' to be prepaid on signing or release of the bills of lading; 
(iii)in breach of the express terms a. the cargo when loaded was not 3200 mt/1812 cu m but 3237.52 mt/2722 cu m resulting in a loss of cargo space of 910 cu m; b. freight was not prepaid upon completion of loading of the cargo or at all.
(iv) the defendants waived the aforesaid breach of USC by issuing the defendants' bill of lading to Waskita in accordance with the terms of the booking note but with the notation 'cargo not to be released unless all freight charges are paid' and with the correct gross weight of the cargo of 3,237.52 mt specified; 
(v) the defendants' demand for payment of the freight was made known to USC their servants or agents and to the plaintiffs, their servants or agents. The plaintiffs however asserted that they possessed a freight prepaid bill of lading issued by Trident Marine by which the plaintiffs evinced an intention not to pay the freight due to the defendants;
(vi) the defendants in exercise of their lien for freight and to mitigate their loss landed the cargo in Singapore.
The defendants counterclaimed for US$350,650.65 representing the sum (US$264,200.65) agreed by the parties to be the freight for carriage of the cargo from Houston to Dumai and the loss of cargo space of 910 cu m (US$86,450) due to misdescription of the cargo.
The findings
This is a case where neither litigant was at fault and the court has to decide which of two innocent parties must bear the loss which was caused by the acts of a third party which in this case was USC. On the one hand the plaintiffs had paid to USC US$336,000 for freight and were further out of pocket by S$105,536.92 in having to tranship the cargo to Dumai and on the other hand the defendants did not receive any freight for carrying the cargo on the vessel.
The issues that arise for determination are as follows:
(i) was there a contract of carriage for the cargo and if so was it evidenced in the Trident b/l or in the defendants' bill of lading? 
(ii) was there a misdescription of the quantity/volume of the cargo and did it entitle the defendants to claim US$86,450 arising therefrom?
(iii)were the defendants justified in landing the cargo in Singapore in exercise of their lien for freight and to mitigate their loss?
(iv) are the defendants still entitled to payment of freight notwithstanding that they did not complete the voyage to Dumai?
Before dealing with the four issues, it is necessary to determine the role of USC vis a vis the plaintiffs and the defendants. It is common ground that USC were freight forwarders but what is in issue is whether their role was independent or that of agents and if the latter, agents for which party. The plaintiffs' stand is that USC were acting as agents for the defendants and therefore their payment of freight by the letter of credit is deemed to have been payment to the defendants. The defendants contend that even if USC were their agents USC not being authorised to issue the Trident b/l, recourse must be had against USC and not the shipowner and this was what Waskita did in suing USC for recovery of the freight paid by the plaintiffs.
The position at law is that depending on the facts of a case and the construction of the contract concerned, freight forwarders can act either as agent or as principal although they qualify more often as principals than as agents (see Schmitthoff's Export Trade 9 ed p 304 onwards). If the forwarder acts as the customer's agent, his duty is to procure with due diligence others who perform the carriage, storage, packing or handling of the goods. The customer, through the forwarder, enters into direct contractual relations with others. Where the forwarder acts as principal, he enters into a contract of services with the customer, he is the only person with whom the customer is in contractual relations even though the actual services which the forwarder has undertaken is carried out by others. It is also possible where the forwarder is instructed to arrange for the carriage of goods that he acts in a 'hybrid' capacity that is as a carrier for the land segment and as forwarding agent for the sea leg of the journey.
To determine whether USC acted as principal or agent, the following factors are relevant:
a. USC issued their own house bill of lading viz the Trident b/l; b. their remuneration would be their profit from the freight which rate (US$4.80 per bag) they separately quoted to and which was accepted by, the plaintiffs and not based on a commission payable by the shipowner or the latter's freight rate, and c. they collected the cargo for Waskita instead of arranging for the collection by a third party.
It seems to me such factors point to USC acting as principal rather than as agent. Further the description of USC under 'merchant' in box 4 of the booking note (see cl 1) includes 'the shipper, the Receiver, the Consignee, the Holder of the bill of lading and the Owner of the goods'-- USC were the receivers of the cargo. The defendants' invoice was also addressed to USC (AB22).
USC contracted as principal in the booking note with the defendants through PCI. It is noteworthy that the defendants in para 6 of the defence pleaded that notwithstanding the breach by USC of the various terms of the booking note, the defendants waived the same and continued to perform their obligations thereunder. It is also in evidence that the conditions governing the booking note were the same as those in the defendants' bill of lading.
The Trident b/l was said by Keller to have been signed by an employee of USC. Although this house bill of lading was said to have been issued without the defendants' authority it is to be noted that the Trident b/l differed from the defendants' bill of lading only in two respects namely, the date of shipment and, that the former was issued 'clean on board' whereas the latter was claused due to the inadequate packing of the cargo and the defendants' claim for additional freight and other expenses; all other terms were more or less the same in both bills of lading including the condition that freight was to be prepaid. This is not a case where the bill of lading was fraudulently issued because no goods were ever loaded on the vessel in question but only that the goods were loaded later than the date stated and the alleged issuing party (Trident Marine) had no authority from the carrier. There is authority to suggest that in the hands of an innocent party a fraudulently dated bill of lading is perfectly valid (see United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada < 1983 > A C 168).
Therefore in answer to issue (i) I hold that there was a contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants for carriage of the cargo from Houston to Dumai evidenced in the Trident b/l which terms were not dissimilar to those in the defendants'bill of lading in particular that freight must be prepaid. It was the evidence of Tan that in order to take delivery of the cargo from Schurig in January 1991, the plaintiffs tendered the Trident b/l not the defendants' bill of lading.
On issue (ii), bearing in mind the freight rate stipulated in box 10 of the booking note (and also in the defendants' bill of lading), the defendants were entitled to charge freight based on either volume or weight whichever was the greater at their option. However the defendants' entitlement to maximise their earnings cannot extend to 'double charging' the plaintiffs based on the full tonnage loaded namely 3237.52 mt (37.52 mt more than what was stated in the booking note) and at the same time claiming for additional freight based on the excess volume of 910 cu m. I agree with the plaintiffs' submission that the defendants must elect to base their claim either on volume or on weight, not claim on both.
Accordingly the defendants' claim for freight would be either for US$236,800 or US$134,088 made up as follows:
3200 mt x $74 = $236,800 
1812 cu m x $74 = $134,088
As for the defendants' claim for additional freight (the mis description claim) at the rate of US$95, again this can only be in addition to either of the two foregoing figures but it cannot be added to the defendants' claim based on the total tonnage or volume loaded (see AB22). Therefore the defendants' claim for additional freight if valid is for either US$3,564.40 or US$86,640 made up as follows:
37.52 mt x $95 = $3,564.40 
910 cu m x $95 = $86,450
If as they contend, the defendants were entitled to maximise their claim for freight and additional freight, then they would be entitled to US$322,640:
3200 mt x $74 = $236,800 910
cu m x $95 = $ 86,450 
Total = $322,450
and not US$326,026.48 ($239,576.48 + $86,450).
In any event the defendants are not pursuing the various sums stated in their invoice but only the freight that would have been due to them for carrying the cargo to Dumai (US$264,200.65) for which no computation was given but which figure was agreed to by the plaintiffs if the defendants should succeed in their counterclaim.
In so far as the misdescription claim is concerned, I would agree with the defence contention that they were and are entitled to the additional US$86,450 pursuant to cl 11(e) of the terms and conditions governing the booking note which allows them to claim double the amount of freight in case of incorrect declaration of contents, weights, measurements or value of the goods.
I shall now deal with the remaining two issues. The defendants' entitlement under the booking note is to prepaid freight on signing/releasing of bills of lading. On the one hand the defendants assert that the plaintiffs did not pay the freight as per their demand and on the other hand the plaintiffs contend that freight amounting to US$336,000 having already been paid to USC, the defendants cannot demand it again.
At law (Scrutton on Charterparties 19 ed pp 333-334) advance freight must be paid though the goods are, after the due date of payment, but before payment, lost by excepted perils, and it will not be recoverable from the shipowner if the goods are after payment so lost. It will be recoverable however if the shipowner has not fulfilled the condition precedent of starting the carriage of the goods on the agreed voyage in a seaworthy ship within a reasonable time.
Applying the principles to this case, it means that Waskita cannot recover the freight paid to USC notwithstanding that the voyage to Dumai was not completed. Freight if payable in advance is payable for the whole journey and the shipper is not entitled to a pro rata return of the freight for other stages as if the consideration had failed, even if calculated separately for each stage and even if the forwarder (which is what happened here) has not paid over any part of the freight relating to stages of the journey to be performed by other companies.
It is also stated in Scrutton (pp 45-46) that the position of a forwarding agent acting as a principal with the liability of a carrier is in many respects similar to that of a carrier issuing a through bill of lading. The forwarding agent usually has the right to employ sub-contractors to perform all or part of the carriage; the right may be implied by custom or as a necessary implication in the case of a forwarding agent who does not operate his own ship or other facilities. In this case that would mean that the defendants were USC's sub-contractors and the latter are not a party to the contract of carriage.
As USC acted as principal and as the plaintiffs had paid to USC in advance the freight from Houston to Dumai, the defendants cannot demand freight again from the plaintiffs notwithstanding that USC failed to pay over the freight they had collected from the letter of credit. Accordingly it must follow that the defendants are not entitled to a lien on the cargo for freight and were not justified in landing the cargo at Singapore in the purported exercise of their lien for freight. They are however entitled to additional freight for the excess 910 cu m shipped amounting to US$86,450. The defendants would have been entitled to freight Houston-Dumai as follows:
Agreed freight US$264,200.65 Additional freight US$ 86,450.00 Total freight US$350,650.65
However as the plaintiffs have paid to USC $336,000 the defendants' entitlement is only to the difference of $14,650.65 (350,650.65 - 336,000) against which the plaintiffs can set off the transhipment and incidental expenses incurred at Singapore of S$108,637.92 as well as the commission (US$1,230) paid on the banker's guarantee for US$224,000.
There will therefore be judgment for the plaintiffs in the sums of S$108,637.92 and US$1,230 and the banker's guarantee for US$224,000 shall be returned to them forthwith. There will be judgement for the defendants on the counterclaim in the sum of US$14,650.65. As the plaintiffs have succeeded in their claim and so have the defendants on their counterclaim albeit in a much smaller sum I feel that a fair order as to costs would be for the plaintiffs to have 2/3 of the taxed costs of the entire action and all previous costs which were ordered to be costs in the cause. Each party shall bear its own costs pertaining to the release of the plaintiffs' cargo and to the variation of that order for release. I am not directing the Registrar to assess damages as no evidence was adduced to show any damage was suffered by the plaintiffs in their late delivery of the cargo to Indonesia other than the expenses claimed and allowed.",1993-05-03 00:00:00,SG High Court
